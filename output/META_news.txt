Title: Sam Altman on AI bubble: ‘People make some dumb capital allocations’ from time to time

OpenAI could now be the world’s most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company’s valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don’t meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company’s AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that “over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI’s for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity. The deadline to apply closes on Oct. 8. —— AP Philanthropy Writer Thalia Beaty contributed to this report. ———- The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$121,738.90 may be entering a decisive phase as macro and crypto-specific forces converge. With the U.S. government shutdown and traditional market indicators like employment reports delayed, traders are leaning into alternative assets, especially bitcoin and gold. BTC climbed to $120,000 after rallying 9% this week, while gold rose 2.9% to touch $3,900. The shutdown has furloughed over 90% of SEC staff and left the CFTC with a skeleton crew. Reacting to the shutdown markets rallied, as investors see the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates by 25 bps later this month as a near certainty over an unexpected drop in U.S. private payrolls and a delay in other key economic data. “Traders have lacked immediate catalysts, evidenced by subdued commitment following the FOMC meeting, even as gold and equities have posted strong gains. However, the broader trend remains higher as we move into a rate-cutting cycle,” Jake Ostrovskis, Head of OTC Trading at Wintermute, told CoinDesk. Lower interest rates make risk assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive, and that’s coming in a month where sentiment is high given historical performance. "October has historically been a bullish month for bitcoin, and early signs suggest this year may be no exception." said Gadi Chait of Xapo Bank, in an emailed statement. "Far from being a speculative outlier, bitcoin continues to show its ability to defy the odds and assert itself as a digital asset with staying power.” On-chain data backs that up. Apparent bitcoin demand has grown by roughly 62,000 BTC per month since July, according to CryptoQuant, driven largely by ETFs and whales. For context, ETF holdings surged by 71% in fourth-quarter 2024. On top of that, the crypto-native market has kept on growing. “Over the past month, DeFi’s share of trading activity has been climbing significantly, expanding both the market and our opportunity,” dYdX Labs President Eddie Zhang told CoinDesk. “A big driver of this shift is the renewed energy and participation we’re seeing out of Asia. We believe DeFi is beginning to fulfill its long-standing promise, and the pace of market adoption is accelerating in response." Looking ahead, crypto markets are anticipating other potential catalysts: ETF decisions for several altcoins including solana and XRP that could be delayed over the shutdown, and Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade, which is slowly moving closer.

Title: The AI Bubble and the U.S. Economy: How Long Do “Hallucinations” Last?

Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser, what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, supporting our expanded daily Links Yves here. This is a devastating, must-read paper by Servaas Storm on how AI is failing to meet core, repeatedly hyped performance promises, and never can, irrespective of how much money and computing power is thrown at it. Yet AI, which Storm calls “Artificial Information” is still garnering worse-than-dot-com-frenzy valuations even as errors are if anything increasing. By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website This paper argues that (i) we have reached “peak GenAI” in terms of current Large Language Models (LLMs); scaling (building more data centers and using more chips) will not take us further to the goal of “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI); returns are diminishing rapidly; (ii) the AI-LLM industry and the larger U.S. economy are experiencing a speculative bubble, which is about to burst. The U.S. is undergoing an extraordinary AI-fueled economic boom: The stock market is soaring thanks to exceptionally high valuations of AI-related tech firms, which are fueling economic growth by the hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars they are spending on data centers and other AI infrastructure. The AI investment boom is based on the belief that AI will make workers and firms significantly more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unprecedented levels. But the summer of 2025 did not bring good news for enthusiasts of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) who were all hyped up by the inflated promise of the likes of OpenAI’s Sam Altman that “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI), the holy grail of current AI research, would be right around the corner. Let us more closely consider the hype. Already in January 2025, Altman wrote that “we are now confident we know how to build AGI”. Altman’s optimism echoed claims by OpenAI’s partner and major financial backer Microsoft, which had put out a paper in 2023 claiming that the GPT-4 model already exhibited “sparks of AGI.” Elon Musk (in 2024) was equally confident that the Grok model developed by his company xAI would reach AGI, an intelligence “smarter than the smartest human being”, probably by 2025 or at least by 2026. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that his company was committed to “building full general intelligence”, and that super-intelligence is now “in sight”. Likewise, Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said “powerful AI”, i.e., smarter than a Nobel Prize winner in any field, could come as early as 2026, and usher in a new age of health and abundance — the U.S. would become a “country of geniuses in a datacenter”, if ….. AI didn’t wind up killing us all. For Mr. Musk and his GenAI fellow travelers, the biggest hurdle on the road to AGI is the lack of computing power (installed in data centers) to train AI bots, which, in turn, is due to a lack of sufficiently advanced computer chips. The demand for more data and more data-crunching capabilities will require about $3 trillion in capital just by 2028, in the estimation of Morgan Stanley. That would exceed the capacity of the global credit and derivative securities markets. Spurred by the imperative to win the AI-race with China, the GenAI propagandists firmly believe that the U.S. can be put on the yellow brick road to the Emerald City of AGI by building more data centers faster (an unmistakenly “accelerationist” expression). Interestingly, AGI is an ill-defined notion, and perhaps more of a marketing concept used by AI promotors to persuade their financiers to invest in their endeavors. Roughly, the idea is that an AGI model can generalize beyond specific examples found in its training data, similar to how some human beings can do almost any kind of work after having been shown a few examples of how to do a task, by learning from experience and changing methods when needed. AGI bots will be capable of outsmarting human beings, creating new scientific ideas, and doing innovative as well as all of routine coding. AI bots will be telling us how to develop new medicines to cure cancer, fix global warming, drive our cars and grow our genetically modified crops. Hence, in a radical bout of creative destruction, AGI would transform not just the economy and the workplace, but also systems of health care, energy, agriculture, communications, entertainment, transportation, R&D, innovation and science. OpenAI’s Altman boasted that AGI can “discover new science,” because “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go.” He “think[s] we know what to do,” saying that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PhD.” Announcing the launch of ChatGPT-5 in August, Mr. Altman posted on the internet that “We think you will love using GPT-5 much more than any previous Al. It is useful, it is smart, it is fast [and] intuitive. With GPT-5 now, it’s like talking to an expert — a legitimate PhD level expert in anything any area you need on demand, they can help you with whatever your goals are.” But then things began to fall apart, and rather quickly so. ChatGPT-5 Is a Letdown The first piece of bad news is that much-hyped ChatGPT-5 turned out to be a dud — incremental improvements wrapped in a routing architecture, nowhere near the breakthrough to AGI that Sam Altman had promised. Users are underwhelmed. As the MIT Technology Review reports: “The much-hyped release makes several enhancements to the ChatGPT user experience. But it’s still far short of AGI.” Worryingly, OpenAI’s internal tests show GPT-5 ‘hallucinates’ in circa one in 10 responses of the time on certain factual tasks, when connected to the internet. However, without web-browsing access, GPT-5 is wrong in almost 1 in 2 responses, which should be troublesome. Even more worrisome, ‘hallucinations’ may also reflect biases buried within datasets. For instance, an LLM might ‘hallucinate’ crime statistics that align with racial or political biases simply because it has learned from biased data. Of note here is that AI chatbots can be and are actively used to spread misinformation (see here and here). According to recent research, chatbots spread false claims when prompted with questions about controversial news topics 35% of the time — almost double the 18% rate of a year ago (here). AI curates, orders, presents, and censors information, influencing interpretation and debate, while pushing dominant (average or preferred) viewpoints while suppressing alternatives, quietly removing inconvenient facts or making up convenient ones. The key issue is: Who controls the algorithms? Who sets the rules for the tech bros? It is evident that by making it easy to spread “realistic-looking” misinformation and biases and/or suppress critical evidence or argumentation, GenAI does and will have non-negligible societal costs and risks — which have to be counted when assessing its impacts. Building Larger LLMs Is Leading Nowhere The ChatGPT-5 episode raises serious doubts and existential questions about whether the GenAI industry’s core strategy of building ever-larger models on ever-larger data distributions has already hit a wall. Critics, including cognitive scientist Gary Marcus (here and here), have long argued that simply scaling up LLMs will not lead to AGI, and GPT-5’s sorry stumbles do validate those concerns. It is becoming more widely understood that LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching — which is why, for example, they still cannot even play chess reliably and continue to make mind-boggling errors with startling regularity. My new INET Working Paper discusses three sobering research studies showing that novel ever-larger GenAI models do not become better, but worse, and do not reason, but rather parrot reasoning-like text. To illustrate, a recent paper by scientists at MIT and Harvard shows that even when trained on all of physics, LLMs fail to uncover even the existing generalized and universal physical principles underlying their training data. Specifically, Vafa et al. (2025) note that LLMs that follow a “Kepler-esque” approach: they can successfully predict the next position in a planet’s orbit, but fail to find the underlying explanation of Newton’s Law of Gravity (see here). Instead, they resort to fitting made-up rules, that allow them to successfully predict the planet’s next orbital position, but these models fail to find the force vector at the heart of Newton’s insight. The MIT-Harvard paper is explained in this video. LLMs cannot and do not infer physical laws from their training data. Remarkably, they cannot even identify the relevant information from the internet. Instead, they make it up. Worse, AI bots are incentivized to guess (and give an incorrect response) rather than admit they do not know something. This problem is recognized by researchers from OpenAI in a recent paper. Guessing is rewarded — because, who knows, it might be right. The error is at present uncorrectable. Accordingly, it might well be prudent to think of “Artificial Information” rather than “Artificial Intelligence” when using the acronym AI. The bottom line is straightforward: this is very bad news for anyone hoping that further scaling — building ever larger LLMs — would lead to better outcomes (see also Che 2025). 95% of Generative AI Pilot Projects in Companies Are Failing Corporations had rushed to announce AI investments or claim AI capabilities for their products in the hope of turbocharging their share prices. Then came the news that the AI tools are not doing what they are supposed to do and that people are realizing it (see Ed Zitron). An August 2025 report titled The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, published by MIT’s NANDA initiative, concludes that 95% of generative AI pilot projects in companies are failing to raise revenue growth. As reported by Fortune, “generic tools like ChatGPT [….] stall in enterprise use since they don’t learn from or adapt to workflows”. Quite. Indeed, firms are backpedaling after cutting hundreds of jobs and replacing these by AI. For instance, Swedish “Buy Burritos Now, Pay Later” Klarna bragged in March 2024 that its AI assistant was doing the work of (laid-off) 700 workers, only to rehire them (sadly, as gig workers) in the summer of 2025 (see here). Other examples include IBM, forced to reemploy staff after laying off about 8,000 workers to implement automation (here). Recent U.S. Census Bureau data by firm size show that AI adoption has been declining among companies with more than 250 employees. MIT economist Daren Acemoglu (2025) predicts rather modest productivity impacts of AI in the next 10 years and warns that some applications of AI may have negative social value. “We’re still going to have journalists, we’re still going to have financial analysts, we’re still going to have HR employees,” Acemoglu says. “It’s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, etc. And those are essentially about 5% of the economy.” Similarly, using two large-scale AI adoption surveys (late 2023 and 2024) covering 11 exposed occupations (25,000 workers in 7,000 workplaces) in Denmark, Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard (2025) show, in a recent NBER Working Paper, that the economic impacts of GenAI adoption are minimal: “AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation, with confidence intervals ruling out effects larger than 1%. Modest productivity gains (average time savings of 3%), combined with weak wage pass-through, help explain these limited labor market effects.” These findings provide a much-needed reality check for the hyperbole that GenAI is coming for all of our jobs. Reality is not even close. GenAI will not even make tech workers who do the coding redundant, contrary to the prediction by AI enthusiasts. OpenAI researchers have found (in early 2025) that advanced AI models (including GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet) still are no match for human coders. The AI bots failed to grasp how widespread bugs are or to understand their context, leading to solutions that are incorrect or insufficiently comprehensive. Another new study from the nonprofit Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR) finds that in practice, programmers, using early 2025-AI-tools, are actually slower when using AI assistance tools, spending 19 percent more time when using GenAI than when actively coding by themselves (see here). Programmers spent their time on reviewing AI outputs, prompting AI systems, and correcting AI-generated code. The U.S. Economy at Large Is Hallucinating The disappointing rollout of ChatGPT-5 raises doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that users are willing to pay for. But the point I want to make is not just about OpenAI: the American AI industry as a whole has been built on the premise that AGI is just around the corner. All that is needed is sufficient “compute”, i.e., millions of Nvidia AI GPUs, enough data centers and sufficient cheap electricity to do the massive statistical pattern mapping needed to generate (a semblance of) “intelligence”. This, in turn, means that “scaling” (investing billions of U.S. dollars in chips and data centers) is the one-and-only way forward — and this is exactly what the tech firms, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Wall Street financiers are good at: mobilizing and spending funds, this time for “scaling-up” generative AI and building data centers to support all the expected future demand for AI use. During 2024 and 2025, Big Tech firms invested a staggering $750 billion in data centers in cumulative terms and they plan to roll out a cumulative investment of $3 trillion in data centers during 2026-2029 (Thornhill 2025). The so-called “Magnificent 7” (Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) spent more than $100 billion on data centers in the second quarter of 2025; Figure 1 gives the capital expenditures for four of the seven corporations. FIGURE 1 Christopher Mims (2025), https://x.com/mims/status/1951… The surge in corporate investment in “information processing equipment” is huge. According to Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, data center investments’ contribution to (sluggish) real U.S. GDP growth has been the same as consumer spending over the first half of 2025 (Figure 2). Financial investor Paul Kedrosky finds that capital expenditures on AI data centers (in 2025) have passed the peak of telecom spending during the dot-com bubble (of 1995-2000). FIGURE 2 Source: Torsten Sløk (2025). https://www.apolloacademy.com/… Following the AI hype and hyperbole, tech stocks have gone through the roof. The S&P500 Index rose by circa 58% during 2023-2024, driven mostly by the growth of the share prices of the Magnificent Seven. The weighted-average share price of these seven corporations increased by 156% during 2023-2024, while the other 493 firms experienced an average increase in their share prices of just 25%. America’s stock market is largely AI-driven. Nvidia’s shares rose by more than 280% over the past two years amid the exploding demand for its GPUs coming from the AI firms; as one of the most high-profile beneficiaries of the insatiable demand for GenAI, Nvidia now has a market capitalization of more than $4 trillion, which is the highest valuation ever recorded for a publicly traded company. Does this valuation make sense? Nvidia’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio peaked at 234 in July 2023 and has since declined to 47.6 in September 2025 — which is still historically very high (see Figure 3). Nvidia is selling its GPUs to neocloud companies (such as CoreWeave, Lambda, and Nebius), which are funded by credit, from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone and other Wall Street private equity firms, collateralized by the data centers filled with GPUs. In key cases, as explained by Ed Zitron, Nvidia offered the neocloud companies, which are loss making, to buy unsold cloud compute worth billions of U.S. dollars, effectively backstopping its clients — all in the expectation of an AI revolution that still has to arrive. Likewise, the share price of Oracle Corp. (which is not included in the “Magnificent 7”) rose by more than 130% during mid-May and early September 2025 following the announcement of its $300 billion cloud-computing infrastructure deal with OpenAI. Oracle’s P/E ratio shot up to almost 68, which means that financial investors are willing to pay almost $68 for $1 of Oracle’s future earnings. One obvious problem with this deal is that OpenAI doesn’t have $300 billion; the company made a loss of $15 billion during 2023-2025 and is projected to make a further cumulative loss of $28 billion during 2026-2028 (see below). It is unclear and uncertain where OpenAI will get the money from. Ominously, Oracle needs to build the infrastructure for OpenAI before it can collect any revenue. If OpenAI cannot pay for the enormous computing capacity it agreed to buy from Oracle, which seems likely, Oracle will be left with the expensive AI infrastructure, for which it may not be able to find alternative customers, especially once the AI bubble fizzles out. Tech stocks thus are considerably overvalued. Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, warned (in July 2025) that AI stocks are even more overvalued than dot-com stocks were in 1999. In a blogpost, he illustrates how P/E ratios of Nvidia, Microsoft and eight other tech companies are higher than during the dot-com era (see Figure 3). We all remember how the dot-com bubble ended — and hence Sløk is right in sounding the alarm over the apparent market mania, driven by the “Magnificent 7” that are all heavily invested in the AI industry. Big Tech does not buy these data centers and operate them itself; instead the data centers are built by construction companies and then purchased by data center operators who lease them to (say) OpenAI, Meta or Amazon (see here). Wall Street private equity firms such as Blackstone and KKR are investing billions of dollars to buy up these data center operators, using commercial mortgage-backed securities as source funding. Data center real estate is a new, hyped-up asset class that is beginning to dominate financial portfolios. Blackstone calls data centers one of its “highest conviction investments.” Wall Street loves the lease-contracts of data centers which offer long-term stable, predictable income, paid by AAA-rated clients like AWS, Microsoft and Google. Some Cassandras are warning of a potential oversupply of data centers, but given that “the future will be based on GenAI”, what could possibly go wrong? FIGURE 3 Source: Torsten Sløk (2025), https://www.apolloacademy.com/… In a rare moment of frankness, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had it right. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said during a dinner interview with reporters in San Francisco in August. “My opinion is yes.” He also compared today’s AI investment frenzy to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. “Someone’s gonna get burned there, I think,” Altman said. “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money – we don’t know who …”, but (going by what happened in earlier bubbles) it will most likely not be Altman himself. The question therefore is: How long investors will continue to prop up sky-high valuations of the key firms in the GenAI race remains to be seen. Earnings of the AI industry continue to pale in comparison to the tens of billions of U.S. dollars that are spent on data center growth. According to an upbeat S&P Global research note published in June, 2025 the GenAI market is projected to generate $85 billion in revenue 2029. However, Alphabet, Google, Amazon and Meta together will spend nearly $400 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 alone. At the same time, the AI industry has a combined revenue that is little more than the revenue of the smart-watch industry (Zitron 2025). So, what if GenAI just is not profitable? This question is pertinent in view of the rapidly diminishing returns to the stratospheric capital expenditures on GenAI and data centers and the disappointing user-experience of 95% of firms that adopted AI. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, Florida-based Elliott, told clients that AI is overhyped and Nvidia is in a bubble, adding that many AI products are “never going to be cost-efficient, never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” “There are few real uses,” it said, other than “summarizing notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”. It added that it was “skeptical” that Big Tech companies would keep buying the chipmaker’s graphics processing units in such high volumes. Locking billions of U.S. dollars in into AI-focused data centers without a clear exit strategy for these investments in case the AI craze ends, only means that systemic risk in finance and the economy is building. With data-center investments driving U.S. economic growth, the American economy has become dependent on a handful of corporations, which have not yet managed to generate one dollar of profit on the ‘compute’ done by these data center investments. America’s High-Stakes Geopolitical Get Gone Wrong The AI boom (bubble) developed with the support of both major political parties in the U.S. The vision of American firms pushing the AI frontier and reaching GenAI first is widely shared — in fact, there is a bipartisan consensus on how important it is that the U.S. should win the global AI race. America’s industrial capability is critically dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China. In this context, America’s lead in GenAI is considered to constitute a potential very powerful geopolitical lever: If America manages to get to AGI first, so the analysis goes, it can build up an overwhelming long-term advantage over especially China (see Farrell). That is the reason why Silicon Valley, Wall Street and the Trump administration are doubling down on the “AGI First” strategy. But astute observers highlight the costs and risks of this strategy. Prominently, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xuworry, in the New York Times of August 19, 2025, that “Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal [of AGI] that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists. In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating A.I. powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.” Schmidt and Xu are rightly worried. Perhaps the plight of the U.S. economy is captured best by OpenAI’s Sam Altman who fantasizes about putting his data centers in space: “Like, maybe we build a big Dyson sphere around the solar system and say, “Hey, it actually makes no sense to put these on Earth.”” For as long as such ‘hallucinations’ on using solar-collecting satellites to harvest (unlimited) star power continue to convince gullible financial investors, the government and users of the “magic” of AI and the AI industry, the U.S. economy is surely doomed. OpenAI’s Altman boasted that AGI can “discover new science,” because “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” Clearly Altman doesn’t know how science is done. I have, for instance, done an AI search on a theme I used to be an expert years ago namely the cell-to-cell-movement of viruses in plants. With google AI what you obtain is a rehash of ideas more or less currently known. Very importantly, it comes without caveats, critical thinking and without any real experimental data already obtained with its experimental context. The first thing a researcher has to do is to be very critical on any data obtained before, conscientious that all that data was obtained in certain experimental conditions which very frequently result in situations in which the functioning of things are altered or controlled. In this sense, many research results are artificial artefacts and the results of research are often misleading and needing more checks and controls. I very well remember a congress (in Capetown 2001) about plasmodesmata , structures that bridge and communicate plant cells. Virus cell-to-cell movement was amongst the main issues in this small, very specialized, meeting. In a session dedicated to this issue there was a researcher exposing a vast body of research the lab had been doing using state-of-the-art methodology. This included data already published (several articles) and in the same line of research new data to be published soon with important conclusions. In the same session, a different research group using different state-of-the-art methodologies obtained results which suggested conclusions quite different to those that the first group had reached. There was a very interesting and heated discussion on the matter. It was obvious that one of the researchers had immersed in a rabbit hole of experimental artefacts. You can call it hallucinatory results. So humans can indeed hallucinate sometimes and this is apparently what AI machines are learning top do: hallucinate. Starting any research with the very redacted rehash of ideas without any kind of critical thinking looks to me the exact recipe for hallucinatory AI-driven research. In the same session, a different research group using different state-of-the-art methodologies obtained results which suggested conclusions quite different to those that the first group had reached. There was a very interesting and heated discussion on the matter. It was obvious that one of the researchers had immersed in a rabbit hole of experimental artefacts. You can call it hallucinatory results. So humans can indeed hallucinate sometimes and this is apparently what AI machines are learning top do: hallucinate. You’ve touched upon what AI boosters are hoping for (AGI) and what the limitations of the current state of affairs are and why humans will be sticking around, especially in knowledge generation fields, for some time still. I remember there being some links here on Naked Capitalism that touched on symbolic computation, and how that got discarded for machine learning/statistical approaches in AI, which were highly successful in tackling computer vision/classification problems, and led to a winter in research in symbolic methods, which researchers are slowly rediscovering will be essential for AGI. In this case, symbolic computation would be invaluable for any type of “thinking machine” to simplify contradictory information into abstract logical terms, recognize they form a contradictory set of statements, and then work around that to identify what could be the cause of contradiction, and how it could be resolved, while recognizing a limitation in its own knowledge set to be able to resolve it. Much of scientific research is dedicated to finding and resolving these contradictions. Phenomenon A predicts X happens in some novel set of circumstances. Phenomenon B predicts Y happens in the same novel set of circumstances. Except in pure mathematics, you can’t ‘reason’ your way through whether A and/or B will fail when tested in those novel circumstances. Likewise as you described, testing a phenomenon A in circumstances X and in presumably the same circumstances X’ generated different results. Reasoning can help identify what may caused different results in this instance, but current LLMs aren’t performing this type of reasoning. Anyone who’s knowledgeable in physics would understand these limitations. We’ve dedicated billions of hours of research into trying to reconcile quantum physics with general relativity, an instance of where two theories cannot be reconciled where both gravitational and quantum effects are significant. Much of that research gave us string theory, but string theory itself suffers from a lack of testable and verifiable circumstances, and also has gaps in certain circumstances. As for the life sciences, I’ve seen AI boosters try to remark that LLMs are extremely advanced, since now they’ve begun creating “designer viruses” or “designer gene therapies” that are engineered to achieve certain therapeutic or other effects. However, I’ve been frustrated to try and explain that first, it didn’t actually engineer it, it only proposed it, or “hallucinated it” as you said. Until it actually gets tested or synthesized in a lab, there might be some underlying principle it ignored in its proposal that will prevent synthesizing it. Second, we’ve never actually needed LLMs to do this. Maybe COVID induced brain fog in a lot of people, but October 1st this year marked the 25th anniversary of Folding At Home. Distributed protein folding setups were quite popular, where you could have your computer or game console experiment with trying to find potential new organic compounds by simulating protein dynamics. I’ve bolded potential and simulating there, because finding candidates or isolating certain functionality was only half the battle, experiments were still needed to validate the results or exploit the actual predicted behavior of how those proteins interacted. LLMs suggesting novel genetics are using similar statistical mechanisms to do this, albeit in a less specialized, and thus less accurate and energy efficient way. I have a conspiratorial notion that those pushing forward these massive capital spending sprees know these limitations, and maybe their intention is to turn all of these data centers into biomedical research simulation labs when everyone else catches on that simulating clerical work isn’t that profitable. All of these GPUs and hardware setups are well suited to be adapted into giant protein dynamic simulation clusters. However protein folding doesn’t sound as sexy to Silicon valley investors as replacing human workers. Thank you for your interesting reply Chris. Indeed, computing models are very useful for, for instance, simulating protein dynamics, their folding and changes these undergo under different conditions. There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed for such simulations. The simulations themselves are to be taken with (tons of) grains of salt. Scientists know that these are just simulations. I think that a big effort has been dedicated to obtain improved versions of RUBISCO, the protein that fixes CO2 to be incorporated in organic material and thought to be the most abundant protein in the world (here an example on Machine Learning to accelerate the process). This kind of work is termed in silico analysis. It isn’t obviously experimental. Whether ML will indeed accelerate the process or make it more complicated it is something that has not been readily shown in this case. It might be that other methods based on random procedures are more efficient and faster. Chris N: I have a conspiratorial notion that those pushing forward these massive capital spending sprees know these limitations, and maybe their intention is to turn all of these data centers into biomedical research simulation labs Of course. That’s exactly what’s happening and biomedical research simulations are one intention. Among others. It’s naive to announce the bleeding obvious, that LLMs can’t hyperscale to more AI or to AGI — whatever that is — as the OP above and many commentators here do as if this were a revelation. Or to point out that LLM-based AI is a bubble. Of course, it is — that’s arguably the business model. The executives running the companies building these giant datacenters almost all went through the dotcom bubble, after all. Ask the next question. (You’re the only person here I’ve seen starting to do that, Chris.) What are they going to do with all that compute besides LLMs? How much compute are we talking about? Currently, the world’s fastest supercomputer is El Capitan, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, capable of 2.746 exaFLOPS — https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer). Microsoft is building Fairwater, an AI-focused datecenter in Wisconsin, operational in 2026 that will by comparison supposedly do 17 exaFLOPS and, via massive GPU parallelism, achieve 10x El Capitan’s performance. And this is only one datacenter among others Microsoft is building and which we can presume therefore will get built. (As opposed to speculating, forex, about how much of the Oracle-Softbank-OpenAIStargate effort will come to fruition). So what other kinds of AI architectures can run in such datacenters. Over the next 3 years, here’s some of the roadmap — Large Physics Models (LPMs): Foundation models trained on physics texts, equations, and experimental data, capable of reasoning across scales—from QM to cosmology. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): For modeling relational systems like molecules, social networks, or traffic flows, where entities and their interactions evolve dynamically. Neural PDE Solvers: AI systems that learn to approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), for simulations in fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and fusion energy. Agent-Based Simulation Models (ABMs): These simulate individual decision-makers (humans, cells, vehicles) whose behaviors evolve based on learned rules, for applications in economics, epidemiology, and urban planning. In 3-7 years’ time, the hope/intent is to leverage this massive datacenter compute to develop neuromorphic computing, which will need massively lower energy inputs (i.e. like the human brain). That way, AI can be pushed out the Edge, as it’s now being referred to, with the Edge meaning autonomous cars, robots, etc. Now, how much of this will happen? Well, prediction is hard, especially about the future. But one other factor needs consideration here: we’ve entered a period of geopolitical conflict, unrest, and war, and war generally accelerates technological development — e.g.the state of things pre-WW2 with biplanes and radio to post-WW2, five years later, with jets, rockets, television, and computers. And this is without the climate threat. So, this could a period of greater technological acceleration than we’ve seen in our lifetimes previously. Who’s they? This GPU compute needs to earn some kind of yield that compensates for the risk undertaken by the investors. And it’s only suitable for a handful of very specialized workloads. Who’s going to pay for this cool-sounding science stuff? Capitalists certainly are not altruistic. They can’t do anything like Uber-for-pets with it. Capitalists aren’t altruistic, but they are greedy, and are willing to invest large amounts of money into things if they think they’ll get a return from them, not because they necessarily or actually will get a return from them. In this case T Rowe price, Vanguard, and every other 401k or pension fund manager is basically putting money into this because of the predicted productivity ramifications from it. I.E. worker output is going to double translates to double value generated, translates to double revenue generated, translates to earnings increasing many times over. However, if that doesn’t materialize, and the bubble pops, there will be all of this hardware left over. Even if the hardware is old, it won’t actually be obsolete. I mentioned folding at home, because many of these types of simulations are embarrassingly parallel computational problems, or those where any computer of any power level can contribute towards calculations. Those GPUs will still be useful for anything that requires a lot of matrix multiplication. This means there will be discount sales for a lot of these data centers, providing opportunities for others companies or investors to buy them up for less than what it would have cost to construct them and buy the hardware new. This is the conspiracy that I’m alluding to: Entrepreneurs can’t pitch a use-biochemical-simulations-to-solve-aging start-up because the time horizon is too long, and initial captial cost too risky to convince non-technical investors to pitch in. But if they can convince them to put money into something that they see a return on, and use that to lower the initial capital cost for their own pet project, they’ll go ahead and do that and fund the entire endeavor for either themselves or their associates interested in those ideas after the crash. As a tangentially related thought, Elizabeth Holmes’ former partner is starting up another medical testing and diagnostics company. A lot of people from the Rational/Less-Wrong Sphere, who came up with Effective Altruism and Long-termism, have a deep cult-like interest in trying to overcome death, either by uploading consciousness into machines, or through mastering genetics and developing therapies to reverse aging. If these individuals lacked scruples to defraud investors via cryptocurrency (See Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX), I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re willing to defraud investors because in their moral calculus, raising lifespans to be 10x longer than they are now is worth it, even if some proportion of the population dies from impoverishment from the bubble crashing, because the net result was positive for the survivors. I’ve bolded potential and simulating there, because finding candidates or isolating certain functionality was only half the battle, experiments were still needed to validate the results or exploit the actual predicted behavior of how those proteins interacted. LLMs suggesting novel genetics are using similar statistical mechanisms to do this, albeit in a less specialized, and thus less accurate and energy efficient way. Interesting you mention this, a story in NY Times earlier this week some researchers at OpenAI left to do a startup that takes these kinds of inputs and then claims they’ll have robotic researchers that will actually perform the experimentation itself physically in a lab, presumably a brute force kind of approach to testing. I can only imagine the number of combinations that might need to be tested for any hypothesis. Second, we’ve never actually needed LLMs to do this. Maybe COVID induced brain fog in a lot of people, but October 1st this year marked the 25th anniversary of Folding At Home. Distributed protein folding setups were quite popular, where you could have your computer or game console experiment with trying to find potential new organic compounds by simulating protein dynamics. I believe a similar folding project, AlphaFold, was able to achieve using generative AI/DeepMind what Folding At Home was setting to accomplish; they were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their achievement. PapP: I believe a similar folding project, AlphaFold, was able to achieve using generative AI/DeepMind what Folding At Home was setting to accomplish Essentially, with some differences. AlphaFold used a transformer architecture to model relationships between amino acids similiarly to how LLMs model word dependencies and has attention mechanisms that work across both sequence and spatial dimensions, similarly to how LLMs track long-range dependencies in text. Differences were no autoregressive token prediction — AlphaFold doesn’t generate sequences, it infers structures — and optimization for protein folding, not open-ended tasks. LLM architectures are pattern-seeking recognition architectures, after all. As Ignacio says above: “There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed” to work out some biogenetic relationships. Turn an optimized LLM loose on non-semantic data sets and you sometimes get amazing results. ~~ Conversely, giving a free version of ChatGPT semantics-based tasks simply to prove LLMs aren’t really intelligent in order to validate your prior anti-LLM beliefs, as many in the NC commentariat are doing, accomplishes — what? Certainly, it’ll give you the proof that the free LLM system for the masses that you used isn’t intelligent, but just a dumb stochastic pattern-recognition system. But it tells you nothing about what specialized LLMs can achieve at full stretch. So, if you believe it does, who’s the joke on? Because it’s not on the LLM, which is indeed just a dumb stochastic pattern-recognition system. LLM architectures are pattern-seeking recognition architectures, after all. As Ignacio says above: “There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed” to work out some biogenetic relationships.

This got me thinking about Kurt Gödel and his Numbering System as applied to LLM architecture with regards to patterns/tokens; these are axiomatic systems govern by simple rules woven together into a regression. So if this is the case, then this is an at least formal-like system and will be ultimately be Incomplete even if you account for the largest vocabulary/library of everything ever written (the totality of the Library of Babel from Jorge Borges comes to mind). So is this chase for AGI a fool’s errand if we can’t even prove AGI on a formal level? What does this say about us on a formal level? Maybe we can relate to this other ontological thing as a fellow confused pattern-recognizing being? Not equal but different. Regarding the replacement of journalists i believe that there are some of a kind who can be easily replaced by AI. Those whose work consists on following a script and who are so frequently and sadly found in MSM. AI can probably do it more reliably. In fact they probably use AI tools to write their articles. Nvidia is selling its GPUs to neocloud companies (such as CoreWeave, Lambda, and Nebius), which are funded by credit, from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone and other Wall Street private equity firms, collateralized by the data centers filled with GPUs. I think it’s worth pointing out here that these GPUs go obsolete in 6-12 months, so their value drops sharply. Their collateral is like fresh fish. They have to hold on to it, but it will inevitably make a huge stink. It seems that with computer operating systems software (OS), the free & open source (FOSS) Linux has proven to be superior to non-FOSS/closed OS software like Windows. What are the prospects for FOSS in AI/LLM? Is there a similar likelihood that a FOSS software in AI/LLM like DeepSeek will outperform the US closed competitors like OpenAI? If no AI/LLM software is producing the hyped extreme productivity breakthroughs, wouldn’t there be an incentive globally in most nations to use or make limited propietary modifications on DeepSeek instead of the US closed software alternatives. Especially if it is the case that DeepSeek can provide similar quality models with 10% of Meta’s AI software’s computing power. Any computer scientists or financial analysts/economists focused on the InfoTech sector have a take on how a FOSS software like DeepSeek will influence future AI development? “What are the prospects for FOSS in AI/LLM? Is there a similar likelihood that a FOSS software in AI/LLM like DeepSeek will outperform the US closed competitors like OpenAI?” Sure thing bro, just search for “running deep seek on raspberry pi and you’ll get a long list of how to do it and many examples of it running. Raspberry is a very cheap one board computer that runs linux. https://www.hackster.io/ElecrowOfficial/how-to-run-deepseek-on-a-raspberry-pi-5-step-by-step-guide-c2c790 There’s a big difference between what FOSS can do and what it does do. Mostly the difference between what a motivated individual wants and what a pointy haired boss wants. ProNewerDeal claims Linux is superior (I agree, personally), but that hasn’t budged the needle on desktop market share, has it? Sure, you can shoehorn a LLM onto a Pi (it’ll run like molasses in January), but what CEO is going to boast about that to a quarterly analyst conference call? The CapEx orgy is hype driven, not performance driven (duh). This is an apples / oranges question. The real worry is that the current AI ‘productivity’ hype was a head fake to fund the infrastructure, and the real goal is to get everyone hooked on AI (a la Facebook/TicTok), dumb down the population, grab Google’s advertising money firehose and end up owning the mother of all Big Brother propaganda engines. I recently stumbled into some on-line drama about how the latest OpenAI model was messing with paying customer’s feels, by routing “dangerous or emotional” prompts to a safer model which was heavy on the warnings, and offering up information about self harm hotlines and such, rather than playing along like the previous model. Oh the humanity! I gather that paying customers can select the older model, but there’s real-time “psychological analysis” of your prompts so if it judges that you’re veering into dangerous territory, it routes to a newer, safer model. And let me tell you, THEY DONT LIKE IT! From my 30 minute climb down that rabbit hole, I came to the conclusion that there’s already a lot of people well on their way to the LLM addiction you mentioned in your last paragraph. It may not be plain jane FOSS, but Linux derivatives are being used by the biggest of big boys: Inside Google‘s Data Centers: The Operating Systems Powering Google‘s Global Infrastructure https://expertbeacon.com/inside-googles-data-centers-the-operating-systems-powering-googles-global-infrastructure/ Google‘s servers predominantly run customized versions of the open source Linux operating system that have been tuned and hardened for Google‘s unique technical environment. Rather than rely on standard “off-the-shelf” Linux distributions, Google‘s engineering team has modified and secured the Linux kernel and userspace tools to create server operating systems tailored for massive server fleets running containerized workloads. This journey to create a highly optimized server OS began nearly two decades ago and continues to evolve today. In Google‘s early days in the late 1990s, its initial fleet of servers ran a modified version of the Red Hat Linux distribution. However, as the scale and complexity of Google‘s infrastructure increased, its engineers began customizing the OS to meet its specific technical and operational needs. In 2006, Google started work on “goobuntu”, its own in-house distribution of the Debian-based Ubuntu Linux OS [1]. Goobuntu was used for Google‘s corporate desktops and also some of its production servers. For its larger server fleet, Google hardened and slimmed down the Linux distribution even further, removing extraneous packages and attack surfaces. This more spartan Linux system used an in-house software distribution and management tool called Midas. In the 2010s, Google began migrating servers to its latest generation custom Linux distribution known as gLinux [2]. The article also mentions that Linux derivatives are used by Amazon and Facebook. Admittedly, using a Pi for an LLM is probably not going to work too well, but AMD’s latest high end laptop CPUs are bringing some real heat if you want to do LLM at home: Linux on the New Framework Desktop PC! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziZDzrDI7AM That’s definitely NOT a cheap PC, but the LLM performance is pretty astonishing even at that price point. Overall though, I agree that AI is way, way over hyped for what it’s actually doing. But strangely, AI in other countries (at least one other country) is actually doing some pretty amazing stuff: China’s AI hospitals will transform medicine across the world. But not in the United States. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFB7AQSR0 China is already a powerhouse in AI for radiology and medical imaging. Next they’re going global. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RJlqhYt2XQ AI in America strikes me as a “cheat”. American elites don’t have to do the real hard work to compete with a country like China (like re-industrialize, bring back R&D, re-create a skilled middle class workforce) , AI will just figure it all out and “poof”, America is on top again! It’s a nice dream for our elites, but it’s a dream that can turn into a nightmare for the rest of us. Glen: AI in America strikes me as a “cheat”.

It’s a nice dream for our elites .. that can turn into a nightmare for the rest of us. Yes. The trend is broadly recapitulating nuclear, which American capitalism — where corporate elites had to be served and profit before all else — also screwed up. Also, automobiles. Also, airliners (e.g. current Boeing failures). Don’t quote Silicon Valley at me, because that was built on Pentagon money; in 1960, 100 percent of all microprocessor chips it produced were bought by the DoD for ICBM guidance systems and early-warning radar networks like NORAD; as late as 1967, 75 percent of all chips from Silicon Valley were still going to the DoD. It took the Japanese to pioneer transistor/chip based electronic consumer appliances — computer tech for the civilian masses — not the Americans. Thanks for this excellent article. Indeed, the whole idea that LLMs are going to lead to AGI is just a laughable fantasy. Perhaps if Sam Altman hadn’t dropped out of a comp sci program, he might know this, but he’s from a rich family so he could always retreat back into money and vast carelessness. And then we get to the whole issue of data centers, their costs, the investment bubble, etc. Regarding the question about FOSS alternatives, and alternatives to the big data center apps… One of my colleagues has been experimenting with local LLMs. This colleague is a professional software engineer with decades of experience. Key findings about local LLMs: * Vision detection using an Intel Arc A770 (12GB of ram) works but gives many false positives. * Voice commands work only for the simplest commands. Anything beyond “turn on the kitchen light” fails to translate into expected actions. * Trying to write kubernetes YAML — the results are so terrible it’s just laughable. * Code generated in other languages “utter trash”. * Trying to resolve actual networking problems gives the same few suggestions, all of which were incorrect. * Trying to solve networking problems with cloud-based LLMs isn’t much better. * Using the app for an interactive diary, it got stuck in discussion loops after a few days. * Open source LLMs on Hugging Face are always well behind the commercial offerings from OpenAI et alia. Conclusion: currently-available local LLMs are simply not usable for many problems, or will cost too much to produce better results. From my vantage point, a lot of the hype around generative AI is being sustained by people who stumble through vibe coding a basic app and then say “wow, this is amazing — I wrote an app but I didn’t have to learn to code!” Basically, these are people looking for a free lunch. They want to be able to say “I wrote an app” but they don’t want to make the effort to learn a programming language. There are also those who say they want to learn, but in fact they are unwilling to just sit down and read a book. There are hundreds and hundreds of books about many different programming languages, expressly for this purpose. E.g., once upon a time, I read Kernighan and Ritchie’s The C Programming Language. It’s well-written and not very long. This is the tried and true way of doing it. But vibe coders don’t want to make such an effort. They want to “chat” with an AI to “learn” what they would get from simply reading a book. In other words, they want hold-holding and fawning attention from a sycophantic bot, all the way through. The unspoken premise here is that learning a programming language is some sort of insanely difficult task — but is it really? IMO, this leads us directly to a deeper issue, which is people who expect rewards — or actually feel entitled to those rewards — but don’t want to make any effort to get those rewards. What i found more damning is that while there are indeed applications for which de LLM models can be useful and help humans with some cumbersome tasks the big 7 keep focused on AGI. Interesting but boring business models bypassed in the search for some utopian or dystopian tech control of everything. The bubble is very, very high above us. And agreed: very good article. “…once upon a time, I read…” This is actually the key failing of AI. You read and comprehended something. LLM’s are given information to make statistically inferred outputs. They don’t read nor comprehend the information that was provided to them in training. I have some limited experience with local LLMs. It was like working with a 3 year old… but unlike a 3 year old, it never learned and kept making the same mistakes. Once in a while, I got better results without changing anything, and other times worse. Software engineer here. I can’t add much to this, unless the idea of AI code generation is to change my job from thinking about solutions to business concerns to thinking about editing the AI’s probabilistic solutions to business concerns, is the order of the day. Of course the there has been some big talk, but not many takers yet it seems. Amazon made hay over exactly this not long ago, as if the efficiency gains are something you can now take to the bank, and removed “tens of thousands” of workers from their rolls. But a few months later it turns out they just wanted to hire a bunch of H1b visa holders instead. Turns out AI ‘efficiency gains’ are simply wage cuts: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/amazon-blamed-ai-for-layoffs-then-hired-cheap-h1-b-workers-senators-allege/ “Those aren’t eatin’ sardines, their tradin’ sardines.” *they’re too early in the morning to try to be witty. sardine (n.) : “pilchard, type of small oily fish,” migratory and highly esteemed as a food, early 15c., from Latin sardina, sarda, from late Greek sardinē, sardinos, earlier sardē, which is often said to be from or related to Sardō “Sardinia” (see Sardinia), the Mediterranean island, near which the fish probably were caught and from which they were exported. which takes us back to the previous discussion of Sardonic Laughter. When i was in Cali i didn’t ask for pilchards but sardines and it was better understood by many sellers there. You know what happens with fish names: they are local and you have plenty of regional variations which apply to some similar fish species. If you enter “sardine” in fishbase you obtain 63 entries from many different regions representing more than two dozen species besides Sardina pilchardus. My wife has had a curious experience with AI-driven decisions taken in a Spanish bank. She was being charged some commissions on her account which according to bank rules were not applicable in this account. She went to a branch to get those removed and dis-charged. The person attending her agreed that she was right but when she tried, the AI algorithms didn’t allow to remove the commission because some obscure “original sin”, let’s call it this way, coming from the merger of the original bank where the account had been opened long ago. In the end this has been solved by a helping attendant who decided that the only way to do this was to deceive the algorithm with false data. You can imagine where is this all going when you have to resort to tricks. Sounds like a great way to have a crooked bank employee feed the AI algorithm some dodgy data so that bank funds are sent to an account that may not be “officially” listed. Would banks miss money going into a bank account that they cannot find listed in their files or even know about? That sounds a lot like the begging process that medical professionals face, with insurance company “care approval” protocols. There is no shortage of stories about doctors and patients trying to get timely care coverage. Insurers claim cost savings and better care, but charts suggest otherwise. There is a thingy about this on the Netflix show Barry and is in real life the Australian Robo Debt debacle – https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-04/robodebt-victims-get-compensation-from-class-action/105734030 I mean its not like there is some decades of these machinations in the “Market Place” and some are still confused … HR is old hat now lmmao … This is a tangent, but bear with me – it’s good and kinda relevant. The last link in the article is to a Science News Today article about building a “Dyson Sphere.” The article states: Dyson’s idea was born out of a need to conceptualize how an advanced civilization could continue to thrive as it consumed more and more energy. This is fake news (and a very common misconception). Freeman Dyson was making fun of the tortured logic used by SETI scientists to explain why they thought looking for particular radio waves would be a reasonable way to scan the stars for life. The article in which Dyson proposed the sphere was a one-page parody letter to an astro-physics journal. Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t get dry humor (which is extremely obvious when you read the actual ‘paper’) and took him seriously. Dyson himself thought it was funny that he was best known for a joke he made instead of any of the actual physics he did. At any rate, the fact that a science news website is acting like Dyson Spheres make any sense at all (they don’t, and purposely so) is pretty indicative of where we’re at as a society…i.e. pretty far down the path to Idiocracy. So the guy bringing us GenAI talking about building Dyson Spheres is pretty on-brand. The best part of Altman’s quote got cut out in the article, however. Right after mentioning Dyson spheres, he says, “Like probably in the next 10 years or something.” roflmao. IBM TV ad on streaming: “Blue gonna help you transform your business with AI.” Reminds me of the TQM craze, everyone chased it no one read Deming! It’s doing wonders for their stock price, though. Victory! Why does this whole sorry episode remind me of the Biblical story of The Tower of Babel? It will all end in tears … As of last night, it finally dawned on me that I’ve been noticing what must be AI generated text in the description feeds to my Amazon Prime video account feeds. The first one I saw, but didn’t recognize it at the time as an AI hallucination, was a movie with the description that started something like, “Set in the 1920’s…”. However watching the trailer it was obvious the story was more modern, but the one item that probably threw me was there was one brief photo in the trailer that was older – maybe from the 1920’s. Anyhow I was confused enough by it that I just kept skipping it. Then last night I watch “The Healer”. It’s intro text started something like, “From the 17th century…” but again the trailer was all modern. I mentally just assumed the 17th century was a reference to a family history of healers which was part of the story line (that it was a family thing). However, after watching it there is NEVER any mention of anything from the 17th century. Then it dawned on me that it might be an AI hallucination. When I even went to the Amazon website the descriptive text there for “The Healer” never said anything about the 17th century, it was only in my Amazon Prime feed from the app on my Android TV. I am now certain my confusion over the “Set in the 1920’s” is also a hallucination. For all your readers who are interested in the history of AI’s coming into being in its current form Matteo Pasquinelli’s book, ‘The Eye of the Master: a social history of Artificial Intelligence’ is indepensable. It chartes the battles of the neuroscience sector, the interests of the US navy and Marxist analysis of labour power with formidable argument to demonstrate the deep flaws in AI’s claims to triumphant revolution. Well, with AI replacing labor, AI robotics replacing labor, AI replacing thinking … AI replacing….. with AI getting all the money to be productive while actual humans have income while that income is depleted more and more by out-go. You would think that fewer and fewer people will be able to afford the purchase or consumption of these magical AI fantasies. I guess if humans are to be digitized to the point of no choice, well then, AI will have all the biological imput devices for it’s consumption and outputs designed to maximize profits I am waiting for AI to come of age in law and take over for lawyers and judges. Between the constant stories of AI hallucinations re: legal case, and anecdotes about AIs learning to “cheat,” I can only imagine what sort of dystopic Wild West is coming for the court system… “The disappointing rollout of ChatGPT-5 raises doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that users are willing to pay for. But the point I want to make is not just about OpenAI: the American AI industry as a whole has been built on the premise that AGI is just around the corner. All that is needed is sufficient “compute”, i.e., millions of Nvidia AI GPUs, enough data centers and sufficient cheap electricity to do the massive statistical pattern mapping needed to generate (a semblance of) “intelligence”. This, in turn, means that “scaling” (investing billions of U.S. dollars in chips and data centers) is the one-and-only way forward — and this is exactly what the tech firms, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Wall Street financiers are good at: mobilizing and spending funds, this time for “scaling-up” generative AI and building data centers to support all the expected future demand for AI use.” The disappointing performance of the COVID-19 vaccines raises doubts about Biomedicine’s ability to read and understand the scientific literature, which has demonstrated conclusively that durable immunity to coronaviruses is unattainable in vertebrates, either through previous infection or vaccination. Nevertheless, Operation Warp Speed was built on the premise that after everyone was vaccinated the pandemic would recede into nothingness. Cost was no object, and a few transnational Big Pharma corporations made tens of billions of dollars during 2021 and 2022, with the expectation of a continuing money stream after the initial surge in vaccinations. This approach was the only way forward and would lead to a revolution in rapid responses to future emerging infectious diseases using mRNA vaccines. And the scientists who figured out how to stabilize expression of exogenous mRNA in the target cells and tissues were awarded a Nobel Prize for their previously underappreciated research. Some calm reflection is in order. If all progress in AI development stopped cold today, it would take 20 years for its benefits to percolate through the world economy. Note that the productivity potential of networked computer technology and uniform electronic data standards available 20 years ago has still not been achieved, largely because of institutional behavioral inertia. The gating factor in the application of intelligence to the problems of man is not the pace of the synthesis of intelligence, it is the unwillingness of mankind to behave intelligently in accepting change. We know how to make universal medical charts and records. We know how to fully automate air traffic control. We know how to prevent train collisions. We know how to build trusted voting systems. But we are good at finding reasons for not doing the things we say we want to accomplish. Of course, when something becomes an “emergency,” suddenly the obvious is discovered. Welcome to the modern world: powered by emergencies, not emergent technologies. It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. — Niccolò Machiavelli This IS calm reflection, and not a moment too soon, in the face of too much cult-like marketing hype. Who is this “we” that will harness technology for the good of mankind? If recent history has shown us anything at all, it is that the application of new technologies—at least in the Western world—will be controlled by the most ruthlessly exploitive financial interests and used primarily if not exclusively to extract value from everyone else. This is the opposite of broadbased dissemination and learning that filters into quality improvements across sectors, raising living standards. My sister is a nurse. I’ve heard quite a bit about the rollout and aftermath of the EPIC medical management system. It is not designed to help medical providers or improve patient care. It’s about billing, full stop, and it’s hated by pretty much everyone she knows in her field. “We know how to make universal medical charts and records.” Yes, we do. And they have very little to do with improving healthcare and everything to do with billing and upcoding. No single $8-ibuprofen tablet shall remain unaccounted for! It is also true that AI transcribed charts are often replete with mistranslations and outright hallucinations. It is a sad fact that U.S. hospitals have effectively resisted the automation and interoperability of their systems for decades. Medical professionals have insisted on preserving institutional moats and drawbridges that render their computer systems highly incompatible, despite the obvious need to track the same patient information. There is no digital standard for the patient chart, the most basic medical record. Between 5 to 10 percent of patients are harmed by medical error. Surely uniform AI cross checks on diagnosis and treatment would reduce that. Put on top of this a health insurance structure that only M.C. Escher could depict, and you have an inefficient mess attributable not to evil computer geniuses, but to institutional turf wars, perverse incentives, and just plain cussedness. It’s not just medical institutions. Look at the power grid, the rail system, pipeline infrastructure, and air traffic control. Look at the inability to build housing, the plague of homeless mentally ill people, all in a nation that is among the richest in the world. Is misguided technology speculation really a central problem? Is misguided technology speculation [that will probably crash a debt-ridden economy] really a central problem? It sounds bad to me… Private Debt mate “Is misguided technology speculation really a central problem?” It’s certainly not the solution. Most of this is due to the category error that his health insurance. People insure their lives and property against events that are unlikely. Illness and accident are not in this category. No argument from me that if healthcare were the objective instead of private profit (even in “nonprofit” hospitals), interoperability and legitimate electronic health records could be useful and universal and improve healthcare all around. According to STAT yesterday, UpToDate is unveiling its AI version. UpToDate has become the near universal cheat sheet for clinicians. Still, from the article: That kind of explainability is critical as doctors choose when and how to let different AI tools help them, said Crowe. But healthcare AI experts emphasized that those advances have not eliminated the chance for error through hallucinations, omissions, or other more nuanced LLM mistakes. Stanford’s Chen cited an example in which a resident had treated a patient with severe alcohol withdrawal with phenobarbital, a powerful sedative and anticonvulsant, based on an LLM-based tool’s response. Chen asked the AI the same question, and got the response he expected: First line therapy was safer benzodiazepines, followed by phenobarbital. “AI will just make up some stuff — or even if it doesn’t make up stuff, it’s a little bit random,” he said. “This unpredictability is what allows it to be kind of creative and flexible. But do you want to be creative when you’re practicing medicine?” Some clinical generative AI tools may perform better than others — depending on their engineering, the data they’re trained on, or their underlying LLMs. There are tradeoffs involved in choosing any subset of medical material to train on. “You are potentially missing some important information if you’re not pulling from more up-to-date resources,” said physician Cornelius James, who researches AI and evidence-based medicine at the University of Michigan. “But you also avoid bias in that you’re not pulling from some of those more up-to-date resources.” But clinicians are missing the details needed to make informed choices between tools. “The general state of the evidence is terrible,” said neurosurgeon Eric Oermann, who directs the Health AI Research Lab at NYU Langone. Researchers and companies are developing benchmarks that evaluate an LLM’s medical abilities, from simple early versions like taking the U.S. medical licensing exam to those involving real-world patient tasks and clinical reasoning. Benchmarks are imperfect, said Oermann, but at least they allow for researchers to compare large language models from tech companies like Google and OpenAI on a level playing field by peppering their APIs with thousands of programmed questions. Anyway, I do not think it unreasonable to expect a resident physician to know that benzodiazepines are the preferred choice over phenobarbital for a patient suffering from alcohol withdrawal, which is not a particularly rare condition. It has been said millions times that “being educated means knowing where to look up something.” No, being educated means knowing what you know and what you don’t know. Researchers and companies are developing benchmarks that evaluate an LLM’s medical abilities, from simple early versions like taking the U.S. medical licensing exam to those involving real-world patient tasks and clinical reasoning. GingerBalls on the Twitter often points out that there’s an unintelligent solution to every intelligence test, so passing these licensing exams is meaningless. Participation in the technical aspects of this discussion, which I am reading with great interest, is above my pay grade, but an observation: the medical and pharmaceutical professions, at least in Canada, are currently the sole remaining market for fax machines. You clearly have not been paying attention to our decade+ posting, based on the work of medical professionals who happen to be experts in IT, as well as the experience of users, that electronic health records are an utter train wreck. And it has NADA to do with your bogus depiction. The process has been driven by billing and the desire to upcode. Not medical care. Not ever remotely your fabricated “medical professionals preserving institutional moats’. You need to stop Making Shit Up when you do not know what you are talking about. Agree with everything here except timing. Some economists tried to quantify the technology diffusion rate and found it’s closer to fifty years instead of twenty if you’re looking at full global adoption. Smartphones took over the world and changed our brains in less than ten years, on the other hand. But yes, there are still Homo sap tribes living in the Amazon who don’t know the world outside their forest and are living the way they lived in 20,000 years (though not in the Americas). Personally, I think it’ll be a sad day if and when they cease to be there — because the world is coming for them — though I wouldn’t wish to be one of them. “Yet AI, which Storm calls “Artificial Information” … Perfect. Re: The AI Bubble and the U.S. Economy: How Long Do “Hallucinations” Last? By Servaas Storm Proper descriptive language is critical to the analysis and reworking of human systems. Therefore, being lulled into repeating truisms that are not true undermines the work being undertaken. In the article, Storm says, “The AI investment boom is based on the belief that AI will make workers and firms significantly more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unprecedented levels.” That phrase is not true. Eliminating “workers and” corrects the statement, ironically, by doing exactly what makes AI so attractive to “firms.” The idea that automation makes the residual workforce more productive has always been a lie, a lie that has been encouraged by ownership simply because it has some ability to make that residual workforce proud of the machines that make it “the most productive workforce in human history,” even as the latest machines pick off the remaining laborers, one by one. Dividing amount of production by number of laborers to get ever-rising labor productivity figures is a stupid accounting trick. Dividing production by labor equivalent units (LEU’s – and, yes, this is adapted from containerized shipping) gives away the game. By not defining or measuring LEU’s, it veils the possibility that productivity – given that energy and pollution would necessarily be figured into the cost of each LEU – would be revealed as having heretofore invisible periods of stagnation, even regression. More importantly, defining and measuring LEU’s would eliminate any last trace of simplistically attributing productivity to labor. By dividing measured production between labor and LEU’s, it would make stark the reality that ownership always trumps attribution. Attributed productivity has never given more than a tenuous claim to the profits of production. Labor has always known that. Labor has long been able to project the trend of increasing productivity and has long dreaded that projection: that eventually “labor” would be reduced to a janitor cleaning up after the machines, working for minimum wage, while being attributed trillions in productivity. Ownership matters. Once nourishment and a safe place to live is secured, ideas are the most valuable commodities, yet “intellectual property” is almost an oxymoron. Technique ends up embedded in tools. That is why, where the guilds were strong, possessing the tools of a craftsman, without being a member of the appropriate guild might actually be a crime. Similarly, the Luddites were not so much opposed to advances in technology as they were the embedding of their intellectual property into an array of machines. Truly, the machinists were the first computer programers, and they feasted on converting the deep skills of others into own-able hardware. Now, the programmers are coming for the artists, the scientists, even the C-suites, and the latest generation of programmers might be the last, as intellectual property devours its producers, and is left to eat its own tail. But the last programmer will be attributed a vast productivity. “Eric Schmidt and Selina Xuworry, in the New York Times of August 19, 2025, that “Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal [of AGI] that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists. In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating A.I. powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.” That’s some Chinese characteristics that I endorse. The USA business and financial sector is preoccupied with trying to insert rent-seeking middle-men between all the issues that could be addressed now – for and by people in the here and now. The people who have to be healthy, sane, and safe in order to have healthy, sane, and safe people in the future. It’s still just fucking software! What a con! If you are interested in a detailed outline of the progress of AI in the MIC, here is a great substack that explains what is going on in the field where military combat AI is being developed. It focuses on Arizona and New Mexico because the largest combat military training centers in the world are located there. I foresee a great future for AI as the military has unlimited financing for the large corporations dabbing in that field. https://sonoransown.substack.com/p/life-recast I guess this is the terminal phase of the AI bubble, the phase I remember from the dotcom one – if you mention the risks that were mounting by the hour people would yell at you because the objective was to get funding and walk away with all you could in the crash. And in five years somebody buys the infrastructure for pennies on the dollar and turns a profit on porn or whatever. Only a tiny example of odd experience: I was testing duck.ai as my system is too old to host the new programs. I wanted duck.ai to shorten a narrative text by 10, then 20, then 50%. For some internal error it cut it down by 90%, 80% and 50% respectively. This failure repeated. It never came up with versions which would be 10% shorter or 20% than what I had fed it with. Strange. Generally the results with narrative fiction are horrible. What the system is offering (they claim to treat the texts confidential) is either total nonsense or equipped with some sense but solely by coincidence. Containing meaning that has little to do with what I had originally written. This is especially true – and now any programmer should seriously lsiten up – humour or “poetical” formulations. Style in general is overwhelming it. Anything where “tonality” comes into play crashes it . As I said I can´t judge state of the art systems. But unless I tell any AI to reproduce something in the style of say TS Eliot, or Dickens or Austen, it doesn´t know wha to do. It is totally lost and will fail to develope inherent styles of its own. And produce gibberish. Which shouldn´t surprise. At the beginning of the industrial revolution, workers rebelled against the machines. They intuited that if they did not own the machines, the machines would own them. This is also the case with robotics in production, “Who owns the robots?” AI in my thinking is no more than a language and data collecting robot. So, “who owns AI?” We see that financialization and rent-seeking have turned AI research into a mess. By all accounts, researchers in China do not do the same. #DotComBoomBustMemories I had a video chat with one of my younger colleagues at work, and they asked me what similarities if any I see between the dot-com-boom, and this new AI-boom. At first, I thought that the dot-com-boom was really more intense flying-by-the-seat-of-ones-pants-into-the-unknown … but as we talked through it, I realized, that this is potentially far worse. The lemmings from lower Manhattan and the sycophants from the valley of silicon are getting the band back together! Rare moment of clarity from Eric Schmidt there … he’s already made his billions, though, so I can imagine some of the young guns who are lookin’ to get theirs scoffing at his concern. Once again, the odious runaway sewage train (via YouTube) of unicorn valuations looks set to derail and spill sh** everywhere. When the colo-business (via dgtlinfra.com) collapsed after the dot-com-bust, a lot of data-center space in NY/NJ, for example, reverted to office space. The intervening years brought public-cloud to the fore, and now public cloud space is set to expand just like metro datacenter space expanded at the turn of the century. One can only imagine the impact of large AI-specific datacenters being built out in the boonies (where land/tax, water and power are cheaper, ostensibly) only to have them decommissioned and empty when the bust invariably comes. Empty strip mall desert redux, anyone? One of the reasons the tech-bros are focused on “surpassing human intelligence” is because they absolutely loathe labor. The finance bros may seem convinced about AI, but they’re not fully. They want two things: • Proof that AI can generate new revenue streams – this, they have gotten thus far. • Proof that AI can kill jobs – this, they haven’t got (to a satisfactory degree yet), and I think this is what they really, really want. The dumb asses don’t understand how an economy works at all, and are blinded by the dollar signs in their eyes. So, yeah … bubble, bubble, toil and trouble! And if, by some chance, this edifice of irrational exuberance somehow manages to survive, just remember: AI is gonna replace everyone … except VC’s … #natch (via futurism.com). Rare moment of clarity from Eric Schmidt there … he’s already made his billions, though, so I can imagine some of the young guns who are lookin’ to get theirs scoffing at his concern. I don’t have to imagine. I’ve heard them. > I don’t have to imagine. I’ve heard them. Thanks much for the confirmation! I know these types, but don’t share environs often. Sadly, the article did NOT look at AI in China – but was navel-focused. China AI is primarily focused on the factory, where it actually provides quantifiable cost savings. The US AI has been focused on rendering a larger fraction of the population as inessential workers – to use the language of Bender in Futurama – meatbags – consistent with the disdain the oligarchs have for the lumpen population.

According to a Bloomberg report, the secondary sale lets current and former staff who had held shares for at least two years sell stock to a handful of companies, including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price. The deal marks OpenAI’s second major tender offer in under a year, following a $1.5 billion SoftBank transaction last November. In January, the Japanese conglomerate was reportedly in talks to earmark up to $25 billion for OpenAI. SoftBank’s U.S.-traded shares (SFTBY) rose 1.7% to $66.04 on Thursday after news of the OpenAI share sale, reflecting investor enthusiasm for its AI-linked deals. The $500 billion figure reflects a steep rise for OpenAI from earlier in the year, when the ChatGPT developer was valued at $300 billion following a $40 billion funding round led by Softbank in March. With this latest move, the company now sits ahead of SpaceX—whose own valuation is estimated near $400 billion—putting OpenAI at the top of the private company universe. Despite scrutiny around the rollout of GPT-5, investor confidence remains undimmed. In September, OpenAI and Nvidia unveiled a strategic infrastructure partnership: OpenAI plans to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, and Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion progressively as each gigawatt is deployed. Jensen Huang described it as part of “bringing AI infrastructure from the labs into the world.” It also coincides with the ongoing Stargate partnership between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle to build out America’s AI infrastructure backed by the Trump Administration. The sale also gives employees liquidity that could help the company fend off nine-figure pay packages from rivals such as Meta, which is aggressively hiring for its new Superintelligence Labs. The timing also coincides with structural moves at OpenAI. The company lifted its capped-profit limit in May, all the while facing continued legal pressure from Elon Musk.

OpenAI could now be the world's most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok's parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company's valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates' MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don't meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company's AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that "over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI's for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity. The deadline to apply closes on Oct. 8. Fukui is a coastal prefecture easily accessible from Tokyo; away from crowds and tourists, but with plenty to do, see and taste. So the investors really still have any expectations? LOL This article is pure hype. ChatGPT is currently losing between $13 million and $23 million per day, depending on how costs are calculated, reflecting operating losses of roughly $400 million to $700 million per month in the second half of 2025. These figures are from several financial reports and news articles published just recently. OpenAI disclosed to shareholders and international media that it lost $2.5 billion in the first half of 2025, mostly due to R&D and operational costs for running ChatGPT on a global scale. This equates to approximately $400 million per month, or about $13 million per day, with other estimates for ongoing all-in costs reaching higher daily figures based on infrastructure, energy, and training expenditures. ChatGPT's unveiling of version 5 was a serious flop, and many users reverted to older models. The new model design and infrastructure changes obviously reflect an attempt to balance costs but at the expense of 'intelligence'. Claude by Anthropic is now preferred by most serious users, and Perplexity is favored for research. ChatGPT's research now lacks the depth, scope, and accuracy of its competitors by a significant margin. OpenAI on a standalone business basis might not be that valuable, but it turns out they have a vast amount of business partnership opportunities, $synergies which are highly unique and thus in the minds of many highly knowledgeable investors, justifying the $valuation Only time will tell, but their chances seem solid, as their scale and biz model flexibility in AI is hard to $achieve Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) capitalized on Wall Street’s artificial intelligence boom Thursday, fueled by billions in chip investments from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and other technology giants. Broadcom has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, carving out a strategic niche in the rapidly evolving chip market. While competitors like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) offer off-the-shelf, high-performance GPUs, Broadcom focuses on designing custom AI chips for its hyperscale customers, the tech giants that own and operate the world’s largest data centers. Also Read: Broadcom Wins $10 Billion OpenAI Order, Analyst Sees More Growth Ahead This approach allows companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to tailor silicon to their exact needs, offering a compelling, often less expensive, alternative to the pricier, general-purpose Nvidia chips. By helping these key players design their proprietary AI accelerators, Broadcom solidifies its foundational role in the sector, ensuring its technology is deeply integrated into the core infrastructure of the AI revolution. KeyBanc Capital Markets reinforced this outlook by reiterating its Overweight rating on Broadcom and raising its price forecast to $420 from $400, citing the company’s foundational position in AI and the broader semiconductor supply chain. Following recent channel checks, analyst John Vinh said that the supply chains of Nvidia and Broadcom “sound the best,” as upward revisions are coming to chip-on-a-wafer-substrate (CoWoS) supply. Broadcom’s trajectory as a core AI beneficiary is evident in its expanded targets. Its 2026 CoWoS supply goal has climbed to 190,000 units, reflecting an anticipated year-over-year increase exceeding 160%, Vinh noted. A critical factor in its AI dominance remains control over Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google TPU franchise through 2026, with volumes expected to more than double. Additionally, Broadcom has secured significant new AI ASIC orders, including 400,000-500,000 units for OpenAI and roughly 100,000 units for Apple, reinforcing its influence over AI development and production. Analyst John Vinh raised the price forecast to $420 based on $10.37 fiscal 2026 consolidated earnings per share (EPS). Price Action: AVGO stock was trading higher by 2.31% to $341.10 at last check Thursday. Read Next: Photo by Remus Rigo via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

By MATT O’BRIEN OpenAI could now be the world’s most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker.

Title: OpenAI valuation reaches $500 billion, topping Musk’s SpaceX

OpenAI has completed a deal to help employees sell shares in the company at a $500 billion valuation, propelling the ChatGPT owner past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. Current and former OpenAI employees sold about $6.6 billion of stock to investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group Corp., Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price, a person familiar with the transaction said. That boosted the US company’s price tag well past its previous $300 billion level during a SoftBank-led financing round earlier this year. That rapid rise underscores the investment frenzy surrounding the leaders of a technology with the potential to transform industries and economies. Sam Altman’s OpenAI is one of several companies including Nvidia Corp. now leading a global push to build data centers and develop artificial intelligence services, an undertaking that’s expected to cost trillions of dollars. Though it has yet to turn a profit, the US startup is helping fuel that infrastructure boom by inking mega-sized deals with the likes of Oracle Corp. and SK Hynix Inc. Representatives for Thrive Capital and Dragoneer didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI, SoftBank and T. Rowe Price spokespeople declined to comment. A spokesperson for MGX said the firm is “pleased to be a core partner to OpenAI and to continue building on our strong relationship as a significant investor across multiple funding rounds.” The deal vaults OpenAI past SpaceX’s $400 billion valuation. That milestone coincides with a pivotal time for Altman’s company, which is in negotiations with Microsoft Corp. to convert into a more traditional for-profit company. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit dedicated to advancing digital intelligence “in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” Planned changes will give the existing OpenAI nonprofit entity control over a new public benefit corporation. Both Altman and Musk, who were OpenAI co-founders, have spoken about the potential existential risk to humans posed by AI. Yet they’ve since fallen out: Musk has sued to try and stop the overhaul, accusing OpenAI of forsaking promises to him when he helped to create the nonprofit. He claims it abandoned its founding purpose when it accepted billions of dollars in backing from Microsoft starting in 2019, the year after he left OpenAI’s board. When it comes to the business itself, OpenAI faces an increasingly competitive market for AI talent as big tech firms jockey for the resources they need. Meta Platforms Inc., for one, has recruited researchers aggressively from OpenAI and other top labs for its new “superintelligence” team, offering pay packages in the nine-figure range. A secondary sale could help OpenAI incentivize staff to stay at the company and turn down those lavish compensation offers. Major US startups often negotiate share sales for their employees as a way to reward and retain staff, and also attract external investors. OpenAI is looking to leverage investor demand to provide employees with liquidity that reflects the company’s growth. The value of a company tied to a secondary share sale is separate from the traditional private market valuation set when a startup completes a new round of funding. The total amount of eligible units sold in the secondary fell short of the $10 billion-plus worth of stock that the company allowed for sale, the person familiar said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is private. That could mean current and former employees are demonstrating confidence in the long-term viability of the business, the person added. In the long run, OpenAI faces mounting competitive pressure from rivals such as Google and Anthropic, which is also raising capital at a rapid clip. In response, OpenAI has embarked on a spate of recent technology product launches. Those include a pair of open and freely available artificial intelligence models that can mimic the human process of reasoning, months after China’s DeepSeek gained global attention with its own open software. OpenAI released its most powerful GPT-5 model in August, aimed at shoring up its lead in an increasingly crowded sphere. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The world's richest man just got richer. Elon Musk became the first person with a net worth of $500 billion in October 2025, according to Forbes. Rising Tesla shares fueled this jump in Musk's fortune. The company's stock was up nearly 17% year-to-date as of Oct. 2, 2025. Musk's wealth has been in the news for a proposed new pay package that could make him a trillionaire. Tesla (TSLA) is asking its investors to approve a massive pay package for Musk which would be valued at nearly $1 trillion if he can lead the company to achieve certain valuation and operations milestones over the next 10 years, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Shareholders are set to vote on this pay package in November. Musk's net worth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla and privately held rocket and satellite manufacturing company, SpaceX. The additional shares under the new pay deal could push the value of Musk-owned Tesla shares to over $2 trillion. Tesla's share price increased more than 60% in 2024, with some of those gains coming after President Trump won the election in November. An insider share sale of SpaceX in December 2024 also boosted Musk's net worth by about $50 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk's wealth surpasses other notable billionaires including Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Here's how the Tesla CEO made his billions. esla is one of the largest carmakers in the world. The company builds and designs fully electric vehicles and also makes energy generation and storage products like solar panels, solar roof tiles, and battery systems. Its vehicles include sedans, mid-size SUVs and the CyberTruck. Tesla was founded in 2003 as Tesla Motors by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk invested in the company and was a member of the board starting in 2004. He became CEO in 2008. Musk was allowed to claim the title of cofounder after an out-of-court settlement. Tesla went public in an initial public offering (IPO) on June 29, 2010. In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from its native Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas. In July 2023, Tesla unveiled its first Cybertruck built in its Texas factory, almost two years behind the original schedule. Musk is Tesla's largest shareholder, and owns 19.7% of the company's stock as of August 29, 2025. Musk is also the cofounder and CEO of SpaceX, a rocket manufacturing company that counts NASA as a client and helps resupply the International Space Station. SpaceX became the most valuable startup in the world when it considered raising funds at a $400 billion valuation in July 2025, according to Bloomberg. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX, which has launched over 400 rockets since it was founded in 2002, and has more than 4 million subscribers for its Starlink internet service. In April 2022, Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion after threatening a hostile takeover. The deal was finalized in October 2022 after Twitter sued Musk for trying to back out of the deal. His takeover has been controversial, as he laid off much of the company’s workforce and added a paid subscription service ($8 per month) for anyone who wants their account verified. In July 2023, Musk rebranded Twitter as X, replacing the blue bird logo with the letter. Fidelity estimates that X is worth about $9.4 billion, according to Forbes, per disclosures released by the investment firm in September 2024. Fidelity's stake in X is now worth about $4.19 million, down about 79% before Musk bought X. Musk founded artificial intelligence firm xAI in 2023. In July 2025, the company was looking to raise fund from investors that would peg its valuation up to $200 billion, according to the Financial Times. The company also raised $10 billion vis loans and cash investments in June, following a $300 million share sale in July, the Financial Times reported. Musk owns about 54% of xAI, per Forbes. The team at xAI is led by Musk and others who have previously worked with OpenAI, DeepMind, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Tesla. Musk is also the founder of The Boring Company, a construction company that aims to “solve traffic” by building tunnels. The company raised $675 million in April 2022 at a valuation of $5.7 billion, according to a release. Musk co-founded a company called Neuralink which designed a "brain-computer interface," a chip that can be implanted into the brain and would allow users to control their computers and mobile devices with their thoughts. According to the company's website, Neuralink is working to help those with quadriplegia, a symptom of paralysis that affects a person's limbs and body from the neck down, with the ability to control their devices with their thoughts. The company, which launched its first human trial in January 2024, was valued at an estimated $9 billion, after a raising $600 million earlier this year according to Semafor.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI’s rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company had authorized sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T. Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. The share sale adds to SoftBank’s earlier investment in OpenAI’s $40 billion primary funding round. The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit.

OpenAI has reportedly finalized a secondary share sale that values the artificial intelligence company at $500 billion, making the ChatGPT owner the world's most valuable startup ever. The share sale, which allows employees to cash out, comes just months after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta Platforms (META) was poaching the company's AI staff with signing bonuses as high as $100 million. OpenAI's sky-high valuation suggests investor demand for AI plays, which has helped propel the major U.S. equities indexes to record highs, remains strong. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI's current and former employees sold about $6.6 billion in stock in a deal that has has vaulted the company past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. OpenAI had a $300 billion valuation earlier this year. Rocket company SpaceX is valued at $400 billion, Bloomberg said. Investors that bought into the secondary share sale—where investors buy from other investors rather than the company—included Japan's SoftBank, which put forth $30 billion in a funding round earlier this year. Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price also snapped up shares, the report said. OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT), is the latest of a string of AI startups to have seen valuations soar as investors are eager for exposure ahead of potential market entries. Nvidia (NVDA) also said last month that it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, has a market capitalization of well over $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable publicly listed company. OpenAI didn't immediately respond to an Investopedia request for comment.

The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said. The sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached at least seven top engineers from OpenAI, often luring them away with multimillion-dollar signing bonuses. OpenAI’s most recent funding round came in August, when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T. Rowe Price, and Dragoneer were also investors in that round, as well as private equity firms like Blackstone and TPG, and major venture capitalists like Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. The sale is also a reminder of OpenAI’s ability to raise cash as needed — a particularly important resource given the company’s ambitious infrastructure plans. OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership. The new sale comes just weeks after a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft, which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity. But OpenAI’s conversion has not yet been confirmed in court, and the new sales could cause significant complications if the conversion fails to proceed as planned. OpenAI continues to develop and launch products at a blistering pace, releasing its latest Sora 2 video model and accompanying social media feed earlier this week. The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash.

It seems like it's AI or nothing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The explosion of generative AI over the last few years signals a change in the job market alongside it, and this brings with it worries of job instability and losses. With big players like Nvidia, Meta, X, and the governments worldwide further committing to AI, questions are posed to those at the very top. In a recent interview with the British news channel, Channel 4, Nvidia's CEO Jensun Huang, gave his thoughts on what's next. He says, "If you're an electrician, if you're a plumber, if you're a carpenter, we're going to need hundreds of thousands of them. To build all of these factories." Huang argues, "The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to boom". "You're going to have to build. You're going to keep doubling and doubling… every single year." Just last week, Nvidia shared plans to spend $100 billion on OpenAI. This cash is intended to go towards greater supplies of data centre chips, to further train upcoming AI models. Just weeks before that, Nvidia's earnings report showed it made almost 10 times more from AI than gaming. Nvidia's stock price is also at an all-time high, over 10 times what it was half a decade ago. CEO of US chip giant Nvidia, Jensen Huang, tells Channel 4 News, that ‘electricians and plumbers’ will be the big winners in the AI race as the skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a 'boom'. #Tech #AI #Nvidia #Economy #C4News OpenAI's spending has also skyrocketed, alongside ChatGPT's popularity, and the US government is firmly behind cementing "US dominance in artificial intelligence". From a PC gaming perspective, we've even seen brands like Razer jump on the AI bandwagon. This is all to say AI doesn't appear to be going away, and it has backing in the hundreds of billions. When asked what could happen if the UK doesn't 'grasp this opportunity', Huang says, "just as the last industrial revolution, the reason why it came about was because you needed it. And so the industrial revolution that started here in the UK came out of need. You need it now, too." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Earlier this year, the UK's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology signed an agreement with OpenAI to push the chatbot into the public sector in a further bid to make the UK an AI powerhouse. Though highlighting future employment seems relevant to current fears around the job market, this doesn't address those who have degrees and experience in fields being replaced. Senator Bernie Sanders argued in June that "Artificial intelligence is going to displace millions and millions of workers". A month after this, OpenAI's Sam Altman shared that he thinks some jobs will be "totally, totally gone" due to AI. A former Google executive in August argued AI will lead to a "short-term dystopia" because it will struggle to create new jobs for those it is replacing. Huang tells reporters, "You're going to be building out AI infrastructure here in the UK for a decade," but it's not clear what the plan is for workers after that. 1.

Title: ChatGPT Shopping: How to Get AI to Recommend Your Products
URL: https://backlinko.com/chatgpt-shopping-optimization
Time Published: 2025-10-02T14:05:17Z
Full Content:
A 14-day trial for premium features. 55+ tools.Free access for core features. Backlinko readers getaccess for 14 days. 55+ tools. Written by Yongi Barnard ChatGPT recommends products — complete with photos, pricing, and purchase links — to its 700 million weekly users. And now customers can complete purchases without leaving the chat. BIG deal. But will ChatGPT recommend your products? That’s not automatic. And you can’t pay for placement. What you can do is optimize your site so ChatGPT understands what you sell, trusts your brand, and surfaces your products when buyers search. This guide shows you how. You’ll learn the eight-step framework for getting featured in ChatGPT Shopping. I also spoke with Leigh McKenzie, Backlinko’s Head of Growth and founder of the ecommerce brand UnderFit, to get his insights on what’s actually working. First, let’s look at how ChatGPT decides which products make the cut. ChatGPT Shopping kicks in automatically for some shopping intent prompts. While it doesn’t fire every time, I found it appears more often than not after testing 100+ prompts. The key? Typing a prompt with clear buying intent. Like “e-bikes that can handle potholes.” Instead of just explaining things or offering advice, ChatGPT Shopping recommends specific products. This includes product images, pricing, and links to online stores and websites where users can make a purchase. Side note: The ChatGPT Shopping experience isn’t consistent. Even with the same prompt, the carousel may (or may not) show. It can also appear at the top, middle, or bottom of the chat. This variability suggests the feature is still evolving. If your store gets recommended, countless high-intent shoppers will see your products. For example, when I tested the e-bike query, ChatGPT gave me a brief explanation of what features to prioritize. But it also provided a visual product carousel with eight products, each in its own card with key details. (It looks similar to Google Shopping ads, except you don’t have to pay for them.) Clicking on any card opens a side panel with: From there, users simply click “Visit” to reach the merchant’s product page. But this experience is changing. As of September 2025, OpenAI is rolling out Instant Checkout — a feature that lets shoppers buy directly inside ChatGPT. This is a huge shift. ChatGPT is no longer just a product discovery tool. It’s a full shopping destination. Right now, Instant Checkout is only available to Etsy sellers in the United States. But OpenAI plans to expand this feature to Shopify merchants and other countries soon. Not on either platform? They’re also accepting applications for merchants to build their own integrations. (More on this in Step #7.) A shopper describes what they’re looking for (“running shoes with arch support under $150”), and ChatGPT’s AI goes to work. It scans the web for the most relevant products based on that request. And weighs details like product names, descriptions, features, reviews, brand authority, and other signals to find the best matches. If your product checks the right boxes — and the information on your site is clear and crawlable — it has a chance to be recommended. ChatGPT may also consider the user’s location and preferences when making recommendations. Ultimately, all product recommendations must also pass through OpenAI’s safety systems. This filters out low-quality, misleading, or unsafe products. So, what does all of this mean for you? ChatGPT Shopping is evolving fast — and the brands that keep up will win the most visibility. Here’s how to ensure ChatGPT can understand, trust, and recommend your products. ChatGPT needs structured data to understand what you sell. Schema markup is code that labels key details on your product pages (and website as a whole): name, price, description, availability, reviews, and more. It turns raw HTML into data AI tools can parse instantly. Without it, ChatGPT (and other AI systems) have to guess what’s on your page. With it, they see clean, structured information they can confidently include in product recommendations. At a minimum, your product schema should include: It may look intimidating, but many content management systems — like WordPress, Shopify, and Wix — offer plugins or built-in tools that generate the markup for you automatically. Once your markup is in place, test that it’s working correctly using Google’s Rich Results Test or Schema.org’s validator. These tools make it easy to check that your structured data is valid, visible, and error-free. Pro tip: Go beyond the schema basics. Add AggregateRating for average review scores or FAQPage markup to answer common buyer questions. The more context you provide, the easier it is for AI to surface your product in response to specific prompts. A product feed is a structured file that packages up your product details and sends them to platforms like Google Merchant Center, Shopify, and Etsy. It includes details like titles, prices, availability, images, links, and more. ChatGPT may use data from major platforms like Google to decide which products to recommend. Pro tip: Want to add your product feed directly to ChatGPT? OpenAI will notify interested merchants when this feature is available. Fill out the Merchant Application form for consideration. For example, if your Google Shopping feed is outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, ChatGPT may return bad information about your products. Or skip recommending them entirely. That’s why a high-quality, up-to-date product feed is critical. Side note: If you’re on an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce or Shopify, feeds are usually created automatically. But keeping feeds accurate is easier said than done. There are a lot of moving parts, like site updates, refresh schedules, and third-party tools. And it only takes one slip for mismatches to creep in. Here are a few common product feed issues — and how to fix them: Automation keeps most updates in sync. And manual checks before major launches or sales help catch anything that may slip through. Here’s how Leigh maintains a balance of the two for his ecommerce store: “I keep all my product data in a spreadsheet. Whenever I change a product detail, I update it there first. WooCommerce uses that data to update my site’s pages and schema automatically. Then, Channable takes the same spreadsheet and syncs those updates into my product feeds. That way, my site and my feeds are always pulling from the same source, so everything stays consistent.” If ChatGPT can’t read your site, it can’t recommend your products. Two simple technical issues block many ecommerce sites from showing up: hidden content and restricted crawlers. Many AI bots — including ChatGPT — still struggle with content that only loads via JavaScript. If key details aren’t in the page’s raw HTML, the bot might never see them. This includes your product descriptions, prices, and images. Eek. Here’s how to check if that’s happening: If your product details disappear, it means they’re only loading through JavaScript. To fix this, work with a developer to ensure all essential information is in your site’s raw HTML. Your robots.txt file can also block AI crawlers. This small file tells bots which parts of your site they can (and can’t) crawl. By default, most sites already allow all bots, including ChatGPT’s crawler, OAI-SearchBot. But it’s still worth double-checking. Here’s how: First, go to yourdomain.com/robots.txt. Then, look for a rule like this: And this: If it says “Disallow,” then ChatGPT is unable to crawl your site. You (or your dev team) can fix this issue by changing it to “allow.” Further reading: 23 Best Large Language Models ChatGPT matches products to prompts by language, not keywords. So, if your product copy doesn’t sound like the way people talk, it may not surface in shopping results. The goal: write the way buyers phrase their prompts. You don’t have to guess how your customers talk. Use research tools like: Look for modifiers that mimic real queries — terms like “best,” “for beginners,” “eco-friendly,” or “kid-friendly.” Tools like Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit show you the actual prompts people type into AI engines. So, instead of manually guessing or testing one by one, you get a ready-made list of conversational queries buyers already use. Once you understand how your audience speaks, weave the terms naturally into your product titles and descriptions. This will increase the odds of your products showing up in ChatGPT when shoppers search. Further reading: 11 Awesome ChatGPT Alternatives to Try When you’re writing copy, pay special attention to your product titles. They often feed directly into the shopping carousel. And they’re the first thing shoppers see before deciding to click. The golden rule: Lead with what matters most to your audience. If trust drives decisions — like in categories such as laptops or smartphones — put your brand front and center. If features, benefits, or use cases are more important, focus on those instead. Use this simple formula: [Main Benefit or Feature] + [Product Type] (+ [Brand] if it builds trust) On Leigh’s site, for example, his titles highlight what buyers care about most: product benefits. That’s why they’re structured as Benefit (Invisible) + Product Type (Undershirt). But when brand recognition is vital to trust, it makes sense to include the brand name. Like this product title for a Sony home theater: Don’t worry about cramming every detail into the title. Most ecommerce platforms give you multiple fields for product info. Use those strategically to sprinkle in conversational keywords. Titles get people to click. Descriptions get them to buy. This is where you expand on features, benefits, and use cases — all in plain, natural language. For example, UnderFit’s product copy mirrors the words buyers use when searching for an undershirt. These words aren’t filler — they’re search terms. Which means they’re likely the same language people use when prompting ChatGPT. Your product’s value proposition needs to be clear and visible at the top of your product page. This ensures ChatGPT immediately understands: But that’s not enough. The rest of your page should support and reinforce that promise. This gives ChatGPT a complete picture of your product. And helps it see your product as the best fit for the query. This means every section — features, benefits, reviews, specs — should back up your value proposition with proof and detail. Huel’s Black Edition product page is a great example of this in action. The value proposition is right under the product title: “High Protein Complete Meal.” This instantly explains: The image reinforces this by highlighting complementary copy: “This is a meal. Not a protein shake” and “40g protein per meal.” The product description repeats the promise yet again: “40 grams of protein.” But it also adds details like “27 essential vitamins and minerals.” This repetition is exactly what you want. While you can (and should) use word variety, your page should tell one clear story from top to bottom. Explain what the product is, why it’s valuable, and how it delivers on that promise. So, audit your site. If copy and images don’t reinforce your core message, rework them until it does. The more consistent and focused your messaging is, the easier it is for ChatGPT to understand (and recommend) your products. Further reading: How to Use AI for Writing Exceptional Content (7 Best Practices) ChatGPT doesn’t just look at your product page when deciding what to recommend. It cross-checks authority signals from across the web to figure out whether your brand (and your product) are trustworthy enough to recommend. These signals include: One way to see which sources matter most for your brand is to run a manual check in ChatGPT. Type a shopping prompt into the tool, scroll to the answer, and click “Sources.” The links you see there are the sites that ChatGPT used to pull its recommendations. (And, by extension, the sites it trusts.) For example, when I asked for a “yoga mat with serious grip for hot yoga,” ChatGPT cited: Use the sources as your roadmap. Target them with outreach strategies like expert quotes, partnerships, and co-branded content. Can’t land mentions on the exact sites ChatGPT cited? Go after similar ones with comparable authority. And build your presence on community platforms, too. A strong showing on Reddit, Quora, and niche Facebook groups can boost your brand’s credibility. Instant Checkout lets shoppers go from product recommendation to purchase without ever leaving ChatGPT. Once they find something they like, they can confirm details, pay, and place an order — all within the same chat window. (Hashtag mind blown) Instant Checkout currently supports single-item purchases in the U.S. on Etsy. (But Shopify integration is coming soon.) If you’re on either platform, you’re in luck. Eligibility is automatic. For everyone else? You’ll need to apply and integrate with OpenAI’s Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP). Translation: Roll up your sleeves. There’s work to do. Here’s what you can do now. Start by filling out OpenAI’s merchant application form. This lets OpenAI know you want in. They’re onboarding merchants on a rolling basis and will reach out when you’re accepted. Once you’re in the pipeline, you’ll need to: Pro tip: Even if ChatGPT Instant Checkout isn’t available for your store yet, preparing your product data, feeds, and backend now will help you move faster when it is. This should give you a head start as this feature gains popularity. It’s not enough to show up in ChatGPT Shopping. You also need to measure how well you’re performing. Start with tracking traffic. The easiest way is through OpenAI’s built-in UTM tag. This is code that OpenAI automatically adds to all outbound links. And looks like this: Set up a custom segment in Google Analytics to track and analyze ChatGPT traffic to your site. Once that’s done, look for patterns: Side note: Not every ChatGPT mention will be traceable. Some users see your product in a chat and search your brand directly on Google instead of clicking. Look for spikes in branded search traffic or direct visits to gauge the broader impact of LLMs. But traffic only tells you what happens after people click. You also need to measure what happens before — specifically, which prompts surface your products. To do this, it helps to understand the kinds of prompts shoppers type. Most fall into four buckets. Think of these buckets as templates. Test prompts in each category and ask yourself: Repeatedly run these checks to gather more data. You’ll learn which prompts lead to product mentions, how your LLM visibility changes, and how buyers talk about your brand. Rather automate this process? Tools like Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit let you: There isn’t a magic formula for getting ChatGPT to recommend your products.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters today. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI's rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi's MGX and T Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. The company had authorised sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit. Accreditation: Reuters © RTÉ 2025.

Business FILE PHOTO: OpenAI logo is seen in this illustration taken May 20, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI's rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi's MGX and T. Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company had authorized sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added.

Title: Economy Candy: Three generations of sweets and success
URL: https://woocommerce.com/posts/economy-candy-custom-woocommerce/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T20:47:09Z
Full Content:
The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog October 1, 2025 We recently got to visit Mitchell and Skye Cohen at Economy Candy to learn about the history of their business and how they use WooCommerce. While our team was in New York, we also filmed a short interview, which you can check out below or on our YouTube channel. Want the full story? Keep on reading for all of the sweet, sweet details of their success. 🍬🍭 Please note that some quotes have been edited for clarity and brevity. Economy Candy began in the 1930s as a penny sweets cart outside a shoe and hat repair shop in New York City. Since then, three generations of the Cohen family have turned the business into a Lower East Side mainstay — with the corner of Rivington and Essex named after Mitchell’s grandfather — and national distributor of goodies from around the world. Now, Mitchell Cohen and his wife, Skye Greenfield Cohen, continue that legacy. “Starting before he could even see over the counter, Mitchell would work with his dad behind the register standing on a milk crate, tallying bills and calculating the change in his head,” Skye shared. Skye has also continued an important tradition: ensuring that her husband continued the family business, just as Mitchell’s mother and grandmother had done for their husbands. Their most recent evolution included an upgraded ecommerce strategy in March of 2020. When they overhauled their website, which luckily happened just in time for Covid-19 closures, they also updated their store operations. Economy Candy brought nearly 2,500 SKUs into their online store, live syncing their inventory management, and began using a combination of shipping and local pickup options to keep their business going (and their customers happy) through the pandemic and beyond. Economy Candy has weathered significant worldwide and local catastrophes in its 88-year history, and yet, they’re still going strong. Their enduring presence is due in large part to their commitment to their customers, maintaining the accessibility of their products through all of the challenging times. Over the past five years, they’ve added nearly 500 new products to their inventory — which now boasts an astounding 2,500 different sweets and goodies. Getting to 2,500 SKUs, however, required an operational pivot: all of their inventory operations used to reside exclusively in Mitchell’s brain. “Up until the pandemic, all of Economy Candy’s inventory was stored in Mitchell’s head,” Skye shared. “Our staff had to memorize the prices of all 2,000+ items we carried because we were still using dumb cash registers where the price of each item had to be manually entered. In 2021 we took a leap into the 21st century and upgraded to Square digital registers.” Their modernization coincided with the pandemic, which exasperated the need for efficient (and online-friendly) inventory management. Not allowed to bring staff in-store, Mitchell and Skye moved all sales online, managing fulfillment themselves. In 2021, they added Square digital registers and implemented barcode scanning, using Thrive to sync in-store sales with their ecommerce business. Economy Candy has been online since the dawn of the millennium. In their hunt for a solution that didn’t feel restricted in functionality or growth, they switched platforms several times until 2015 — when they found WooCommerce. “When WooCommerce was presented to us, it was clear that limitations would no longer be an issue. Because WooCommerce is open source, there is no ceiling. There’s no limit to what you can do, what you can customize, what you can create. And it’s been great ever since.”— Skye Greenfield Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy Their WooCommerce store is responsible for 20 to 25% of their total sales each year, with seasonal spikes in traffic around the holidays. Thrive sits between WooCommerce and Economy Candy’s other third-party tools, and syncs sales data for in-store purchases, online transactions, and ShipStation. They’ve also integrated the site with UPS, FedEx, Route, Mailchimp, Google, and Meta. With a total of 57 active plugins and custom code, Economy Candy manages a complex network of tools and services. “It’s incredible the way that WooCommerce is able to talk to all these different programs.”— Skye Greenfield Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy One aspect that Mitchell and Skye love about WooCommerce is the breadth of options for customization — something that comes in handy when your products might melt during warmer seasons: “Shipping chocolate in the summer is tough. It is a challenge, but one thing that Woo has been great [for], there’s a myriad of popups and messages that you can easily set up.” “[For example,] I can set a warning,” noted Skye, “for anything that’s chocolate, put this text on that page so that the person ordering it knows that this is chocolate, there is a risk of melting. Do they want to add ice? Do they want to add cold packaging? So all those plugins [allow us to] set it and forget it… And it has really made shipping chocolate much less of a heartbreak.” Their focus on customer satisfaction has been the key to their success: “Economy Candy has survived for nearly 90 years on word of mouth,” Skye shared. “Of course, what ‘word of mouth’ means has changed a bit in the last century, from literal word of mouth to now including having our customers post about us on TikTok and Instagram and having a social media presence ourselves.” To inspire that organic promotion, they follow the rule of threes: If three people give the same feedback or request, they do their best to accommodate it. This often impacts their product and inventory decisions, from importing international sweets to making sure they stock candy from their oldest customers’ youth. They take a similar approach to new product decisions, considering the selection from the customer’s point of view: Would the customer be excited to see it in store, or has someone requested something similar? Is it a unique product that they haven’t seen before? Mitchell and Skye are also mindful of future generations of their audience. Their Gen Z staff members help them stay up to date on TikTok trends and viral sweets, such as Swedish candy, freeze-dried candy, and slime lickers. As the business grows, Economy Candy continues to play to WooCommerce’s strengths. Taking advantage of all of the customization options, Mitchell and Skye know that they can change direction whenever the need arises. “Being able to pivot without recreating your website from scratch every few years, which we used to do — now we’re making tweaks on an existing platform instead of starting from scratch, and that saves a lot of money, a lot of time.”— Mitchell Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy “With WooCommerce as the central foothold of our platform and adding pieces around that, … EconomyCandy.com is customized to what EconomyCandy.com needs to be for Economy Candy customers and for Economy Candy staff to be able to operate on the backend. We are able to put in all those custom functionalities that work for our specific business.” About Ship your WooCommerce orders with confidence, save on top carriers, and automate your processes with ShipStation.

Title: Morgan Stanley: Adobe’s Future at Risk Due to AI
URL: https://petapixel.com/2025/10/01/morgan-stanley-adobes-future-at-risk-due-to-ai/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T19:31:25Z
Full Content:
Morgan Stanley has downgraded Adobe’s stock rating, cutting its price target for the software giant amidst a perceived inability to stand out amidst the rise of generative AI. According to a report from The Street, top Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss noted a growing gap between Adobe’s AI development (and promises) and reported revenue in its Digital Media division. “Since that upgrade, we have seen the Digital Media annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth directionality diverge from the pace and quality of innovation being embedded within the product portfolio,” Weiss writes in his report. The full report notes that Adobe’s revenue which it can tie directly to its AI-based efforts has been lagging, and monetization is going slowly. Compounding issues are growing from competitors like Canva, Google, and Meta, who all have introduced AI-based features that they can more directly tie to revenue growth. As a result, Morgan Stanley lowered their price target for Adobe from $520 to $450. It doesn’t look like it’s close to even hitting that lower mark, however, as the stock has been steadily falling in the past couple of weeks. It hit $353 per share on September 24 and sits at $344 on October 1. Adobe’s current weakened situation is likely a product of its own making. For the last year, Adobe has been shouting loudly about its AI development and the power of its in-house generative AI platform, Firefly. However, after updates and iterations, Firefly remains significantly behind competitors in terms of usefulness. While its select subject and remove tools have become a lot better over the last couple of months, for most of the year, its generative tools have been downright ghastly, resulting in Eldritch nightmares that don’t solve the problems they should. Its AI-based generative video tool is still far from being usable. The AI situation at Adobe has been so behind that the company recently opened up its platform to use other Generative AI tools — most recently Nano Banana — diminishing the value of its “responsible” AI to the degree that Adobe seems less concerned with it now than ever, especially as pressure mounts to make good on its AI-based revenue promises. In June, Adobe finally started tracking generative AI use through its apps via credits, which will very likely be an indicator that Adobe can use to tie AI to revenue. But if those numbers aren’t high and showing an upward trend, investors still won’t be happy. That’s tricky for the software company, as the main users of its Digital Media division are still artists, many of whom are less than happy with the proliferation of generative AI that has been trained on human work, effectively stealing knowledge so it can be sold back to them. Adobe is not wholly beloved by its customers either, who regularly clamor for someone else to step in and give Adobe competition. Its recent foray into social media network Bluesky is the best example of how Adobe’s customers feel as the company was hit with so much backlash after joining that it was effectively forced off the platform.

Title: Contrarians Only: A “Flash” Sale On Our Top AI Dividend
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/10/01/contrarians-only-a-flash-sale-on-our-top-ai-dividend/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T15:24:00Z
Full Content:
ByBrett Owens, Contributor. We contrarians live for the “one-off” shots at extra income (or gains!) our favorite AI dividend plays throw our way. One of these “special situations” just landed in our lap: A shot at buying a megatrend-powered 7.6% dividend that’s rarely cheap. And we’re picking it up for a song. It’s a long-time holding of our Contrarian Income Report advisory, and it’s sitting right in the tracks of the surging AI buildout. In fact, it may be the last “cheap” AI play on the board! This one’s dropped from trading for more than its portfolio is worth to a lot less. As you can see, this fund dropped from trading 6% above its net asset value (NAV, or the per-share value of its portfolio) to 7.1% below, as of this writing. It’s a huge drop, and it stands out because, as you can see above, this fund, the 7.6%-yielding Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund (UTF), is rarely cheap for long. UTF’s latest tour in our Contrarian Income Report portfolio started in November 2020, and this reliable utility fund has been humming away since, handing us a 7.8% yield on our original buy, plus a monthly payout that’s rolled in like clockwork. That’s exactly what we bought it to do. And it’s handed us a 41% total return in that time, too. And now we have a shot at buying it cheaper than we did five years ago! Let me put all of this in dollars and cents for you. In the past year, UTF’s average premium has been 1.8%. If the discount reverts to that level, price upside of around 10% is on the table here. And that’s before we factor in the growth of its portfolio. Let’s talk about that now. We bought UTF in late 2020 because its utility-stock holdings—including big players like NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co. (CO)—are essentially “bond proxies.” When rates fall, as they did then, utilities rise. Nowadays, we have a similar setup. As we discussed in last week’s article on some of our favorite gold dividends, long rates are essentially capped, and short-term rates (controlled by the Fed) are falling. Plus we have another, far bigger driver: AI’s limitless power demand. Let’s take Texas, ground zero for the AI power boom. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) have built data centers there. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), Texas alone expects a 62% surge in power demand by 2030 as these data centers multiply. That’s just one state, utilities nationwide are racing to add capacity. To be sure, this AI-utility trade is far from a secret, so why the discount on UTF? Look at the chart below. In orange, we have UTF’s total NAV return (again, the value of its underlying portfolio) for 2025. In purple we see its total return based on market price (or what investors are paying for the fund itself on the open market). As you can see, the total NAV return has continued its climb. The market-price return, meantime, has dropped, carving out that 7.1% “discount gap.” This is the kind of sign we contrarians love because it shows that this discount is not because management blew a stock selection (or many). It’s all about investor sentiment. And we’re happy to take the other side of the bet when investors turn bearish on a solid fund like this one. Why the sour mood? UTF’s management firm, Cohen & Steers, is doing something CEF managers rarely do: conducting a “transferable rights offering” on the fund. Under this setup, if you held shares of UTF as of the “record date”—September 22—you get one “right” to buy new shares at a discount: Every five rights lets you buy one new UTF share. Here’s how that will work: When the offer expires on October 16, the price of the new shares will be set at 95% of the stock’s average closing price on that date and the four trading days leading up to it. If the fund’s average price is below 90% of its NAV—again, the per-share value of its underlying portfolio—the price will be set at 90% of NAV. That “floor” helps limit the offer’s downside pressure on the shares. If you owned UTF as of September 22, you’ll be able to exercise your rights and even more, if there are leftover shares other investors don’t pick up. If you don’t want to get in on the action here, that’s fine—you can sell your rights—hence the “transferable” in the name. All of the details of the rights offering are on C&S’s website. All of this, in a nutshell, is why UTF has dropped to a discount.. But how do I know this is a buying opportunity? Let’s look at history. I did say earlier that rights offerings were rare for CEFs, but on March 19, Nuveen announced a similar deal on its Nuveen Credit Strategies Income Fund (JQC). JQS’s discount deepened on the offer’s announcement, then ground back toward its norm when the expiry date rolled around. I expect the same with UTF’s AI tailwind, capped interest rates and management’s ability to sniff out winning infrastructure plays. And thanks to the rights offering, they’ll have even more cash to work with. If you own UTF, this is your chance to buy more at a bargain. If not, you still get to buy a rarely cheap fund for 93 cents on the dollar—and ride its closing “discount gap” higher. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: CoreWeave Stock To $250?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/01/coreweave-stock-to-250/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T13:22:50Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CoreWeave stock (NASDAQ:CRWV) exhibited an impressive performance increase of 12% on September 30, 2025, following the announcement of a groundbreaking $14.2 billion partnership with Meta Platforms, affirming the organization’s position as a leading AI infrastructure provider. The seven-year agreement with Meta, which extends through December 2031 with the potential for expansion into 2032, signifies a strategic diversification success for CoreWeave. Having been reliant on Microsoft for roughly 70% of its revenue, this partnership fundamentally alters CoreWeave’s risk related to client concentration while illustrating the scalability of its specialized GPU infrastructure model. The partnership guarantees Meta access to CoreWeave’s Nvidia GB300 server racks, each outfitted with 72 of Nvidia’s advanced Blackwell AI GPUs, establishing CoreWeave as Meta’s infrastructure partner for forthcoming AI workloads. This agreement comes on the heels of CoreWeave’s recent $6.5 billion expansion with OpenAI, raising the total contracted revenue with OpenAI to $22.4 billion and creating a varied blue-chip client portfolio. We elaborate further on this development and CoreWeave’s valuation in the sections below. That being said, if you’re looking for a less volatile investment than holding a single stock like CRWV, you might consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has realized returns surpassing 91% since its inception. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; avoiding a tumultuous experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In addition, refer to – Wait For A Dip To Buy Hims & Hers Health Stock Meta’s dedication grants CoreWeave unparalleled revenue visibility and confirms the company’s specialized “AI Hyperscaler” strategy. As Meta actively enhances its investments in AI infrastructure—with capital expenditures anticipated between $66-72 billion for 2025—CoreWeave becomes an essential infrastructure provider for one of the largest AI spenders in the tech industry. The agreement bolsters CoreWeave’s competitive advantage against hyperscale cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud by showcasing that specialized AI infrastructure can command premium pricing and foster client loyalty. CoreWeave’s current market capitalization of approximately $70 billion and its current revenue base of $3.5 billion indicate that the company trades at roughly 19 times trailing revenue—a compelling multiple considering its rapid growth trajectory. For context, CoreWeave's revenue is projected to increase over 3.5 times, nearing approximately $18 billion by 2027. Does this imply the company’s valuation will decrease to under 4 times sales, assuming the stock price stays stable? We do not think so. Even at a more conservative 8 times revenues, the company’s valuation would likely surpass $145 billion, representing more than a doubling from current levels in the next three years. Indeed, this valuation seems conservative when compared to other high-growth technology stocks that trade at considerably higher revenue multiples. For instance, among AI and Data Infrastructure Leaders, Snowflake trades at around 18x revenue despite slower 28% growth rates, while Palantir commands a 124x revenue multiple with a 39% growth rate. In the realm of High-Growth SaaS Companies, Palo Alto Networks trades at a 15x revenue multiple, and HubSpot at a 10x multiple. There are numerous other comparable examples. CoreWeave’s recent achievements authenticate our previous forecasts of substantial upside potential, with the stock rising 47% over the last month and more than tripling since its IPO in March 2025 at $40 per share. The company’s revenue growth of 206% year-over-year in Q2 2025, reaching $1.213 billion with 62% adjusted EBITDA margins, showcases significant operational leverage at scale. With a contracted backlog of $30.1 billion offering multi-year revenue predictability and nearly 50% anticipated to be realized within 24 months, CoreWeave presents investors with both growth and certainty—an unusual pairing in high-growth technology stocks. The partnership with Meta reinforces CoreWeave’s thesis as the specialized infrastructure layer driving the AI revolution, positioning the company for sustained growth as enterprise AI adoption accelerates across various verticals. Naturally, we could be incorrect in our evaluations, and investors should carefully consider the risks prior to investing in CRWV stock. The primary risks associated with CoreWeave revolve around its financial stability and market standing. Specifically, the company confronts substantial challenges stemming from fierce competition with major cloud providers and the possibility of market cyclicality in AI spending. From an operational perspective, CoreWeave has a -29% net margin and a $15 billion debt burden necessary for significant infrastructure investments, compounded by a critical customer concentration risk with major clients such as OpenAI. It’s important to recognize that investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate strong returns for investors. What accounts for this success? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a dynamic means to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when the markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Pseudonymous X user Buzzlamic Jihad, who is called Buzz by his friends and family, told Decrypt that he hopes to address Aptos’ image problem and position it as a premium stablecoin network—harking back to the original Libra vision from Facebook in which Aptos was founded. He said that one way he aims to do this is by leveraging his personal connections with the co-founders of the President Trump-backed World Liberty Financial, two of whom were mentors to the shitposter. "Buzz is an inventor and true Aptos missionary through and through,” Ash Pampati, head of ecosystem at Aptos, told Decrypt. “I'm excited for him to come on board as an advisor to expand everyone's imagination of what is truly possible only on Aptos.” Aptos looking good here https://t.co/eTQrNlu1ga — 🐝 (🌐/acc) (@BuzzlamicJihad) September 14, 2025 Back in February, Buzz was partly responsible for a 17% pump for Aptos' APT token as the crypto community started to notice the memes he had been posting for months. The then-little-known social media user had been spamming “Aptos lookin’ good here,” “sidelined?” and “motion not priced in yet” in unwavering support for the layer-1 blockchain. These phrases have since become canonical crypto memes, with major crypto figures and companies embracing them. The buzz, pardon the pun, was so effective that Pampati told Decrypt in May it helped to revive developer interest in the network, in an unexpected display of the power of memes. Aptos looking good here This is just the last 24h pic.twitter.com/pagwYwZ1nD — 🐝 (🌐/acc) (@BuzzlamicJihad) February 16, 2025 At the time, people wondered how a seemingly random X user could have such a large impact. It turns out Buzz has a history in growth marketing, specializing in Facebook advertising, and claims to have generated millions with this venture. During that period, Buzz told Decrypt, he was mentored by Chase Herro and Zak Folkman, successful Facebook marketers who went on to co-found World Liberty Financial. At one point, Buzz said he lived with the pair in Puerto Rico and was briefly their business partner. Given his history with Facebook, now Meta, Buzz explained that he was immediately attracted to Aptos as it was formed by developers from Libra—a now-defunct stablecoin project led by Facebook. The deeper he dug, the more he liked about Aptos, and he started posting about it under the pseudonym Buzzlamic Jihad. After the February pump, Buzz claims he was offered a role in marketing at Aptos but turned it down. Over the coming months, he continued conversations with the Aptos team and has now signed a deal to become an advisor. In many ways, Buzz joining Aptos as an advisor is comparable to if meme stock influencer Keith “Roaring Kitty” Gill joined GameStop—a rumor that once circulated on the internet. As the possibility of joining Aptos emerged, Buzz reached out to Folkman after years of not being in contact and told him, “Let’s run it back.” He helped connect Folkman with Aptos CEO Avery Ching, with the pair meeting at the White House crypto summit in March. Following this interaction, and without further help from Buzz, World Liberty Financial agreed to list its USD1 stablecoin on Aptos—which was announced in October at Token2049 in Singapore. BREAKING: @DonaldJTrumpJr & @ZachWitkoff just announced that @worldlibertyfi's USD1 is coming to @Aptos as the first Move based deployment. Our teams share a united mission of building the best financial infrastructure for 🇺🇸 and the world. Much more to come… 🦅🌐 https://t.co/DjxBvviJts pic.twitter.com/0P3YfSaY63 — avery.apt 🇺🇸 (@AveryChing) October 1, 2025 But this is just the beginning, Buzz told Decrypt. He intends to continue to leverage his relationship with the World Liberty Financial team to attract “net new buyers” to Aptos, fix its image, and position it as a premium stablecoin network. He went on to hint at bigger potential collaborations to come, although nothing is set in stone. “I think it's very relevant right now because you see chains like Plasma, they’re doing very well. Everyone was talking about them. Now you even have Circle, they’re launching the Tempo blockchain,” Buzz said, referencing the Plasma stablecoin network. “They’re basically doing Libra 2.0 … so the idea is validated. Aptos has the technology, it’s just frustrating that they don’t have the right messaging.” Now officially working for Aptos, Buzz hopes to have a direct hand in fixing this messaging. He also told Decrypt that he has some “bigger goals” which, if he achieves, he will be paid more for. That’s not to mention that he’s requested that he be paid entirely in APT tokens, as a sign of his belief in the network. After making his name by asking people if they’re sidelined, Buzz is finally no longer sidelined himself. “I am trying to community takeover,” Buzz told Decrypt. “That started as a meme, but as it progressed, I’m like, ‘Maybe it's actually possible. Could I actually do this?’,” he said, adding, “This isn’t a joke anymore. I’m actually working on it.” “It’s lookin' good here,” he finished.
