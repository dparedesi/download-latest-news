Investing Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock surged 78% in 2025. KeyBanc upgraded AMD to Overweight with a $270 price target citing 30% upside. AMD’s server CPUs are nearly sold out for 2026. Average selling prices may increase 10% to 15% in Q1. Analyst forecasts AMD AI revenue will reach $14B to $15B in 2026 driven by MI355 and MI455 accelerator shipments. Sending You to Google News in 3 © HelloRF Zcool / Shutterstock.com Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock climbed 78% in 2025, driven by growing adoption of its artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators and expectations for next-generation products. The company’s Instinct MI300 series gained market share in data centers, competing against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). At CES 2026 earlier this month, AMD showcased advancements like the Helios AI platform and previews of future chips, signaling it was continuing to innovate and not rest on its laurels. This morning, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upgraded AMD to Overweight with a $270 per share price target, implying 30% upside from yesterday’s closing price, citing sold-out server CPUs and strong hyperscaler demand. He forecasts at least 50% growth in AMD’s server CPU business and $14 billion to $15 billion in AI revenue for 2026. With these drivers pushing it forward, AMD has significant tailwinds that may propel shares beyond a mere 30% gain. KeyBanc’s note followed an Asia supply-chain trip revealing robust demand for AMD’s AI and data-center products. The firm noted AMD’s server CPUs are nearly sold out for 2026, prompting a potential 10% to 15% increase in average selling prices in the first quarter. This tightness stems from hyperscalers ramping up AI infrastructure investments, who are projected to spend over $600 billion in capital expenditures (capex) in 2026, a 36% increase from 2025, primarily on AI infrastructure. The analyst expects AMD’s server CPU revenue to grow at least 50% year-over-year in 2026, fueled by the EPYC line’s adoption. In Q3, AMD’s fifth-generation Epyc Turin CPUs accounted for over half of all Epyc-related revenue. Similarly, AI-related revenue is forecast to hit $14 billion to $15 billion this year, boosted by shipments of the MI355 accelerator and a major ramp in the MI455-powered Helios platform. Earnings estimates were raised to $4.01 per share for 2025 and $7.93 for 2026, up from prior forecasts. AMD’s valuation justifies the $270 target price, based on 34 times the 2026 earnings estimate. AMD trades at 32 times consensus 2026 earnings, compared to peers at 27 times, reflecting its growth premium. The note also highlights tight memory supply pressuring PCs but benefiting AMD’s margins through a data center shift, aligning with the upgrade the analyst gave for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and indicating overall semiconductor strength. At CES 2026, AMD unveiled the Helios rack-scale platform, integrating 72 Instinct MI455X accelerators, EPYC Venice CPUs on 2 nanometer (nm) Zen 6 architecture, and Pensando Vulcan NICs. This setup delivers up to 3 AI exaflops per rack, targeting trillion-parameter AI model training with high bandwidth and efficiency. Helios matches Nvidia’s NVL72 in scale but emphasizes memory richness and cost-effectiveness through the open source ROCm software stack. The company also previewed the Instinct MI500 series for 2027, built on CDNA 6 architecture with 2nm process and HBM4E memory. It promises up to 1,000 times the AI performance of the MI300X through architectural enhancements, FP4 formats, faster interconnects, and improved memory. These announcements position AMD to challenge Nvidia in AI inference and enterprise deployments, appealing to buyers seeking open standards over proprietary systems. The MI500 series’ projected performance leap addresses escalating AI demands, with global compute capacity expected to reach 10 yottaflops in five years. A yottaflop is one septillion — a 1 followed by 24 zeros — floating-point operations per second. Zen 6 CPUs on 2nm enhance efficiency, supporting data-center expansions. Roadmaps show AMD launching Zen 6 this year and Medusa APUs in 2027, bolstering the PC and embedded markets. Partnerships with OpenAI, Luma AI, and others underscore its ecosystem’s growth. These developments narrow the gap with Nvidia’s 92% market share, potentially capturing more in cost-sensitive segments. AMD’s focus on scalable, efficient AI positions it for gains for years to come as infrastructure spending expands. Analysts maintain a Moderate Buy consensus on AMD, with a consensus price target of $277 per share — higher than even KeyBanc’s target and implying 33% upside. After AMD’s November earnings report, firms like Melius Research, Raymond James, Wells Fargo, and multiple others set targets at $300 or much higher. With strong product demand and next-gen developments like MI500 on the horizon, price targets below $300 will appear quaint in three to five years, meaning you should be buying AMD stock now.
