Title: Lisa Su has built AMD into a $378 billion microchip titan. So why isn't she richer?

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, has built one of the world's most valuable companies and made investors billions — but is barely a billionaire herself. She has delivered a 70-fold increase in her company's stock price during her 11 years in charge, including a 41% surge this week to fresh highs thanks to its OpenAI partnership. The chipmaker's market value has soared to $378 billion, surpassing Home Depot, Bank of America, and Procter & Gamble. Yet Su doesn't rank among the world's 500 richest people, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Forbes puts her net worth at $1.5 billion — less than 1% of the $167 billion fortune of her rival and distant cousin, Jensen Huang, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia. There is one big difference: Huang cofounded Nvidia, while AMD was established in 1969 by a group of engineers who had left Fairchild Semiconductor. One of them, Jerry Sanders, served as CEO until 2002. AMD filings show Su has amassed about 4.7 million shares or a 0.3% stake, worth about $1.1 billion based on the company's stock price ahead of Friday's market open. Her compensation, including salary, bonuses, and stock options, totaled around $31 million last year, per the filings. Su's small ownership stake is the main reason she's not worth more. For comparison, Huang still owns close to a 4% stake in Nvidia, which is worth upward of $160 billion despite significant dilution over the years. Nvidia is also about 12 times larger than AMD, with an unmatched $4.7 trillion market capitalization. Oracle's $847 billion market value is a little over double AMD's figure, but cofounder Larry Ellison owns nearly 41% of the enterprise-software giant — a roughly $350 billion stake that makes him the world's second-wealthiest man after Elon Musk on both Bloomberg and Forbes' rich lists. The difference in size between Su's fortune and theirs underscores that founding a company, and retaining a large stake in it, is the most common path to enormous wealth. Seven of the top 10 people on Bloomberg's list are founders, and another two, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett, shaped their companies, Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway, in their respective images as much as any founder. Steve Ballmer, who joined Microsoft as Bill Gates' assistant in 1980 and later became CEO, is a rare exception because he parlayed a quirk in his contract into a sizable equity stake. AMD stock has almost doubled this year as investors buy into Su's vision of building an AI hardware, software, and services ecosystem. Su isn't likely to crack the top 10 of the rich list soon, but if her shares keep soaring, she could be worth billions more. Jump to

Title: OpenAI’s Strategic Shift: What The AMD And Nvidia Partnerships Signal
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/solrashidi/2025/10/09/openais-strategic-shift-what-the-amd-and-nvidia-partnerships-signal/

BySol Rashidi, Contributor. AMD, Advanced Micro Devices saw a 23.71% surge in its share price this week, driven by a high-profile partnership with OpenAI that could fundamentally reshape the competitive landscape in AI computing infrastructure. The deal, centered around AMD’s graphics processing units (GPUs), will supply OpenAI with an initial 1-gigawatt of computing power beginning in the second half of 2026. What’s interesting about this partnership is, this isn’t just another chip supply agreement—it appears to be a calculated strategic move that gives OpenAI options for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock, a stake potentially worth billions. This announcement comes just two weeks after OpenAI inked a $100 billion equity and data deal with Nvidia. This marks a clear shift in OpenAI’s ambitions to vertically integrate compute, data, and model training at unprecedented scale. According to sources close to the matter, OpenAI will tap AMD’s Instinct MI300X accelerators, which have emerged as viable competitors to Nvidia’s H100 in certain high-throughput AI workloads. The company will gain access to a gigawatt-scale infrastructure footprint by late 2026—a move likely to insulate it from compute shortages that have plagued the AI industry over the past 18 months. While the dollar figure remains undisclosed, the scale of the deal—coupled with the 160 million share option—signals a valuation easily in the multibillion-dollar range. For perspective, AMD’s total market capitalization currently sits north of $180 billion, and the share options represent nearly 9% of the company’s outstanding shares. What this new structure is telling us is OpenAI isn’t just a customer—it’s positioning itself as a strategic partner, if not an indirect stakeholder. The option to own nearly a tenth of AMD gives OpenAI substantial negotiating leverage and aligns both companies’ incentives to optimize AMD’s chips for future GPT models. OpenAI is not a traditional enterprise customer, it appears to be morphing into a power broker within the semiconductor ecosystem through the following avenues: For AMD, the deal is a validation of its long-term strategy to challenge Nvidia’s AI dominance. Its MI300X chips, launched in late 2023, have seen gradual uptake in hyperscale environments. But with OpenAI’s endorsement, AMD now has a marquee customer that could catalyze broader adoption. Expect AMD’s software ecosystem—to receive increased investment, while new benchmarking metrics may emerge to compare GPT training performance across vendors. For Nvidia, the deal is less a loss and more a wake-up call. While it still dominates AI acceleration, OpenAI’s move signals that no vendor is too big to compete with. It’s also a hedge against Nvidia’s own ambitions in AI services and inference, which increasingly overlap with OpenAI’s. For the broader market, this marks a splintering of the AI hardware stack. Rather than standardizing on a single vendor, the next generation of AI firms—spurred by OpenAI’s model—may adopt multi-vendor architectures, mixing AMD, Nvidia, and even custom silicon like Google’s TPUs. The AMD partnership is more than a procurement deal—it’s frankly a masterclass in strategic positioning. OpenAI has quietly built a playbook based on ecosystem control, upstream equity leverage, and industrial-scale deployment, setting the tone for the next phase of AI’s evolution. By aligning itself with both Nvidia and AMD—and demanding favorable terms via options and equity—OpenAI ensures both security and influence over its most critical dependency: compute. In the words of Peter Drucker, “The best way to predict the future is to create it.” OpenAI isn’t waiting for the AI infrastructure to evolve—it appears to be building it, one chip deal at a time.

World shares are mostly higher after US stocks hit records again following a brief stumble MANILA, Philippines -- MANILA, Philippines (AP) — European shares were mixed in early trading while most Asian stocks rose on Thursday after U.S. stocks hit records again following a brief stumble. The futures for S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were both up less than 0.1%, while markets in mainland China gained more than 1% as they reopened following a weeklong holiday. In early European trading, Germany's Dax added 0.2% to 24,634.96 while France's CAC 40 was almost flat at 8,062.13. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.4% to 9,507.00 as sentiments were weighed by banking and housing stocks. Oil prices fell back, then slightly recovered after Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to pause fighting in Gaza so that the remaining hostages there can be freed in the coming days in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The acceptance of elements of a plan put forward by the Trump administration represents the biggest breakthrough in months in the devastating two-year-old war and reduced risks in the volatile region. U.S. benchmark crude added 12 cents to $62.67 per barrel as of Thursday afternoon. Brent crude, the international standard, edged up 12 cents to $66.37 per barrel. Gold shed some of its stellar gains but was still at $4,051.80 per ounce as of Thursday afternoon. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.8%, closing at 48,580.44. Technology giant SoftBank Group surged over 11% after it announced a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index edged down 0.3% to 26,740.37, while the Shanghai Composite index added 1.3% to 3,933.97 in its first trading session since Oct. 1. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged up nearly 0.3% to 8,969.80 while Taiwan's Taiex pared earlier bigger gains, closing 0.9% higher. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, on Thursday reported its third-quarter revenue climbed 30% year-on-year, beating market forecasts. Its shares gained 2.1%. On Wednesday, Wall Street resumed climbing and the price of gold pushed further past $4,000 per ounce. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% to 6,735.72, another record, a day after snapping a seven-day winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged less than 0.1% lower to 46,601.78, while the Nasdaq composite rose 1.1% to its own record of 23,043.38. Trading has been relatively muted recently following the U.S. government’s latest shutdown. The closure is delaying the release of several major economic reports that usually move the market. Stocks have been drifting without them or other signals to change expectations for cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, one of the major reasons the stock market has surged since April. Another force that’s pushed the market to records is the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Advanced Micro Devices jumped another 11.4% to add to its rally from earlier in the week, when it announced an AI-related deal. AMD was the best performing stock in the S&P 500. Right behind was Dell Technologies, which piled more gains onto its own rally from Tuesday, when it talked up its growth opportunities related to AI. Dell rose 9.1%. Poet Technologies climbed 17% and likewise added to its surge from Tuesday, when it said it raised $75 million in investment to accelerate its growth. The company sells high-speed optical engines and other products used in the AI systems market. AI-related stocks have broadly been on a tear. Nvidia has soared nearly 41% so far this year. Oracle is up 73.2% over the same time, while Palantir Technologies has more than doubled with a nearly 143% surge. The performances have been so strong that criticism is rising about prices having gone too far, like they did during the 2000 dot-com mania. That bubble ultimately imploded, and the S&P 500 halved in value. In other dealings early Thursday, the U.S. dollar rose to 152.75 Japanese yen from 152.70 yen. The euro fell to $1.1617 from $1.1629. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

An AI chipmaker's stock extended its rally in the wake of a major artificial intelligence deal. Meanwhile, the latest salvo in an escalating competition between credit score providers weighed on one of the industry's big players. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.1% to set fresh closing highs, bolstered by gains in the tech sector and minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting suggesting the central bank could be on track toward more interest-rate cuts this year. The Dow was little changed. Find Investopedia's full daily market recap here. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares posted the day's best performance in the S&P 500 index with a nearly 12% jump, extending their winning streak following the announcement of a partnership with OpenAI. A slew of analysts have raised their price targets for AMD this week, with Jefferies upgrading its rating to "buy" from "hold." Dell Technologies (DELL) shares surged 9.1%, after the server maker raised its outlook, citing strong demand driven by the buildout of AI infrastructure. CEO Michael Dell said the company's broad portfolio of tech products makes it well positioned to provide the compute, storage, and network capacity necessary to deploy AI at scale. Optimism around AI helped boost other companies with exposure to the burgeoning technology as well. Shares of AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA) rose about 2% after CEO Jensen Huang said in a televised interview with CNBC that AI demand is up "substantially" this year, and that he expects it to keep growing. Equifax (EFX) announced it will provide its VantageScore 4.0 credit scores at a reduced price or free to customers, just days after Fair Isaac (FICO) said last week that it would offer its FICO credit scores directly to firms that provide credit reports to lenders, reducing reliance on Equifax and the other nationwide credit bureaus. Fair Isaac shares dropped nearly 10%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock Wednesday and reversing a portion of the gains posted after last week's announcement, while Equifax shares advanced close to 1%. Live Nation (LYV) shares fell 3.4% after the Ticketmaster parent announced a plan to offer $1.3 billion in convertible senior notes maturing in 2031. The live entertainment company intends to use the proceeds of the transaction to redeem senior notes due in 2026, repay other debt, and for general corporate purposes.

Major U.S. equities indexes climbed Wednesday as enthusiasm for artificial intelligence stocks boosted the tech sector. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all gained. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose after CEO Jensen Huang said in a televised interview with CNBC that AI demand is up "substantially" this year, and that he expects it to grow further. Shares of rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led gains on the S&P 500, adding to their recent rally in the wake of a deal with OpenAI. Dell Technology (DELL) also jumped, after the server maker reported yesterday that it sees a “massive” growth opportunity in AI as it raised its outlook. AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) shares soared to a record high as the provider of space-based cellphone service and Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed on a partnership to offer direct-to-customer broadband service across the continental U.S. Credit score data provider Fair Isaac (FICO) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after score reporter Equifax (EFX) slashed prices in response to Fair Isaac providing its information directly to firms that give credit reports to mortgage companies. Equifax shares advanced. DaVita (DVA) shares declined as Barclays lowered its price target for the kidney dialysis service provider's stock, pointing to a cyberattack that disrupted operations in August. Gold prices high a fresh high, and oil futures climbed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped. The U.S. dollar was higher versus the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded lower.

Investors are excited about OpenAI’s expansion driving big gains in technology stocks, but a rising number of Wall Street pros fear that the wild pops that add tens of billions of dollars in value in mere minutes are signaling an unhealthy market reminiscent of the dot-com era. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. took this rocket ride on Monday, as the company’s stock soared, briefly boosting its market capitalization by roughly $100 billion at an intraday high, after the chipmaker signed a deal with OpenAI that could lead to billions of dollars in revenue. AMD’s shares extended gains into a second day, rising as much as 7.5% in early trading on Tuesday. This follows a 36% jump in Oracle Corp. shares last month, which added $255 billion to the software firm’s market value in a single session, after it gave blockbuster guidance for its cloud business, including an agreement with the ChatGPT operator worth $300 billion over five years. “If any one of these deals falls through it has this domino effect downstream that I think is concerning,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management Inc., which has about $12 billion in assets. “It reminds me of what happened with telecom back in the mid-nineties.” The moves come amid growing concern about a bubble forming around artificial intelligence as the key players — namely Nvidia Corp. and OpenAI — pledge billions of dollars in deals with a cohort of companies making infrastructure for the technology. As more money is spent, there’s mounting fear that the trend will end in a crash the way it did 25 years ago following the dot-com euphoria, when heavy investments were made in anticipation of internet traffic that took much longer to materialize. An unwinding could be even more painful today, as the top tech stocks account for roughly 35% of the S&P 500 Index, compared with less than 15% in 1999. “The market is pricing these deals as if everyone who transacts with OpenAI will be a winner,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading. “OpenAI is a negative cash flow company and has nothing to lose by signing these deals. Investors should be more discerning. But this is a buy-first, ask-questions-later environment.” Hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones said the current backdrop reminds him of the dot-com bubble in an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box on Monday. “All the ingredients are in place for some kind of a blow off,” he said. “Will it happen again? History rhymes a lot, so I would think some version of it is going to happen again,” adding that this environment is “more potentially explosive than 1999.” One of the big concerns about the deals is their circular capital structures, with the companies using each other’s money to buy each other’s products, Mulberry said. In addition, the scale of the stock market moves for such large companies is alarming, he said. These are companies with “very large mature balance sheets that are participating in these types of rallies,” Mulberry said. “That is unusual, and it does cause a little bit of reflection.” To be sure, AMD’s climb may be justified because the OpenAI deal signifies a major step in its progress with graphics processing units, or GPUs, where it competes for market share with Nvidia. Wall Street analysts covering AMD generally cheered the news. “This agreement fundamentally shifts how the industry will view AMD’s competitive position going forward,” Benchmark analyst Cody Acree wrote in a note to clients on Monday, boosting the firm’s price target to $270 from $210. “Beyond the obvious revenue and earning accretion of the agreement, we believe this announcement is a ringing endorsement of AMD’s increasingly competitive position as a viable technical alternative to Nvidia’s AI GPU dominance.” Still, having multiple large technology stocks surge by double-digits in quick succession could be a sign that valuations have become disconnected from underlying fundamentals, and that investors are buying primarily based on the fear of missing out on further gains. “The price discovery is actually pretty scary,” Ted Mortonson, a technology strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co., said after Oracle’s pop. A company that large, gaining so much market value that rapidly is “not good and normal,” he added. “I would call it a part of the exuberance bundle.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares rose Tuesday after soaring yesterday to a 19-month high on news that the chip designer and ChatGPT maker OpenAI have inked a multi-year supply deal. Under the agreement, OpenAI is committing to buying several generations of AI chips from AMD in a long-term deal that could see it take a 10% stake in the Nvidia (NVDA) rival. AMD said it anticipates the ripple effect of the deal to net it more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers. AMD shares, which jumped 24% on Monday, were up more than 5% at around $215 in recent trading, putting the stock on pace for a record closing high. The stock is up 77% since the start of the year, handily outpacing Nvidia’s 40% return over the same period. Below, we take a closer look at AMD’s weekly chart and apply technical analysis to identify critical price levels worth watching out for. AMD shares staged a dramatic breakout from an inverse head and shoulders pattern on Monday, laying the groundwork for follow-through buying. While the surge coincided with the relative strength index crossing into overbought territory, the indicator remains below peaks that preceded drawdowns in November 2021 and March 2024. However, the stock closed near its low for the day yesterday, indicating a short-term over-extension. Let’s point out two critical overhead areas to watch on AMD’s chart if the shares continue their bullish run and also identify support levels worth monitoring during potential pullbacks. If the chipmaker’s shares regain their upward momentum, investors should initially keep track of the $227 area. This location on the chart would likely attract significant attention near Monday's high, which coincidently sits just below the stock’s record intraday high set in March last year. Investors can project an overhead area to watch above the stock’s all-time high by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to forecast future price movements. When applying the study to AMD’s chart, we calculate the distance from the inverse head and shoulders’ head to neckline in points and add that amount to the pattern’s neckline. For example, adding $98 to $174 projects a bullish target of $272, about 34% above Monday's closing price. During retracements, it’s worth watching for a potential fill of yesterday's stock gap down to around $174. Investors would likely see this as a high probability buying area near the inverse head and shoulders’ neckline, which could flip from prior resistance to future support. Finally, a steeper pullback would open the door to a retest of the $150 level. This area on the chart could provide support near the inverse head and shoulders’ two shoulders, which closely align with the December 2023 high.

Title: OpenAI’s Windows Play

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: OpenAI’s flood of announcements are getting hard to keep up with. A selection — not exhaustive! — from just the last month: The last two announcements just dropped yesterday, and actually bring clarity and coherence to the entire list. In short, OpenAI is making a play to be the Windows of AI. For nearly two decades smartphones, and in particular iOS, have been the touchstones in terms of discussing platforms. It’s important to note, however, that while Apple’s strategy of integrating hardware and software was immensely profitable, it entailed leaving the door open for a competing platform to emerge. The challenge of being a hardware company is that by virtue of needing to actually create devices you can’t serve everyone; Apple in particular didn’t have the capacity or desire to go downmarket, which created the opportunity for Android to not only establish a competing platform but to actually significantly exceed iOS in market share. That means that if we want a historical analogy for total platform dominance — which increasingly appears to be OpenAI’s goal — we have to go back further to the PC era and Windows. Before there was Windows there was DOS; before DOS, however, there was a fast-talking deal-making entrepreneur named Bill Gates. From The Truth About Windows Versus the Mac: In the late 1970s and very early 1980s, a new breed of personal computers were appearing on the scene, including the Commodore, MITS Altair, Apple II, and more. Some employees were bringing them into the workplace, which major corporations found unacceptable, so IT departments asked IBM for something similar. After all, “No one ever got fired for buying IBM.” IBM spun up a separate team in Florida to put together something they could sell IT departments. Pressed for time, the Florida team put together a minicomputer using mostly off-the shelf components; IBM’s RISC processors and the OS they had under development were technically superior, but Intel had a CISC processor for sale immediately, and a new company called Microsoft said their OS — DOS, which they acquired from another company — could be ready in six months. For the sake of expediency, IBM decided to go with Intel and Microsoft. The rest, as they say, is history. The demand from corporations for IBM PCs was overwhelming, and DOS — and applications written for it — became entrenched. By the time the Mac appeared in 1984, the die had long since been cast. Ultimately, it would take Microsoft a decade to approach the Mac’s ease-of-use, but Windows’ DOS underpinnings and associated application library meant the Microsoft position was secure regardless. There is nothing like IBM and its dominant position in enterprise today; rather, the route to becoming a platform is to first be a massively popular product. Acquiring developers and users is not a chicken-and-egg problem: it is clear that you must get users first, which attracts developers, enhancing your platform in a virtuous cycle; to put it another way, first a product must Aggregate users and then it gets developers for free. ChatGPT is exactly that sort of product, and at yesterday’s DevDay 2025 keynote CEO Sam Altman and team demonstrated exactly that sort of pull; from The Verge: OpenAI is introducing a way to work with apps right inside ChatGPT. The idea is that, from within a conversation with the chatbot, you can essentially tag in apps to help you complete a task while ChatGPT offers context and advice. The company showed off a few different ways this can work. In a live demo, an OpenAI employee launched ChatGPT and then asked Canva to create a poster of a name for a dog-walking business; after a bit of waiting, Canva came back with a few different examples, and the presenter followed up by asking for a generated pitch deck based on the poster. The employee also asked Zillow via ChatGPT to show homes for sale in Pittsburgh, and it created an interactive Zillow map — which the employee then asked follow-up questions about. Apps available inside ChatGPT starting today will include Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow. In the “weeks ahead,” OpenAI will add more apps, such as DoorDash, OpenTable, Target, and Uber. OpenAI recently started allowing ChatGPT users to make purchases on Etsy through the chatbot, part of its overall push to integrate it with the rest of the web. It’s fair to wonder if these app experiences will measure up to these company’s self-built apps or websites, just as there are questions about just how well the company’s Instant Checkout will convert; what is notable, however, is that I disagree that this represents a “push to integrate…with the rest of the web”. This is the opposite: this is a push to make ChatGPT the operating system of the future. Apps won’t be on your phone or in a browser; they’ll be in ChatGPT, and if they aren’t, they simply will not exist for ChatGPT users. That, by extension, means the burden of making these integrations work — and those conversions performant — will be on third party developers, not OpenAI. This is the power that comes from owning users, and OpenAI is flexing that power in a major way. There is a second aspect to the IBM PC strategy, and that is the role of AMD. From a 2024 Update: While IBM chose Intel to provide the PC’s processor, they were wary of being reliant on a single supplier (it’s notable that IBM didn’t demand the same of the operating system, which was probably a combination of not fully appreciating operating systems as a point of integration and lock-in for 3rd-party software, which barely existed at that point, and a recognition that software is just bits and not a physical good that has to be manufactured). To that end IBM demanded that Intel license its processor to another chip firm, and AMD was the obvious choice: the firm was founded by Jerry Sanders, a Fairchild Semiconductor alum who had worked with Intel’s founders, and specialized in manufacturing licensed chips. The relationship between Intel and AMD ended up being incredibly fraught and largely documented by endless lawsuits (you can read a brief history in that Update); the key point to understand, however, is that (1) IBM wanted to have dual suppliers to avoid being captive to an essential component provider and (2) IBM had the power to make that happen because they had the customers who were going to provide Intel so much volume. The true beneficiary of IBM’s foresight, of course, was Microsoft, which controlled the operating system; IBM’s mandate is why it is appropriate that “Windows” comes first in the “Wintel” characterization of the PC era. Intel reaped tremendous profits from its position in the PC value chain, but more value accrued to Microsoft than anyone else. This question of who will capture the most profit from the AI value chain remains an open one. There’s no question that the early winner is Nvidia: the company has become the most valuable in the world by virtue of its combination of best-in-class GPUs, superior networking, and CUDA software layer that locks people into Nvidia’s own platform. And, as long as power is the limiting factor, Nvidia is well-placed to maintain its position. What Nvidia is not shy about is capturing its share of value, and that is a powerful incentive for other companies in the value chain to look for alternatives. Google is the furthest along in this regard thanks to its decade-old investment in TPUs, while Amazon is seeking to mimic their strategy with Trainium; Microsoft and Meta are both working to design and build their own chips, and Apple is upscaling Apple Silicon for use in the data center. Once again, however, the most obvious and most immediately available alternative to Nvidia is AMD, and I think the parallels between yesterday’s announcement of an OpenAI-AMD deal and IBM’s strong-arming of Intel are very clear; from the Wall Street Journal: OpenAI and chip-designer Advanced Micro Devices announced a multibillion-dollar partnership to collaborate on AI data centers that will run on AMD processors, one of the most direct challenges yet to industry leader Nvidia. Under the terms of the deal, OpenAI committed to purchasing 6 gigawatts worth of AMD’s chips, starting with the MI450 chip next year. The ChatGPT maker will buy the chips either directly or through its cloud computing partners. AMD chief Lisa Su said in an interview Sunday that the deal would result in tens of billions of dollars in new revenue for the chip company over the next half-decade. The two companies didn’t disclose the plan’s expected overall cost, but AMD said it costs tens of billions of dollars per gigawatt of computing capacity. OpenAI will receive warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares, roughly 10% of the chip company, at 1 cent per share, awarded in phases, if OpenAI hits certain milestones for deployment. AMD’s stock price also has to increase for the warrants to be exercised. If OpenAI is the software layer that matters to the ecosystem, then Nvidia’s long-term pricing power will be diminished; the company, like Intel, may still take the lion’s share of chip profits through sheer performance and low-level lock-in, but I believe the most important reason OpenAI is making this deal is to lock in its own dominant position in the stack. It is pretty notable that this announcement comes only weeks after Nvidia’s investment in OpenAI; that, though, is another affirmation that the company who has the users has the ultimate power. There is one other part of the stack to keep an eye on: TSMC. Both Nvidia and AMD make their chips with the Taiwanese giant, and while TSMC is famously reticent to take price, they are positioned to do so in the long run. Altman surely knows this as well, which means that I wouldn’t be surprised if there is an Intel announcement sooner rather than later; maybe there is fire to that recent smoke about AMD talking with Intel? When I started writing Stratechery, Windows was a platform in decline, superceded by mobile and, surprisingly enough, increasingly challenged by its all-but-vanquished ancient foe, the Mac. To that end, one of my first pieces about Microsoft was about then-CEO Steve Ballmer’s misguided attempt to focus on devices instead of services. I wrote a few years later in Microsoft’s Monopoly Hangover: The truth is that both [IBM and Microsoft] were victims of their own monopolistic success: Windows, like the System/360 before it, was a platform that enabled Microsoft to make money in all directions. Both companies made money on the device itself and by selling many of the most important apps (and in the case of Microsoft, back-room services) that ran on it. There was no need to distinguish between a vertical strategy, in which apps and services served to differentiate the device, or a horizontal one, in which the device served to provide access to apps and services. When you are a monopoly, the answer to strategic choices can always be “Yes.” Microsoft at that point in time no longer had that luxury: the company needed to make a choice — the days of doing everything were over — and that choice should be services (which is exactly what Satya Nadella did). Ever since the emergence of ChatGPT made OpenAI The Accidental Consumer Tech Company I have been making similar arguments about OpenAI: they need to focus on the consumer opportunity and leave the enterprise API market to Microsoft. Not only would focus help the company capture the consumer opportunity, there was the opportunity cost of GPUs used for the API that couldn’t be used to deliver consumers a better experience across every tier. I now have much more appreciation for OpenAI’s insistence on doing it all, for two reasons. First, this is a company in pure growth mode, not in decline. Tradeoffs are in the long run inevitable, but why make them before you need to? It would have been a mistake for Microsoft to restrict Windows to only the enterprise in the 1980s, even if the company had to low-key retreat from the consumer market over the last fifteen years; there was a lot of money to make before that retreat needed to happen! OpenAI, meanwhile, is the hottest brand in AI, so why not make a play to own it all, from consumer touchpoint to API to everything in-between? Second, we’ve obviously crossed the line into bubble territory, which always was inevitable. The question now is whether or not this is a productive bubble: what durable infrastructure will be built by eventually bankrupt companies that we benefit from for years to come? GPUs are not that durable infrastructure; data centers are more long-lasting, but not worth the financial pain of a bubble burst. The real payoff would be a massive build-out in power generation, which would be a benefit for the next half a century. Another potential payoff would be the renewed viability of Intel, and as I noted above, OpenAI may be uniquely positioned and motivated to make that happen. More broadly, this play to be the Windows of AI effectively positions OpenAI as the linchpin of the entire AI buildout. Just look at what the mere announcement of partnerships with OpenAI has done for the stocks of Oracle and AMD. OpenAI is creating the conditions such that it is the primary manifestation of the AI bubble, which ensures the company is the primary beneficiary of all of the speculative capital flooding into the space. Were the company more focused, as I have previously advised, they may not have the leverage to get enough funding to meet those more modest (but still incredible) goals; now it’s hard to see them not getting whatever money they want, at least until the bubble bursts. What’s amazing about this overview is that I only scratched the surface of what OpenAI announced both yesterday and over the last month — and I haven’t even mentioned Sora (although I covered that topic yesterday). What the company is seeking to achieve is incredibly audacious, but also logical, and something we’ve seen before: And, interestingly enough, there is an Apple to OpenAI’s Microsoft: it’s Google, with their fully integrated stack, from chips to data centers to models to end user distribution channels. Instead of taking on a menagerie of competitors, however, Google is facing an increasingly unified ecosystem, organized, whether they wish to be or not, around OpenAI. Such is the power of aggregating demand and the phenomenon that is ChatGPT. Get notified about new Articles Please verify your email address to proceed.

Hello there. Now, you’ll say… “you’re like a broken record, you’ve been saying the same things will happen this winter.” What can I do? I’ll say it again: the best is yet to come. And it all started yesterday with Alexis Tsipras announcing his departure from SYRIZA, heading “for new seas,” as he put it — which, translated, means a new party. Or something like that, since lately I’ve been hearing talk of an “electoral alliance of personalities,” Macron-style, though I’m not entirely convinced. I tried teasing my first-class source in the political world by saying “does this ‘new seas’ line hint at…?” But they laughed and replied, “Stop the provocations. Alexis is addressing his old comrades — we’ve been through this. We’re not joining forces with businessmen; no offense, but we’ll keep our independence.” Reactions… Let’s be honest: our leader, the great helmsman Alexis, never goes unnoticed. I’m probably the only one who didn’t issue a statement to attack him. Of course, New Democracy did, PASOK did — and its various warlords individually — as did all the former comrades, who accuse him of causing a split. As if the original “First Time Left” (SYRIZA) hadn’t already fragmented into ten pieces — it’s Tsipras making one more that bothers them. The only one who remained gracious (by nature, anyway) was also the most directly affected: Sokratis Famellos, whose party Tsipras just left. He almost apologized to Tsipras — the man who left SYRIZA! The sauerkraut and the oracle of a new party Let me remind you that last week Tsipras, still as an MP, participated in the work of the Council of Europe. The mixed parliamentary delegation posted a “family photo” from a dinner held at the ambassador’s residence. In the picture, the former PM was surrounded by Dora Bakoyannis, Theodoros Roussopoulos, George Papandreou, Evripidis Stylianidis, Yiannis Oikonomou, Dimitris Markopoulos, Giorgos Stamatis, Dimitris Mantzos and Nefeli Chatziioannidou. I asked some of those present whether — between the tarte aux oignons (onion tart), choucroute garnie (sauerkraut with cured meats), and fine, fruity Alsatian Gewürztraminer — he confided anything about his intentions. The answer was no. They did say, however, that he seemed generally disenchanted with SYRIZA. But they passed on one comment of his that I found revealing. When asked whether he plans to found a party, he said: “A former prime minister starts a party only to become prime minister again.” Why now… Readers ask why he rushed to leave now — does it mean the party launch is coming earlier than the new year? The answer I got was: “He didn’t want to attend Parliament’s opening blessing ceremony as a SYRIZA MP.” Personally, I believe he also wants to be “set up” early, because founding a new party — especially on the Left — is no easy task. (Not that the Right is overflowing with talent either…) The reservoirs… Several opinion polls are currently measuring the potential impact of new parties in formation. In Tsipras’s case, one recent poll found that over 19% of respondents were either certain or inclined to vote for him (8% were solid). Where would Tsipras’s support come from? Roughly, two-thirds of SYRIZA’s 2024 European election voters, 40% of the New Left voters, 19+% from Plefsi Eleftherias (Course of Freedom), 13% from KKE (Communist Party) and almost 10% from PASOK. Of course, polls are one thing, ballot boxes another… The people of Amalias Street… Tsipras is said to be conducting a thorough screening of potential figures to join his new party. He’s reportedly not eager to rely on current SYRIZA MPs as a base. Later on, when it’s time to compile electoral lists, he will likely include some — under conditions. At his offices on Amalias Avenue, a core team of close associates is in constant contact with him. They include: Michalis Kalogirou (longtime director), Vangelis Kalpadakis (splits his time between Athens and Vienna), Giorgos Chouliarakis and Dimitris Liakos (economic team), Giorgos Vasiliadis (in charge of scouting people). What Maximos Mansion is saying “This is an opportunity for people to remember who Tsipras is, but for us, he’s not the benchmark,” a source from the Maximos Mansion (Prime Minister’s Office) told me about Tsipras’s new venture. Government spokesperson Marinakis reportedly made a jab at Tsipras’s “new seas” phrase, saying “last time, we needed life vests” — but that’s not their official strategy. Obviously, Maximos isn’t going to pretend he doesn’t exist. They’ll keep reminding voters of his record. But based on their research, they believe they shouldn’t revive the Mitsotakis–Tsipras two-party dynamic — that was settled for many voters in the 2023 elections, apart from perhaps ND’s hardcore base. Meeting on special spatial planning Meanwhile, meetings upon meetings are held daily at Maximos on various central issues. Following yesterday’s meeting on water — focusing on urgent interventions needed to prevent Attica from running out in 1.5 years — today’s discussion will concern special spatial plans. Participants include K.M., Hatzidakis, Papastavrou-Tagaras from the Environment Ministry. The goal is to finalize special spatial plans for renewable energy and tourism by year’s end, though significant pending issues remain for industry, mineral resources, aquaculture, and more. The Saudi Arabian Minister’s Visits and Meetings Since yesterday, the Saudi Arabian Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources, Bandar bin Ibrahim Al-Khorayef, has been in Greece. He met with Theodorikakos and Papastavrou, while the Minister of Development took him in the afternoon to the Elefsina Shipyards, as Greece is interested in bringing the Saudis into the equation and securing orders for the shipyard. Particularly noteworthy is the breakfast that Theodorikakos is organizing for him today with representatives of the largest Greek companies from the industrial, energy, construction, and other sectors. The Saudi minister controls several hundred billion, so it’s best not to miss these kinds of opportunities… Petralias’s “Glass” Yesterday, after the conclusion of the statements regarding the submission of the draft Budget, Pierr (likely referring to the Finance Minister) smilingly said in a small informal press chat about Petralias:“Some see the glass half full, some half empty. Thanos sees it twice as big,” acknowledging the role of the Deputy Minister, who shapes the final form of economic policy. Let’s not forget, after all, that Pierrakakis and Petralias are the “architects” both of the rent rebate announced at Easter and to be implemented in November, and of the Thessaloniki International Fair measures aimed at supporting the middle class and addressing the demographic issue. Negotiations for Two Organic Product Companies Leaving aside the concerns the French situation is causing in the markets, let’s turn to the microcosm of the Greek market, starting with the increased activity surrounding organic product companies. According to market sources, two separate negotiation cases are underway involving two different funds. Neither deal is guaranteed to close, though the one that seems more advanced is Bioagros’s talks with Halcyon Capital, currently at the due diligence stage — which means nothing is finalized yet.On a related note about food, I hear it’s only a matter of days before the acquisition of Kritikos by Masoutis is formally concluded. Euronext’s Plan for the Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX) Interesting details emerge from the information memorandum regarding Euronext’s public offer for the Athens Stock Exchange. The memorandum has been published, and any investor visiting Euronext’s website section dedicated to the public offer will experience a kind of “cultural shock” at how direct and clear the information is: it lays out the key facts shareholders need to know, provides step-by-step acceptance instructions, an FAQ section, and more. Now to the essence: Euronext’s plan for the Athens Exchange is to integrate it into its platform and turn it into a hub for company listings from the broader Southeastern European region, under the name “Euronext Athens.” A key role is played by its technological infrastructure — specifically, Euronext’s unified trading, clearing, and post-trading platform — which is planned to be incorporated into the Greek exchange. Euronext expects to achieve annual cash synergies (run rate) of €12 million by the end of 2028, mainly through migrating the Greek trading market to the Optiq platform and harmonizing core functions. The transition of ATHEX’s systems to the unified platform is planned for 2027. Additionally: The CEO of ATHEX will be proposed as a member of the Board of Directors of Euronext N.V. An independent representative of the Greek financial ecosystem will be proposed to join the Euronext Supervisory Board at the 2026 Annual General Meeting. The Hellenic Capital Market Commission will remain the main supervisory authority for Greek markets and will be invited to join Euronext’s College of Supervisors, participating in the overall supervision of the Euronext Group. Key Points of the Public Offer The acceptance period will last six weeks, until November 17. The exchange ratio is twenty ATHEX shares for one Euronext share. Based on the timetable, and provided there are no changes, the new shares to be issued (the exchange shares) will start trading on Euronext markets on November 24. The total number of exchange shares issued will depend on how many ATHEX shares are finally tendered in the public offer or, if applicable, acquired through the squeeze-out and sell-out rights should the process reach that stage. The information memorandum states that G. Chatzinikolaou and G. Kontopoulos have committed to tender their shares (15,000 and 95,000 respectively). Formally, the offer will be valid if shareholders holding at least 38.76 million shares, or 67% of ATHEX’s total shares, accept it. However, Euronext can consider the offer successful even with 33%, since it has the right, e.g., five days before the end of the offer, to lower the required threshold. An important factor in the public offer is that as of the end of June, ATHEX itself held 2.5 million treasury shares, corresponding to 4.14% of its share capital. Deutsche Bank is acting as Euronext’s advisor, and Eurobank is the offer’s manager. In the banking brokerages…they’ve seen it all The above concerns are essentially about the public offer but refer to the official framework for how Euronext will proceed. What is more interesting, however, is what is happening behind the scenes, with the Dark Room offering mental support especially to the staff of the banking brokerage firms… who have seen it all. What preparations they are making, what methods they are inventing so that their clients can easily open foreign accounts in order to receive the Euronext shares, what informational and other types of emails they are sending, etc. etc. In the banking mutual fund management companies (AEDAK), I imagine there will not be similar mobilization, as only one decision is needed, but the pressure there is also strongly felt. From the side of those who support Euronext’s move, the estimates regarding the outcome of the offer are that it is not considered a done deal, but if the bar is lowered to 51%, it has good chances. On the opposite side, the… unruly ones disagree due to the large participation of private investors in the Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) shareholding structure, and argue that the offer will struggle to gather 50%. Who is right will be revealed on November 17 (note: what a day they picked, too!). The two shipowners who support the Chinese shipyards Despite Washington’s intense pressure to impose duties on Chinese-built ships docking at American ports, China continues to hold the lead. More than 50% of new global ship orders are directed to Chinese shipyards. This percentage soared during the summer months of 2025: 65% in June and 84% in August. Despite US–China tensions, China’s shipbuilding industry is being supported by new orders from major shipowners, such as George Procopiou and the Norwegian John Fredriksen. G.P.’s Dynacom owns the largest tanker fleet on order in the world, with 55 tankers under construction. If the orders from other companies in the group — bulkers and gas carriers — are added, the total number of ships under construction reaches 83. The (double) vote of the chairman And since the subject came up, let me add that G. Procopiou leaves nothing to chance. This is also confirmed by a very recent amendment to the Articles of Association of “Astir Palace M.A.X.E.”, which owns the Astir Vouliagmeni complex. It should be noted that this complex passed into the hands of G. Procopiou at the beginning of the year, with him taking over as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Last week, the amendment of Article 25 of Astir Palace’s Articles of Association was uploaded to the General Commercial Registry (G.E.MI.). This article sets out the provisions regarding member representation, quorum, and majority for the operation of the Board of Directors. According to the Articles of Association, “the company is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of 3 to 15 directors,” while currently the members are 5: G. Procopiou (Chairman), D. Lampropoulos (Vice Chairman), H. Pavlou (CEO), P. Kassi­dokostas–Latsis (Member), and K. Mitsios (Member). Article 25, which regulates issues of majority, previously provided that “the decisions of the Board of Directors are validly taken by an absolute majority of the directors who are present and those represented.” With the said amendment, however, it was added that “in the event of a tie, the Chairman’s vote prevails.” It is self-evident that the opinion of the owner and Chairman carries decisive weight, but in this case, this “advantage” was also enshrined in the Articles of Association. Greece at the critical IMF Summit The submission of the 2026 Draft Budget will be the strong card of the Greek government delegation, which, a week from today, will travel to Washington for the IMF and World Bank Annual Fall Meetings. Strong growth rates, fiscal discipline, a spectacular reduction of Public Debt, and reforms will be the key arguments of Finance Minister K. Pierrakakis, Michalis Argyrou (head of the Prime Minister’s Economic Office), and Dimitris Tsakonas of the Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA). At a time when Sovereign Debts have skyrocketed to record levels and two-thirds of the discussions in Washington concern their management, the Greek side will be a useful, positive example. The Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable has announced it will publish a “playbook” for more predictable and faster sovereign debt restructuring procedures, combined with institutional reforms on the role of international financial institutions in supporting countries’ recovery. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva will deliver her key speech on October 8 at the Milken Institute, while the official Plenary Session will be held on October 17. The stockbroker with the blue Porsche who gives advice via TikTok Times have changed. The Stock Exchange is no longer a taboo. Social media have firmly entered our lives. This is exactly what Mr. Socrates Ch. of Platon seems to believe, who travels with his blue Porsche between Monaco and Luxembourg, and incidentally also gives investment advice. With humor, ease, and confidence, he declares on TikTok which stocks will perform well, what are “the games of the market” at the moment, and he shares — for free, of course — his knowledge with the audience that follows him. In his most recent analysis, he mentioned “the surprise of ELTON Chemicals” as a “hidden card,” which, however, did not work out for him yesterday — just like ONYX — but there is always time for improvement. Drop with low turnover and a pretext from France It didn’t have the strength to reach higher levels, it didn’t have the mood for a major correction, but it found a “golden pretext” in the developments of French political life, which certainly affect the entire Eurozone, to stop and take a breather. The positive start of the General Index lasted only 10 minutes; it didn’t continue, since the European Stock Exchanges started “in the red” as soon as the resignation of the French prime minister was announced. But when the European markets limited their losses, Athens continued downwards, mainly because it didn’t feel like putting up any resistance. The General Index started at 2,082.37 points (+0.30%) and then dropped to 2,049.59 points (–1.31%). It ended the session at 2,053.08 points (–1.14%). The value of transactions remained at €188.2 million, of which €22.08 million were in blocks, because most transactions took place in “heavyweight” stocks. Worth noting is the move by Coca Cola HBC (+0.52% at €38.5), which after a long time contributed positively to the General Index with trades worth €4.45 million. With transactions worth €28.9 million, Piraeus fell to €7.26 (–2.76%) after the announcement of a €600 million AT1 bond issue, convertible into shares. National Bank (–1.25% at €13.07), Alpha (–1.33% at €3.70), and Eurobank (–0.97% at €3.482) reflect the climate of yesterday’s session, affecting the rest of the banking stocks as well. Intralot (€1.178, –4.23%), after the success of its public offering, rushed to meet the capital increase price (€1.11). The autonomous course of Viohalco’s shares The shares of the Viohalco Group kept their distance from the nervousness and the generally poor picture presented yesterday by the Greek stock market. With the majority of stocks “in the red,” Viohalco, ElvalHalcor, and Cenergy Holdings were bright exceptions, continuing their trajectory at levels of historic or multi-year highs. VIO took a decisive step toward conquering €8 for the first time, with its capitalization now exceeding €2 billion. Over the last three days, it has “run” a rally of 7.1%, and this year it has strengthened by 46.5%. A buying party took place in ELHA, which was the blue chip with the strongest rise. With a 4.4% jump, it closed at €3.06, reaching €3.08 at the day’s highs. This is the best close in more than 17 years, specifically since early January 2008. CENER followed with a smaller rise, but it was enough not only to renew its all-time high but also to reach the peak of €13. Over the last five days, it has seen only positive signs, posting cumulative gains of around 8.65%. Its market capitalization stands at €2.77 billion, trailing Titan (€2.86 billion) and Motor Oil (€2.88 billion). The shipowners renovate After many years, the Union of Greek Shipowners is proceeding with a substantial renovation of its privately owned offices in Piraeus. Works are underway for a complete refurbishment, with the goal of being ready before the celebration of world shipping — Posidonia — next June. The modernization of the offices includes everything from infrastructure and energy upgrades to the creation of modern, technologically updated workspaces. Until the works are completed, the UGS has moved its services to other offices on Akti Miaouli. Geneva calling In the glamorous Bâtiment des Forces Motrices hall in Geneva, Kriton Lentoudis of Evalend Shipping was honored as “Shipowner of the Year.” Upon receiving his award, he called on the Greek shipping community to stand “on par with other maritime centers” and to more actively support the work of Mercy Ships — the hospital ships that provide surgical care in poor African countries. Every AI deal sends stocks soaring Late the night before last, New York time, it was announced that OpenAI — the company that brought ChatGPT into our lives — will acquire 10% of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and will develop up to 6 GW of AMD Instinct graphics processors, starting with 1 GigaWatt in 2026. To get a sense of the scale, 1 GigaWatt is enough to power hundreds of thousands of advanced computers simultaneously. This infrastructure is necessary for training the next generations of artificial intelligence. Immediately after the announcement, AMD’s share price skyrocketed by +25%, from $165 to $207.35 in a single session. OpenAI will participate as an early design partner in the development of AMD’s next GPU, the MI450. This move breaks Nvidia’s monopoly in the AI processor market. Nvidia had dominated with over 90% market share in AI chips, but AMD — now supported by OpenAI — becomes a serious competitor. The war has just begun. Hydrogen is changing the construction sector in Britain It is the first attempt. It didn’t take place in a scientific laboratory, but on a real construction site. And it changes all the cost parameters. A huge excavator, a JCB machine, will run not on diesel but on hydrogen. It has already started work at the Lower Thames Crossing — a £10 billion project connecting Kent with Essex. It marks a silent revolution in the construction sector. The excavator is already saving 1.1 tons of CO₂ per month. In Britain, plans are already being developed to completely eliminate oil from construction sites by 2027. The construction industry represents 39% of global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, with heavy vehicles and machinery consuming vast amounts of diesel. The Lower Thames Crossing serves as a testing ground for a new, “green” way of building: low-emission steel, improved concrete methods, and the largest supply of green hydrogen ever made in the UK. Experience so far shows that hydrogen can indeed power heavy equipment under real-world conditions. If the model succeeds, Europe will have a real blueprint for how to build infrastructure without burning its future. Explore related questions
