Title: Why AMD Stock Jumped 50%?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock surged by almost 50% between 7/17/2025 and 10/15/2025. The gains come on the back of improving earnings, a recovering CPU market and surging interest in GPUs for artificial intelligence applications. AMD also recently snagged a high profile deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, to supply tens of thousands of its GPU chips for 6 gigawatts of computing capacity over the next five years. From a quantitative perspective, the gains were mainly influenced by a 19.3% shift in the company's Net Income Margin (%). While there is more to this story than just figures, let's first analyze the stock price movement by breaking it down into its contributing factors. Investing in individual stocks can be daunting, but there is great advantage in adopting a more diversified approach, such as with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth management firm – whose asset allocation strategies have yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced a loss of over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio within this asset allocation framework to offer clients superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it provides a smoother investment experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Returning to the “change”: The shifts in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue, and margins reveal a deeper narrative regarding the business and investor sentiment. Below, we highlight key developments that impacted the price movement of AMD stock. To provide context: AMD offers x86 microprocessors, accelerated processing units, chipsets, discrete and integrated GPUs, data center and professional GPUs, as well as development services across computing, graphics, enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segments. Here Is Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Moved Our Current Assessment Of AMD Stock Opinion: At the moment, we regard AMD stock as relatively pricey. Why is that? For an in-depth analysis, read Buy or Sell AMD Stock to understand the basis of our current view. Risk: AMD is also vulnerable to significant downturns. It dropped about 83% during the Dot-Com crash and nearly 91% in the Global Financial Crisis. The corrections in 2018 and inflation shock caused losses of 49% and 65%, respectively. Even the Covid sell-off was harsh, erasing over 34%. While solid fundamentals are important, during market downturns, AMD has demonstrated its capacity to incur substantial losses. Consistently identifying winners is not an easy endeavor, particularly given the volatility associated with individual stocks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a demonstrated history of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. What is the reason for this? On average, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother investment journey, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Major U.S. equities indexes climbed Wednesday afternoon in the wake of strong bank earnings and indications of more Federal Reserve rate cuts ahead. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow were all higher. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged, leading broader gains for semiconductor companies a day after the chipmaker announced a deal to sell chips to Oracle (ORCL). Also helping lift semiconductor stocks was an update from chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML (ASML), which said AI-driven demand was strong. Shares of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) gained after both financial firms reported better-than-expected results on booming investment banking revenue. Bunge Global (BG) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 as the soybean exporter stands to benefit from soybean trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Progressive (PGR) shares slumped after the insurer reported its combined ratio rose on higher costs. Shares of F5 (FFIV) also dropped after the cloud services firm reported a cyberattack by government hackers. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) shares declined after the drugmaker cut the top end of its earnings guidance on concerns about the impact of tariffs. Gold price climbed to a fresh high, while oil futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were higher.

Title: Broadcom Stock Retreats After Soaring on OpenAI Deal—Monitor These Key Price Levels

Broadcom (AVGO) shares dropped Tuesday morning, giving back a portion of the big gains posted yesterday following news that the chip giant had forged a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The company said it would collaborate with OpenAI on the development of artificial intelligence accelerator and network systems for delivery from 2026 to 2029. The announcement comes just a week after rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) inked a deal with the San Francisco-based AI start-up. Broadcom shares were down nearly 4% at around $343 in recent trading, tracking a broader move lower for U.S. equities, after surging 10% on Monday. Investors have bid up the stock, which has risen about 50% since the start of the year, amid surging demand for custom AI chips as enterprises build out their AI capacity. Below, we take a closer look at Broadcom’s chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for. After hitting their all-time high last month, Broadcom shares retraced toward the 50-day moving average (MA) before attracting buying interest near the respected indicator. Buying in the stock accelerated yesterday on the highest trading volume in over a month, a move that also coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) reclaiming the 50 threshold to signal a return of bullish price momentum. Let’s point out two key overhead areas to watch on Broadcom’s chart and also identify important support levels worth monitoring during profit-taking episodes. Buying from current levels could initially see a move up to around $374. Tactical traders who have bought the recent pullback may look to lock in profits in this location near the stock’s record high, especially if the RSI simultaneously moves into overbought territory. If the shares enter price discovery mode, investors can forecast a possible overhead target to watch by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior price action to project future directional movements. When applying the analysis to Broadcom’s chart, we take the uptrend from late August to early September and reposition it from last month’s low. This forecasts a bullish target of around $415, implying 16% upside from Monday’s closing price. We selected this prior move as it followed an earlier dip to the 50-day-MA in August, providing clues as to how a new trend higher from the indicator may take shape if price action rhymes. The first support level worth monitoring sits around $324. This area on the chart could attract buying interest near the September and October lows, which currently closely align with the rising 50-day MA. Finally, selling below this important level could spark a more significant drop to the $291 level. Investors could look to accumulate Broadcom shares in this region near a trendline that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart between July and September.
