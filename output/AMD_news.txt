Chips, models, hash rates, capital raises. That framing is already outdated. At this stage of the cycle, growth is no longer decided by demand or funding. It is decided by power. Not theoretical power. Not future contracts. Existing, usable electricity that can support a continuous load. That is the asset hyperscalers are quietly competing for, and it is where expansion is actually happening. Companies that already have access to it within live facilities can move. Those that do not are discovering that capital alone does not unlock growth. That framework is what makes Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) worth a closer look, because the company is not approaching this shift from the sidelines. It already operates across four U.S. colocation sites running continuous, power-intensive workloads, with uptime above 95%. Its current fleet of more than 3,100 wholly owned Scrypt mining rigs is live today, spread across diversified data-center load zones, and management has disclosed a funded expansion to more than 4,100 rigs in the first half of 2026. This is not a future buildout. The facilities are live, powered, and operating today, with revenue being generated under continuous load. Look at where the biggest buyers are actually adding load. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has concentrated new AI capacity inside existing campuses in places like Iowa and Texas, where power delivery and transmission are already settled. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has done the same in long-established regions such as Virginia and Ohio. These are not speculative locations. They are places where electricity shows up on time and at scale. Expansion is flowing to what already works, while projects tied to future power remain stuck. That is the environment in which Datacentrex operates. It is not waiting on approvals or interconnection. Its sites are already live. Power is flowing, load is running, and revenue is being generated under continuous operation. At this stage of the cycle, the question is not who wants to expand, but who already can. What matters next is how that position is used. Datacentrex is not holding power idle. Today, it is monetized through Scrypt mining. The infrastructure is already paid for, and cash is already coming in. At the same time, the company sits adjacent to a data center and AI market already measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Secured access to live power does not promise outcomes, but it determines who even gets a seat when demand shifts. For now, Datacentrex uses its contracted, energized capacity the way infrastructure businesses usually do: by putting it to work. Datacentrex’s current revenue engine is Scrypt mining, a faster-growing and less saturated corner of crypto infrastructure that has outperformed expectations over the past cycle. Scrypt mining secures networks such as Litecoin and Dogecoin using specialized hardware designed for steady, always-on operation. It is a different market from Bitcoin mining. The field is smaller. Competition is thinner. Scale is not dominated by a handful of megasites, and that helps shape returns. Over the past year, that gap has been visible in operating results. While Bitcoin miners have dealt with rising difficulty, higher capital intensity, and margin pressure following the halving, Scrypt economics have held up better. Company materials show that Scrypt mining delivered stronger realized profitability than SHA-256 mining for much of 2024. And it’s all because of the structure. A clearer way to gauge mining economics is to look at what the networks pay miners. CoinMetrics network data show that total miner revenue on Scrypt networks such as Dogecoin and Litecoin stayed comparatively steady through 2024. Bitcoin miner revenue did not. The halving cut payouts sharply, and margins across the SHA-256 ecosystem tightened. Scrypt mining also allows a single machine to earn rewards from two networks at the same time, most commonly Litecoin and Dogecoin. Power use does not increase, but output does. That feature is known as merged mining. For many operators, merged mining creates a secondary problem. Rewards arrive in more than one cryptocurrency, each with its own liquidity and conversion process. Turning production into usable cash can involve multiple steps, additional timing risk, and unnecessary friction. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) handles this differently. Mining output is consolidated into bitcoin rather than managed across several smaller assets. The result is a simpler cash flow. Fewer conversions. Less exposure to liquidity bottlenecks. Revenue moves from production to cash without detours. That shows up in operating results. Datacentrex has disclosed that its Scrypt operations have been EBITDA positive from the start. Power costs are covered. Sites fund themselves. Expansion is incremental rather than speculative. Source: https://x.com/ElphaPex/status/2003624000581464457 This defines Scrypt's role in the business today. It is not framed as a destination. It is the current workload on energized sites. Cash is generated, infrastructure stays active, and the company retains the option to reallocate capacity over time. In a market where power is scarce, that combination matters. Treasury Strategy: Liquidity First Datacentrex pays attention to how revenue becomes usable capital, not just how it is produced. Scrypt mining generates value across multiple networks. As a result, many operators end up managing several different crypto assets. That complicates cash flow. Conversion timing matters. Liquidity varies. None of that improves mining performance, but it can affect outcomes. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) avoids that problem by consolidating mining proceeds into a single settlement asset. Revenue is realized quickly and cleanly. There is no need to manage multiple small positions or wait for favorable conversion windows. The result is a liquid treasury because operating costs are covered without the need to sell. Capital can be held, deployed, or left idle depending on conditions. Decisions are not dictated by short-term price moves or balance-sheet pressure. That flexibility is the point. The treasury does not try to add returns on its own. It preserves the ability to act when opportunities appear and to sit still when they do not. Execution: Scale, Control, and Cash Discipline Execution at Datacentrex begins with ownership. The company owns its machines and operates directly within third-party colocation facilities directly. There are no leased rigs and no vendor liens embedded in the fleet. Decisions around uptime, expansion, and capital allocation stay simple because nothing lies between the company and its assets. Today, Datacentrex runs more than 3,100 Scrypt ASICs across four U.S. colocation sites. Power is delivered and consumed under continuous load. These facilities are operating now, and utilization is happening in real time. Growth builds from that base. Management has disclosed plans to expand the fleet beyond 4,100 rigs in the first half of 2026, adding capacity inside facilities that are already running. Power, cooling, and operating processes are in place. Capital goes toward machines, not construction. The economics are already visible. Datacentrex has said its Scrypt subsidiary, dogehash technologies’ operations have been EBITDA positive from inception. Power costs are covered. Sites carry themselves. Expansion follows cash flow. The company is also carrying cash. Datacentrex has disclosed roughly $45 million on hand, no long-term debt, and full ownership of its operating equipment. It is not forced to raise capital to keep operating or to add capacity. The people involved have been through cycles where that distinction mattered. Members of the board and management have built and run crypto and data infrastructure businesses during periods when power tightened and capital disappeared. They have seen where leverage breaks things first. That experience shows up in how the business is run. Assets are owned outright. Capacity is added where operations already work. Liquidity stays intact. The company is not built to chase scale just to justify fixed costs. Management has been explicit about how it sees the model evolving. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) has pointed to companies such as IREN, Cipher Mining, and TeraWulf as examples of businesses where the market stopped valuing hash rate alone and started valuing who has secured access to power,, balance sheets, and operating flexibility. The asset is not the output. It is the infrastructure underneath it. For investors, execution here is straightforward. The system is operating, and cash is coming in, while capacity can be added without rebuilding the business. Capital, Revenue, and the Size of the Playing Field The scale of what is unfolding in data centers and AI infrastructure is already well defined. J.P. Morgan estimates that U.S. data center capacity could exceed 130 gigawatts by 2030, up from roughly 20–30 gigawatts today, with total infrastructure and hardware investment required to support that buildout running north of $3 trillion. Power, not demand, is the gating factor. Generation exists. Transmission, interconnection, and delivery do not move at the same speed. J.P. Morgan’s work shows where capacity already exists. U.S.-listed bitcoin miners are operating more than 8.5 gigawatts of energized power, with approvals in place for roughly another 8 gigawatts. These are not plans on paper. The sites are connected, permitted, and already drawing load. Moving from mining to higher value computing is expensive, but the most difficult step is already complete. Electricity is reaching the site. J.P. Morgan estimates that converting existing mining power capacity to HPC applications could cost roughly $10-15 million per megawatt before GPUs, with all-in AI data center costs exceeding $45 million per megawatt once hardware is included. That math explains why expansion across the sector is gravitating toward sites that already work, rather than projects that still need power. This is where Datacentrex fits in. The company is not trying to solve the power problem. It is operating after it. Its business decisions concern how to use existing capacity, not how to secure it. At this point in the cycle, outcomes hinge on where electricity is already being consumed. Other companies to keep a close eye on in the space: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) NVIDIA is the dominant global supplier of GPUs and accelerated computing platforms that underpin artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and modern data centers. Its data center segment has become the company’s primary growth engine, driven by demand for AI training and inference workloads from hyperscalers, sovereign cloud projects, and enterprise customers.
