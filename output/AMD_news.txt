A slew of major American technology stocks pulled back Wednesday, as the latest batch of fourth-quarter earnings and an increasingly complicated operating environment for multinational companies ate at Wall Street’s risk appetite. An ever-shifting geopolitical backdrop has weighed on the minds of investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index dipped 0.7% shortly after market open. Leading the losses was an 8% drop for Google parent Alphabet, a slide which erased as much as $211 billion in market value after the company’s earnings report revealed weaker Q4 revenues than consensus analyst forecasts and far higher 2025 spending guidance than anticipated, as Alphabet stock paces toward its biggest percentage loss since October 2023. Also struggling after their company’s earnings reports were shares of semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices and ride-hailer Uber. AMD stock tanked 10% to their cheapest level since 2023 after the firm fell short of estimates in its artificial intelligence-focused datacenter division, while Uber stock fell 7% after the company predicted lower-than-expected ride revenue during 2025’s first three months. Notable fallers not tied to quarterly results included iPhone maker Apple, and Elon Musk’s electric vehicle producer Tesla, both of which suffered about 2% share price declines. Apple’s drop followed a Bloomberg report Chinese regulators are considering an antitrust investigation into Apple over its App Store fees, a possible retaliation to President Donald Trump’s 10% additional tariffs on U.S. imports of Chinese goods. Tesla’s dip came after the company reportedly suffered its worst month for new car sales in Germany since 2021 and France since 2022, a potential consequence of Musk’s outspoken support for right-wing politicians including Germany’s Alternative for Deutschland party. The Nasdaq is still up 1% in 2025, but it’s been a rocky path to those gains, as tariffs and the heated U.S.-China generative AI competition weighed on investors’ minds. Also down Wednesday were New York-listed shares of Chinese companies. Online retailers Alibaba and Temu parent Pinduoduo, the two most valuable U.S.-traded Chinese firms, both suffered about 2% drops as investors reacted to an increasingly messy trade conflict between the U.S. and China, which most recently resulted in the U.S. Postal Service briefly pausing acceptance of all packages from China and Hong Kong.

By Kanchana Chakravarty and Zaheer Kachwala (Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices shares tumbled more than 10% on Wednesday after the company's AI chip revenue failed to meet lofty expectations, reinforcing its struggles to grab market share from well-entrenched market leader Nvidia. The company's fourth-quarter data center revenue - a proxy for its AI performance - jumped 69% to $3.9 billion, compared with the consensus estimate of $4.15 billion. "AMD may still be taking market share from Intel in the central processing unit (CPU) side of things, but it remains a long way behind Nvidia and is struggling to catch up when it comes to graphics processing units (GPU)," said Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. "Investors want the company to take the fight to Nvidia, but for now it is very much struggling to break the moat and disrupt its market position," he added. AMD is set to lose more than $19 billion of its market capitalization if current losses hold. Shares fell 18% last after more than doubling in 2023 on expectations of the company riding the AI boom. Meanwhile, Nvidia's stock gained 171% in 2024. An increasing push by tech giants including Microsoft and Meta —both AMD customers — to develop in-house chips that are cheaper and more efficient could also dampen demand for AMD's off-the-shelf processors. BofA analysts said as Nvidia continues to outperform and custom chips gain more traction at hyperscalers, it might be hard for AMD to "win" the AI narrative despite its strong growth levels. The arrival of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek's low-cost model has made investors more sensitive, said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. AMD's results and outlook have "knocked confidence further", she added. At least 22 analysts have cut their price targets on the stock, with the median now at $150, compared to $166.5 before the results. AMD's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 23.39, compared with Nvidia's 26.27.

Business FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with a displayed AMD logo is placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken March 6, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo :Advanced Micro Devices shares tumbled 8 per cent on Wednesday after the company's AI chip revenue failed to meet analysts' high expectations, underscoring its struggle to grab market share from well-entrenched market leader Nvidia. The company's fourth-quarter data center revenue, which reflects demand for its AI processors, jumped 69 per cent to $3.9 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $4.15 billion. "AMD may still be taking market share from Intel in the central processing unit (CPU) side of things, but it remains a long way behind Nvidia and is struggling to catch up when it comes to graphics processing units (GPU)," said Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. "Investors want the company to take the fight to Nvidia, but for now it is very much struggling to break the moat and disrupt its market position," he added. The drop in AMD's shares on Wednesday erased about $15 billion in stock market value. Its shares fell 18 per cent last year after more than doubling in 2023 on bets the company's AI-optimized graphics processing units would become more competitive against Nvidia's offerings. Nvidia's stock gained 171 per cent in 2024. An increasing push by tech giants including Microsoft and Meta — both AMD customers — to develop in-house chips that are cheaper and more efficient could also hurt demand for AMD's off-the-shelf processors. BofA analysts said that as Nvidia continues to outperform and custom chips gain more traction at hyperscalers, it might be hard for AMD to "win" the AI narrative despite its strong growth levels. The launch of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek's low-cost model has made investors more wary of heavy spending on AI chips, said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Title: AMD’s data center revenue comes up short, leaving investors dismayed

UPDATED 20:36 EST / FEBRUARY 04 2025 by Mike Wheatley Investors bailed on Advanced Micro Devices Inc. late today after the chipmaker reported lower-than-expected revenue in its key data center segment, despite posting solid results overall. The company revealed fourth-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $1.09 per share on record-breaking revenue of $7.66 billion, up 12% from a year earlier. The results came in ahead of Wall Street’s forecasts, with analysts predicting slightly lower earnings of $1.08 per share on sales of $7.53 billion. However, the higher revenue was offset by increased costs, resulting in net income of $482 million, down from $667 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin, which measures the revenue that remains after subtracting the direct costs associated with producing goods or services, rose by a single percentage point, to 51%. AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su (pictured) hailed 2024 as a “transformative year” for the company, in which it generated record annual revenue and saw strong earnings growth. “Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing,” she added. Su told analysts on a conference call that the company anticipates “strong double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth in 2025.” For the first quarter of the year, the company is forecasting sales of $7.1 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, with a higher gross margin of 54%. That compares favorably with the Street’s forecast of $7 billion in sales. The numbers were largely positive, except for the performance of AMD’s most critical business unit, the data center segment, which produces computer chips for data center servers. That business has been growing fast in recent quarters thanks to the insane demand the company has seen for graphics processing units that power artificial intelligent workloads. It showed good momentum in the latest quarter, with revenue up 69%, to $3.86 billion. However, investors were hoping for even faster growth, and had expected the company to deliver $4.14 billion in data center revenue. They were not happy that AMD was unable to meet their lofty expectations, and the company’s stock fell more than 8% in extended trading, wiping out a gain of just over 4% during the regular session. The reaction was perhaps a bit harsh on AMD, which said the data center business grew its sales by 94%, to $12.6 billion, in fiscal 2024. That’s thanks to an increase in sales of its Instinct GPUs and also its EPYC central processing units, which power regular computer servers. AMD positions its newest Instinct MI300X GPU as an alternative to Nvidia Corp.’s chips, which dominate the industry, and it accounted for over $5 billion of sales in the last year, officials said. It has been embraced by some of the biggest data center operators, including Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon Web Services Inc. One thing that may have struck investors was that AMD declined to provide a forecast for AI-related revenue for the coming year, which may add fuel to concerns that sales of the Instinct GPUs are slowing down. However, Su insisted that the company sees a “steep, long-term growth trajectory” that will eventually grow to “tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue” in the coming years. Somewhat surprisingly, Su praised the emergence of the Chinese AI company DeepSeek Ltd., which rocked financial markets last week when it became clear that its latest large language model could compete with the most advanced LLMs offered by U.S. companies, despite being built at just a small fraction of the cost. Some investors fear that the rise of lower-cost alternatives might hit chipmakers such as AMD, though perhaps not so much as AI developers such as OpenAI. Su also hailed the Stargate project announced by U.S. President Donald Trump last month, which plans to invest $500 billion in building AI computing infrastructure to ensure the country remains at the forefront of the AI industry. “All of these initiatives require massive amounts of new compute and create unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD across our businesses,” Su insisted. All of the talk and buzz around AI has meant that AMD’s other key business, which sells chips for personal computers, has largely been forgotten. But it put in a stellar performance, with sales rising 58% year-over-year, to $2.3 billion, above the consensus estimate of $1.9 billion. AMD’s smaller gaming and embedded businesses both declined, however, reflecting sustained pressures on those segments. The gaming segment saw sales tumble by 59%, to just $563 million, with the company pointing to a drop in “semicustom” sales. Meanwhile, the embedded chip segment saw revenue drop 13%, to $923 million. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said the market is likely being a bit harsh on AMD, as he thinks the company is growing very well in what is still a transitional phase as it shifts its focus to the data center. “Data center revenues were good, up almost 70%, and the client computing business had a record quarter, offsetting the shrinkage in its smaller gaming and embedded segments,” the analyst said. “It looks very good on the profitability side too, with operating income up more than 350%. The problem is that investors wanted to see turbocharged AI growth, but the data center business didn’t grow enough to satisfy such desires. It will need to pull off another epic quarter if it wants its investors to be really happy.” During the quarter, AMD’s venture capital arm, AMD Ventures, participated in a number of big funding rounds, including a $333 million raise by the cloud infrastructure startup Vultr Inc., and a $250 million investment in the AI startup Liquid AI Inc. Last November, the company also announced its intention to lay off about 1,000 workers, or 4% of its total staff, in order to free up more money to invest in AI development. Today’s after-hours price action means AMD’s stock is down 33% in the past 12 months, compared with a 9% gain in the broader iShares Semiconductor ETF.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed China's instant retaliation to US President Donald Trump's additional tariffs and the potential risks of a trade war. Traders also took in fresh jobs data, with job openings declining more than expected in December. Investors are continuing to watch any signs of cooling in the labor market as the Federal Reserve debates future interest rate cuts in the face of sticky inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Beijing reacted swiftly on Tuesday to Trump's additional 10% levies on Chinese imports going into effect at midnight. China slapped tariffs of 15% on US coal and liquified natural gas, starting Feb. 10, alongside 10% duties on imports of crude oil, farm equipment, and some autos. The tit-for-tat measures raise the risk of an escalation into trade war that would damage both of the world's top two economies. But some on Wall Street see the Chinese response as showing restraint that opens the door to compromise, as seen in the US tariff postponement deals with Mexico and Canada. Giving more cause for optimism, Trump brought forward talks with China's President Xi Jinping. He said on Monday they would take place "probably over the next 24 hours," rather than later in the week. The pair did not speak on Tuesday but US officials said a call could come tomorrow. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) fell, down about 0.9% as worries eased somewhat. Meanwhile, China opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and added Calvin Klein owner PVH (PVH) and biotech company Illumina (ILMN) to its "unreliable entities list." Outside of China's investigation, investors also kept a close eye on Alphabet's earnings, with the company the latest Mag 7 name to report. Shares dropped around 7% in after-hours trading after revenue for its all-important cloud business disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Other high-profile companies also posted results after the bell. Chipotle stock fell on a same-store sales miss while shares of AMD (AMD) rose on strong guidance that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. Meanwhile, social media giant Snap (SNAP) saw its stock jump double digits after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw shares rise in after-hours trading after the company posted a strong sales forecast that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. In the current quarter, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. That view tops the midpoint of Wall Street estimates. "Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing," the company said in the earnings release. Here are AMD's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Read more about AMD's earnings from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley here. Snap (SNAP) shares soared as much as 15% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Snap said it expects revenue in the current quarter to come in between $1.33 billion and $1.36 billion. That's ahead of the $1.33 billion Wall Street had anticipated. The company also sees daily active users reaching about 459 million, also ahead of the expected 458 million. Here are Snap's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Chipotle (CMG) stock fell as much as 6% in after-hours trading before paring losses after the company reported comparable sales that fell short of Wall Street's estimates. For the fourth quarter, the fast-casual restaurant chain reported comparable sales up 5.4%, below Wall Street's estimates of a 5.67% increase. Chipotle's operating margin of 14.6% also fell short of Wall Street's estimate of 15.1%. The company's earnings per share of $0.25 matched Wall Street's projections. Read more on Chipotle's results from Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dropped over 7% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after overall revenue missed expectations in the quarter. Revenue for its all-important cloud business also disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Here are Alphabet's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: The company reported cloud revenue of $11.96 billion, a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus expectations of $12.19 billion. Read more about Alphabet's results from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed the latest trade war developments and fresh jobs data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Disney (DIS) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday as the company aims to extend recent streaming momentum and build on its latest string of theatrical hits at the box office. Parks should face some uncertainty after Disney estimated in November that Hurricanes Helene and Milton would register a hit of about $130 million in the quarter, while the Disney cruise line pre-launches will tack on an additional $90 million. Still, the company said operating income at the parks will improve beyond the first quarter, estimating growth between 6% and 8% for full-year 2025. Here's how Wall Street expects Disney to perform, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Streaming profitability should once again be a focus point after Disney said it expects its direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming business — which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — to post profits of approximately $875 million in fiscal 2025. In its latest results, the company reported profits of $321 million for the three months ending Sept. 28. Read more here. Job openings declined more than analysts expected in December, hitting 7.6 million, their lowest level since September. But economists argued the details in the release were roughly in line with the "broadly stable" labor market Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described in his most recent press conference on Jan. 29. "The totality of the December JOLTS data are consistent with a labour market that has stabilized at a healthy level," Capital Economics North America economist Paul Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. This dynamic can be seen in the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. The ratio has been sitting at around 1 to 1 for more than six months now, reflecting significant cooling from the hot labor market of 2022 but still painting a relatively solid jobs picture. For now, this helps paint a "familiar picture" of the labor market, according to Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten. It's an environment where hiring has clearly slowed, but layoffs aren't rampant and pushing unemployment higher. "The December JOLTS report is consistent with the Fed's view that the labor market is healthy enough to tolerate a more cautious approach to lowering rates, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding tariff policy," Vanden Houten wrote. "We will be removing a March rate cut from our February baseline forecast." Robinhood (HOOD) shares held on to earlier gains, rising about 2% Tuesday despite the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formally requesting the company "not permit customers to access" sports event contracts. The development comes just one day after Robinhood said it would launch event contracts for Super Bowl LIX, a move that would have allowed users to place bets on who will win the game: the Kansas City Chiefs or the Philadelphia Eagles. The event contracts began trading on Monday, but have since been suspended, according to the company. "We are disappointed by this outcome, especially given that we had been in regular communication with the CFTC about our intent and plans to offer this product," Robinhood said in a statement. "We’ve also taken steps to advocate for balanced regulation in the futures and derivatives markets, including participating directly in a CFTC roundtable, providing written feedback to the CFTC, and generally championing the economic benefits of event contracts." Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi has more on the story here. Fox (FOXA) is about to enter the competitive streaming marketplace with its own direct-to-consumer service, expected to launch by the end of this year. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch made the announcement during the company's fourth quarter earnings call on Tuesday, saying that while the traditional cable bundle still presents "the most value" for both Fox's customers and its business, "we do want to reach consumers wherever they are. Analysts have said Fox's assets have been heavily skewed toward the linear pay TV ecosystem at a time when more consumers are cutting the cable cord in favor of less expensive streaming services. To that point, Murdoch said the new service will target the "cord-cutters" and the "cord-nevers." The company plans to release more details regarding the launch in the coming months. Traditional legacy players have tried to adapt to the industry's streaming transition. Along with Fox, CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recently unveiled plans to invest $70 million into a "digital revamp" of its network, which also includes its own direct-to-consumer streaming product. Fox's management had hinted at plans to explore more streaming options. The new service it just announced comes after the abrupt dismantlement of Venu Sports, a sports streaming service that was supposed to launch from Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney's ESPN (DIS). Read more here. It's already a different trade war from Trump's first run in the White House. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: After announcing historic duties on America's top three trading partners over the weekend, Trump then shocked markets again on Monday with a quick pivot on two of them. As of Tuesday morning, 10% duties on China are in place, and the world's second-largest economy has already hit back. The 25% duties on Canada and Mexico are on hold for a month as talks continue. At a Politico event on Tuesday morning, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro said the president's call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping will take place today and that a tariff pause will be on the table. The unpredictable mix is clearly flummoxing Wall Street and the rest of corporate America. "It is fundamentally different," former US trade representative general counsel Greta Peisch said in an interview, noting that Trump is now "breaking new ground in what is a trade authority, what are they used for, and how expensive the transactions will be." Read more here. Vaccine stocks Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), and BioNTech SE (BNTX) all fell following news that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cleared a key committee vote in his quest to lead the Health and Human Services Department. Kennedy's nomination now heads to the Senate, which is widely expected to approve his nomination. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La), a medical doctor, had been a key swing vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The senator confirmed his decision in a post on X, writing, "With the serious commitments I’ve received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on, like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes." The final tally was 14-13, with every Republican voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination. Every Democrat on the committee voted against it. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining around 1% in early afternoon trading. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) jumped nearly 2% to reach intraday record highs — its third intraday record of 2025. Shares are also currently on track for another record close. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose, while AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 2% in early trading as it attempted to stage a comeback from previous session losses of over 2.5%. Palantir (PLTR) was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance early Tuesday after the intelligence software company's quarterly and annual revenue forecasts exceeded expectations. Shares rocketed roughly 25% to a fresh record high. Investors applauded solid demand for the company's artificial intelligence products, which included higher US commercial and government sales in the quarter. Late last year, the company secured a $400 million contract with the Army for up to four years. Palantir has greatly benefitted from the AI boom, with shares up nearly 1,000% over the past five years. Still, its hefty market cap of over $239 billion has long been questioned by analysts. On the earnings call, the company addressed DeepSeek concerns following last week's sell-off. "We would strongly discourage [DeepSeek] and don't think any customer in the US government will be able to use it," said Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue officer. Oil pared losses after sliding as much as 3% following China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs on some US imports, including oil and liquified natural gas. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) recovered to trade near $72.80 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also cut losses of more than 2% to trade around $76 per barrel. Earlier in the session, crude reacted to China's announcement that starting next Monday, it would impose levies of 15% on US-imported coal and liquified natural gas (LNG) and 10% for crude oil. This came in retaliation to the Trump administration's implementation of additional 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports on Tuesday. On Monday, President Trump paused tariffs against Mexican and Canadian imports, which would've included oil. Job openings declined more than expected in December as investors continue to watch closely for any signs of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 7.6 million jobs open at the end of December, a decrease from the 8.15 million seen in November. The November figure was revised higher from the 8.01 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 8 million openings in November. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.46 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.37 million made during November. The hiring rate was flat at 3.4% for the third straight month. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, was 2% in December, unchanged from the month prior. US stocks opened mixed on Tuesday as investors continued to assess back-and-forth tariff developments, with China responding to President Trump's 10% tariffs with its own duties on US goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down roughly 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened just around the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a losing day for stocks. Google is facing a new antitrust probe in China as Beijing responds to Trump's "first salvo" of tariffs with a warning shot showing where it thinks it can hit the US hard. But shares in Google owner Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) inched higher in pre-market, rising almost 1%, even as Big Tech eyes a potential hit from Trump's tariffs itself. Investors may well be holding fire for the megacap tech's fourth quarter results, due after the bell, to get a steer on whether its massive AI spending is about to pay off. China has already brought one challenge to Alphabet in the shape of Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI models. At the same time, some on Wall Street see the Google parent as more insulated than its peers from tariff risk, given its cloud and ad strength stand to offset AI stumbles. Though there is a chance that the market is underpricing tariff risk — or is just baffled as to what Trump will do next, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports. Shares of Spotify (SPOT) climbed over 9% before the bell on the heels of upbeat quarterly results. The stock has already surged roughly 150% over the past year, as of Monday's close. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Spotify Technology posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat revenue expectations, as it reported its first full-year profit. The audio giant also posted another strong quarter of subscriber gains, as levels of churn remain low despite recent price increases. The results follow an intense business overhaul, which has included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts — an area it had aggressively pursued. Those efforts allowed the stock to stage a comeback from the record lows it faced in 2022. Read more here. Europe's stock markets trod water on Tuesday, as investors eyed the US-China exchange of tariff fire for clues to what duties Trump might hit the EU with. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) wavered below the flat line as a series of corporate earnings shifted the mood. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) retraced deeper morning losses to trade little changed, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was more upbeat, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) in London trended lower. Overall, I'm not liking these earnings from PepsiCo. The food giant's 2025 sales and EPS guidance were relatively in line with consensus. The Street may have some concern about the company hitting those targets, judging by how the fourth quarter played out. Pressure was on the top and bottom lines in the company's two most important segments: Frito Lay and North America beverages. PepsiCo continues to see heightened competition in its categories and low-income consumers spending cautiously, given years of price increases. Its shares are off by 2.5% in the pre-market. I am talking to PepsiCo (PEP) chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta ahead of his earnings call today at around 7:45 a.m. ET, so I will jump back in here with more insights. Sign in to access your portfolio

By Oliver Rodzianko Summary AMD (AMD, Financial) is one of the most exciting chip companies in the world at the moment. Due to its strategic focus on AI, including a diversified approach centered on inference as well as training demand, the stock has a robust medium-term future ahead of it. Moreover, my valuation model posits a 35% margin of safety for investment assessed from a full financial breakdown of its earnings capacity and share count over the next three years. Additionally, my December 2027 price target of $290 is the conclusive reason I am highly bullish on AMD stock at its present valuation. Operational & financial analysis In my opinion, there are two semiconductor companies that are both the best-positioned in terms of valuation, financials, and operations to warrant heavy buying of their stock at the moment. However, there is a core difference between the two companies that makes AMD a more stable medium-term investment. I’ve mentioned extensively in previous analyses on Nvidia that it is likely to face a revenue decline in the medium term related to lower spend on AI infrastructure graphics processing units for model training. However, AMD is focusing on inference workloads, a potentially larger and more protracted market. At the moment, AMD's data center segment accounts for about half of its total revenue and grew by 122% year-over-year in Q3 2024. However, Nvidia remains dominant with around a 90% share of the AI graphics processing unit market. Unlike training workloads that require high-end graphics processing units, inference can leverage central processing units, graphics processing units, and even specialized accelerators, providing AMD with multiple avenues to compete as it transitions its focus toward inference to differentiate itself from Nvidia. In addition, while Nvidia has a comprehensive software ecosystem named CUDA, this is more focused on training utilizing high-performance graphics processing units like the H100. Inference workloads will be less reliant on CUDA, so AMD has an opportunity to compete with its open-source ROCm stack and cost-efficient solutions. In the next two to three years, AMD is quite likely to achieve an earnings without non-recurring items compound annual growth rate of over 35% due to profit harvesting amid the upcycle of its AI ramp up and other diversified revenue streams. Moreover, this will likely coincide with around a 20% compound annual growth rate in its revenues over the time period. Such growth forecasts are based on my research and analysis of its current growth trends and market position and validated against consensus estimates from Wall Street. To be precise, I forecast $44.5 billion in annual revenue for Fiscal 2027 (ending December 2027), and earnings without non-recurring items of $8.37 for Fiscal 2027. Valuation analysis For my valuation model, I provide a full breakdown of the company's profit potential and share issuance. The model is capped at three years, in-line with my estimates above due to this likely being the highest-growth period to hold AMD stock in the foreseeable future. The company's basic average shares outstanding have been increasing at an 8.23% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. If this trend slows due to profit harvesting meaning the company is less reliant on equity financing to fund its operations, a compound annual growth rate of 5% in its share count seems plausible over the next three years. The company's current trailing 12-month shares outstanding equals 1.62 billion, so I forecast it will have 1.88 billion trailing 12-month shares outstanding in December 2027. AMD Shares Outstanding Chart As I forecast that the company will have about a 35% trailing 12-month net margin without non-recurring items by December 2027, the company's net income without non-recurring items would be $15.75 billion. Given my forecast that it will have 1.88 billion shares outstanding, this equates to an earnings per share without non-recurring items of $8.37. AMD stock is currently trading at a much cheaper price-to-earning ratio without non-recurring items compared to its 10-year median of just over 50. The current multiple is almost 40. Moreover, this indication of good value is not just due to cyclical profitability dynamics as the company's price-to-sales ratio of nearly 8 is only moderately higher than its 10-year median of 5.45, despite a three-year revenue growth rate of 19.9% compared to 2.5% as a 10-year median. I therefore consider AMD very reasonably valued right now. Indeed, a terminal multiple of 35 appears both consistent with historical valuations, industry norms (i.e. compared to Nvidia), and conservative given its robust growth horizon with no indication of a medium-term revenue decline for now. AMD and Nvidia PS Ratio Chart The result of my model is a fair December 2027 price target for AMD stock of $290, indicating approximately a three-year compound annual growth rate of over 35%. AMD's weighted average cost of capital is 16.83%, composed of 98.6% equity (costing 17.02%) and 1.4% debt (costing 3.75% pre-tax, 3.75% post-tax due to a 0% effective tax rate). When discounting my December 2027 price target back to the present day over three years using the company's weighted average cost of capital as my discount rate, the implied intrinsic value is $180. As the stock is currently trading at $115, the implied margin of safety in my model is 35%. Risk analysis AMD is not the only company competing in the inference market and attempting to disrupt Nvidia's moat in AI infrastructure. Broadcom (AVGO, Financial) and Marvell (MRVL, Financial) are aggressively entering the AI accelerator market, with Broadcom showing particular promise with potentially $90 billion in AI-related revenue over the next three years. Moreover, there are niche players like Cerebras and Groq which are poised to dominate portions of use-case specific inference through targeting lower latency and higher throughput with tailored chips. It is also worth considering that though we have Trump in the White House this year for a four year term, likely providing more geopolitical resilience through stronger leadership, tensions between the East and West are still high, especially surrounding Taiwan. If further hot wars break out or trade tensions escalate, supply chains and revenue streams could be disrupted. In a worst-case scenario of a market crash, I believe it prudent for investors to have a robust cash position at this time to mitigate risk and allow themselves to capitalize shrewdly on any major undervaluations that occur. This is the strategy being adopted by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), and it appears a shrewd model to emulate. The greatest risk operationally and financially is that AMD has recently heavily concentrated its resources on AI. I do not consider this a bad thing, given that the AI industry is the highest-growth economic boom most people know of. However, it comes with risks for AMD shareholders if the company falls short of expectations. This could manifest if there is lumpiness in AI spending as enterprises optimize their budgets after initial build-outs, or if customers encounter any errors with its central processing units, graphics processing units, or AI accelerators, as two key examples. Conclusion I currently have a significant portion of my value trading portfolio in Nvidia shares, and I'm considering adding AMD shares at a higher or equal weight. I expect I will hold my AMD shares for longer than my Nvidia shares, because Nvidia is showing signs of significantly slower growth on the horizon and then, very likely, at least a minor revenue contraction. Therefore, I am only planning on holding Nvidia stock for about a year, but will likely hold my AMD position for two years or more. As my valuation model indicates, holding AMD stock for three years could result in a 35% compound annual growth rate, making it a top investment to consider at this time. One Community. Many Voices.
