We aren’t talking about a single day drop - but sustained selling triggered by risks that are piling up leading to a big reset in valuation. If this stock reverts to anything close to a sane multiples, we’re talking a drop to $60 or even lower - and that’s without a full-blown tech meltdown. That’s the kind of risk that exists with individual stocks, or if your portfolio is too concentrated. We minimize this risk while giving exposure to upside in our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s pull back the curtain on AMD. Just from the numbers that matter, AMD looks a lot like Google at first glance. But PE multiples? Different like night and day. AMD is trading almost at 85 PE while Google is sitting below 19. Why such a massive difference? The answer: margins! AMD has a very low net margin of 6.4% compared to Google’s 28.6% (last 12 months) - which means low income and exceptionally high PE. In other words, the market is expecting significant margin expansion from AMD - but that dream might blow up. Here is what the numbers really mean. So what’s propping it up? Expectations. And those are starting to wobble. Sure, earnings might look “fine” on the surface. But watch the guidance like a hawk. That’s where the truth slips out. If AMD blinks even a little in forward guidance, Wall Street’s love affair could end fast. The semiconductor industry isn’t new to booms and busts. We’ve seen this movie before. AMD is not immune. Remember 2022? AMD dropped from $160 to under $60 in just months. And it wasn’t because AMD failed - it was because the expectations collapsed. That wasn’t the only time this happened. In 2018, AMD dropped nearly 50% in < 1.5 months as the market corrected in October. All we are saying is - stay cautious! Does it mean you shouldn’t invest in stocks like AMD? No, we aren’t saying that. AMD has provided excellent returns for investors. But stocks like AMD should be just a small part of the portfolio. There is much more to long-term money compounding. Consider Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares lost ground again Thursday, a day after the chipmaker joined a sector-wide sell-off following news that the U.S. had imposed new licensing requirements on some AI chip exports to China. AMD said via a regulatory filing that the new chip curbs would see it face charges of up to $800 million related to the export of its MI308 graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip designed for compute-intensive applications, such as AI and gaming. AMD shares have tumbled 28% since the start of the year and lost 43% of their value over the past 12 months amid concerns about slowing AI infrastructure spending and the company’s inability to capture a greater share of the AI chip market from sector bellwether Nvidia (NVDA). The Trump administration's trade policies have added to the uncertainty surrounding the stock. Below we analyze AMD’s weekly chart and identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching. After breaking down below the neckline of a head and shoulders formation in December, AMD shares trended sharply lower until last week’s volume-backed rebound, potentially laying the groundwork for a longer-term reversal. Importantly, the move created a piercing pattern, a two-day candlestick price pattern that marks a potential reversal from a downward trend to an upward trend. However, selling resumed this week, with the relative strength index (RSI) edging back toward oversold levels to confirm bearish short-term price momentum. Looking ahead, investors should watch for the indicator to potentially break out above a falling wedge pattern it has formed over the past seven months. Let’s locate major support and resistance levels by applying technical analysis to AMD’s chart. AMD shares fell 0.9% to $87.50 on Thursday. The first lower level to watch sits around $76. This area would likely attract significant scrutiny near last week’s low, which also closely aligns with a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to September 2020. Selling below this level opens the door for a retest of lower support at $65. Investors could seek buying opportunities in this location near the December 2022 retracement low, a region the marked the start of a 14-month uptrend in the stock. A move higher from current levels could see the shares initially climb to around $116. This region provides a confluence of selling pressure near the 200-week moving average, last month’s countertrend high, and a range of comparable price points on the chart extending back to August 2021. Finally, a longer-term trend reversal in the stock could fuel a rally to $150. Investors who have accumulated shares during the stock’s downtrend may look for profit-taking opportunities in this location near a horizontal line that connects several minor peaks on the chart between December 2021 and August last year. Depending on the timing of such a move, AMD shares may also encounter resistance in this area from the head and shoulders’ neckline.
