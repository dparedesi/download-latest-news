We believe there are some minor issues with AMD stock that contribute to its high valuation. The surge in generative AI has fueled strong GPU demand, but AMD’s AI accelerator segment has fallen short of expectations. In Q4, AMD’s data center revenue—a key indicator of its AI chip performance—was $3.9 billion, missing consensus estimates. The company also issued a soft outlook, noting that current-quarter data center sales may decline 7% sequentially. Former President Donald Trump’s trade policies could also pose risks to companies like AMD. While there is limited clarity on the semiconductor tariffs due to inconsistent messaging from the White House, the threat remains for AMD, as it sources most of its chips from Taiwan and other parts of Asia. Additionally, AMD has a thinner margin buffer to withstand tariffs compared to competitors like Nvidia due to its lower gross margins. Our assessment of Advanced Micro Devices using key parameters like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows the company is strong operationally and financially, despite its rich valuation. For those seeking returns with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio offers an alternative—it has outpaced the S&P 500 and delivered over 91% returns since inception. Relative to sales and profit, AMD stock appears quite expensive compared to the broader market. • AMD has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 5.6 versus 2.8 for the S&P 500 • Its price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) is 69.0 vs. 21.3 for the S&P 500 • The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 87.7 compared to 21.3 for the benchmark Advanced Micro Devices’ Revenues have grown significantly in recent years. • The company has recorded an average revenue growth of 17.8% over the past 3 years (vs. 6.2% for the S&P 500) • Revenues have increased 13.7% from $23 Bil to $26 Bil in the past 12 months (vs. 5.3% growth for the S&P 500) • Its latest quarterly revenue rose 24.2% to $7.7 Bil from $6.2 Bil a year ago (vs. 4.9% growth for the S&P 500) AMD’s profit margins lag behind most firms covered by Trefis. • Operating Income over the last four quarters was $2.1 Bil, reflecting a low Operating Margin of 8.1% (vs. 13.1% for S&P 500) • Operating Cash Flow was $3.0 Bil, implying a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 11.8% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) AMD’s balance sheet appears robust. • The company had $2.2 Bil in debt at the end of the latest quarter versus a $152 Bil market cap (as of 4/11/2025), resulting in a very low Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.5% (vs. 21.5% for S&P 500) [Note: Lower is better] • With $5.1 Bil in cash among $69 Bil in total assets, AMD has a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 7.4% (vs. 15.0% for S&P 500) AMD has underperformed the S&P 500 during several past downturns.

The high valuation restricts upside in the near to mid-term. Instead, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio, which has outperformed a combined all-cap index benchmark. Why? Its quarterly-rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks helps capture gains in strong markets while limiting losses in downturns, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics.
