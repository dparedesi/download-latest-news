We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. The new regulatory environment has the technology sector eyeing prominent growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Big Tech is set to release earnings next week and investors are excited to see how the group performed in the last quarter. On January 24, Dan Ives, managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, appeared in an interview on Morning Brief at Yahoo Finance to share his 2025 outlook for the tech sector. Ives suggested that the Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech and advises investors to “grab popcorn” for the earnings week ahead. He also shared his optimism towards the billion-dollar investments made by the group before 2025 and claimed that the “fourth industrial revolution” has just begun. He also suggested that AI spending by companies heavily depends on the use cases for the company, and emphasized the unique selling point for each of the names in mega-cap tech names. Ives stated that the ability to monetize stall bases has been the crucial factor driving the growth among tech names, which happens to mimic what the hyperscalers have done. Ives emphasized that investments in artificial intelligence are now going to play out on the consumer side and remained confident that Big Tech is a step ahead in terms of the AI journey to monetization. He believes that seeing the return on investment play out, the Street is underestimating the growth in the tech sector, not just for the earnings next week but for 2025 as a whole. He also suggested that the regulatory environment is drastically changing especially in favor of the autonomous vehicles market and expects a massive year ahead for the segment and stocks associated with self-driving technologies and autonomous vehicle driving. The year ahead looks super solid for companies in the growth sector, namely artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, biotechnology, fintech, and software. While most of it is because of the efforts made by these names over the past year, the promising regulatory environment is going to boost the position of these stocks significantly. We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 23, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor and IT company that produces accelerators capable of managing complex AI workloads. Over the past few months, AMD launched advanced processors for the next generation of PCs and high-performing computing solutions for the AI computing demand. For instance, on January 6, AMD announced the launch of its first commercial Dell PCs that run on its AI processors. The new processors offer improved efficiency, privacy, personalization, and connectivity coupled with cutting-edge AI compute and advanced business productivity tools. On January 22, Thomas O’Malley, an analyst at Barclays shared his stance on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The analyst highlighted that the stock has been struggling for the past year. However, O’Malley believes that AMD’s investments in AI will allow the company to achieve year-over-year growth of a few billion dollars for MI series accelerators in 2025. He also added that the company will have to wait a little longer to garner opportunities for additional market share. Despite that, the analyst gives an overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $140, adding that the stock may potentially gain 12% in the coming months. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) attributes its growth to its data center products and ever-growing demand for its Ryzen PC processors. The company is emerging in the AI and technology sector as a leader in the production of accelerators and processors. Overall, AMD ranks 4th on our list of most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.
