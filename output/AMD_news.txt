Title: Why AMD Stock Is Tumbling Despite Better-Than-Expected Results

Better-than-expected sales and guidance weren’t enough to lift Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock over the high bar set by its run-up in recent months. AMD on Tuesday reported second-quarter sales that topped estimates, and offered Wall Street a rosier-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. Still, shares of the Nvidia competitor were down nearly 7% in recent trading. Above-consensus revenue was driven by strength in AMD’s gaming segment, while earnings, margins, and data center sales were negatively impacted by an $800 million charge related to restrictions on the sale of AI chips to China. The company projected growth at all of its units in the third quarter, and forecast double-digit revenue growth as it ramps sales of its MI355X next-gen AI chip. Most analysts attributed the market's reaction on Wednesday to high expectations and a lofty valuation. “We believe guidance for the AI chip business was in line with Buyside expectations (based on our investor discussions), which is why the stock traded lower," according to Citigroup analysts. Bank of America analysts predicted Wall Street was reacting negatively to "likely ignorable earnings noise" and that the stock wasn't helped by its approximately 80% run-up in the three months leading up to Tuesday's results. One big unknown still hanging over AMD is how much revenue the company will generate when it resumes sales of its MI308 chip to China. (The MI308 was designed expressly for Chinese customers to satisfy Biden-era restrictions.) AMD and Nvidia last month said the Commerce Department had agreed to restart reviewing their export license applications after abruptly halting them earlier in the year. Nonetheless, AMD excluded MI308 sales from its guidance on Tuesday. “There are no China GPU licenses yet, which didn't hurt the outlook but possibly is a letdown for those modeling a $500mn quarterly China contribution in Q3/Q4,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Wednesday. But BofA saw reason for optimism in the outlook. “AMD now expects ~$1.7bn in Q3 GPU sales even without ~$800mn of lost China revenue, suggesting overall ~$500mn higher outlook excluding China vs. $2.0bn pre-ban consensus.” Wedbush analysts echoed that bullish view. “The Q3 outlook was better than expected on substantial Q/Q DC GPU growth expectations, even without assuming any MI308 export licenses are granted,” they wrote. “In turn, we believe this guide sets up AMD to exceed our prior outlook for the out quarters.” Analysts at Wedbush raised their AMD stock price target to $190 from $170 on Wednesday. The firm maintained its “outperform” rating on the stock. Citigroup lifted its price target to $180 from $165 but stood by its “neutral” rating, citing elevated expectations. Seven of the 11 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current AMD ratings and price targets rate the stock a “buy,” with the remainder assigning it a neutral rating. The average price target of $183 implied about 5% upside from Tuesday’s closing price. AMD shares were trading at about $161 midday Wednesday.

Title: These are the top takeaways for investors from the latest high-profile earnings reports

Companies have reported mostly strong second-quarter earnings so far, but there are some specific takeaways investors should be aware of. So far, 82% of companies that have reported results have beaten estimated. According to FactSet, if that percentage holds, it will represent the highest percentage of quarterly earnings beats since the third quarter of 20221. Earnings will continue rolling in over the coming weeks, with tech titan Nvidia set to report at the end of August. Until then, here are some key insights from the last results: What happened: Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer both reported earnings for the second quarter on Tuesday, with mixed results. AMD beat on revenue, but missed earnings estimates slightly. The chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.48, a hair below the expected $0.49 a share. Lisa Su, AMD's CEO, said the firm's AI revenue declined on a year-over-year basis largely due to US export restrictions, which have prevented AMD from selling its MI308 AI chip to China. Shares were down as much as 8% on Wednesday. Super Micro, meanwhile, missed slightly on both earnings and revenue. The chipmaker said revenue came in at $5.76 billion, below the expected $5.89 billion, and earnings per share came in at $0.41, below the $0.44 Wall Street expected. The miss was partly fueled by the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, Charles Liang, the CEO, said on a call with analysts on Tuesday. Shares of the chipmaker were down 17% after the results. What it means: AI chip manufacturers are caught in the crossfire of the trade war. That's expected to remain a key concern as the US irons out the details of its trade relationship with China. The US and China have until August 12 to strike a trade deal before higher tariffs kick in, another headwind that could rattle the market and semiconductor stocks in particular. "Industry-wide tariff impact is only now being felt and could result in headwinds for the entire semiconductor industry," Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst at EMARKETER, wrote in a note. What happened: McDonald's beat on earnings and revenue expectations for the quarter, but voiced concerns about the health of lower-income consumers and the ability of Americans to keep spending. The fast food franchise said revenue came in at $6.84 billion for the quarter, above the $6.7 billion analysts expected. Earnings per share came in at an adjusted $3.19, above estimates of $3.15. "Re-engaging the low-income consumer is critical," Chris Kempczinski, the CEO, said on the company's earnings call, adding that low-income Americans were more likely to visit the chain than other income groups. "This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the US consumer." What it means: Consumer spending is in focus for retail giants and for Wall Street, given the cumulative effects of inflation in recent years and Trump's tariffs. Economists say tariffs could stoke inflation, as companies can pass along the cost of import duties to consumers. For now, though spending remains fairly strong, even as concerns have risen recently around a pullback among both high and low-income households. What happened: Palantir blew past estimates for second quarter earnings. The data software firm revealed that its revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time, reflecting a 55% year-over-year increase. Shares popped as much as 10% after its results, bringing the stock up 130% year-to-date. What it means: The AI trade is alive and well, with firms still benefitting from the hype for artificial intelligence. Wedbush Securities called Palantir the "Messi of AI" in a note to clients shortly after the firm reported earnings. In a separate note, analysts lifted their price target for the stock to $200 a share, implying 15% upside from current levels. "Palantir remains one of our top tech names to own in 2025 and this deal represents another opportunity for PLTR to capitalize on while continuing to generate unprecedented traction for its entire portfolio across the federal and commercial landscapes," analysts said. What happened: Microsoft and Meta both beat on earnings last week. Microsoft took in $76.4 billion in revenue and $3.65 in earnings per share, above estimates of $73.8 billion and $3.37 a share. The company also joined the $4 trillion club for the first time as its stock surged following its earnings report, with shares up 26% year-to-date. Meta, meanwhile, took in $47.5 billion in revenue and $7.14 in earnings per share, above estimates of $44.83 billion and $5.89 a share. The stock is up 27% year-to-date. What it means: Mega-cap tech is still dominating the market. Tech was best-performing area of the S&P 500 in July, with the sector up 5% in the month. The Nasdaq hit 14 record highs in July, causing Deutsche Bank to declare that "tech-ceptionalism" has resumed for the market. The strong outperformance of large-cap stocks accelerated, further widening the gap between small-cap peers. "We continue to favor US large cap Tech over its small cap counterpart, as it takes a highly speculative market (i.e. 2021) or Big Tech to fall out of favor (i.e. 2022, Q4 2024) for the latter to outperform," Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of the research firm DataTrek, wrote in a note.
