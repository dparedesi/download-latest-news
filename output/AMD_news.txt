Title: Lisa Su has built AMD into a $378 billion microchip titan. So why isn't she richer?

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, has built one of the world's most valuable companies and made investors billions — but is barely a billionaire herself. She has delivered a 70-fold increase in her company's stock price during her 11 years in charge, including a 41% surge this week to fresh highs thanks to its OpenAI partnership. The chipmaker's market value has soared to $378 billion, surpassing Home Depot, Bank of America, and Procter & Gamble. Yet Su doesn't rank among the world's 500 richest people, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Forbes puts her net worth at $1.5 billion — less than 1% of the $167 billion fortune of her rival and distant cousin, Jensen Huang, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia. There is one big difference: Huang cofounded Nvidia, while AMD was established in 1969 by a group of engineers who had left Fairchild Semiconductor. One of them, Jerry Sanders, served as CEO until 2002. AMD filings show Su has amassed about 4.7 million shares or a 0.3% stake, worth about $1.1 billion based on the company's stock price ahead of Friday's market open. Her compensation, including salary, bonuses, and stock options, totaled around $31 million last year, per the filings. Su's small ownership stake is the main reason she's not worth more. For comparison, Huang still owns close to a 4% stake in Nvidia, which is worth upward of $160 billion despite significant dilution over the years. Nvidia is also about 12 times larger than AMD, with an unmatched $4.7 trillion market capitalization. Oracle's $847 billion market value is a little over double AMD's figure, but cofounder Larry Ellison owns nearly 41% of the enterprise-software giant — a roughly $350 billion stake that makes him the world's second-wealthiest man after Elon Musk on both Bloomberg and Forbes' rich lists. The difference in size between Su's fortune and theirs underscores that founding a company, and retaining a large stake in it, is the most common path to enormous wealth. Seven of the top 10 people on Bloomberg's list are founders, and another two, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett, shaped their companies, Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway, in their respective images as much as any founder. Steve Ballmer, who joined Microsoft as Bill Gates' assistant in 1980 and later became CEO, is a rare exception because he parlayed a quirk in his contract into a sizable equity stake. AMD stock has almost doubled this year as investors buy into Su's vision of building an AI hardware, software, and services ecosystem. Su isn't likely to crack the top 10 of the rich list soon, but if her shares keep soaring, she could be worth billions more. Your daily guide to what's moving markets — straight to your inbox.

Title: OpenAI’s Strategic Shift: What The AMD And Nvidia Partnerships Signal
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/solrashidi/2025/10/09/openais-strategic-shift-what-the-amd-and-nvidia-partnerships-signal/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T13:00:00Z

BySol Rashidi, Contributor. AMD, Advanced Micro Devices saw a 23.71% surge in its share price this week, driven by a high-profile partnership with OpenAI that could fundamentally reshape the competitive landscape in AI computing infrastructure. The deal, centered around AMD’s graphics processing units (GPUs), will supply OpenAI with an initial 1-gigawatt of computing power beginning in the second half of 2026. What’s interesting about this partnership is, this isn’t just another chip supply agreement—it appears to be a calculated strategic move that gives OpenAI options for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock, a stake potentially worth billions. This announcement comes just two weeks after OpenAI inked a $100 billion equity and data deal with Nvidia. This marks a clear shift in OpenAI’s ambitions to vertically integrate compute, data, and model training at unprecedented scale. According to sources close to the matter, OpenAI will tap AMD’s Instinct MI300X accelerators, which have emerged as viable competitors to Nvidia’s H100 in certain high-throughput AI workloads. The company will gain access to a gigawatt-scale infrastructure footprint by late 2026—a move likely to insulate it from compute shortages that have plagued the AI industry over the past 18 months. While the dollar figure remains undisclosed, the scale of the deal—coupled with the 160 million share option—signals a valuation easily in the multibillion-dollar range. For perspective, AMD’s total market capitalization currently sits north of $180 billion, and the share options represent nearly 9% of the company’s outstanding shares. What this new structure is telling us is OpenAI isn’t just a customer—it’s positioning itself as a strategic partner, if not an indirect stakeholder. The option to own nearly a tenth of AMD gives OpenAI substantial negotiating leverage and aligns both companies’ incentives to optimize AMD’s chips for future GPT models. OpenAI is not a traditional enterprise customer, it appears to be morphing into a power broker within the semiconductor ecosystem through the following avenues: For AMD, the deal is a validation of its long-term strategy to challenge Nvidia’s AI dominance. Its MI300X chips, launched in late 2023, have seen gradual uptake in hyperscale environments. But with OpenAI’s endorsement, AMD now has a marquee customer that could catalyze broader adoption. Expect AMD’s software ecosystem—to receive increased investment, while new benchmarking metrics may emerge to compare GPT training performance across vendors. For Nvidia, the deal is less a loss and more a wake-up call. While it still dominates AI acceleration, OpenAI’s move signals that no vendor is too big to compete with. It’s also a hedge against Nvidia’s own ambitions in AI services and inference, which increasingly overlap with OpenAI’s. For the broader market, this marks a splintering of the AI hardware stack. Rather than standardizing on a single vendor, the next generation of AI firms—spurred by OpenAI’s model—may adopt multi-vendor architectures, mixing AMD, Nvidia, and even custom silicon like Google’s TPUs. The AMD partnership is more than a procurement deal—it’s frankly a masterclass in strategic positioning. OpenAI has quietly built a playbook based on ecosystem control, upstream equity leverage, and industrial-scale deployment, setting the tone for the next phase of AI’s evolution. By aligning itself with both Nvidia and AMD—and demanding favorable terms via options and equity—OpenAI ensures both security and influence over its most critical dependency: compute. In the words of Peter Drucker, “The best way to predict the future is to create it.” OpenAI isn’t waiting for the AI infrastructure to evolve—it appears to be building it, one chip deal at a time.

Asian shares were mostly higher on Thursday after US stocks hit records again following a brief stumble. Markets in mainland China gained more than 1% as they reopened following a weeklong holiday, while U.S. futures were mixed. Oil prices fell back, then recovered to trade flat after Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to pause fighting in Gaza so that the remaining hostages there can be freed in the coming days in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The acceptance of elements of a plan put forward by the Trump administration represents the biggest breakthrough in months in the devastating two-year-old war and reduced risks in the volatile region. U.S. benchmark crude added 2 cents to $62.57 per barrel as of Thursday afternoon. Brent crude, the international standard, edged up 4 cents to $66.29 per barrel. Gold shed some of its stellar gains but was still at $4,055.80 per ounce as of Thursday afternoon. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.8% to 48,572.67. Technology giant SoftBank Group surged over 11% after it announced a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged up nearly 0.3% to 8,969.80 while Taiwan's Taiex pared earlier bigger gains, closing 0.9% higher. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, on Thursday reported its third-quarter revenue climbed 30% year-on-year, beating market forecasts. Its shares gained 1.8%. On Wednesday, Wall Street resumed climbing and the price of gold pushed further past $4,000 per ounce. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% to 6,735.72, another record, a day after snapping a seven-day winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged less than 0.1% lower to 46,601.78, while the Nasdaq composite rose 1.1% to its own record of 23,043.38. Trading has been relatively muted recently following the U.S. government’s latest shutdown. The closure is delaying the release of several major economic reports that usually move the market. Stocks have been drifting without them or other signals to change expectations for cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, one of the major reasons the stock market has surged since April. Another force that’s pushed the market to records is the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Advanced Micro Devices jumped another 11.4% to add to its rally from earlier in the week, when it announced an AI-related deal. AMD was the best performing stock in the S&P 500. Right behind was Dell Technologies, which piled more gains onto its own rally from Tuesday, when it talked up its growth opportunities related to AI. Dell rose 9.1%. Poet Technologies climbed 17% and likewise added to its surge from Tuesday, when it said it raised $75 million in investment to accelerate its growth. The company sells high-speed optical engines and other products used in the AI systems market. AI-related stocks have broadly been on a tear. Nvidia has soared nearly 41% so far this year. Oracle is up 73.2% over the same time, while Palantir Technologies has more than doubled with a nearly 143% surge. The performances have been so strong that criticism is rising about prices having gone too far, like they did during the 2000 dot-com mania. That bubble ultimately imploded, and the S&P 500 halved in value. In other dealings early Thursday, the U.S. dollar rose to 153.03 Japanese yen from 152.70 yen. The euro fell to $1.1623 from $1.1629.

An AI chipmaker's stock extended its rally in the wake of a major artificial intelligence deal. Meanwhile, the latest salvo in an escalating competition between credit score providers weighed on one of the industry's big players. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.1% to set fresh closing highs, bolstered by gains in the tech sector and minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting suggesting the central bank could be on track toward more interest-rate cuts this year. The Dow was little changed. Find Investopedia's full daily market recap here. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares posted the day's best performance in the S&P 500 index with a nearly 12% jump, extending their winning streak following the announcement of a partnership with OpenAI. A slew of analysts have raised their price targets for AMD this week, with Jefferies upgrading its rating to "buy" from "hold." Dell Technologies (DELL) shares surged 9.1%, after the server maker raised its outlook, citing strong demand driven by the buildout of AI infrastructure. CEO Michael Dell said the company's broad portfolio of tech products makes it well positioned to provide the compute, storage, and network capacity necessary to deploy AI at scale. Optimism around AI helped boost other companies with exposure to the burgeoning technology as well. Shares of AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA) rose about 2% after CEO Jensen Huang said in a televised interview with CNBC that AI demand is up "substantially" this year, and that he expects it to keep growing. Equifax (EFX) announced it will provide its VantageScore 4.0 credit scores at a reduced price or free to customers, just days after Fair Isaac (FICO) said last week that it would offer its FICO credit scores directly to firms that provide credit reports to lenders, reducing reliance on Equifax and the other nationwide credit bureaus. Fair Isaac shares dropped nearly 10%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock Wednesday and reversing a portion of the gains posted after last week's announcement, while Equifax shares advanced close to 1%. Live Nation (LYV) shares fell 3.4% after the Ticketmaster parent announced a plan to offer $1.3 billion in convertible senior notes maturing in 2031. The live entertainment company intends to use the proceeds of the transaction to redeem senior notes due in 2026, repay other debt, and for general corporate purposes.
