Title: DayTrading.com's Head Analyst Issues Warning That US Stock Market Is Priced For Impossible Perfection

November 06, 2025 04:05 ET | Source: DayTrading.com DayTrading.com LONDON, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Analysis from an investor with 60,000+ hours trading under his belt and a degree in Economics from Harvard examines the current valuation landscape of U.S. equities. DayTrading.com’s Dan Buckley started by looking at basic metrics, namely the forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. This evaluates how much today’s investors are paying for each dollar of next year’s expected profit.The U.S. market is trading at roughly 23x forward earnings, which is far above the 15x times level seen in international markets. "This is an extreme gap, representing a roughly 51% void," Buckley says. "When valuations stretch this far, future returns are often modest at best and downright negative at worst." The last times the U.S. hit these sorts of valuations were: Buckley noted that since the 2021 peak, the U.S. stock market has delivered a compound annual return of around 9%, but before that, it went nearly a decade without making substantial, sustained gains. After the downturn in early 2022, U.S. equities took nearly two years just to get back to previous highs. A Market Bigger Than Its EconomyAnalysis from DayTrading.com reviewed several metrics highlighting a familiar pattern: global investors maintain a significant weighting in U.S. assets compared with the scale of the underlying economy. This imbalance reflects how influential U.S. markets have become within global portfolios and index benchmarks. U.S. Market ImbalanceThe research highlighted that the U.S. currently represents around 65% of the MSCI All Country World Index. This is a benchmark that guides billions in global investment flows. Yet by comparison, America produces only around 26% of the world’s economic output in nominal dollar terms, and it’s actually more like 15% when adjusted for the cost of living. Buckley noted that even investment vehicles labelled as "global" reflect this outsized concentration. For example, Vanguard’s Total World Stock ETF (VT), is often used as a diversified core holding by many institutions. That still invests around 66% of its assets in the U.S., with 4% just in Nvidia. "When one single chipmaker accounts for more in a portfolio than many entire countries, diversification is merely a slogan - not a reality," Buckley added. The Outsized Impact Of AIDayTrading.com's research took aim at AI, pointing out that roughly half of the S&P 500’s gains in 2025 stem from companies tied to artificial intelligence - semiconductor leaders, mega-cap platforms, and infrastructure providers. These include now household names like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Palantir (PLTR). Buckley observed that AI has become a major focus for both markets and corporate strategy, but noted that the extent and pace of its long-term impact remain to be seen. "It’s true that AI will transform many businesses and their operations," he says. "But investors are pouring money in assuming every firm will be a winner, and better yet, all at the same time. But that’s rarely how innovation pays out – just look at the dot-com era, where many went under and only a few flourished." Market Perspective: A Measured ViewBuckley emphasized that his comments should not be interpreted as forecasting a market downturn. Rather, he offered a measured assessment of current U.S. equity conditions, noting potential areas of imbalance that may emerge when market expectations are elevated. While financial markets can often behave unpredictably, Buckley observed that not all sectors appear overextended. Certain segments—including financials, healthcare, select industrials, and international markets—continue to show valuations that align more closely with underlying fundamentals. “U.S. stocks don’t necessarily need a flood of negative news to experience adjustment,” Buckley noted. “Even subtle signs of strain can have an effect when perfection is already reflected in prices.”The full analysis is available here: U.S. Stocks: Great Expectations, Even Greater Valuations About DayTrading.comDayTrading.com is a platform that provides information and market analysis for individual investors.

Title: Here's What Wall Street Analysts Are Saying About AMD's Earnings

Advanced Micro Devices investors have become harder to impress. The chipmaker yesterday posted record quarterly results and an upbeat outlook on surging demand for its data center chips—and its stock has hardly budged. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares were up about 2%, near $255, in recent trading as the broader tech sector looked to rebound from yesterday's sell-off. Here's a roundup of what Wall Street analysts said about AMD after last night's results. This year's big stock gains for chipmakers like AMD have given rise to worries about an AI bubble. The weak reaction to AMD's strong results could underscore growing uncertainty around the sector—or, at least, the rich valuations carried by stocks in it. Analysts at Oppenheimer, who maintained a neutral rating, voiced some concerns about AMD's reputation as a "second horse supplier" to AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA), preferring to stay on the sidelines while waiting to see more from AMD's ability to compete with its AI strategy. Most Wall Street analysts, however, remain bullish on the chipmaker's stock amid expectations of growing market share for AMD. Jefferies and HSBC analysts, who have "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock and $300 price targets, said they came away from Tuesday's results convinced of AMD's potential for more AI-driven growth. HSBC called AMD's recent deal with OpenAI a "game changing" development. Wedbush, which boosted its target to $290 from $270, said it is looking forward to an Analyst Day event next Tuesday for more color on its roadmap. While Wall Street's targets and ratings may be in flux, the mean price target on AMD's shares is around $275 based on Visible Alpha data and Investopedia calculations. About twice as many analysts have "buy" ratings as have "holds," with no bearish ratings currently tracked by the service. Shares of AMD have more than doubled in 2025 so far, with much of its recent gains coming in the wake of the OpenAI deal announced last month.

As bubble debate rages, a new study finds why companies are getting stuck by the AI productivity paradox Listen (5 min) Listen (5 min) There feels something toppy about the rants from Palantir’s Alex Karp and OpenAI’s Sam Altman against short sellers – in the latter’s case, entirely imaginary, as the ChatGPT maker is still a private company – given the meteoric stock-market gains so far from the AI trade. On the other hand, the possibly revolutionary impact from artificial intelligence argues that maybe it is still early days, no matter how abrasively these chieftains behave.
