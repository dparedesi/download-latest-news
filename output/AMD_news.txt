Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Ross Stores Climbs on Strong Earnings; Nvidia, Oracle, Broadcom Fall as AI Slump Persists

Shares of an off-price apparel retailer climbed after the company touted its success in the back-to-school season and issued a rosy outlook for the critical holiday quarter. Meanwhile, a database software firm remained under pressure as questions linger about its valuation and capacity to meet lofty targets. Major U.S. equities indexes bounced back Friday, clawing back losses posted in the prior session. The S&P 500 ended the final trading session of the week 0.9% higher. The Dow added 1.1%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.8%. See here for Investopedia's full wrap-up of Friday's major market moves. Shares of Ross Stores (ROST) surged 8.4% after the off-price apparel, footwear, and accessories retailer surpassed third-quarter sales and profit estimates. The company is the latest discount retailer to demonstrate it's benefiting from consumers' bargain-seeking. Ross highlighted strength in the back-to-school shopping season and raised its outlook, pointing to optimism about the crucial holiday period. Comments from John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, helped boost expectations that policymakers might cut interest rates in December. Rate-cut optimism boosted the stocks of companies exposed to the housing market, which stand to benefit from lower mortgage rates. Shares of residential construction materials supplier Builders FirstSource (BLDR) jumped 7.1%, while homebuilders D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) also notched solid gains. Insulet (PODD) shares climbed 5.8% a day after the medical device maker held an investor day event. The manufacturer of continuous glucose monitoring devices provided a three-year sales and profit forecast that exceeded consensus expectations. Several research firms raised their price targets on Insulet stock following the event. Oracle (ORCL) shares tumbled 5.7%, extending their recent downtrend and suffering the heaviest decline of any S&P 500 stock Friday. The database software and cloud computing giant has been rattled recently by concerns about its elevated valuation and heavy borrowing tied to its data center investments. Following Friday's drop, the stock is down around 28% over the past month. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slid 1% as concerns about an AI bubble continued to weigh on high-flying tech stocks. Friday's decline extended the stock's 3% loss yesterday despite the AI chip giant blowing past estimates with its third-quarter earnings report. Nvidia's largest rivals, Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), shed 1.9% and 1.1%, respectively, on Friday. Nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), whose stocks soared over the past year as they struck multi-billion dollar deals to power AI data centers, were also dogged by bubble fears. Their stocks fell a respective 3% and 2.2%.

Title: What's Going on With Oracle? Its Stock Price Has Dropped More Than 40% in Two Months.

Betting big on artificial intelligence is proving to be a double-edged sword. Shares of Oracle (ORCL), the almost-50 year-old software company turned AI play, rallied furiously during the summer as investor enthusiasm for what could be the next transformative technology surged. Lately the company's stock has given up much of those gains, down more than 40% from its all-time high in September, more than other related plays including Meta Platforms (META), Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose stocks declined at least 20% from their respective peaks. Now investors are looking at Oracle as the poster child for AI-related excess. Though concerns about AI valuations have been lingering for years, investors have recently started to pan stocks tied to the theme, weighing the amount companies are spending to develop the tech against the potential for future revenue. Oracle has come under increased scrutiny since it raised $18 billion in new debt last month to fund its infrastructure buildout, pushing its overall debt to over $100 billion. In January, Oracle announced that it was joining forces with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Japanese tech giant Softbank on a $500 billion project, called Stargate, to develop AI infrastructure in the U.S. It's become increasingly difficult to view AI-related businesses in a vacuum, because of the relationships they've created between each other with multi-billion dollar deals. In that way Oracle's hurt could turn into pain for others. Oracle's quarterly earnings report in early September blew past Wall Street expectations, sending the stock soaring 36% in one day and briefly making co-founder and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison the world's richest person. A few weeks later, however, the company announced that longtime CEO Safra Catz would be replaced as CEO, and the stock has been declining ever since. Meanwhile, traders have started to pile into Oracle's credit-default swaps as a way to both hedge and bet against the AI trade, according to a recently published story by Bloomberg. Credit default swaps are derivative contracts that serve as a kind of insurance against the possibility that a borrower will default on its debt obligations. Consensus capital expenditures for AI hyperscalers, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Meta, Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle have risen to $533 billion now from $467 billion at the start of the third-quarter earnings season, according to Goldman Sachs. Oracle is also a major part of the web of deals between AI software makers, chip companies and cloud operators, whose circular deals—possibly indicating more self-dealing than representative of organic demand—have raised eyebrows. The Wall Street Journal reported that a large chunk of the outsize revenue backlog unveiled in its September earnings report was from an OpenAI deal. "The feedback loops created by the revenue and equity relationships between some of the largest U.S. public companies and smaller AI firms increase the risk that stress in one part of the AI ecosystem affects investors across the AI complex," Goldman analysts led by Ryan Hammond said in a report published earlier this week.

Despite Nvidia Corp. reporting blockbuster fiscal third-quarter earnings that easily surpassed consensus estimates, the market's reaction demonstrated that valuation concerns and uncertainty about the sustainability of the AI boom continue to hold investor sentiment firmly in bearish territory. The chipmaker, whose graphics processing units are the essential bedrock of the current AI revolution, reported revenue of $57 billion late Wednesday, exceeding expectations and issuing similarly robust guidance for the current period, projecting fourth-quarter sales of $65 billion. The results, fueled by seemingly insatiable demand from hyperscalers like Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft, should have ignited a sector-wide rally. Instead, the surge proved short-lived. Nvidia’s stock, which initially jumped in after-hours trading and opened sharply higher on Thursday, rapidly reversed course, closing the session down approximately 3.15%. The dramatic reversal in the market’s AI bellwether dragged the entire technology sector down with it, contributing to a 2.2% plunge for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index that day. The week’s action was a stark manifestation of a broader debate raging among institutional investors: whether the multi-year AI rally has inflated into a speculative bubble. This skepticism is evidenced by a noticeable market rotation into defensive sectors. Throughout November, professional fund managers have been moving capital out of high-growth technology and AI-adjacent stocks and into sectors like healthcare, which have substantially outperformed the broader market. Tech, meanwhile, has been the S&P 500’s worst-performing sector this month. Other key AI infrastructure plays followed Nvidia’s slide. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slumped nearly 8%, and other chipmakers contributed to the sell-off, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index declining nearly 5% on Thursday. The bearish sentiment was particularly painful for pure-play AI software vendors, many of which lack the established cash flows and diverse revenue streams of the Big Tech titans. C3.ai Inc. (AI), a prominent enterprise AI application provider, saw its stock price decline over the five-day period, underscoring the vulnerability of companies whose entire valuation rests on the promise of rapidly scaling AI revenue. The stock began the week trading around $13.44 per share but retreated steadily and was down 5% over the past five days, according to Yahoo Finance. This decline means C3.ai's shares are down more than 26% in the past month, a sign that investors are reassessing the risk associated with its current business model ahead of its December earnings report. The company faces stiff competition from major cloud providers now aggressively pushing their own AI platforms, and concerns remain regarding the long path to profitability for enterprise AI solutions. The divergence between Nvidia’s underlying business strength and the stock market’s lukewarm reception illustrates that while the AI revolution is undoubtedly real, investors are no longer willing to underwrite the sector’s current valuations without clearer signs of sustained, broad-based commercialization—outside of the largest cloud and chip companies.

Title: Tech Stocks That Are Down Today: AMD, Palo Alto Networks, DataDog and Micron Technology

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © alexgo.photography / Shutterstock.com After yesterday’s debacle in which approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization was erased from the stock market, some technology stocks are still hunting a bottom. With the Nasdaq Composite now down 3% for the month of November so far, the AI rally has lost its steam for the time being as the markets wrestle with bullish fundamentals overshadowed by negative headlines. While the selling hasn’t been pretty for the bulls, it does not appear to be over, at least not yet. The following technology stocks – Micron Technology (Nasdaq: MU), Data Dog (Nasdaq: DDOG), Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) and Palo Alto Networks (Nasdaq: PANW) – are heading lower today in a most volatile time to be invested in the U.S. stock market. After sinking as much as 11% in Thursday’s market sell-off, and even dipping below the psychologically sensitive $200 threshold, the bottom has seemingly fallen out in the stock. Today MU stock is down another 3.6%. Investors have been spooked by Micron’s aggressive AI capex plans in which management conceded that its $18 billion plan would face headwinds. Investors are having to get used to these massive balance sheets committed massive amounts of capital to stay in the AI race. Also, profit taking is normal with a stock that has run up over 100% year-to-date. Rosenblatt has a whopping $300 price target on the stock, owing to its massive total addressable market and leaving room for plenty of upside potential. Morgan Stanley analysts are targeting a very bullish $325 stock price with an “overweight” rating. Therefore investors might look to any pullback in the stock as a potentially strategic buying opportunity but not for the faint of heart. After spiraling by 9.5% on Thursday, Datadog is widening its losses today, falling 3.4% as of mid-morning trading. After nearing the $200 level in November, Datadog has taken a step backwards, threatening to fall below the $150-per-share level in recent days. Year-to-date, the stock is up 8.2%, and Wall Street analysts are bullish with an average price target of $218 attached. With OpenAI integration a bullish sign, today’s declines may be technical in nature, as there is no apparent negative catalyst, but the declines are still hitting investor portfolios hard. After losing 7.8% in Thursday’s market downturn, Advanced Micro Devices stock can’t get out of its own way. AMD stock has now dipped below the $200 level, falling a steep 4% in today’s session. AMD clinched its latest all-time high last month when it rose as high as $264 per share, and investors may be taking profits off the table. AMD also has a spot in the coveted OpenAI club, having clinched a recent partnership with the maker of ChatGPT. The consensus is that the stock is worth close to $300 per share, but the ride up is likely going to be bumpy. After falling 7.4% yesterday, Palo Alto Networks is down a further 1.2% today. The cybersecurity company reported earnings and suffered a downgrade by HSBC, which lowered its view on the stock from “hold” to “reduce” with a price target of $157. PANW announced a merger in which it is buying a cloud-management company in a $3.3 billion transaction, which as the buyer could also be weighing on the stock.
