CANADA - 2025/01/24: In this photo illustration, the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo is seen ... [+] displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) AMD stock has declined by almost 5% over the last five trading days. The stock also remains down by about 19% since the start of 2024. In contrast, the S&P 500 has gained about 27% since early 2024. A couple of factors have driven the recent sell-off. The unveiling of China’s new resource-light AI model, DeepSeek, roiled the U.S. big semiconductor stocks earlier this week. DeepSeek has reportedly restructured the foundation of AI models, emphasizing software-driven resource optimization over hardware dependency and this could reduce the need for GPUs to carry out tasks. In fact, the company claims that it spent just about $5.5 million to train its V3 model, compared to the $100s of millions that the likes of OpenAI were reported to spend. While DeepSeek’s claims haven’t been verified, industry insiders have praised the company’s innovative methods, which appear to reduce the need for AI computing capacity. DeepSeek’s model is open source, and it is possible that many big tech companies could take inspiration from its methods to cut down costs. If adopted widely, this could cool off the demand for AI computing power, potentially impacting GPU demand. Now, although AMD is a distant second behind Nvidia in the GPU race, this could nevertheless impact the company. Separately, an FDA approval helped boost this company. See What’s Happening With VRTX Stock? There are also some concerns on the server CPU space as well. While AMD has been gaining share from market leader Intel over the last few years, Intel’s latest server chips, called the Granite Rapids series, are viewed as being much more compelling. The new chips have a maximum processing core count that is double their predecessors, with tests noting that Intel was largely on par with AMD in terms of performance. While the Intel chips were priced at a premium at launch last year, there have been reports that Intel significantly reduced the listed prices for the chips, with prices on the flagship chips cut by as much as 30%. In fact, the pricing per core of Intel’s top-end Granite Rapids chips is now apparently well below that of AMD’s flagship offerings. The increase in AMD stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 57% in 2021, -55% in 2022, 128% in 2023, and -18% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AMD face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Despite the recent sell-off, we remain positive on AMD stock. While Nvidia has dominated the AI accelerator market, with its GPUs which have been viewed as the best performing for AI training and inferencing, DeepSeek’s relatively lower computing power requirements could also open the door for other players to compete in the market. This could benefit AMD to an extent. If demand for high-performance GPUs potentially eases, AMD’s more affordable AI accelerators could become a good alternative for companies looking for a more favorable price-to-performance trade-off. Moreover, if the costs of running AI models trend lower, this could drive broader adoption of AI in new use cases, helping semiconductor players in the long-run. Separately, AMD’s expertise with both CPUs and GPUs could put it in a unique position as computer hardware evolves. While traditional CPUs are becoming insufficient due to limits in handling complex, parallel-processing AI workloads, GPUs excel at these AI-driven applications. AMD’s dual expertise allows it to offer a comprehensive solution that integrates both CPU and GPU capabilities, enabling systems to efficiently balance general-purpose processing with accelerated computing tasks. This could give the company an edge, particularly in the PC market. We have a $160 per share valuation for AMD, which is roughly 35% ahead of the current market price. AMD trades at just about 23x consensus 2025 earnings, which we believe is a reasonable multiple given AMD’s sales growth and prospects in the AI market. AMD’s revenues are projected to grow by about 26% by 2025. See our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for AMD.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a buzzword around Wall Street for most of 2024. AI has shown immense promise but comes with significant risks. Big AI players are dominating the broader market, but there will be opportunities for other companies to explore as the AI market continues to expand. For instance, the new administration is keen on technological advancement, and recently, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion AI initiative, a joint venture known as Stargate between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle. However, DeepSeek’s introduction shocked the U.S. companies after it released a new AI model, a much better alternative to GPT-4. DeepSeek claims to have designed the AI model in just two months and at around under $6 million using Nvidia’s less-advanced H800 chips, as reported by Reuters on January 27. Since the news broke out, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have plunged over 16%, wiping away $600 billion in market capitalization, the biggest one-day loss in U.S. history. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead, speaking to Market Domination, shared his views on DeepSeek. Moorhead was impressed by the efficiency of DeepSeek’s AI. He pointed out that the Chinese have used different techniques compared to American developers, where they were able to parse or train maybe 5% of the data, which is a 95% reduction. However, Moorhead also addressed the U.S. market drop as an “overreaction.” “I think the market overall should be going crazy because [this is the] uplift of what we were looking for [from AI],” said Moorhead. He added that the investors’ focus should be on the progress in inference. It might be a good time to invest in AI stocks, especially cheap AI stocks during the market’s overreaction. To determine the list of cheap AI stocks, we went through various news articles and stock analyses. We shortlisted the AI stocks with the minimum analyst upside of 30%, as of January 27. Cheap, in the context of this article, means stocks that Wall Street analysts believe are undervalued and will surge to higher share prices. We have ranked the cheap AI stocks to buy based on their popularity among hedge funds, as of Q3 2024, in ascending order. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Analyst Upside (as of January 27): 59% No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 107 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA’s counterpart, specializes in manufacturing semiconductors, providing processors, and graphics solutions for gaming, data centers, and embedded systems, with a core focus on high-performance computing using AI use cases. Where NVDA led the AI boom in 2024, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares plunged over 35% in the last year. Earlier in December 2024, someone asked Jim Cramer if he was worried about AMD and the stock’s underperformance. Here is what Cramer said: “This is very difficult, and you’re absolutely right to bring it up, and I’m glad you did. Here’s the problem. It is absolutely true—it is absolutely true that they’re not doing as well as Nvidia. It is true that they do not have the big Amazon orders that I’ve been looking at. But can we just remember that Lisa Su has built an amazing company, taking a lot of shares from Intel? She got the number two when it comes to the data center, when it comes to AI, and come on, she just did the great deal where she got all these engineers to come in. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has transformed its business from a struggling company to a semiconductor leader, with its stock jumping from $3 to $115 over a decade, as of January 27. In 2024, AMD introduced the Instinct MI325X AI accelerators and next-generation networking solutions, focusing on strengthening its position in the AI data center market. The company’s majority of revenue comes from data center sales. In 2024, the company acquired ZT Systems for around $5 billion. The ZT Systems purchase will further help Advanced Micro Devices in improving its market share in AI data centers. During the third quarter of 2024, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) posted a revenue of $6.82 billion, up by 18% year-over-year and beating estimates by $104.33 million. The data center revenue accounted for $3.5 billion, up 122% year-over-year, driven by significant growth in EPYC CPU and Instinct GPU sales. On January 21, Citi maintained a Buy rating on AMD shares and lowered the price target from $200 to $175. The firm expects a drop in semiconductor sales due to weaker demand in PC, automotive, and industrial markets. However, analysts project AMD’s data center business to expand, driven by AI sales. Overall, AMD ranks 4th on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts. The new regulatory environment has the technology sector eyeing prominent growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Big Tech is set to release earnings next week and investors are excited to see how the group performed in the last quarter. On January 24, Dan Ives, managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, appeared in an interview on Morning Brief at Yahoo Finance to share his 2025 outlook for the tech sector. Ives suggested that the Street is underestimating the potential of Big Tech and advises investors to “grab popcorn” for the earnings week ahead. He also shared his optimism towards the billion-dollar investments made by the group before 2025 and claimed that the “fourth industrial revolution” has just begun. He also suggested that AI spending by companies heavily depends on the use cases for the company, and emphasized the unique selling point for each of the names in mega-cap tech names. Ives stated that the ability to monetize stall bases has been the crucial factor driving the growth among tech names, which happens to mimic what the hyperscalers have done. Ives emphasized that investments in artificial intelligence are now going to play out on the consumer side and remained confident that Big Tech is a step ahead in terms of the AI journey to monetization. He believes that seeing the return on investment play out, the Street is underestimating the growth in the tech sector, not just for the earnings next week but for 2025 as a whole. He also suggested that the regulatory environment is drastically changing especially in favor of the autonomous vehicles market and expects a massive year ahead for the segment and stocks associated with self-driving technologies and autonomous vehicle driving. The year ahead looks super solid for companies in the growth sector, namely artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, biotechnology, fintech, and software. While most of it is because of the efforts made by these names over the past year, the promising regulatory environment is going to boost the position of these stocks significantly. We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 23, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

On January 22, Thomas O’Malley, an analyst at Barclays shared his stance on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The analyst highlighted that the stock has been struggling for the past year. However, O’Malley believes that AMD’s investments in AI will allow the company to achieve year-over-year growth of a few billion dollars for MI series accelerators in 2025. He also added that the company will have to wait a little longer to garner opportunities for additional market share. Despite that, the analyst gives an overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $140, adding that the stock may potentially gain 12% in the coming months. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) attributes its growth to its data center products and ever-growing demand for its Ryzen PC processors. The company is emerging in the AI and technology sector as a leader in the production of accelerators and processors. Overall, AMD ranks 4th on our list of most promising growth stocks according to Wall Street analysts.
