Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares lost ground again Thursday, a day after the chipmaker joined a sector-wide sell-off following news that the U.S. had imposed new licensing requirements on some AI chip exports to China. AMD said via a regulatory filing that the new chip curbs would see it face charges of up to $800 million related to the export of its MI308 graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip designed for compute-intensive applications, such as AI and gaming. AMD shares have tumbled 28% since the start of the year and lost 43% of their value over the past 12 months amid concerns about slowing AI infrastructure spending and the company’s inability to capture a greater share of the AI chip market from sector bellwether Nvidia (NVDA). The Trump administration's trade policies have added to the uncertainty surrounding the stock. Below we analyze AMD’s weekly chart and identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching. After breaking down below the neckline of a head and shoulders formation in December, AMD shares trended sharply lower until last week’s volume-backed rebound, potentially laying the groundwork for a longer-term reversal. Importantly, the move created a piercing pattern, a two-day candlestick price pattern that marks a potential reversal from a downward trend to an upward trend. However, selling resumed this week, with the relative strength index (RSI) edging back toward oversold levels to confirm bearish short-term price momentum. Looking ahead, investors should watch for the indicator to potentially break out above a falling wedge pattern it has formed over the past seven months. Let’s locate major support and resistance levels by applying technical analysis to AMD’s chart. AMD shares fell 0.9% to $87.50 on Thursday. The first lower level to watch sits around $76. This area would likely attract significant scrutiny near last week’s low, which also closely aligns with a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to September 2020. Selling below this level opens the door for a retest of lower support at $65. Investors could seek buying opportunities in this location near the December 2022 retracement low, a region the marked the start of a 14-month uptrend in the stock. A move higher from current levels could see the shares initially climb to around $116. This region provides a confluence of selling pressure near the 200-week moving average, last month’s countertrend high, and a range of comparable price points on the chart extending back to August 2021. Finally, a longer-term trend reversal in the stock could fuel a rally to $150. Investors who have accumulated shares during the stock’s downtrend may look for profit-taking opportunities in this location near a horizontal line that connects several minor peaks on the chart between December 2021 and August last year. Depending on the timing of such a move, AMD shares may also encounter resistance in this area from the head and shoulders’ neckline.

(Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices stock appears relatively expensive, making it a costly investment at its current price of around $93. We believe there are some minor issues with AMD stock that contribute to its high valuation. The surge in generative AI has fueled strong GPU demand, but AMD’s AI accelerator segment has fallen short of expectations. In Q4, AMD’s data center revenue—a key indicator of its AI chip performance—was $3.9 billion, missing consensus estimates. The company also issued a soft outlook, noting that current-quarter data center sales may decline 7% sequentially. Former President Donald Trump’s trade policies could also pose risks to companies like AMD. While there is limited clarity on the semiconductor tariffs due to inconsistent messaging from the White House, the threat remains for AMD, as it sources most of its chips from Taiwan and other parts of Asia. Additionally, AMD has a thinner margin buffer to withstand tariffs compared to competitors like Nvidia due to its lower gross margins. Our assessment of Advanced Micro Devices using key parameters like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows the company is strong operationally and financially, despite its rich valuation. For those seeking returns with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio offers an alternative—it has outpaced the S&P 500 and delivered over 91% returns since inception. Relative to sales and profit, AMD stock appears quite expensive compared to the broader market. • AMD has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 5.6 versus 2.8 for the S&P 500 • Its price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) is 69.0 vs. 21.3 for the S&P 500 • The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 87.7 compared to 21.3 for the benchmark Advanced Micro Devices’ Revenues have grown significantly in recent years. • The company has recorded an average revenue growth of 17.8% over the past 3 years (vs. 6.2% for the S&P 500) • Revenues have increased 13.7% from $23 Bil to $26 Bil in the past 12 months (vs. 5.3% growth for the S&P 500) • Its latest quarterly revenue rose 24.2% to $7.7 Bil from $6.2 Bil a year ago (vs. 4.9% growth for the S&P 500) AMD’s profit margins lag behind most firms covered by Trefis. • Operating Income over the last four quarters was $2.1 Bil, reflecting a low Operating Margin of 8.1% (vs. 13.1% for S&P 500) • Operating Cash Flow was $3.0 Bil, implying a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 11.8% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) AMD’s balance sheet appears robust. • The company had $2.2 Bil in debt at the end of the latest quarter versus a $152 Bil market cap (as of 4/11/2025), resulting in a very low Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.5% (vs. 21.5% for S&P 500) [Note: Lower is better] • With $5.1 Bil in cash among $69 Bil in total assets, AMD has a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 7.4% (vs. 15.0% for S&P 500) AMD has underperformed the S&P 500 during several past downturns.

The high valuation restricts upside in the near to mid-term. Instead, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio, which has outperformed a combined all-cap index benchmark. Why? Its quarterly-rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks helps capture gains in strong markets while limiting losses in downturns, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics.
