Title: Watch These Intel Price Levels as Stock Jumps After CEO Meets With Trump

Intel (INTC) shares surged again Tuesday following a meeting between CEO Lip-Bu Tan and President Donald Trump on Monday. The meeting came after Trump on Fridy demanded the immediate resignation of Tan, calling him "highly conflicted" over investments in Chinese firms. The president late Monday said on this Truth Social platform that the meeting was "very interesting" and that Tan's success is "an amazing story." Trump said that members of his cabinet would continue meeting with Tan in the coming days. Trump’s meeting with the once-storied American chipmaker’s CEO followed news on Monday that AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have agreed to pay 15% of their China chip revenues to the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses. Intel shares were up 5% at $21.75 in late trading Tuesday, adding to the previous session's gain of 3.5%. The stock is up about 9% so far this year, roughly in line with the performance of the S&P 500 in 2025 as investors asses the impact of Tan’s strategic moves, which include divesting assets, reducing employees, and reallocating resources. Tan took over the CEO role in March. Below, we take a closer look at Intel’s chart and use technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. After breaking down from an ascending channel late last month, Intel shares retraced to a multi-month trading floor before finding buying interest around this key location. More recently, the stock has continued to move higher, though the price remains below the 50- and 200-day moving averages and the relative strength index sits just below its neutral reading. However, it’s worth noting that the shares registered their highest volume in more than two weeks on Monday, indicating growing interest in the chipmaker’s stock. Let’s identify key overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares continue their recent upward momentum and also point out a major support level worth monitoring during future retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $22, currently just above the key moving averages. This location will likely attract significant attention on the chart near a horizontal line that stretches back to last August’s prominent stock gap. A decisive close above this price could see the stock climb to the $24 area. The shares may face selling pressure here near a range of corresponding price action on the chart between September and July. Buying through this area opens the door for a retest of resistance near $26. Investors who have bought the stock at lower prices could look for exit points around major peaks that formed on the chart in November, February and March. During future retracements in Intel’s share price, it’s worth keeping a close eye on the $19 level. This region on the chart would likely provide strong support near multiple troughs that mark the stock’s multi-month trading floor.
