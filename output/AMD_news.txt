Title: What's Happening With Super Micro Stock?

POLAND - 2025/01/16: In this photo illustration, the Supermicro company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Server maker Super Micro Computer stock (NASDAQ: SMCI) has moved largely sideways in 2025, trading at about $31 per share currently. The stock experienced considerable volatility in 2024, surging to over $114 per share earlier in the year before crashing by over 80% at one point due to multiple issues, although it has recovered a bit since November. What’s next for the SMCI stock, and what recent developments should investors consider? Also see Streaming Can Turn Around Disney Stock In 2025. The biggest issues for SMCI have been related to its corporate governance standards and this has been responsible for much of the sell-off over the past year. Short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the company of accounting irregularities in a detailed report last year. Moreover, the company delayed filing its financial results with the stock exchanges for FY’24, putting it at risk of being delisted by the Nasdaq. Moreover, the company’s public auditor Ernst & Young, resigned last October after it raised concerns regarding the accuracy of the company’s financial statements. That said, a couple of factors drove a recovery for the stock in recent months. The company said that it had conducted an internal probe led by a special board committee, along with attorneys, and a forensic accounting firm found no evidence of fraud or misconduct by management. The company hired BDO as its new public auditor and also received an extension from Nasdaq to file results by February 25. If SMCI submits its audited financials, it could regain compliance. On the operational front, demand for servers used for AI will likely remain strong. For perspective, semiconductor fabrication specialist TSMC, which typically reports earnings ahead of the U.S. chip giants, posted solid results for the most recent quarter, indicating that demand for AI chips remains strong. This could be viewed as a proxy for demand for SMCI’s server products, as customers of the big GPU players Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices deploy the chips using SMCI’s server solutions. SMCI previously guided net sales in a range of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion for the second quarter of the fiscal year 2025 compared to about $3.66 billion in the year-ago period. SMCI is one of a handful of stocks that have increased their value in each of the last 4 years, but that still wasn’t enough for it to consistently beat the market. Returns for the stock were 39% in 2021, 87% in 2022, 246% in 2023, and 7% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could SMCI face a similar situation as it did in 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months – or will it see a strong jump? SMCI stock trades at a very reasonable 11x consensus 2025 earnings. Growth rates are also likely to remain strong with consensus calling for about 65% revenue growth this year. That said, SMCI’s corporate governance concerns overshadow its attractive valuation in our view. Issues with internal controls and financial reporting could raise doubts about the company’s long-term ability to deliver shareholder value. Until SMCI’s new auditor signs off on its financials with its regulatory filings for the last year being filed, exercising caution would be prudent. Want to profit from shifts in the AI market?

Title: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): An Undervalued Chip Stock Near 52-Week Lows

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Undervalued Chip Stocks Near 52-Week Lows. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other undervalued chip stocks. Energy and EV stocks continue to be in focus as Donald Trump signs a bunch of executive orders that will have far-reaching impacts on many industries. He even revoked an executive order related to AI, though it addresses a matter that may not directly impact a company's sales in the near term. AI stocks are going under the radar for a few weeks but with earnings season about to get into full gear, we may not have the same opportunities in a couple of weeks that we have now. Many of the chip stocks continue to stay undervalued. The main reason is the lack of demand in the niche industries that these companies serve. But this demand will eventually shift at some point in 2025, which is what makes them so attractive to consider at this point. We came up with 10 stocks that we believe are undervalued, near their 52-week lows, and present good investment opportunities. To come up with the 10 undervalued chip stocks that are near 52-week lows, we only considered stocks with a market cap of between $10 billion and $200 billion that hit their 52-week lows recently. Close-up of Silicon Die are being Extracted from Semiconductor Wafer and Attached to Substrate by Pick and Place Machine. Computer Chip Manufacturing at Fab. Semiconductor Packaging Process. A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. AMD has nearly halved from its 52-week highs and is hovering around its 52-week lows. AMD has always played second-fiddle to Intel. However, with Intel’s recent decline, the company has become a leader in CPU technology. It now has to fulfill the same role competing against Nvidia in GPUs. So far, the company isn’t doing a good job as the stock price shows. Things could change as AI infrastructure costs become an issue for companies. Nvidia has the better technology at a much higher price tag. AMD makes weaker GPUs that are more cost-effective for small and medium tech companies. As a result, the total cost of ownership of AMD infrastructure for training AI models is quite low, which is why companies opt for its GPUs. At current levels, the stock is undervalued. It may be true that the market is not confident in AMD’s ability to dent Nvidia’s market share but it doesn't need to do that to gain a good chunk of future AI spending. Its GPU part of the business will continue to stay relevant as companies continue to set up cheaper training and inference clusters. Moreover, using AMD GPUs in combination with Nvidia GPUs is also something businesses can consider to bring down their total costs. At 24 times its forward earnings estimates, the stock is a steal. Overall AMD ranks 1st on our list of the undervalued chip stocks near 52-week lows. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
