The 2024 rack is based on the MI300X node, which is comparable to the Nvidia H100 and reflects current common practice in AI deployments in 2024/2025 timeframe. The 2030 rack is based on an AMD system and silicon design expectations for that time frame. In each case, AMD specified components like GPUs, CPUs, DRAM, storage, cooling, and communications, tracking component and defined rack characteristics for power and performance. Calculations do not include power used for cooling air or water supply outside the racks but do include power for fans and pumps internal to the racks.Performance improvements are estimated based on progress in compute output (delivered, sustained, not peak FLOPS), memory (HBM) bandwidth, and network (scale-up) bandwidth, expressed as indices and weighted by the following factors for training and inference. Performance and power use per rack together imply trends in performance per watt over time for training and inference, then indices for progress in training and inference are weighted 50:50 to get the final estimate of AMD projected progress by 2030 (20x). The performance number assumes continued AI model progress in exploiting lower precision math formats for both training and inference which results in both an increase in effective FLOPS and a reduction in required bandwidth per FLOP. vii AMD estimated the number of racks to train a typical notable AI model based on EPOCH AI data (https://epoch.ai). For this calculation we assume, based on these data, that a typical model takes 1025 floating point operations to train (based on the median of 2025 data), and that this training takes place over 1 month. FLOPs needed = 10^25 FLOPs/(seconds/month)/Model FLOPs utilization (MFU) = 10^25/(2.6298*10^6)/0.6. Racks = FLOPs needed/(FLOPS/rack in 2024 and 2030). The compute performance estimates from the AMD roadmap suggests that approximately 276 racks would be needed in 2025 to train a typical model over one month using the MI300X product (assuming 22.656 PFLOPS/rack with 60% MFU) and <1 fully utilized rack would be needed to train the same model in 2030 using a rack configuration based on an AMD roadmap projection. These calculations imply a >276-fold reduction in the number of racks to train the same model over this six-year period. Electricity use for a MI300X system to completely train a defined 2025 AI model using a 2024 rack is calculated at ~7GWh, whereas the future 2030 AMD system could train the same model using ~350 MWh, a 95% reduction. AMD then applied carbon intensities per kWh from the International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook 2024 [https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024]. IEA’s stated policy case gives carbon intensities for 2023 and 2030. We determined the average annual change in intensity from 2023 to 2030 and applied that to the 2023 intensity to get 2024 intensity (434 CO2 g/kWh) versus the 2030 intensity (312 CO2 g/kWh). Emissions for the 2024 baseline scenario of 7 GWh x 434 CO2 g/kWh equates to approximately 3000 metric tC02, versus the future 2030 scenario of 350 MWh x 312 CO2 g/kWh equates to around100 metric tCO2.

Title: The World’s Largest Technology Companies 2025: Nvidia Continues To Soar Amid AI Boom

ByRashi Shrivastava ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff. Nvidia's cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang is worth an estimated $125 billion thanks to its stock's rapid rise. The whiplash growth of artificial intelligence has minted a gaggle of billionaires and unicorns, but chip behemoth Nvidia continues to remain among the largest beneficiaries of the AI boom against all odds. The company took a hit on the $50 billion Chinese AI chip market after the Trump administration placed export controls on its H20 chips, which “effectively closed” the market to the U.S. industry, CEO Jensen Huang said in a recent earnings call. Earlier this year its stock briefly nosedived after Chinese darkhorse DeepSeek’s popular AI model launch triggered a panic sell-off. Despite challenges—external and internal—the $3.5 trillion (market cap) juggernaut has continued to capitalize on the global demand for AI infrastructure. In its latest quarterly earnings in May, Nvidia beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations and reported $44.06 billion in revenue, up 69% from a year ago. A hefty portion of its business growth, $39.1 billion of its revenue, comes from its data center operations as the company plans to build “AI factories” in the US and internationally that will help billions of people across the world run AI tools like ChatGPT. In late May, Nvidia said it will supply its powerful silicon chips to Stargate UAE, a joint project with OpenAI, Oracle and others to build a 1 gigawatt “compute cluster” in Abu Dhabi's AI campus. Such projects have helped push the company to the top 100 on Forbes’ Global 2000 ranking the world’s largest public companies. It’s now at position No. 47, 63 spots higher than last year, thanks to a period of strong business growth spurred by widespread use of generative AI. The company is now among the likes of massive tech conglomerates like Tencent (No. 37) and Taiwan Semiconductor (No. 38). The Global 2000 measures market value, revenue, profit and assets equally using the last 12 months of data as of April 25, 2025. Even as AI companies have shifted from training large language models to building applications on top of them, they require a steady supply of Nvidia's powerful silicon chips called graphics processing units (GPUs) to do what’s called inference— where a model produces an answer based on new information fed to it in real time. To top that, new so-called “reasoning AI models” that take a step-by-step approach to answer complex problems consume 100 times more computational resources, creating more demand for Nvidia’s hardware. While Nvidia is the market leader, other companies are growing as well. Semiconductor company Micron, which builds memory and data storage products, has hopped more than 400 spots on the list and is now at No. 228. And South Korean memory chip provider SK Hynix Inc is up 419 spots to No. 155. But not all semiconductor companies have benefited from the AI frenzy. Silicon Valley stalwart Intel, now at No. 488, dropped 381 spots on the Forbes’ Global 2000 this year. The company has struggled after a string of woes including declining revenue, leadership challenges and losing its market share to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Arm Holdings. In December 2024, Intel’s CEO Pat Gelsinger stepped down, and was replaced by Lip-Bu Tan in March 2025. In April, the company said its plans to lay off 20% of its staff, Bloomberg reported. The largest tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have all made gigantic bets on artificial intelligence, throwing billions of dollars and the best engineers to develop AI models and build products for their users. Those four firms are all among the top 20 of the Global 2000. South Korean conglomerate Samsung is the only tech giant based overseas in the top 20, moving up to 19th this year. One new AI beneficiary to watch is CoreWeave, which rents cloud computing power to customers and went public in March. It’s making its first appearance on the list at 1,799th this year and is likely to move up fast. It’s not profitable yet, but after the data was compiled for this year’s Global 2000 on April 25, it reported $982 million in first quarter revenue, a 420% increase compared with the first quarter last year, and its stock price has surged 250%.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed at the onset of a new week as trade talks between the U.S. and China got underway in London, pointing to a potential thaw in the icy relationship between the world's two largest economies. The S&P 500 ticked 0.1% higher, while the Nasdaq added 0.3%. The Dow was essentially flat for the day, ending Monday's session just a single point below Friday's closing level. Shares of solar technology firm Enphase Energy (ENPH) jumped 5.1%, securing the top daily performance in the S&P 500. Monday's gains extended a rally for the stock that began on Friday following reports of possible roadblocks in the Senate for the "One Big, Beautiful Bill," which includes proposals to eliminate solar tax credits that benefit Enphase and other manufacturers. Despite their recovery over the past two trading days, Enphase shares are still down more than 35% year-to-date. Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) shares advanced 4.9% after a positive clinical trial readout for Dupixent, a skin treatment developed by the biotech firm in collaboration with Sanofi (SNY). A Phase 4 study showed that Dupixent improved disease severity and symptoms for adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Semiconductor stocks moved higher, boosted by optimism that progress on trade talks between the U.S. and China could result in softer export restrictions. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares gained 4.8% after Citi analysts lifted their price target on the stock ahead of the company's artificial intelligence (AI) showcase scheduled for later this week. Shares of ON Semiconductor (ON) closed 4.4% higher, adding to strong gains posted last week as the chipmaker's CEO highlighted a recovery in automotive and industrial demand. Edison International (EIX) shares plunged 8.1%, losing the most of any S&P 500 constituent on Monday, after Wolfe Research downgraded the California-based power generator's stock to "peer perform" from "outperform." Analysts cited legal proceedings related to this year's devastating wildfires in Southern California and legislation that could expose utilities in the state to increased wildfire liability costs. Shares of fellow Golden State electricity provider PG&E (PCG) sank 6.8%. The chief financial officer (CFO) of hospital operator Universal Health Services (UHS) told an industry conference that the company has seen a slowdown in the volume of care people are seeking. According to the executive, demand for voluntary procedures surged in the wake of the pandemic as patients caught up on care they may have delayed, but has cooled off since then and remains below historical averages. UHS shares were down 6.1%. Deutsche Bank downgraded Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) stock to "sell" from "hold" on Monday, and shares of the medical device maker slid 5.6%. While analysts highlighted the widespread adoption of the company's da Vinci robotic surgery system, Deutsche Bank cited risk to Intuitive's business from third-party companies repairing the manufacturer's older surgical instruments and returning them to service, cutting into sales of newer equipment.
