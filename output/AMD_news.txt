Title: Why AMD Stock Jumped 50%?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock surged by almost 50% between 7/17/2025 and 10/15/2025. The gains come on the back of improving earnings, a recovering CPU market and surging interest in GPUs for artificial intelligence applications. AMD also recently snagged a high profile deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, to supply tens of thousands of its GPU chips for 6 gigawatts of computing capacity over the next five years. From a quantitative perspective, the gains were mainly influenced by a 19.3% shift in the company's Net Income Margin (%). While there is more to this story than just figures, let's first analyze the stock price movement by breaking it down into its contributing factors. Investing in individual stocks can be daunting, but there is great advantage in adopting a more diversified approach, such as with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth management firm – whose asset allocation strategies have yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced a loss of over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio within this asset allocation framework to offer clients superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it provides a smoother investment experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Returning to the “change”: The shifts in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue, and margins reveal a deeper narrative regarding the business and investor sentiment. Below, we highlight key developments that impacted the price movement of AMD stock. To provide context: AMD offers x86 microprocessors, accelerated processing units, chipsets, discrete and integrated GPUs, data center and professional GPUs, as well as development services across computing, graphics, enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segments. Here Is Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Moved Our Current Assessment Of AMD Stock Opinion: At the moment, we regard AMD stock as relatively pricey. Why is that? For an in-depth analysis, read Buy or Sell AMD Stock to understand the basis of our current view. Risk: AMD is also vulnerable to significant downturns. It dropped about 83% during the Dot-Com crash and nearly 91% in the Global Financial Crisis. The corrections in 2018 and inflation shock caused losses of 49% and 65%, respectively. Even the Covid sell-off was harsh, erasing over 34%. While solid fundamentals are important, during market downturns, AMD has demonstrated its capacity to incur substantial losses. Consistently identifying winners is not an easy endeavor, particularly given the volatility associated with individual stocks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a demonstrated history of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. What is the reason for this? On average, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother investment journey, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
