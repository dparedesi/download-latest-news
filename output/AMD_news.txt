Title: Is MetaX a NVIDIA Threat—or Just Another DeepSeek Market Scare?

On Dec. 17, news broke about China-based MetaX Integrated Circuits making its public debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and subsequently surging by around 700%. The company—not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META—was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD executives and develops general-purpose graphics processing units, or GPUs, for applications in artificial intelligence. Because of the AI-focus of its microchips, the company has drawn comparisons to NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA, the largest publicly traded company by market cap at $4.58 trillion. As an increasing level of global competition comes to the forefront, should shareholders be concerned about threats to NVIDIA’s dominance? On Dec. 21, CNBC reported that AI-linked IPOs in China are undergoing rapid growth, with some of the listings “delivering eye-popping gains.” One week before MetaX made its debut, another GPU designer—Moore Threads Technology—also had its IPO, with its shares gaining approximately 400% thereafter. At the same time, investors continued to rotate out of U.S.-listed tech stocks as concerns about elevated valuations, market concentration, and the specter of an AI bubble looms over the S&P 500. The MetaX news accelerated selling of NVDA, which, after hitting its all-time high in late October 2025, had fallen by more than 17% by Dec. 17 before finding its footing. For analysts and pundits, there was no shortage of correlations being drawn between MetaX’s market disruption and the one investors grappled with on Jan. 27, 2025, when news of DeepSeek—a generative AI company based in China—would present an alternative to OpenAI at comparatively attractive prices. In turn, a majority of large and mega-cap U.S. equities with any exposure to AI underwent a short-term sell-off. Within days, hundreds of billions of dollars in Magnificent Seven market cap was wiped out. But it turned out that DeepSeek, despite its low-cost models that could run training models at a fraction of the compute power as OpenAI, was a flash in the pan. Numerous issues—from government censorship and a notable security breach to slowdowns in updates and uninspiring subsequent models—saw the company’s hype die down as quickly as it arrived. Now, nearly 12 months later, the market could be seeing another iteration of that with MetaX. NVIDIA’s dominance in the broad AI landscape, and in the GPU industry in particular, is unquestioned. But importantly, when the market overreacts to newcomers—as it is prone to do—oftentimes the investors who panic-sell are the ones who suffer long term. Over the last three years, NVIDIA has delivered 11 earnings beats in the past 12 quarters. Over the same period, the company has beat on revenue estimates 12 out of 12 times. MetaX, on the other hand, continues to operate at a loss. Analysts have determined that the company’s technology lags that of mainstream competitors by two to three years. Additionally, being based in China, the company relies heavily on domestic, state-sanctioned investments, which put into question the viability of its long-term success. Compounding matters, as CNBC reported, it isn’t easy for overseas investors to partake in these rallies. According to the outlet, “foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs.” Fund manager Yang Tingwu of Tongheng Investment told Reuters that the surge in these China-based AI companies’ stock prices is very likely a run-up that will result in the markets “witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years.” Meanwhile, NVIDIA is less than 9% removed from its all-time high, has gained nearly 1,352% over the past five years, and finds itself at the center of a circular financing network that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. NVIDIA and its ilk are nearly cemented in strategic partnerships with other AI companies, including OpenAI—a role that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based fabless GPU company is unlikely to relinquish any time soon. The stock maintains a consensus Buy rating based on 53 analysts that cover it, with its average 12-month price target of $262.14 representing potential upside of more than 39%. Over the past year, institutional owners have been pouring money into the company to the tune of $339.17 billion compared to outflows of $116.47 billion. Another strong indication of health is that current short interest stands at just 1.13% of the float. Before you consider NVIDIA, you'll want to hear this.

Title: What Is One of the Best Chip Stocks to Hold for the Next 10 Years?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Courtesy of Advanced Micro Devices Over the next decade, you’ll surely want to own at least one artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock. You might assume that all you need is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and nothing else. However, even though NVIDIA is the market’s darling, your best pick could actually be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock. Even though it’s a giant company, Advanced Micro Devices is an underdog in some respects. Unlike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices isn’t a member of the Magnificent Seven group of highly favored U.S. mega-cap stocks. This isn’t to suggest that buying and holding AMD stock for 10 years is a risk-free investment. Right now, we’ll tackle the red flags that must be acknowledged for long-term Advanced Micro Devices shareholders. In the end, though, you may be open to a buy-and-hold share position as Advanced Micro Devices is a chipmaking challenger with hyper-scaling potential. One possible deal-breaker for income investors is that AMD stock doesn’t pay a dividend. Consequently, you’ll need the share price to rise in order to make a profit. Meanwhile, value investors might take issue with Advanced Micro Devices’ valuation. Specifically, the company has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 113x. In addition, AMD stock is already up 135% over the past five years. Given the triple-digit P/E ratio and the stock’s price action, some value investors may not be willing to take a chance on Advanced Micro Devices. Those are valid objections, but to be fair, Advanced Micro Devices stock just pulled back nearly 20% from $167. Since the stock has a good track record of recovering from drawdowns, there appears to be a dip-buying opportunity here. Besides, if Advanced Micro Devices is a robust revenue and earnings grower, then the high P/E ratio don’t have to be a deal-breaker. With that in mind, let’s perform a thorough checkup on Advanced Micro Devices’ financial health. Advanced Micro Devices’ high P/E ratio and lack of a dividend are legitimate reasons to reduce your position size in AMD stock. Nevertheless, you’ll probably leave a lot of money on the table if you don’t own some shares of Advanced Micro Devices during the next 10 years. All in all, Advanced Micro Devices is an undeniable sales and income grower. To prove this point, we can observe the company’s results from the quarter ended September 27, 2025. Impressively, Advanced Micro Devices’ net revenue grew 35.6% year over year, from $6.819 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $9.246 billion. Nearly half of that revenue stemmed from Advanced Micro Devices’ Data Center segment; this suggests that the company continues to benefit from AI-associated sales. Turning to the bottom-line results, Advanced Micro Devices’ net income surged 61.2%, from $771 in the year-earlier quarter to $1.243 billion. Also during that time frame, the company’s cash and cash equivalents increased 27%, from $3.787 billion to $4.808 billion. So evidently, Advanced Micro Devices remains a cash-rich chipmaker that’s on a powerful growth trajectory. While U.S. chip sales are crucial to Advanced Micro Devices’ business model, it definitely appears that the company is making headway in China’s chip market. To be more specific, Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices’ MI308 AI accelerators. This is important because investors need to think globally, not just locally, over the next 10 years. China is a major chip market, and Advanced Micro Devices has a long-term growth opportunity there. Advanced Micro Devices made a savvy move in designing its MI308 chips to be compatible with export restrictions. Furthermore, the company has secured export licenses for these chips and is prepared to pay a 15% fee to the U.S. on approved sales in China. Also, it’s a positive sign that Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su recently met with Chinese Commerce ​Minister Wang ‌Wentao in Beijing. They “exchanged views on the company’s business ⁠development in ​China and ​strengthening cooperation with China,” according to the ‍ministry. Sure, NVIDIA is also making headway into China’s chip market. At the same time, however, NVDA stock may have already priced in the company’s progress in this region. In contrast, Advanced Micro Devices’ growth story in China is still developing and the market needs time to recognize this. Give it a few years, and you should see AMD stock reflect strong chip sales in both the U.S. and China. In the final analysis, there’s no need to overload your portfolio with AMD stock. Just holding a moderately sized share position for 10 years will, most likely, put you in a profitable position without undue risk. While Advanced Micro Devices doesn’t pay a dividend and appears overvalued at first glance, I still encourage you to give the company a chance. If AI chip sales remain strong and Advanced Micro Devices keeps on growing its sales and profits, there’s an attractive reward-to-risk profile here for buy-and-hold investors.
