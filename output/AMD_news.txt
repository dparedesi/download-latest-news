The chipmaker granted OpenAI a warrant for up to a 10% stake, tightly aligning their success. This massive agreement cements AMD as a core partner in OpenAI’s infrastructure plan. The battle for supremacy in the AI chip market just reached a critical new phase. In a move that sent its stock soaring, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced a major multi-year partnership with OpenAI. The deal has the potential to fundamentally reshape the industry’s supply chain. OpenAI, which is racing to build the immense computing power needed for the next generation of artificial intelligence, has committed to deploying an astonishing 6 gigawatts (GW) of AMD Instinct GPUs. This agreement is far more than a simple hardware purchase. It represents one of the largest GPU deployment contracts in AI history and serves as a powerful endorsement of AMD’s accelerator technology. In exchange for this massive, multi-year commitment, AMD has granted OpenAI a warrant to acquire up to 160 million shares. This could eventually translate to a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker. The unconventional arrangement aims to tie the success of the two companies together. The vesting of the shares is directly linked to OpenAI hitting deployment milestones—starting with the initial 1 GW rollout of AMD’s MI450 series chips in late 2026—and the continued increase in AMD’s share price. AMD CEO Lisa Su noted that this incentive motivates OpenAI to ensure the successful integration of AMD’s hardware, turning the customer into a strategic partner invested in the chipmaker’s long-term success. The sheer scale of this deployment reflects the AI industry’s relentless demand for computing power. This 6 GW commitment to AMD, combined with OpenAI’s prior agreements with other vendors (including a major 10 GW infrastructure deal with Nvidia), confirms that the AI startup is proceeding with a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure roadmap. For AMD, this partnership is a turning point. The firm expects the agreement to net tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. It also forecasts that the ripple effect will generate over $100 billion in new revenue from OpenAI and subsequent customers over the next four years. Nvidia still commands the lion’s share of the market, though. However, this deal firmly establishes AMD as a serious player capable of supplying the advanced computing technology needed for AI’s hyperscale future. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines.

Title: OpenAI Inks Landmark Deal with Nvidia Rival AMD for AI Chips
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/10/06/openai-inks-landmark-deal-with-nvidia-rival-amd-for-ai-chips/
Time Published: 2025-10-06T14:38:29Z

OpenAI and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have reached a groundbreaking deal that could see Sam Altman’s company take a 10 percent stake in the chipmaker. The deal comes shortly after OpenAI signed a massive deal with Nvidia, the dominant player in the AI chip arena. CNBC reports that the partnership, which was announced on Monday, has caused AMD stock to skyrocket by more than 28 percent in morning trading. Under the terms of the agreement, OpenAI will deploy six gigawatts of AMD’s Instinct graphics processing units (GPUs) over multiple years and across multiple generations of hardware. The rollout will commence with an initial 1-gigawatt deployment of chips in the second half of 2026. As part of the deal, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock. The vesting of these shares is tied to both deployment volume and AMD’s share price milestones. The first tranche will vest upon the first full gigawatt deployment, with additional tranches unlocking as OpenAI scales up to six gigawatts and meets key technical and commercial milestones required for large-scale rollout. If OpenAI exercises the full warrant, it could acquire approximately 10 percent ownership in AMD, based on the current number of outstanding shares. While the exact dollar amount of the deal was not disclosed, OpenAI stated that it was worth billions. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, praised the partnership, stating, “AMD’s leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.” The deal positions AMD as a core strategic partner to OpenAI, marking one of the largest GPU deployment agreements in the artificial intelligence industry to date. The partnership is expected to help ease industrywide pressure on supply chains and reduce OpenAI’s reliance on a single vendor, but is likely to rub AI hardware giant Nvidia the wrong way. Breitbart News previously reported that OpenAI and Nvidia signed a massive $100 billion equity-and-supply agreement: Nvidia has unveiled plans to invest a staggering $100 billion in OpenAI, the AI company behind ChatGPT. The announcement sent shockwaves through the global chip sector, with companies linked to Nvidia experiencing a notable boost in their share prices. According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the deal between the two tech giants is set to be on an unprecedented scale. OpenAI intends to construct and deploy Nvidia systems that will require 10 gigawatts of power, equivalent to the output of between four and five million graphics processing units (GPUs). In a blog post, Nvidia calls the deal “the Biggest AI Infrastructure Deployment in History:” Shares of Nvidia fell more than one percent on Monday morning trading following the news of the OpenAI-AMD deal. OpenAI is also in talks with Broadcom to build custom chips for its next generation of models. For AMD, the partnership is both a commercial milestone and a validation of its next-generation Instinct roadmap. After years of trailing Nvidia in the AI accelerator market, AMD now has a flagship customer at the forefront of the generative AI boom. AMD CEO Lisa Su said the deal creates “a true win-win enabling the world’s most ambitious AI buildout and advancing the entire AI ecosystem.” Read more at CNBC here.

Δ The collaboration will see the companies develop artificial intelligence data centers running on AMD processors, according to a Monday (Oct. 6) press release. “This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI’s full potential,” OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman said in the release. “AMD’s leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.” With this deal, OpenAI pledged to purchase 6 gigawatts worth of AMD’s chips, beginning with the MI450 chip next year, the release said. It will buy the chips either directly or through OpenAI’s cloud computing partners, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Monday. As part of the agreement, AMD issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock, designed to vest as specific milestones are reached, according to the release. The first tranche vests with the initial 1-gigawatt MI450 chip deployment, with more tranches vesting as purchases scale up to 6 gigawatts. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue “Vesting is further tied to AMD achieving certain share-price targets and to OpenAI achieving the technical and commercial milestones required to enable AMD deployments at scale,” the release said. The deal comes on the heels of chipmaker Nvidia’s $100 billion pledge to OpenAI, a deal that, when realized, would be the largest private company investment on record. AMD CEO Lisa Su said the deal will result in tens of billions of dollars in new revenue for the chip company over the next half-decade, per the WSJ report. She was interviewed jointly with Altman, who said demand for inference computing has jumped in tandem with the rise of AI tools like large language models. “It’s hard to overstate how difficult it’s become” to get sufficient computing power, Altman said, according to the report. “We want it super fast, but it takes some time.” Inference is when a trained model is applied to new inputs in real time, a “constant, real-time activity” that never stops, PYMNTS reported Sept. 22. Keeping ChatGPT online alone reportedly costs OpenAI tens of millions of dollars each month. Altman and Su said their collaboration gives both companies incentives to commit to the boom in AI infrastructure, WSJ reported. “It’s a win for both of our companies, and I’m glad that OpenAI’s incentives are tied to AMD’s success and vice-versa,” Su said, per the report.

Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time SAN FRANCISCO — AMD said on Monday it will supply artificial intelligence chips to OpenAI in a multi-year deal that would bring in tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue and give the ChatGPT creator the option to buy up to roughly 10% of the chipmaker. The deal offers OpenAI an opportunity to take a stake in one of Nvidia’s most formidable rivals and is a powerful endorsement of Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD’s) AI chips and software. “We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry,” AMD executive vice president Forrest Norrod told Reuters on Sunday. The agreement covers the deployment of hundreds of thousands of AMD’s AI chips, or graphics processing units (GPUs), equivalent to six gigawatts, over several years beginning in the second half of 2026. AMD said OpenAI would build a one-gigawatt facility based on its forthcoming MI450 series of chips beginning next year, and that it would begin to recognize revenue then. AMD executives expect the deal to net tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. Because of the ripple effect of the agreement, AMD expects to receive more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers, they said. “Other people are going to come along with it because this is really the pioneer, a pioneer in the industry that has a lot of influence over the broader ecosystem,” AMD strategy chief Mat Hein said. The deal with AMD will help OpenAI build enough AI infrastructure to meet its needs, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimate AMD will generate revenue of $32.78 billion this year, according to LSEG data. As part of the arrangement, AMD issued a warrant that gives OpenAI the ability to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD for 1 cent each over the course of the chips deal. The warrant vests in tranches based on milestones that the two companies have agreed on. The first tranche will vest after the initial shipment of MI450 chips set for the second half of 2026. The remaining milestones include specific AMD stock price targets that escalate to $600 a share for the final installment of stock to unlock. AMD has 1.62 billion shares outstanding and is valued at $267.23 billion, according to LSEG data. Its shares closed on Friday at $164.67. OpenAI has a valuation of $500 billion. OpenAI has worked with AMD for years, providing inputs on the design of older generations of AI chips such as the MI300X. The San Francisco-based AI company has been taking a number of steps to ensure it has the chips needed for its future needs. In September, Nvidia announced an investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI that included a plan to supply at least 10 gigawatts worth of Nvidia systems. The plan includes OpenAI deploying a gigawatt of Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin chips in late 2026. In addition to using Nvidia hardware, cloud computing giants such as Alphabet’s Google and Amazon build their own in-house processors. Similarly, OpenAI is in the process of developing its own silicon for AI use and has partnered with Broadcom, Reuters reported last year. OpenAI and its main backer Microsoft also announced last month that they had signed a non-binding agreement to restructure OpenAI into a for-profit entity, signaling further changes in the governance of the fast-growing AI company. A person familiar with the matter said the deal with AMD does not change any of OpenAI’s ongoing compute plans, including that effort or its partnership with Microsoft. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Shares of AI chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices are in the spotlight on Monday, after the company announced a multibillion-dollar partnership with Sam Altman's OpenAI to collaborate on artificial intelligence data centres. AMD's stock price surged a sharp 31% to $215.62 on the back of this development, as of 7:20 p.m. IST. The deal could see Altman acquire a 10% stake in the chipmaker, which may prove to be one of the most direct challenges to industry leader Nvidia. Nvidia's premarket share price was trading marginally in the red at the same hour. OpenAI plans to deploy six gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over several years and across multiple hardware generations, the companies announced. The partnership will begin with a 1-gigawatt deployment in the second half of 2026. As part of the deal, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant to purchase up to 160 million shares of its common stock. The first tranche will vest upon completion of the initial 1-gigawatt rollout, with additional tranches unlocking as OpenAI scales to six gigawatts and hits key technical and commercial milestones necessary for large-scale deployment. If fully exercised, the warrant would give OpenAI roughly a 10% stake in AMD, based on the chipmaker's current number of outstanding shares. "AMD's leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster," OpenAI CEO Altman said in a statement announcing the agreement. The deal positions AMD as a key strategic partner for OpenAI and represents one of the largest GPU procurement agreements in the AI industry to date. The move comes just two weeks after OpenAI finalised a landmark $100 billion equity-and-supply agreement with Nvidia. In contrast to the AMD arrangement, that deal saw Nvidia taking an ownership stake in OpenAI. "This is a true win-win enabling the world's most ambitious AI buildout and advancing the entire AI ecosystem," AMD CEO Lisa Su said.

The deal offers OpenAI an opportunity to take a stake in one of Nvidia's most formidable rivals and is a powerful endorsement of Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD's) AI chips and software. "We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry," AMD executive vice president Forrest Norrod told Reuters on Sunday. The agreement covers the deployment of hundreds of thousands of AMD's AI chips, or graphics processing units (GPUs), equivalent to six gigawatts, over several years beginning in the second half of 2026. AMD said OpenAI would build a one-gigawatt facility based on its forthcoming MI450 series of chips beginning next year, and that it would begin to recognize revenue then. AMD executives expect the deal to net tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. Because of the ripple effect of the agreement, AMD expects to receive more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers, they said. "Other people are going to come along with it because this is really the pioneer, a pioneer in the industry that has a lot of influence over the broader ecosystem," AMD strategy chief Mat Hein said. The deal with AMD will help OpenAI build enough AI infrastructure to meet its needs, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimate AMD will generate revenue of $32.78 billion this year, according to LSEG data. As part of the arrangement, AMD issued a warrant that gives OpenAI the ability to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD for 1 cent each over the course of the chips deal. The warrant vests in tranches based on milestones that the two companies have agreed on. The first tranche will vest after the initial shipment of MI450 chips set for the second half of 2026. The remaining milestones include specific AMD stock price targets that escalate to $600 a share for the final installment of stock to unlock. AMD has 1.62 billion shares outstanding and is valued at $267.23 billion, according to LSEG data. Its shares closed on Friday at $164.67. OpenAI has a valuation of $500 billion. OpenAI has worked with AMD for years, providing inputs on the design of older generations of AI chips such as the MI300X. The San Francisco-based AI company has been taking a number of steps to ensure it has the chips needed for its future needs. In September, Nvidia announced an investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI that included a plan to supply at least 10 gigawatts worth of Nvidia systems. The plan includes OpenAI deploying a gigawatt of Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin chips in late 2026. In addition to using Nvidia hardware, cloud computing giants such as Alphabet's Google and Amazon build their own in-house processors. Similarly, OpenAI is in the process of developing its own silicon for AI use and has partnered with Broadcom, Reuters reported last year. OpenAI and its main backer Microsoft also announced last month that they had signed a non-binding agreement to restructure OpenAI into a for-profit entity, signaling further changes in the governance of the fast-growing AI company. A person familiar with the matter said the deal with AMD does not change any of OpenAI's ongoing compute plans, including that effort or its partnership with Microsoft. (Reporting by Max A.

(File image: Reuters/Dado Ruvic) SAN FRANCISCO: AMD will supply artificial intelligence chips to OpenAI in a multi-year deal that would bring in tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue and give the ChatGPT creator the option to buy up to roughly 10 per cent of the chipmaker. Shares of the chipmaker surged more than 34 per cent on Monday (Oct 6), putting them on track for their biggest one-day gain in over nine years and adding roughly US$80 billion to the company's market value. The deal, latest in a string of investment commitments, underscores OpenAI and the broader AI industry's voracious appetite for computing power as companies race toward developing AI technology that meets or exceeds human intelligence. "We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry," AMD executive vice president Forrest Norrod told Reuters on Sunday.

The chipmaker is expected to report revenue of US$32.78 billion this year, according to LSEG data. In contrast, analysts are expecting Nvidia to report revenue of US$206.26 billion for the current fiscal year. "AMD has really trailed Nvidia for quite some time. So I think it helps validate their technology," said Leah Bennett, chief investment strategist at Concurrent Asset Management. Shares of Nvidia dipped more than 1 per cent. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the AMD deal will help his startup build enough AI infrastructure to meet its needs. It was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the massive deal. OpenAI, which is valued at US$500 billion, generated around US$4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025 and burned through US$2.5 billion in cash, according to media reports. As part of the arrangement, AMD issued a warrant that gives OpenAI the ability to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD for 1 cent each over the course of the chip deal.

In September, Nvidia announced a deal to supply OpenAI with at least 10 gigawatts worth of its systems. In contrast with the startup's deal with AMD where it will take a stake in the chipmaker, Nvidia will invest US$100 billion in the ChatGPT parent under the terms of the agreement announced in September. Taking a stake in AMD could give OpenAI "the power to potentially influence corporate strategy. With Nvidia, OpenAI is simply the client and not a part-owner," said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell. OpenAI has worked with AMD for years, providing inputs on the design of older generations of AI chips such as the MI300X. The San Francisco-based AI company has been taking a number of steps to ensure it has the chips needed for its future needs. Altman has floated expectations of reaching 250 gigawatts of compute in total by 2033, The Information has reported. OpenAI's deal last month with Nvidia includes the deployment of one gigawatt of the chip giant's next-generation Vera Rubin processors in late 2026.
