Exciting news for investors! Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has announced ambitious growth projections for its data center business. The company forecasts a potential $100 billion in annual revenue from data center chips within the next five years, accompanied by a threefold increase in profits. The Santa Clara, California-based chip design company saw its stock initially dip by 2.7% to $237.52 after market close, but quickly rebounded with a 4% increase in volatile trading as markets opened. This positive momentum builds upon a 16% increase in AMD’s share price since October 6th. This rise coincided with AMD securing a multi-year agreement with OpenAI, a deal expected to generate tens of billions of dollars annually. While this agreement may not immediately challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the AI chip market, it signals growing confidence in AMD’s chip technology. The company’s optimistic financial outlook, revealed on Tuesday, is anticipated to alleviate investor concerns. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the data center chip market is expected to reach a staggering $1 trillion by 2030. She shared this forecast at an analyst day event in New York, highlighting the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI) in driving this growth. The market includes AMD’s general-purpose processors, networking chips, and specialized AI chips. “This is a very exciting market,” Su stated. “The data center is the largest growth opportunity right now, and AMD is incredibly well positioned for it.” Over the next three to five years, AMD projects an annual growth rate of 35% for its overall business, with a remarkable 60% growth rate specifically for its data center business, as announced by AMD’s Chief Financial Officer, Jean Hu. The company is targeting earnings per share of up to $20 within this timeframe. For context, Reuters cited an LSEG estimate predicting AMD’s 2025 profit at $2.68 per share. The future looks bright for AMD in the high-performance computing and artificial intelligence landscape. Nep123.com is your reliable source for news, stories, and insights from Nepal.

Title: AMD CEO Lisa Su Said AI Demand Is ‘Insatiable.’ The Chipmaker's Stock Is Soaring

Advanced Micro Devices shares are getting a boost from its outlook. The stock was up about 10% in early trading Wednesday, leading gains on the S&P 500 after the chipmaker yesterday unveiled ambitious new targets at its first analyst day. (Read our daily markets coverage here.) Chip stocks were broadly rising, too, with the SOX index of semiconductor shares up 1.5%. CEO Lisa Su on Tuesday told analysts the company is seeing "insatiable" AI demand, suggesting that its revenue growth could climb to 35% per year over the next three to five years, with gross margins of 55% to 58%. AMD (AMD) said last week its third-quarter adjusted gross margin was 54%. AMD said it now believes its total addressable AI market could be over $1 trillion by 2030, up from a previous target of $500 billion by 2028. The jump in AMD's stock price Wednesday could point to growing investor optimism in opportunities for the chipmaker, long seen as occupying a distant second place to AI chip leader Nvidia. Several Wall Street analysts said they remain bullish on the chipmaker's stock following the event, though they declined to raise their price targets amid persistent worries about an AI bubble and the possibility that AMD's upward momentum could reverse course if it pops. Citi analysts, who maintained a neutral rating for the shares, said they believe AMD's targets "will likely be maintained or exceeded until the AI bubble bursts but our conversations with investors indicate many are already there." "We believe the AI bubble will likely burst within a couple years and could result in much lower estimates," they wrote. Shares of AMD have roughly doubled in value in 2025 so far, with most of those gains coming in the past few months after a string of big AI deals, including one with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

Title: US stocks are drifting around their records as AMD rallies

By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks drifted around their records in a mixed day of trading Wednesday. The S&P 500 added 0.1% and neared its all-time high set a couple weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 327 points, or 0.7%, to set a record for the second straight day, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%. Advanced Micro Devices was at the front of the market. It rallied 9% after CEO Lisa Su said the chip company is expecting better than 35% of annual compounded revenue growth over the next three to five years. She credited “accelerating AI momentum.” Stocks benefiting from the artificial-intelligence frenzy have been shaky recently, as investors question whether how much more they can add to already spectacular gains. Their sensational performances have been one of the top reasons the U.S. market has hit records despite a slowing job market and high inflation. Their prices have shot so high, though, that critics say they’re reminiscent of the 2000 dot-com bubble, which ultimately burst and dragged the S&P 500 down by nearly half. Nvidia came into the day with a 4.6% drop for the month so far, for example, after its stock price more than doubled in four of the last five years. The biggest player in AI chips swung between gains and losses throughout Wednesday. Palantir Technologies, another AI darling, fell 3.6% for one of the day’s larger losses in the S&P 500. Similar questions about priciness are dogging the rest of the U.S. market, though not as pointedly as for Big Tech and AI superstars. One way for stock prices to look less expensive is for companies to deliver big growth in profits. On Holdings jumped 18% after the Swiss shoe and apparel company reported a much bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It reported growth in sales from around the world, with the strongest coming from Asia. But even beating expectations may not be enough for some stocks. Circle Internet Group fell 12.2% even though it reported profit for the latest quarter that trounced analysts’ estimates. The issuer of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies has seen its stock price fall since it got near $300 in June, just a few weeks after its initial price offering of $31. It’s now below $87. All told, the S&P 500 rose 4.31 points to 6,850.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 326.86 to 48,254.82, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 61.84 to 23,406.46. Another way for stock prices to look less expensive is if interest rates fall. That’s because bonds paying lower yields can encourage investors to pay higher prices for other kinds of investments. In the U.S. bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.06% from 4.13% late Monday after trading resumed following Tuesday’s Veterans Day holiday. Traders still see a nearly 2-in-3 chance that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December, according to data from CME Group. That’s despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying a third cut for the year is far from a sure thing. Fed officials are worried about the potential of giving still-high inflation more fuel. The Fed has been in a difficult spot recently because the U.S. government has not been publishing its usual updates on the job market, inflation and other areas of the economy. That’s restricted its view of how things are going, though the nation’s longest-ever shutdown appears to be nearing an end. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. Germany’s DAX returned 1.2%, and South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.1% for two of the world’s bigger gains. AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.

Stock futures are higher this morning after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high on Tuesday; the House of Representatives is poised to vote on legislation to end the six-week U.S. government shutdown; Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares are rising after the chipmaker projected strong revenue growth over the coming years; the White House is reportedly examining measures that could limit the influence of proxy advisers and index-fund managers in shareholder voting; and shares of On Holding are soaring after the sneaker maker posted strong earnings and raised its guidance. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher as investors keep close tabs on developments in Washington D.C., with a key vote scheduled later today that could end government shutdown. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 0.2% recently after the blue-chip index closed at a record high on Tuesday. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. Bitcoin was at just under $105,000, up from an overnight low of around $102,500. Gold futures rose 0.6% to $4,140 an ounce, trading near their highest levels in three weeks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer loans, was at 4.08%, down from the previous close of 4.11%. The House of Representatives is set to vote on a spending measure that would reopen the government through January and end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. A key House committee moved the Senate-passed legislation forward in an early-Wednesday vote, rejecting attempts by some Democrats to amend the legislation. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the legislation, bringing an end to the shutdown, which is now in its 43rd day. The work stoppage has contributed to a freeze on U.S. government economic reports, while also creating staffing issues in the air traffic control system that prompted officials to reduce the number of flights. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped in premarket trading after CEO Lisa Su said the chipmaker’s revenue could grow by 35% annually over the next three-to-five years owing to continued strong demand for artificial intelligence chips. At the company’s first-ever analysts day on Tuesday, Su said that the company’s AI data center business could grow by 80% annually over the same period, potentially hitting tens of billions of dollars in sales by 2027. AMD also said its gross margins would come in at around 55% to 58% in coming years, ahead of analysts' forecasts. Shares of AMD, which have nearly doubled in value since the start of the year, were up 6% ahead of the bell. The White House is looking at new measures that would reduce the influence of proxy advisers and index-fund managers on shareholder voting, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The report said that Trump administration officials are considering executive orders that could ban proxy advisers such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis from making recommendations on shareholder votes. Officials are also looking to curtail the influence of index-fund managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, according to the report. The influence of proxy firms has been criticized by top corporate executives, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who faced resistance from proxy advisers ahead of a recent shareholder vote on his trillion-dollar pay package. Shares of On Holding (ONON) are soaring in premarket trading after the Roger Federer-backed Swiss sneaker maker reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and raised its full-year outlook. On posted adjusted earnings of 0.43 Swiss francs ($0.54) per share on net sales that jumped 25% year-over-year to 794.4 million Swiss francs ($994.2 million), well above Wall Street estimates. The Zurich-based company, which lifted its guidance for a third straight quarter, now expects full-year sales to grow by 34% on a constant-currency basis, up from a previous projection of at least 31%. Profitability is also expected to rise. On co-founder and executive co-chairman Caspar Coppetti told CNBC the company won't be offering Black Friday deals and will be "full price through the holiday season." On shares, which through yesterday's close had shed more than a third of their value this year, were up 8% in recent trading.

Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP financial outlook and long-term financial model typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, income tax provision, and other non-recurring items such as impairment charges and acquisition-related costs. A reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time as the timing and impact of such adjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control. Such events may include unanticipated changes in AMD’s effective tax rate, unanticipated one-time charges related to asset impairments, unanticipated acquisition-related expenses, unanticipated gains, losses, and impairments, and other unanticipated non-recurring items not reflective of ongoing operations. All statements made in this press release are based on current expectations as of November 11, 2025, and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements made in this press release except as may be required by law.
