Title: IPO pops are back, AI starts to pay off for Big Tech, and Palo Alto Networks spends big

UPDATED 11:37 EDT / AUGUST 01 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Palo Alto Networks is charging full speed ahead on attempting to be as much of a one-stop cyber shop as is possible in the fast-changing field, buying CyberArk for a stunning $25 billion. Investors weren’t especially happy, but properly integrated, it’s probably worthwhile long-term. And as Zeus Kerravala notes, it’s a good addition for its artificial intelligence play. IPOs keep on coming, just this week from Ambiq and Figma — the latter up more than threefold so fast trading had to be halted, and then topped $140 in after-hours trading. Pops are back, baby. Of course, those represent money left on the table, but they could spur more of the tech industry’s prime wealth-building mechanisms that have been in short supply for years now. As for Figma’s success, you can thank former Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Kahn, of all people, Alex Wilhelm notes, since she resisted a deal with Adobe three years ago. Just when you thought AI funding couldn’t get any crazier… it does. OpenAI reportedly is in talks to raise $8.3 billion at a stunning $300 billion valuation, while Anthropic apparently is in talks to raise $5 billion at a $170 billion valuation and Mistral is looking for $1 billion at a $10 billion valuation. Vast Data also is reported to be looking at a multibillion-dollar funding at a $30 billion valuation. And get a load of all those $100 million-plus fundings of other AI or adjacent companies below. The dot-com boom had nothing on this…. Uh-oh. Some big tech companies are making a lot of money thanks in part to the AI boom — not just from selling it but from using its efficiencies internally, as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out. But they’re also spending a lot to meet that demand, as Microsoft, Meta and Amazon showed this week. In fact, that’s what tripped up Amazon a day later, as its guidance came in light, suggesting its AI investments may take longer to pay off. For now, at least, their core businesses are doing well enough to support that spending. Next week there’s still a lot of earnings reports coming from Advanced Micro Devices, Supermicro, Uber, Lyft, Palantir and many more. Speaking of Zuckerberg, he thinks “superintelligence,” whatever that is, is almost here. Conveniently, he said it’s likely to be delivered via augmented reality glasses like the kind it makes, currently at a multibillion-dollar quarterly loss. I think some of us can be excused for worrying about tech titans deciding how this superintelligence will be used. Dave Vellante dove into stablecoins, finding they’re achieving… stability! Crypto can use some solidity to counter the continuing drumbeat of fraud and other nefarious uses of crypto. Vellante and John Furrier discuss this and other news, in particular digging into what’s really behind Amazon’s latest earnings, on this week’s podcast theCUBE Pod, out now on YouTube. Here’s all the enterprise and emerging tech news and analysis this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Zuckerberg outlines Meta’s vision for AI superintelligence Chief AI role gains traction as firms seek to turn pilots into profits OpenAI reportedly raises $8.3B in funding after annualized revenue tops $12B Report: Vast Data could raise multibillion-dollar funding round at $30B valuation French AI startup Mistral seeks to raise $1B at $10B valuation (per Financial Times) NiCE acquires customer service AI startup Cognigy for $955M Salesforce and ServiceNow in talks to invest ~$750M each in Genesys, which uses AI to automate customer service functions, valuing Genesys at ~$15B (per Bloomberg) Weeks after its last funding round, fintech startup Ramp raises $500M more AI-native clinical documentation startup Ambience Healthcare raises $243M Anaconda raises $150M+ to speed up Python-based AI projects Physical operations AI firm Motive raises $150M ahead of possible IPO AI infrastructure company fal raises $125M, valuing company at $1.5B Salient secures $60M to expand AI-powered loan servicing platform Lumana gets $40M to build more intelligent video surveillance systems Dropzone AI raises $37M to expand AI SOC analyst development and integrations Sparrow raises $35M in Series B funding to scale AI-powered solutions for leave management E2B shares its vision of sandboxed, cloud environments for every AI agent after raising $21M in funding Promptfoo raises $18.4M to build AI security and evaluation platform Echo secures $15M seed round to build AI-powered vulnerability-free application infrastructure AI data analyst startup Julius raises $10M seed round Streamline AI raises $8.6M to transform work for in-house legal operations teams Cyata Security gets $8.5M in funding to help companies get a grip on their AI agents Runloop raises $7M seed round to bring enterprise-grade infrastructure to AI coding agents Drizz launches with $2.7M to provide vision-based testing AI for mobile apps Microsoft turns Edge into an AI agent with new Copilot Mode Google DeepMind releases highly accurate AI model map of Earth Google rolls out powerful creative problem-solving AI model Deep Think to the Gemini app Amazon DocumentDB goes serverless with automatic scaling to support agentic AI workloads Chinese startup Z.ai releases cost-efficient GLM-4.5 reasoning model Writer releases autonomous AI ‘super agent’ for enterprise users OpenAI launches ChatGPT study mode to reduce AI misuse at schools and universities Google rolls out new ways to use AI Mode search with PDFs, images, live video and more Informatica tackles AI scaling roadblocks with new platform updates AI startup Artificial Societies simulates the behavior of target audiences to speed up market research Linux Foundation welcomes AGNTCY Project to standardize open multi-agent system infrastructure and break down AI agent silos Trump administration announces medical records access plan, but privacy issues loom Google said it will sign the EU AI Code of Practice There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Chipmaker Ambiq Micro shares soar 60%+ after $96M IPO Figma stock more than triples from $33 offering price in another blockbuster IPO Firefly Aerospace seeks $5.5 billion valuation in IPO as US space race heats up AI infrastructure firm WhiteFiber seeks $132.8M in IPO Microsoft crushes earnings expectations and its market cap soars above $4T And check out Dave Vellante’s analysis: Microsoft earnings: Turning up the heat with Azure, AI and the data center arms race, with proprietary data from theCUBE Research.
