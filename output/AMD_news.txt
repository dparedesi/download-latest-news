Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Courtesy of Advanced Micro Devices Over the next decade, you’ll surely want to own at least one artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock. You might assume that all you need is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and nothing else. However, even though NVIDIA is the market’s darling, your best pick could actually be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock. Even though it’s a giant company, Advanced Micro Devices is an underdog in some respects. Unlike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices isn’t a member of the Magnificent Seven group of highly favored U.S. mega-cap stocks. This isn’t to suggest that buying and holding AMD stock for 10 years is a risk-free investment. Right now, we’ll tackle the red flags that must be acknowledged for long-term Advanced Micro Devices shareholders. In the end, though, you may be open to a buy-and-hold share position as Advanced Micro Devices is a chipmaking challenger with hyper-scaling potential. One possible deal-breaker for income investors is that AMD stock doesn’t pay a dividend. Consequently, you’ll need the share price to rise in order to make a profit. Meanwhile, value investors might take issue with Advanced Micro Devices’ valuation. Specifically, the company has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 113x. In addition, AMD stock is already up 135% over the past five years. Given the triple-digit P/E ratio and the stock’s price action, some value investors may not be willing to take a chance on Advanced Micro Devices. Those are valid objections, but to be fair, Advanced Micro Devices stock just pulled back nearly 20% from $167. Since the stock has a good track record of recovering from drawdowns, there appears to be a dip-buying opportunity here. Besides, if Advanced Micro Devices is a robust revenue and earnings grower, then the high P/E ratio don’t have to be a deal-breaker. With that in mind, let’s perform a thorough checkup on Advanced Micro Devices’ financial health. Advanced Micro Devices’ high P/E ratio and lack of a dividend are legitimate reasons to reduce your position size in AMD stock. Nevertheless, you’ll probably leave a lot of money on the table if you don’t own some shares of Advanced Micro Devices during the next 10 years. All in all, Advanced Micro Devices is an undeniable sales and income grower. To prove this point, we can observe the company’s results from the quarter ended September 27, 2025. Impressively, Advanced Micro Devices’ net revenue grew 35.6% year over year, from $6.819 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $9.246 billion. Nearly half of that revenue stemmed from Advanced Micro Devices’ Data Center segment; this suggests that the company continues to benefit from AI-associated sales. Turning to the bottom-line results, Advanced Micro Devices’ net income surged 61.2%, from $771 in the year-earlier quarter to $1.243 billion. Also during that time frame, the company’s cash and cash equivalents increased 27%, from $3.787 billion to $4.808 billion. So evidently, Advanced Micro Devices remains a cash-rich chipmaker that’s on a powerful growth trajectory. While U.S. chip sales are crucial to Advanced Micro Devices’ business model, it definitely appears that the company is making headway in China’s chip market. To be more specific, Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices’ MI308 AI accelerators. This is important because investors need to think globally, not just locally, over the next 10 years. China is a major chip market, and Advanced Micro Devices has a long-term growth opportunity there. Advanced Micro Devices made a savvy move in designing its MI308 chips to be compatible with export restrictions. Furthermore, the company has secured export licenses for these chips and is prepared to pay a 15% fee to the U.S. on approved sales in China. Also, it’s a positive sign that Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su recently met with Chinese Commerce ​Minister Wang ‌Wentao in Beijing. They “exchanged views on the company’s business ⁠development in ​China and ​strengthening cooperation with China,” according to the ‍ministry. Sure, NVIDIA is also making headway into China’s chip market. At the same time, however, NVDA stock may have already priced in the company’s progress in this region. In contrast, Advanced Micro Devices’ growth story in China is still developing and the market needs time to recognize this. Give it a few years, and you should see AMD stock reflect strong chip sales in both the U.S. and China. In the final analysis, there’s no need to overload your portfolio with AMD stock. Just holding a moderately sized share position for 10 years will, most likely, put you in a profitable position without undue risk. While Advanced Micro Devices doesn’t pay a dividend and appears overvalued at first glance, I still encourage you to give the company a chance. If AI chip sales remain strong and Advanced Micro Devices keeps on growing its sales and profits, there’s an attractive reward-to-risk profile here for buy-and-hold investors.

Title: If You Like AMD’s Future, AMDY Lets You Go Full Send With An Over 100% Distribution Yield

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall Street The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY) has captured investor attention with its extraordinary 101.88% distribution rate as of December 17, 2025. This isn’t a traditional dividend ETF – AMDY generates income by selling weekly call options on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock, collecting premiums from traders betting on AMD’s price movements. AMDY employs a covered call strategy, selling short-term call options against synthetic AMD exposure. The fund’s 101.88% distribution rate means investors theoretically receive more than their initial investment back annually through distributions. However, this assumes the most recent weekly distribution remains constant—a significant assumption given variable options premiums. The fund’s income depends entirely on AMD’s volatility. With a beta of 1.93, AMD moves nearly twice as much as the broader market, creating rich options premiums. AMD’s 52-week range of $76.48 to $267.08 illustrates this volatility—a 249% spread generating substantial options income. In 2025, AMD surged 76.7% through mid-December, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s 16.13% gain. This explosive performance drove elevated options premiums enabling AMDY’s triple-digit distribution rate. AMDY’s strategy caps upside participation. While AMD gained 76.7% in 2025, AMDY delivered a 53.9% price return—capturing approximately 70% of AMD’s appreciation. The fund sacrificed 23 percentage points of capital gains for its high distribution yield. More concerning is downside risk. AMD currently trades at $213.43, down 20% from its 52-week high of $267.08. During this decline, options premiums compress, reducing AMDY’s distribution potential. The fund offers no downside protection—if AMD falls 30%, AMDY’s net asset value falls approximately 30%, and declining volatility simultaneously reduces income generation. AMD’s business fundamentals support the bullish case underlying AMDY’s strategy. Third quarter 2025 revenue reached $9.25 billion, up 35.6% year-over-year, with operating cash flow of $2.16 billion. The company maintains $4.81 billion in cash against $3.87 billion in debt. Management recently announced a multiyear partnership with OpenAI expected to generate over $100 billion in revenue. However, AMD’s valuation leaves little room for disappointment. The stock trades at 112x trailing earnings, despite a more reasonable 35x forward multiple. Analysts maintain a consensus $282.82 price target, implying 32% upside—gains that AMDY holders would largely miss due to capped call positions. AMD pays no dividend, meaning AMDY’s distributions come entirely from options premiums. AMDY’s 101.88% distribution rate is not sustainable in its current form. This figure represents an annualized rate based on a single week’s distribution during elevated AMD volatility. As AMD’s price stabilizes or declines, options premiums will compress, reducing weekly distributions significantly. The fund’s 30-day SEC yield of just 1.15% provides a more conservative baseline. Investors should expect substantial distribution variability. During periods when AMD trades sideways or declines, weekly distributions may fall 50% or more from current levels. Investors seeking similar options-based income with different underlying exposure should consider the YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY). This fund applies the same covered call strategy to NVIDIA stock. NVDY offers exposure to a different segment of the AI semiconductor market, currently yielding approximately 80% through its options premium strategy. Like AMDY, NVDY caps upside potential while maintaining full downside exposure. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.
