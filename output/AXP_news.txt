Shares of a major credit card issuer moved higher as a refresh of high-end cards and strong spending among affluent customers helped drive a quarterly earnings beat. Meanwhile, gold prices retreated from their recent highs, exerting pressuring on a major mining company. Major U.S. equities indexes finished higher to close out a volatile trading week as investors shook off concerns about bad loans at regional banks and U.S.-China trade tensions. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow each rose 0.5% Friday to post gains for the week. See here for more coverage from Investopedia of Friday's market moves. Kenvue (KVUE) stock bounced back on Friday, clawing back some of the heavy losses posted in the prior session after a lawsuit in the U.K. claimed that baby powder made by the consumer health products company was linked to cancer. Shares of the Band-Aid, Listerine, and Neutrogena parent company ended 8.4% higher, logging the top daily performance in the S&P 500. American Express (AXP) shares surged 7.3% to close at an all-time high after the company beat quarterly earnings estimates, with revenue climbing 11% year-over-year to a record $18.43 billion. Amex benefitted from the launch of updated high-end credit cards and strong spending trends among its affluent client base. Shares of fellow card issuer Capital One Financial (COF) gained 4% Friday, partly recovering from a downtick the prior day amid pressure on the financial sector. Gilead Sciences (GILD) shares added 4.2% following a price target boost by analysts at Goldman Sachs. Earlier this week, the biotechnology company presented positive results from a Phase 3 study of its cancer treatment Trodelvy. Truist Financial (TFC) also reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter, and shares of the financial services firm rose 3.7%. An uptick in fee income, boosted by strength in the wealth management and mortgage banking businesses, helped drive Truist's strong performance. Gold prices retreated from record levels, and shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold producer, dropped 7.6% Friday. The stock had reached an all-time high Thursday following a rally in parallel with the precious metal's push higher. Shares of Oracle (ORCL) sank close to 7%. Although the enterprise software giant provided targets for robust sales and profit growth through fiscal 2030, some Wall Street analysts raised concerns about a lack of details on Oracle's capital expenditure plans, as well as the company's heavy reliance on revenue from OpenAI and other major customers. Moderna (MRNA) shares lost 4.2%. Some analysts have voiced worries about declining revenue from the company's COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the company's limited headway on diversifying into other products.

Major U.S. equities indexes climbed at midday Friday as regional bank stocks rebounded from yesterday's losses after a flurry of corporate earnings reports. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were all higher. Kenvue (KVUE) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 as investors bought the dip in the health care product’s stock following yesterday’s selloff after a lawsuit in the U.K. claimed the company’s baby powder caused cancer. Shares of American Express (AXP) gained after the financial firm posted quarterly results that topped analysts' estimates and lifted its outlook as customers rushed to use its refreshed high-end credit cards. Truist Financial (TFC) also posted better-than-expected results on higher wealth management fees and interest income, sending its shares higher. Shares of Newmont (NEM) and rival gold miners slid as the price of the precious metal, which has been setting records recently, pulled back. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) and shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) were down following comments from President Trump about slashing prices for popular weight-loss drugs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note and oil futures edged higher. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro and pound, but lost ground to the yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded lower.
