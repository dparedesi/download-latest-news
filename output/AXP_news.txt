US stocks rose on Monday to head for fresh record highs as Nvidia stock climbed and investors prepared for more big bank earnings to test that rally and the chances of an economic "soft landing." The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up 0.7% to head for a fresh record after ending above 5,800 for the first time on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped around 1% as Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose toward new highs, up about 3.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered above the flatline. Earnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old. The Dow and S&P 500 closed a winning week at new records after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), and Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley (MS) due Wednesday. At the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing "sticky" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy — the preferred soft landing.

The company, which faces a record $5 billion in third quarter losses, has slashed 17,000 jobs as a month-long strike hits manufacturing. The the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) clawed its way into green territory by 10:30 a.m ET to hover at new intraday record highs. The blue-chip index had slipped as much as 0.3% shortly after the market open following a record close on Friday. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% Monday, on pace for another record close. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) saw shares of its US-listed equity rise more than 1% in early trading, with the stock notching a new record intraday price of $193.96 per share and rejoining the $1 trillion club. TSMC shares previously hit an all-time high above $193 each in July after the Taiwanese contract chipmaker reported second-quarter earnings. That surge briefly put its market capitalization above $1 trillion before shares pared gains. The stock fell back to earth as investors weighed its high valuation multiples, geopolitical risks, and concerns over AI demand. TSMC last week revealed third-quarter revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.6 billion). That beat the NT$748.3 ($23.3 billion) expected according to Bloomberg data, as well as the company's prior guidance of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion. Some 23 Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying TSMC shares, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. Analysts see shares rising to $216.59 each over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Boeing (BA) shares slipped more than 2% as investors questioned the crisis-hit plane maker's future amid job cuts and a strike that is now in its fifth week. On Friday, the company said it will cut 17,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce. "Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term," CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees posted on Boeing's website on Friday. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. S&P Global put the cost estimate of the strike that started on Sept. 1 at roughly $1 billion per month. Last week, talks between Boeing and IAM broke down, with the company withdrawing its contract proposal. Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped more than 2% at the open on Monday, surpassing its June record high close of $135.58. The stock was a couple of dollars away from its all-time intraday high just past $140.76. The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors turned their focus to upcoming big bank earnings and other quarterly results from major companies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3% to eye a new record high. On Friday, the broader index ended above 5,800 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.5% soon after the bell on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.2% from its Friday record close. Earnings season continues in full swing this week, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) among those expected to report. Oil futures dropped more than 2% as OPEC cut its demand forecast for 2024 and 2025. Traders also reacted to a lack of detail from China's Finance Minister over the weekend on any large new stimulus spending. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 1% in premarket trading to $136.22, putting the chipmaking giant on track to surpass its previous record closing price of $135.58 posted in June. The AI chipmaker's shares have made substantial gains in October following a massive, $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, much of which will be funneled back to Nvidia. AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have cited furious demand for the company's latest Blackwell chips. Its stock is up 8% over the past week. Nvidia's gains put it on track to once again claim the rank of No. 1 most valuable company in the world, in terms of market capitalization. It currently holds the No. 2 position, behind Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.3 trillion Monday, while Apple's was $3.46 trillion. Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect it to report revenue of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of those covering the stock and tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Sign in to access your portfolio

On Monday, Monness, Crespi, Hardt maintained a Buy rating on American Express (NYSE: NYSE:AXP) shares and increased its price target to $300 from the previous $265. The revision reflects a positive outlook based on the company's affluent customer base and its ability to manage a tougher spending environment effectively. The firm's analyst adjusted the estimates for American Express, introducing projections for calendar year 2026 while slightly moderating the expectations for calendar year 2025. The updated estimates are based on approximately 20 times the projected earnings per share for calendar year 2025. Despite acknowledging a cautious stance on the overall spending climate, the analyst expressed confidence in American Express's resilience compared to its peers due to its wealthier cardholder demographic. American Express is seen as having various operational levers to maintain a mid-teens earnings per share compound annual growth rate, even in the face of potential spending slowdowns in sectors like travel and restaurants. The analyst highlighted that while there has been a softening in spending within these categories since early 2024, American Express's exposure to higher discretionary spending could mean that it is better positioned than open loop networks like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), which are more reliant on less affluent customers. The analyst also pointed out that American Express's balance sheet remains strong, with leading cardholder metrics such as low delinquency and charge-off rates. Management at American Express has indicated expectations for loan growth normalization by the year's end while maintaining double-digit ranges and stable write-off rates, as seen in the second quarter of 2024 financial results. This strategic communication from management supports the belief in the company's continued stability in spend volumes. In other recent news, American Express has been the focus of several major developments. The company reported a significant 44% year-over-year earnings growth in the second quarter, marking a record high in revenue, and adjusted its full-year earnings per share (EPS) guidance to $13.30 - $13.80. JPMorgan downgraded American Express from Overweight to Neutral, citing limited upside potential, but raised the price target to $286 from $268. Meanwhile, RBC Capital Markets retained an Outperform rating and increased the share price target to $267, acknowledging the company's steady revenue and well-managed expenses. American Express also amended its bylaws to provide additional clarity on shareholder voting processes, enhancing the transparency of voting outcomes on shareholder resolutions and other corporate decisions. Seaport Global Securities maintained a Neutral rating on American Express, highlighting growth trends in the company's portfolio and credit quality that aligns with or slightly surpasses pre-pandemic levels. These are recent developments that have been shaping the narrative around American Express. The company's U.S. consumer card loan portfolio saw a year-over-year increase of 12.4% to $87.3 billion. The company's small business loan portfolio also experienced notable growth, increasing by 22.9% year-over-year to $30.1 billion. However, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the banking license of the Russian subsidiary of American Express, marking the end of the company's direct banking presence in Russia. The recent analysis from Monness, Crespi, Hardt aligns well with several key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. American Express's strong market position is reflected in its substantial market capitalization of $196.33 billion. The company's P/E ratio of 20.63 suggests a reasonable valuation, especially considering its growth prospects. InvestingPro Tips highlight American Express's financial strength and market performance. The company has maintained dividend payments for 54 consecutive years, demonstrating long-term stability. Additionally, AXP is trading near its 52-week high, with a remarkable 84.95% price total return over the past year, reinforcing the analyst's positive outlook. The company's revenue growth of 9.62% in the last twelve months and a healthy gross profit margin of 55.83% support the analyst's confidence in American Express's ability to navigate challenging spending environments. These metrics, combined with the InvestingPro Tip noting that AXP is a prominent player in the Consumer Finance industry, underscore its competitive position and potential for continued growth.

Title: Retail sales, big banks' results, and Netflix earnings: What to know this week
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-sales-big-banks-results-and-netflix-earnings-what-to-know-this-week-114506799.html

Stocks closed another week at record highs as investors began to digest quarterly earnings releases and debate intensified over what the Federal Reserve will do at its November meeting. For the week, the Nasdaq (^IXIC), the S&P 500 (^GSPC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all rose more than 1%, with both the Dow and S&P 500 closing at all-time highs Friday. In the week ahead, a monthly report on retail sales will lead the economic calendar as investors assess whether or not the economy is reaccelerating following a surprisingly strong September jobs report. In corporate news, the results from Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) will round out earnings from big banks, while reports from United Airlines (UAL) and Netflix (NFLX) will also highlight the week. In the past week, speculation that the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates further at its November meeting has been growing. The September jobs report, which included another decline in the unemployment rate and one of the highest monthly payroll addition numbers of the year, helped ease fears that the labor market was rapidly deteriorating. On Thursday, the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed core prices increased more than expected. On Friday, the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) told a similar story, with core prices increasing 2.8%, compared to Wall Street's expectations for a 2.6% increase. Some have argued that given this data — as well as recent minutes from the Fed's September meeting revealing "some" officials would've supported a smaller interest rate cut — the central bank is likely to hold rates steady in November. "As long as inflation isn't getting towards 2% so dramatically and there's no crisis that unfolds in the labor market, which I don't foresee, I don't think there's anything that gives the Fed reason to cut further this year," Yardeni Research chief markets strategist Eric Wallerstein told Yahoo Finance. As of Friday, markets were pricing a roughly 18% chance the Fed doesn't cut in November, up from a 3% chance seen a week prior, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Stronger-than-expected economic data has helped drive the "no cut" discussion. Investors will have another update in that department this week with the release of the September retail sales report on Thursday. Economists expect that retail sales increased 0.2% in September from the prior month. In August, retail sales rose 0.1%, defying the decline economists had projected. "Retail sales, in particular, could be a significant market mover as variance in the series has increased, and scrutiny over the health of the consumer has intensified," Jefferies' economics team led by Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "We would warn that one should not read too deeply into a miss against consensus (upside or downside) because retail sales measures spending with a very heavy weighting towards goods rather than services, and it is measured in nominal terms. Weakness may just be due to continued disinflation or deflation in goods." Big banks largely passed Wall Street's test to open earnings season. Investor focus will remain on financials early in the week with reports from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America before shifting to Netflix results on Thursday after the bell. The streaming giant's stock is up about 50% this year and trading near an all-time high. Wall Street expects Netflix to report earnings per share of $5.16 on revenue of $9.77 billion. This would represent nearly 40% earnings growth compared to the year prior. But Wall Street is heavily debating whether or not the stock can sustain its massive run. In the near term, Citi analyst Jason Bazinet believes Netflix announcing further price hikes in the US could be a catalyst for the stock. "We expect Netflix’s stock to trade higher on a US price hike announcement, but we would expect shares to eventually trade lower as investor’s hopes for $25 in 2025 earnings per share are dashed," Bazinet wrote. The 10-year Treasury (^TNX) is hovering near 4.1% for the first time since late July. The 10-year has now added roughly 30 basis points over the past week as investors have scaled back their expectations for interest rate cuts amid signs that inflation may be stickier than initially thought while economic growth data holds steady. For much of the past few years, higher yields have been a headwind for stocks. But Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance on Thursday yields likely have not risen enough to be too much of a headwind just yet. "I don't think this backup in interest rates is all that worrisome for equities in aggregate," Kantrowitz said. "But where it does show up is in leadership." Kantrowitz pointed out that areas like Real Estate (XLRE) and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT), which had benefited from investors anticipating lower rates, have lagged amid the 10-year yield's recent rise. For now, Kantrowitz added, rising rates are determining market leadership more than they are weighing on the S&P 500 index. "If rates keep going higher, I don't think it's a massive issue for equities unless it persists for, I'd say, a few months," he said.

American Express (NYSE:AXP) shares soared to an all-time high, reaching a price level of $276.81, marking a significant milestone for the financial services giant. This peak comes amidst a robust year for the company, with the stock witnessing an impressive 82.94% surge over the past year. Investors and analysts alike are attributing this exceptional performance to a combination of strategic business moves and a favorable economic environment that has bolstered consumer spending and strengthened the company's core credit card business. The all-time high represents a culmination of sustained growth, reflecting heightened investor confidence in American Express's market position and future prospects. In other recent news, American Express has seen notable developments in its financial performance and corporate governance. The company reported a significant 44% year-over-year earnings growth in the second quarter, marking a record high in revenue and adjusting its full-year earnings per share (EPS) guidance to $13.30 - $13.80.
