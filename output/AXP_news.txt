On Monday, Baird, a financial services firm, adjusted its stock price target for American Express (NYSE:AXP), increasing it to $240 from the previous $215. Despite this change, the firm maintained its Underperform rating on the credit card company's stock. The adjustment follows American Express's recent earnings report, which revealed a mix of financial results. American Express reported earnings per share (EPS) and pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) that surpassed expectations, attributed primarily to effective expense management. This positive performance was somewhat dampened by lighter revenue growth and a less certain future outlook. The company observed a slowdown in billed business trends, which could impact future revenues. The analyst from Baird noted that the stock's decline on Monday was likely due to the high expectations set before the earnings announcement combined with the slightly disappointing revenue forecast. Despite the challenges, the analyst believes that American Express's long-term earnings potential remains stable, even in the face of uncertain economic conditions. Baird acknowledged the company's strong execution in managing expenses but expressed concerns about the overall attractiveness of the stock's risk/reward profile. The firm's stance reflects a cautious view on American Express's valuation after considering both the recent underperformance and the updated financial metrics. Investors and market watchers will likely continue to monitor American Express's financial performance and market position, especially in light of the evolving economic landscape and consumer spending patterns. The updated price target from Baird provides a new benchmark for evaluating the company's stock performance in the near term.

In a significant business transaction, UBS divested its 50% stake in Swisscard to American Express.
