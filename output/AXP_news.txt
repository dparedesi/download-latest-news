On Monday, Baird, a financial services firm, adjusted its stock price target for American Express (NYSE:AXP), increasing it to $240 from the previous $215. Despite this change, the firm maintained its Underperform rating on the credit card company's stock. The adjustment follows American Express's recent earnings report, which revealed a mix of financial results. American Express reported earnings per share (EPS) and pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) that surpassed expectations, attributed primarily to effective expense management. This positive performance was somewhat dampened by lighter revenue growth and a less certain future outlook. The company observed a slowdown in billed business trends, which could impact future revenues. The analyst from Baird noted that the stock's decline on Monday was likely due to the high expectations set before the earnings announcement combined with the slightly disappointing revenue forecast. Despite the challenges, the analyst believes that American Express's long-term earnings potential remains stable, even in the face of uncertain economic conditions. Baird acknowledged the company's strong execution in managing expenses but expressed concerns about the overall attractiveness of the stock's risk/reward profile. The firm's stance reflects a cautious view on American Express's valuation after considering both the recent underperformance and the updated financial metrics. Investors and market watchers will likely continue to monitor American Express's financial performance and market position, especially in light of the evolving economic landscape and consumer spending patterns. The updated price target from Baird provides a new benchmark for evaluating the company's stock performance in the near term. In other recent news, American Express has been in the spotlight for various reasons. The company reported strong financial results for the third quarter of 2024, with earnings per share reaching $3.49 and revenues totaling $16.6 billion, indicating an 8% increase year-over-year. Moreover, American Express raised its full-year EPS guidance to between $13.75 and $14.05. On the other hand, BTIG reiterated its Sell rating on American Express, maintaining a $230.00 price target for the company's shares. The firm's analyst raised concerns about the company's ability to achieve its 10% year-over-year revenue growth target and referred to it as "aspirational." In a significant business transaction, UBS divested its 50% stake in Swisscard to American Express. This move marked a major shift in Swisscard's ownership and was part of UBS's strategy to reshape its business following the acquisition of Credit Suisse assets. These are recent developments that highlight the dynamic changes within the financial industry. The transactions between UBS and American Express, the strong financial performance of American Express, and the cautious outlook from BTIG analysts provide a snapshot of the ongoing shifts within the sector. To complement Baird's analysis of American Express (NYSE:AXP), recent data from InvestingPro offers additional context. Despite Baird's Underperform rating, AXP's financial metrics paint a picture of a company with strong fundamentals. The company's P/E ratio of 20.39 and PEG ratio of 0.73 suggest that the stock may be undervalued relative to its growth potential, aligning with an InvestingPro Tip that AXP is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth. American Express's revenue growth of 8.94% over the last twelve months and 8.0% in the most recent quarter demonstrates the company's ability to expand its business, even as Baird notes concerns about billed business trends. Additionally, AXP's strong profitability is evident in its gross profit margin of 55.7% and operating income margin of 20.59%. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that American Express has maintained dividend payments for 54 consecutive years, showcasing its financial stability and commitment to shareholder returns. This is further supported by a dividend yield of 1.01% and a notable dividend growth of 16.67% over the last twelve months.

Title: American Express' Mixed Q3 Results: Goldman Analyst Sees Silver Lining In Expense Management And NII Growth

American Express Co (NYSE:AXP) stock slid Friday after its third-quarter print failed to impress the Street. The third-quarter revenue (net of interest expense) grew 8% year-on-year to $16.64 billion, marginally missing the analyst consensus estimate of $16.67 billion. Higher loan volumes, stable growth in Card Member spending, and accelerated card fee revenue growth triggered the topline growth. Also Read: What’s Going On With Trump Media & Technology Group Stock On Friday? Goldman Sachs analyst Ryan M. Nash reiterated a Buy rating on American Express with a price target of $300. Goldman Sachs: Nash summarized American Express Co’s third-quarter performance. It reported third-quarter 2024 earnings per share (EPS) of $3.49, surpassing Visible Alpha’s consensus estimate of $3.30. Core pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) exceeded expectations at $4.56 billion compared to the consensus of $4.45 billion, as lower expenses offset slightly weaker revenue. Core revenue grew 8% year-over-year (FX-adjusted) to $16.64 billion, just shy of the $16.67 billion estimate. Net interest income (NII) rose 16% year-over-year to $4.01 billion, beating expectations of $3.92 billion. In comparison, fees grew 5.8% year-over-year to $12.63 billion, falling short of the $12.75 billion projection due to lower discount revenues. Billed business increased 6% year-over-year (FX-adjusted) to $441 billion, with Goods & Services up 6% and Travel & Entertainment (T&E) slowing to 6%, down from 7% the previous quarter. Expenses were 1% lower than anticipated, primarily due to reduced variable engagement costs (VECs), as total cardmember costs (including marketing) rose 12% year-over-year to $8.25 billion, below the expected $8.5 billion. Core operating expenses were higher at $3.83 billion compared to the $3.72 billion estimate. Credit performance was in line with expectations, with provisions at $1.36 billion and net charge-offs of 2.1%, which were better than anticipated. American Express adjusted its full-year 2024 guidance, lowering expected revenue growth to 9% (from the previous 9 – 11% range) and raising its EPS outlook to $13.75 – $14.05, up from the previous $13.30 – $13.80. This increase includes a $0.66 gain from Accertify. According to Nash, this was a mixed quarter for American Express. Revenues came in slightly below expectations due to weaker discount revenues. However, higher NII and card fees provided some support. Lower-than-expected expenses helped offset higher operating costs. Credit metrics remained steady, with provisions meeting expectations and losses coming in lower than anticipated. However, the market may be concerned about American Express Co’s revenue mix as NII thrives (16% Y/Y). In comparison, discount revenues increased only 4% Y/Y, raising questions about future growth. The outlook for revenue growth, significantly as NII will likely slow, will likely be a key focus on the upcoming call. On the upcoming call, Nash will seek insight into what drove American Express Co’s decision to revise its year-over-year revenue growth forecast to around 9%, down from the previous 9%-11%, and the company’s outlook for future revenue growth. The analyst also expected updates on card fees. He will seek an update on billed business growth, which stayed flat this quarter. Additionally, it will be necessary to hear about the trajectory for net interest income (NII), as the growth rate slowed slightly from 20% in the second quarter to 17% but still shows strong performance. Further, Nash sought the company’s view on customer engagement costs, which were down quarter-over-quarter, with VECs expected to stay near 42%, though they were 40.7% in the third quarter. The analyst also expects more information on the 3.3 million new card acquisitions and whether the company can sustain this momentum. Finally, he sought clarity on credit performance, as net charge-offs (NCOs) came in better than expected. American Express updated its 2024 guidance, anticipating revenue growth of around 9%, down from the prior 9% – 11%, which matches the consensus estimate of $65.99 billion. It also raised its EPS outlook to $13.75 – $14.05, up from $13.30 – $13.80, with the midpoint implying $13.90 versus the consensus of $13.74. Based on this, Nash estimates fourth-quarter EPS of around $2.95, just below the consensus of $2.98, and revenue of approximately $17.19 billion, indicating 3.3% quarter-over-quarter growth. Price Action: AXP stock is down 2.79% at $277.82 at the last check on Friday.

American Express Co’s (NYSE:AXP) third-quarter revenue (net of interest expense) grew 8% year-on-year to $16.64 billion, marginally missing the analyst consensus estimate of $16.67 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income, increased Card Member spending, and continued strong card fee growth. Amex’s stock price went up after the report, but it soon gave up the gains in the premarket session on Friday. Also Read: Citigroup Remains A Compelling Investment Opportunity: Analysts Take On Q3 Performance Adjusted EPS of $3.49 beat the analyst consensus estimate of $3.28. Card Member spending or Billed Business grew 6% (or 6% forex adjusted) year-over-year to $387.3 billion. U.S. Consumer Services revenue was $7.944 billion, up 10% year over year. Commercial Services revenue was $3.998 billion, up 7% year over year. International Card Services revenue was $2.936 billion, up 11% year over year, and Global Merchant and Network Services revenue was $1.847 billion, flat year over year. Total expenses increased by 9% year over year to $12.1 billion, primarily reflecting higher customer engagement costs due to higher Card Member spending, increased usage of travel-related benefits, and higher marketing investments. Provision for credit losses stood at $1.4 billion, compared with $1.2 billion a year ago, reflecting higher net write-offs. FY24 Outlook: Amex expects revenue growth of 9% or $65.96 billion (versus prior expectations of 9%–11% or $65.96 billion–$67.17 billion) versus consensus of $65.97 billion. It has raised its EPS outlook to $13.75–$14.05 (from $13.30–$13.80 prior) versus the consensus of $13.14. In August, B of A Securities analyst Kenneth Bruce downgraded American Express, citing continued inflation and the higher rate environment affecting consumer demand. He did not expect the company to deliver its previously guided 9%- 11% revenue growth for fiscal 2024. At least 3 Wall Street firms, including JP Morgan, HSBC, and BTIG, downgraded the stock in October. American Express stock is up 89% in the last 12 months. Price Action: AXP stock is down 2.79% at $277.80 premarket at the last check on Friday.
