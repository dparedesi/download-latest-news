Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Shares of AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) and Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB) are drawing intense retail attention in December, with both space stocks registering neutral sentiment scores of 53 as of this morning. That marks a significant cooldown from early December, when AST SpaceMobile held sentiment scores consistently above 88 through December 7-8, while Rocket Lab hovered in the 78-82 range. The convergence tells a story of shifting retail conviction as both stocks navigate similar market caps near $30 billion but wildly different operational realities. AST SpaceMobile dominated social sentiment through early December, averaging 82.5 across the seven-day period compared to Rocket Lab’s 70.5. The enthusiasm centered on the company’s satellite constellation plans, with retail traders on r/stocks and r/investing repeatedly naming ASTS among their top growth picks for 2026. One commenter on the r/stocks thread noted: “ASTS is one of the most exciting growth opportunities heading into 2026.” But the fundamentals paint a different picture. AST SpaceMobile missed Q3 estimates by 114%, reporting a loss of $0.45 per share against expectations of $0.21. Revenue of $14.74M fell short of the $20.33M estimate, and the company trades at 1,567x price-to-sales. The stock carries a 2.76 beta. Despite $1.2B in cash and over $1B in contracted revenue commitments, the path to profitability remains distant as the company targets 45-60 satellites by end of 2026. Rocket Lab presents a stark operational contrast. The company beat Q3 estimates by 71%, posting a loss of just $0.03 per share against expectations of $0.1045, while revenue of $155.08M topped estimates and grew 48% year-over-year. With 17 Electron launch contracts secured (a record) and gross margins hitting 37%, Rocket Lab demonstrates consistent execution. The company’s price-to-sales ratio of 55x, while elevated, sits far below AST SpaceMobile’s extreme valuation. Reddit discussions reflect this operational maturity. On r/wallstreetbets, one trader laid out the bull case: “Neutron is a structural change within the company that will bring Billions in revenue over the years […] it gives you rocket fuel for one of the best positioned company of the next 10+ years.” The upcoming Neutron launch, expected in Q1 2026, represents a potential inflection point that could unlock Department of Defense contracts worth hundreds of millions. Both stocks trade with similar market caps and high volatility, but Rocket Lab generates 30x more revenue ($554.5M vs $18.5M) while maintaining better profitability metrics. Institutional investors recognize this, with 58% ownership in RKLB compared to 39% for ASTS. As sentiment converges at neutral levels, the divergence in fundamentals becomes impossible to ignore.

Title: AST SpaceMobile Aims to Launch FM2, Its Second Prototype Satellite, in January

AST SpaceMobile is hoping to launch a second next-generation prototype satellite "as early as January" as it races to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service. The company disclosed the launch timing in a new Federal Communications Commission filing. AST is already on track to launch its first prototype satellite, FM1, later this month. However, it appears that it's also scrambling to launch the FM2 as soon as possible. “As part of its proactive efforts to secure sufficient launches for its satellite constellation on an expedited basis, AST SpaceMobile was able to secure an accelerated launch slot capable of launching a BlueBird satellite as early as January 2026,” the company wrote. Interestingly, AST has tapped rival SpaceX to launch the satellite using a Falcon 9 rocket. But the filing notes: “In order to meet quick turnaround launch requirements, AST SpaceMobile was constrained in the available orbital parameters for launch. The alternative was to forgo the launch opportunity.” The company secured FCC clearance in August to fly up the FM2. However, the "constrained" orbit parameters are leading AST to request regulatory permission to launch the FM2 satellite at a lower orbit, from 520 kilometers down to 460 kilometers. AST describes the lower orbit as part of “a few minor changes” that won’t lead to increased radio interference. “Grant of this application will serve the public interest by facilitating expeditious deployment of a new, groundbreaking space-based cellular network that will deliver direct-to-device broadband connectivity across the United States,” the company added. Still, the company’s application might face opposition from rival companies, such as SpaceX. It could also take time for the FCC to review and clear the application, although the Commission has been working to fast-track satellite approvals. AST’s first prototype, the FM1, is currently scheduled to launch on Dec. 15. The company has tapped India’s space agency to launch the satellite, which is about three times larger than AST's first-generation BlueBirds. The square-shaped satellites have been designed to act as cell towers in space, capable of powering high-speed broadband to phones on the ground. The goal is to operate 45 to 60 BlueBird satellites by the end of next year—enough for the company to provide continuous coverage through partners such as AT&T and Verizon. In addition, “AST SpaceMobile expects five orbital launches by the end of Q1 2026, with launches occurring every one to two months on average,” the company told the FCC. Hence, the launch timing is crucial when AST faces heightened competition from SpaceX. The company's own cellular Starlink system launched through T-Mobile earlier this year, and can already power text messaging, app data, and even video calls for phones in cellular dead zones. Now SpaceX is preparing to bulk up the system’s capabilities after acquiring valuable radio spectrum from Boost Mobile’s parent, EchoStar. Elon Musk's company has even gone as far as to file the trademark for “Starlink Mobile,” suggesting SpaceX might try to become a global carrier, but primarily through satellites.
