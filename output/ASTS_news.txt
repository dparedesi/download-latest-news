As it develops satellite-based cellular connectivity, AST SpaceMobile has reached an agreement designed to prevent the company’s massive BlueBird satellites from interfering with astronomy. On Monday, the Texas-based company signed a “coordination agreement” with the US National Science Foundation (NSF). The deal calls for AST to “implement best practices between satellite communications and ground-based optical, infrared, and radio astronomy observations. “Under this agreement, AST SpaceMobile commits to collaborate closely with NSF, its major facilities, and the broader US astronomy community to mitigate any potential impact on ground-based astronomical facilities,” the company added. Importantly, AST has committed to adopting recommendations from the International Astronomical Union’s Dark and Quiet Skies initiative (IAU/CPS), which formed in 2022 in response to the rise of “mega” satellite constellations. This includes SpaceX’s Starlink, which has incorporated various design changes to prevent the satellites from reflecting sunlight in the night sky. In AST’s case, the company’s first-generation BlueBird satellites already feature a vast, 693-square-foot communications array. As a result, the satellites can appear as bright stars in the night sky, according to astronomers. The interference risk may grow more serious since AST plans to launch dozens of even larger, second-generation BlueBirds, each 2,400 square feet. But on Monday, CEO Abel Avellan said the agreement with NSF underscores its “commitment to responsible stewardship of space.” AST didn’t elaborate on what measures it’ll take to prevent such interference. But in January, the company sent a letter to the FCC that noted it plans on rolling or tilting its satellites “to avoid direct illumination of optical telescopes." AST also wants to install new antennas designed to reduce the satellites' brightness. Despite the agreement, Anthony Mallama, a retired astronomer who studies satellites for their brightness, told PCMag that he's skeptical the coordination deal will make a major difference. "The AST BlueBird Block 1 spacecraft are currently the brightest constellation by far with an average apparent magnitude of 3.3," he said. "That is 30 times brighter than the limit recommended by the IAU/CPS. The forthcoming Block 2 satellites will be 3 times the size of Block 1. So, they may outshine every star in the sky." In the meantime, the NSF agreement is important not only for astronomers but also for AST’s efforts to receive further regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission. In the past, the FCC has conditioned Starlink satellite approvals on working with the NSF to prevent interference with astronomy research. Last week, SpaceX even criticized AST’s request to launch a prototype second-generation BlueBird, the FM-1, saying the company had yet to explain how it would prevent the satellite from interfering with optical astronomy.

Published onApril 26, 2025 Starlink has truly opened our eyes to the power of satellite technology, delivering speeds that rival cable internet in areas previously lacking high-speed options. But Starlink isn’t just about traditional internet use. Earlier this year, T-Mobile and Starlink introduced emergency satellite-to-cell features, including full texting, to mobile phone users for the first time. More recently, Verizon and some of its MVNOs followed suit with a more limited satellite-to-cell service launch for Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 users, in cooperation with Skylo. As satellite providers increasingly team up with major carriers, you might wonder: Will satellite technology ever surpass traditional services from big providers? It’s a compelling thought, but the reality is more complicated. Let’s take a closer look at the major players in the satellite-to-cell space, what they currently offer, and their publicly announced future plans. We’ll also explore the roadblocks holding satellite technology back in the mobile world and whether these issues might eventually become a thing of the past. Although numerous companies are involved in satellite technology, only a handful have directly pursued satellite-to-cell capabilities so far. Recently, Starlink has emerged as the most widely available service, even though its features remain in public beta. Nevertheless, several other companies have significant plans for satellite-to-cell technologies in the future. Starlink is best known for its internet service, but it has also become the biggest satellite-to-cell provider as it offers this service indirectly through partnerships, such as with T-Mobile in the US. The great thing about this partnership is that T-Mobile isn’t keeping satellite features exclusive, as it has allowed subscribers from rival networks to use the feature for free during beta. Skylo provides satellite connectivity across various industries through partnerships as opposed to having its own network. While it’s far from a major player in the satellite-to-cell game right now, Skylo most notably powers Verizon’s emergency SOS features on specific devices and is working with other cellular companies and phone makers to expand emergency SOS features. AST SpaceMobile aims to establish its own low-earth orbit satellite-to-cell network similar to Starlink, but it is still in early development. Unlike Starlink, which has over 7,000 satellites (approximately 400 equipped for cellular service), AST SpaceMobile has only launched five satellites capable of satellite-to-cell connectivity features. Iridium is known primarily for traditional satellite phone services, typically requiring specialized equipment for remote or field use. Currently, it offers the Iridium Go hotspot as a standalone device providing limited satellite-to-cell features, though at very slow speeds that are not suitable as a true cellular service replacement. For what it’s worth, we’ve seen other devices like the Go, including the HMD OffGrid. The big difference is that Iridium controls its own network. Iridium briefly partnered with Qualcomm to develop satellite-to-cell capabilities; however, after this partnership fell through, it shifted its attention toward other future collaborations. Globalstar is another major traditional satellite phone provider. While it continues to primarily focus on traditional satellite customers, it is actively pursuing the expanding satellite-to-cell market, notably through its partnership with Apple. To that end, Apple has invested over $1 billion in Globalstar to support satellite-to-cell features like emergency texting on iPhone 14 and newer devices. Likely, Globalstar will eventually extend its efforts to other manufacturers as well. In addition to already working with Skylo, ViaSat also plans to work with it and other partners on its own constellation of low-orbit satellites that will be designed to connect directly to smartphones and IoT devices without requiring ground infrastructure. This system was successfully tested last year through Skylo in the United Arab Emirates, India, and Saudi Arabia, and so it’s only a matter of time before the company ramps up the effort. While HughesNet doesn’t seem to be pursuing satellite-to-cell partnerships with carriers or manufacturers in any major way just yet, that doesn’t mean it isn’t involved at all. HughesNet currently offers its SatCell Connect service for first responders and field use. As you can see, there are plenty of efforts underway to roll out satellite-to-cell technology. For the most part, partnerships remain the favored approach. Given the current trajectory, it’s unlikely that satellite technology will replace terrestrial cellular service anytime soon, if ever. One major reason is that satellite technology often faces larger regulatory hurdles than the cellular industry. This is especially true for low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. LEO constellations are crucial because they are the only type even theoretically capable of replacing terrestrial service. Traditional satellites suffer from latency and speed limitations that make such a replacement effort impractical. Even if we move past regulatory and technical challenges, there are several inherent advantages to traditional cellular service that are difficult to overcome: To be fair, Starlink’s latency isn’t that much worse than that of broadband (at least compared to regular sat), which suggests latency could become a non-issue over time. But capacity remains a major obstacle and solving it would likely require blanketing the sky with billions of satellites. That’s not just expensive, it’s also a future filled with space junk. And although satellite deployment costs may drop over time, land-based infrastructure will almost always be the more economical option. The truth is, satellite providers don’t want to replace traditional cellular service, and you shouldn’t want that either. The ideal model is a hybrid approach, where carriers provide both ground and satellite coverage. While it’s possible that some carriers may eventually develop their own satellite networks, the infrastructure investment would be massive and likely not worth the cost. From a consumer perspective, there’s no real advantage to satellite-only service either. Let’s be honest: most people don’t care (or even want to know) how their phone connects, as long as it works. In the future, satellite backup will likely become so seamless and integrated that you won’t be able to tell whether you’re connected to a ground tower or a satellite, aside from maybe a latency spike or a small indicator on your phone. And that’s the beauty of it: the ability to connect from anywhere. That’s far more appealing than a future reliant on just satellites or towers.

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. SpaceX is criticizing rival AST SpaceMobile’s plan to test a next-generation satellite, arguing that the company’s proposal is flawed and potentially threatens orbital safety. In a Thursday letter to the FCC, SpaceX urged the agency to ensure that "enormous experimental satellites" follow the rules. The FCC is weighing whether to grant an experimental license so AST SpaceMobile can test a larger, more powerful version of its BlueBird satellite. This "FM-1" satellite spans 223 square meters, making it about three times larger than AST's first-gen BlueBird satellites, five of which are currently in orbit. The FM-1 is important since AST aims to launch and operate a fleet of second-generation BlueBirds to deliver satellite connectivity for carriers, including AT&T and Verizon. AST is also facing a tight timeline since its partners want to begin offering satellite connectivity to customers as soon as next year. Although SpaceX doesn’t oppose the FM-1 satellite itself, the company has gripes with AST SpaceMobile’s proposal. In its letter to the FCC, SpaceX argues the “experimental license application for the FM-1 satellite contains worrying discrepancies in its orbital debris mitigation plan that require clarification before granting authorization to launch.” The discrepancies include how AST says the FM-1 satellite will be retired in 2.9 years by burning up in the Earth’s atmosphere once the satellite’s mission is complete. SpaceX’s analysis, using NASA software, claims the satellite will orbit the planet for 6.6 years after it completes its mission, violating the FCC’s disposal rule for low-Earth orbiting satellites. In addition, SpaceX claims “the actual collision probability of the FM-1 satellite is close to ten times higher than AST reports,” when other satellites, rocket pieces, and space debris orbit at the same altitude. “Strikingly, AST makes no effort to explain how it can mitigate the harm the ‘largest commercial phased array antenna in LEO’ will cause for optical astronomy,” the letter adds. (That said, AST has been working with the scientific community to address the potential astronomy interference.) SpaceX has become more vocal in attacking AST when both are developing cellular satellite services. In its letter, SpaceX stresses that AST’s new satellite follows the same requirements the company faced when the FCC authorized its second-generation Starlink satellites. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in October, the company accused SpaceX of using anti-competitive tactics to “intimidate and bully its competitors, regulators, and cellular operators.” In the meantime, the FCC told AST last week that its application for the FM-1 satellite was "incomplete," and sent AST 10 questions, which AST has until April 15 to address.
