As it develops satellite-based cellular connectivity, AST SpaceMobile has reached an agreement designed to prevent the company’s massive BlueBird satellites from interfering with astronomy. On Monday, the Texas-based company signed a “coordination agreement” with the US National Science Foundation (NSF). The deal calls for AST to “implement best practices between satellite communications and ground-based optical, infrared, and radio astronomy observations. “Under this agreement, AST SpaceMobile commits to collaborate closely with NSF, its major facilities, and the broader US astronomy community to mitigate any potential impact on ground-based astronomical facilities,” the company added. Importantly, AST has committed to adopting recommendations from the International Astronomical Union’s Dark and Quiet Skies initiative (IAU/CPS), which formed in 2022 in response to the rise of “mega” satellite constellations. This includes SpaceX’s Starlink, which has incorporated various design changes to prevent the satellites from reflecting sunlight in the night sky. In AST’s case, the company’s first-generation BlueBird satellites already feature a vast, 693-square-foot communications array. As a result, the satellites can appear as bright stars in the night sky, according to astronomers. The interference risk may grow more serious since AST plans to launch dozens of even larger, second-generation BlueBirds, each 2,400 square feet. But on Monday, CEO Abel Avellan said the agreement with NSF underscores its “commitment to responsible stewardship of space.” AST didn’t elaborate on what measures it’ll take to prevent such interference. But in January, the company sent a letter to the FCC that noted it plans on rolling or tilting its satellites “to avoid direct illumination of optical telescopes." AST also wants to install new antennas designed to reduce the satellites' brightness. Despite the agreement, Anthony Mallama, a retired astronomer who studies satellites for their brightness, told PCMag that he's skeptical the coordination deal will make a major difference. "The AST BlueBird Block 1 spacecraft are currently the brightest constellation by far with an average apparent magnitude of 3.3," he said. "That is 30 times brighter than the limit recommended by the IAU/CPS. The forthcoming Block 2 satellites will be 3 times the size of Block 1. So, they may outshine every star in the sky." In the meantime, the NSF agreement is important not only for astronomers but also for AST’s efforts to receive further regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission. In the past, the FCC has conditioned Starlink satellite approvals on working with the NSF to prevent interference with astronomy research. Last week, SpaceX even criticized AST’s request to launch a prototype second-generation BlueBird, the FM-1, saying the company had yet to explain how it would prevent the satellite from interfering with optical astronomy. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017. I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service. I also cover emerging online cyber threats, the rise of generative AI, the ever-changing landscape of today’s social media, and the PC graphics card market (which led me to camp out in front … PCMag is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.
