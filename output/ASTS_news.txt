We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTS) stands against the other growth stocks. The latest data from the job market in the United States came out on Friday and that has made the future of rate cuts even more uncertain. Lauren Sanfilippo, senior investment strategist at Bank of America, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss her market thesis and how the easing cycle is expected to play out in 2025. Sanfilippo believes that the market has been basing its decisions on the easing cycle, but the job data, which has been particularly good, has allowed investors to pivot their investment approach away from rate cuts. She added that she is not looking at more rate cuts this year and is expecting a hike amid inflation concerns. She suggested that the market must not overreact to one piece of data and wait for more data to come out before any decisions are made. Speaking of the commencement of the easing cycle, Sanfilippo believes the Fed was in the right to start the much-awaited easing cycle. However, she did share her concerns about the 100 basis point rate cut being executed over a very short time. She added that while the job market is in good shape and inflation is not that much of a problem yet, the stock market's performance may also be influenced because of yields and how stocks are "thinking about yields." She also suggested that previously stocks have been very tolerant of higher yields, and is interested to see how it changes going forward. Sanfilippo also shared her views on inflation and emphasized the importance of viewing the bigger picture more holistically. She added there is a much larger widening opportunity in the market but is waiting to see how the Q4 2024 earnings pan out. The market may be uncertain, however, some stocks in the market have a promising outlook making them a solid buy. These stocks have been pouring into solid growth opportunities and are popular among analysts and investors. That said, let's take a look at the 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services.

AST SpaceMobile is highlighting how it will ensure that its large satellites do not become a nuisance to astronomers through several changes, including rolling and tilting in space. Last week, the cellular satellite provider sent a letter to the FCC about its efforts to prevent the company's BlueBird satellites from interfering with astronomy. These satellites each boast an exceptionally large 700-square-foot panel, which can reflect sunlight, turning the satellites into some of the most luminous objects in the sky, akin to a bright star. In the letter to the FCC, AST says it’s close to reaching a “comprehensive coordination agreement” with the US National Science Foundation for both optical astronomy and radio astronomy. “The parties are in the final stages of approving the agreement,” Texas-based AST SpaceMobile writes. The document adds that AST has committed to taking several measures, which include “using commercially reasonable efforts to operationally roll or tilt spacecraft to avoid direct illumination of optical telescopes.” Another measure involves the satellites incorporating “deployable antenna elements that reduce brightness.” The company has also pledged to share its satellite location data with astronomers, giving them a way to plan their observations ahead of time. “AST SpaceMobile will also continue to evaluate ways to mitigate impacts on optical astronomy interests, including physical design changes, attitude maneuvering, maintaining authorized orbital elevations, and providing orbital information to astronomers,” the letter adds. AST SpaceMobile didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement, NSF said it's "in the process of coordinating with AST SpaceMobile [and will] share more information when coordination is complete." So it’s unclear how AST plans to roll and tilt its satellites, and what other design changes may be in store. But the FCC made the NSF coordination a condition to granting partial approval to AST operating its satellite constellation. The startup envisions one day operating dozens of BlueBird satellites in orbit, capable of beaming internet data to phones on the ground. But astronomers have been worrying about the brightness of the company’s satellites, especially since they could proliferate and disrupt telescopic observations. In the meantime, AST’s first batch of BlueBird satellites were sent into Earth’s orbit in September. Over a month later, all five satellites unfolded their antenna arrays. AST is now waiting for FCC approval so that it can start testing the satellites with phones on the ground.

This agreement positions AST SpaceMobile to combine its existing low-band spectrum coverage in the continental United States with premium lower mid-band spectrum access, creating an enhanced framework for reliable and widespread connectivity. The company's advanced communications arrays, the largest deployed in low Earth orbit, will support this integration to deliver better performance across diverse applications. "Adding premium lower mid-band spectrum access in the United States to the AST SpaceMobile network gives us long-term access to a large block of a scarce resource, significantly enhancing our planned space-based cellular broadband offering," said Abel Avellan, Chairman and CEO at AST SpaceMobile. "Alongside the previously announced 850 MHz nationwide network plans, access to the largest available block of high-quality nationwide spectrum will position us to deliver on our goal of peak data transmission speeds up to 120 Mbps, together with our mobile network operator partners, to enable a true broadband experience directly from space to everyday smartphones." The agreement, facilitated through a binding Restructuring Support Agreement with Ligado Networks ("Ligado") and its creditors, grants AST SpaceMobile long-term usage rights for 80+ years. This includes up to 40 MHz of L-Band MSS spectrum and an additional 5 MHz in the 1670-1675 MHz Band in the United States. Completion of the transaction depends on finalizing definitive documentation, anticipated in early 2025. Upon execution, Ligado will receive approximately 4.7 million penny warrants convertible into AST SpaceMobile Class A shares, subject to a 12-month lock-up. Regulatory approvals and other conditions will determine the transaction's closing, which also includes $550 million in additional consideration supported by institutional financing. AST SpaceMobile has arranged for a non-recourse senior-secured delayed-draw term loan facility to finance this commitment, with annual payments of approximately $80 million for spectrum rights. Ligado will also receive long-term net revenue sharing rights. The transaction aligns with Ligado's ongoing restructuring efforts. UBS Securities LLC is serving as the exclusive financial advisor for AST SpaceMobile. Legal counsel includes Freshfields and Sullivan and Cromwell. The company's advancements include the September 2024 launch of five BlueBird satellites, which are the largest commercial communication arrays in orbit. These satellites offer non-continuous broadband services across the United States and select global markets, with the aim of achieving nationwide coverage. The next-generation Block 2 BlueBird satellites will feature even larger arrays and deliver up to 10 times the bandwidth capacity, supporting speeds up to 120 Mbps for a full range of cellular services.
