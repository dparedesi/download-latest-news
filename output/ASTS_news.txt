The collaboration will integrate Verizon's terrestrial mobile network, its premium 850 MHz low-band spectrum, and AST SpaceMobile's next-generation satellite constellation in low Earth orbit. Together, the networks will enable seamless connectivity for customers in urban, rural, and remote regions without the need for specialized hardware. AST SpaceMobile's system employs the largest commercial communications arrays ever deployed in orbit, capable of connecting directly to everyday smartphones. The network is designed to utilize AST's licensed L- and S-band spectrum along with up to 1,150 MHz of partner mobile spectrum globally, advancing the company's vision of continuous, direct broadband access from space. "Through our definitive commercial agreement with Verizon, we are working to deliver space-based cellular broadband coverage from space across the continental United States," said Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman and CEO of AST SpaceMobile. "The agreement will extend the scope of Verizon's 850 MHz premium low-band spectrum into areas of the U.S. that would benefit from the ubiquitous reach of space-based broadband technology." This agreement follows successful tests that validated the AST SpaceMobile network's performance. In one milestone, a Verizon smartphone in Texas placed a crystal-clear Voice over LTE (VoLTE) call via an AST SpaceMobile BlueBird satellite to another Verizon device in New Jersey. The companies also demonstrated direct video and voice calls as well as two-way RCS messaging using unmodified smartphones, underscoring the maturity of the satellite-to-cellular technology. "This partnership with AST SpaceMobile is a good step forward in our mission to build a seamlessly connected world," said Srini Kalapala, Senior Vice President of Technology and Product Development at Verizon. "By integrating our expansive, reliable, robust terrestrial network with this innovative space-based technology, we are paving the way for a future where everything and everyone can be connected, regardless of geography."

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us AST SpaceMobile has inked a new deal with Verizon to bring space-based cellular broadband across the United States, marking its most significant partnership to date and its latest move to capture a larger share of the emerging space-to-cellular market. Under the agreement, Verizon will integrate AST’s satellite network with its terrestrial infrastructure, using Verizon’s 850 MHz spectrum to extend coverage in remote areas where towers can’t reach. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The deal builds on an earlier partnership between the two entities announced last year, in which Verizon made a $100 million commitment to support AST’s service rollout. Verizon is the second major carrier to sign with AST, following a 10-year agreement with Vodafone. For AST, the Verizon deal comes at a critical time as the company races to deploy its BlueBird satellite constellation designed to link directly with unmodified cell phones. As of now, the company has successfully placed its first five BlueBird satellites into low Earth orbit, an initial “Block 1” that are intended to deliver “intermittent” coverage across the U.S. Meanwhile, AST is assembling the next generation of satellites — “Block 2” — with plans to deploy between 45-60 satellites by 2026. The partnership also underscores how rapidly the satellite-to-cell market is evolving. SpaceX, through its Starlink network, has already started rolling out its direct-to-cell service with T-Mobile, and recently bolstered its ambitions further by agreeing to acquire $17 billion worth of wireless spectrum from EchoStar. AST has already demonstrated 4G and 5G connections between its satellites and smartphones, including voice and video calls, testing milestones that the company says have “proven the capabilities” of its network. But it still faces the challenge of scaling that technology to serve millions of users. AST shares jumped by more than 15% on Wednesday after the deal was announced.

Shares of AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) blasted off, trading at an all-time high after the provider of space-based cellphone service announced it had struck a deal with Verizon Communications (VZ) to offer direct-to-customer broadband service across the continental U.S. AST said the service will be available to Verizon customers next year and will allow them to have cell reception wherever they are without the need for specialized equipment. Verizon customers will be able to get cellphone service virtually anywhere in the continental U.S. without specialized equipment. The partnership with AST SpaceMobile promises more reliable coverage in remote areas, opening the door to a new era of space-based connectivity starting in 2026. AST noted that the agreement came after the company’s AST SpaceMobile network hit certain milestones in tests. Financial terms were not listed. The deal “will extend the scope of Verizon’s 850 MHz premium low-band spectrum into areas of the U.S. that would benefit from the ubiquitous reach of space-based broadband technology," said Founder and CEO Abel Avellan. Srini Kalapala, senior vice president of technology and product development at Verizon, said the partnership is “not just filling in the map; we are creating a new paradigm of connectivity that will unlock the full potential of the digital age.” AST SpaceMobile shares have soared 250% this year. Shares of Verizon are little changed today.

Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google As SpaceX races to dominate satellite-to-phone services, Verizon is doubling down on rival AST SpaceMobile instead. On Wednesday, Verizon announced it had signed a commercial agreement with the Texas-based AST SpaceMobile to supply satellite-to-phone connectivity starting next year. Terms were kept under wraps. But the agreement promises to give Verizon customers a new way to remain connected in cellular dead zones by tapping AST’s orbiting satellites, which have been designed to power voice and video calls, along with data. Currently, Verizon subscribers on certain phones can receive only limited satellite-powered texting through partner Skylo. Importantly, the deal solidifies Verizon’s relationship with AST after the two initially announced a “strategic partnership” last year. The partnership calls for Verizon to commit $100 million while giving AST access to a slice of its radio spectrum to power the satellite-to-phone services. However, industry watchers have been waiting for an actual commercial agreement between the two. There was even speculation that Verizon could back out and tap SpaceX, which offers its cellular Starlink service through T-Mobile. Last month, Elon Musk's company also reached a $17 billion deal to acquire valuable radio spectrum for Boost Mobile’s parent, EchoStar, to upgrade the cellular Starlink system with even more capacity. Wednesday’s agreement signals that Verizon is going all in on AST, even though it’s still months away from offering commercial service to users. In contrast, SpaceX already has over 650 cellular Starlink satellites in orbit and has been delivering service to T-Mobile users since January, first as a beta and then with a formal launch in July. AT&T is also betting on AST; last year, the carrier announced its own commercial agreement that lasts until 2030. But the major challenge facing AST is launching enough satellites in time. It's using Blue Origin, India’s national space agency, and SpaceX as launch partners. The company currently has only five of its “BlueBird” satellites in orbit, when it needs 45 to 60 to deliver continuous coverage in the US. AST was supposed to fly up a prototype FM1 satellite in August, the first second-generation BlueBird. However, the launch has been delayed until December or January. Still, AST indicated last week it could send up a separate second-generation BlueBird in the coming weeks. In a tweet, the company noted: “BlueBird 7 is expected to ship to the Cape Canaveral launch site in October.” The same tweet also reiterated that AST expects to have 45 to 60 satellites in orbit by the end of next year. In Wednesday’s announcement, AST also emphasized its tests show the company’s satellites can complete “direct voice and video calls, as well as two-way RCS messaging, between standard, unmodified smartphones.” “A crystal-clear Voice over LTE (VoLTE) call was made from a smartphone on Verizon's network in Texas, connecting via an AST SpaceMobile satellite to another Verizon smartphone in New Jersey,” the company added. “These successful tests represent a significant leap in satellite-to-cellular technology and pave the way for a future of ubiquitous connectivity.” My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years.

The satellite design and manufacturing company is up more than 300% in 2025. Why: On Wednesday, AST SpaceMobile announced an agreement with Verizon to provide cell service to consumers from space. Starting next year, the company will provide Verizon customers with a direct-to-cellular connection via satellite. According to AST SpaceMobile, its network features the largest commercial communications array ever deployed into low Earth orbit. The technology can connect directly to standard smartphones. "The agreement will extend the scope of Verizon's 850 MHz premium low-band spectrum into areas of the U.S. that would benefit from the ubiquitous reach of space-based broadband technology, stated AST SpaceMobile founder and CEO Abel Avellan. What it means: The Verizon deal is a major milestone for the company, which has emerged as a popular stock among retail traders looking for exposure to the growing space tech sector. The news on Wednesday prompted a jubilant reaction from traders on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. Its partnership with an industry leader like Verizon may be a turning point for what's often been viewed as a meme stock, as it could position AST SpaceMobile as a serious competitor to larger rivals like SpaceX. In September, ASTS stock briefly surged on momentum when a Mexican news outlet reported that América Móvil was considering taking a stake, a story that SpaceMobile revealed to be false. Jump to
