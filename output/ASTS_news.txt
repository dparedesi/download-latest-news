Could SpaceX derail a rival's next-generation satellite project because of paperwork issues? On Monday, the company urged the Federal Communications Commission to dismiss an application from AST SpaceMobile because of "careless errors" and "inconsistencies" in the documentation. "While AST extolls the titanic capabilities of its satellite in its application, it simultaneously seeks to hide the risks of its operations,” SpaceX says in a filing. Texas-based AST has been trying to secure FCC experimental authorization to operate a prototype satellite called FM1, which is scheduled to launch in July. The huge satellite, which is designed to offer internet to mobile phones, spans 223 square meters, or about three times larger than the company’s first-generation BlueBird satellites. AST first filed its regulatory request for FM1 in March. But since then, it has faced an ongoing back-and-forth with the FCC over errors and incomplete data. "Wilde is in Argentina, not Australia. Please correct this repeated error in the API,” the FCC told the company last Friday, while raising five other issues. In total, the FCC has sent AST five emails about submitting additional details and correcting the application. On Monday, SpaceX seized on the paperwork problems, alleging that AST’s orbit safety plans for the satellites have been "hastily revised." "Unfortunately, AST's experimental license application and supplemental submissions fail to demonstrate substantial completeness or compliance with the Commission’s rules, or that authorizing these high-risk test operations would serve the public interest,” SpaceX says. The company’s four-page letter lists the alleged flaws with AST's paperwork, concluding that its "orbital debris mitigation plan fails to demonstrate that the FM1 satellite can operate safely and sustainably." The same document also faults the application for failing to provide more details on how the company will prevent its satellite from disrupting astronomy, even though AST recently reached a deal with the US National Science Foundation. The complaints might delay AST's launch of the FM1 satellite in July through India’s space agency. In April, SpaceX also sent another letter to the FCC, claiming that AST’s proposal for the FM1 potentially threatens orbital safety. The letter highlights the combative rivalry between the two companies, which are competing to offer satellite connectivity to smartphones. SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service is slated to launch next month through T-Mobile. Meanwhile, AST is preparing its own alternative for AT&T and Verizon, with the goal of launching the initial service early next year. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the company recently hired a former EchoStar executive, Jennifer Manner, as SVP for regulatory affairs, which might help AST better navigate the FCC's procedures. In October, AST also told the FCC that SpaceX was engaging in anticompetitive behavior by using tactics to “intimidate and bully its competitors, regulators, and cellular operators."

Title: “Something wicked this way comes,” Ray Bradbury (1962)

It was a great and horrifying story about two young boys and the arrival of the Cooger and Dark Carnival in Green Town, Illinois. If you entered the carnival grounds late at night, you might be drawn to its iconic ride, Cooger & Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show. It’s a story about the ways in which evil can be a powerful temptation to even the best of people. Some of the lines are maddeningly good. A stranger is shot in the street, you hardly move to help. But if, half an hour before, you spent just ten minutes with the fellow and knew a little about him and his family, you might just jump in front of his killer and try to stop it. Really knowing is good. Not knowing, or refusing to know is bad, or amoral, at least. You can’t act if you don’t know. Others half-haunt me. Oh, what strange wonderful clocks women are. They nest in Time. They make the flesh that holds fast and binds eternity. They live inside the gift, know power, accept, and need not mention it. Why speak of time when you are Time, and shape the universal moments, as they pass, into warmth and action? How men envy and often hate these warm clocks, these wives, who know they will live forever. Bradbury declared it his most “delicious” story. The title is also an homage to the witches of Macbeth (Act 4, Scene 1, following “boil and trouble”): 2nd Witch: By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. [Knocking] Open locks, Whoever knocks! [Enter Macbeth] I admit to having been thinking of dark circuses and evil clowns rather a lot lately. They make it hard to pick up the newspaper most mornings. Chief Justice Warren got it, too: “I always turn to the sports section first. The sports section records man’s accomplishments; the front page has nothing but man’s failures” (Sports Illustrated, July 22, 1968). For readers of the Mutual Fund Observer, two coming circuses will be particularly pressing. Single-stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and leveraged single-stock ETFs are relatively new and complex investment products that have garnered significant attention from both investors and researchers. I was struck by the utter flood of new fund registrations in the first weeks of May, which might signal a July or August. Launch. In the middle of 2024, there were about 100 such funds globally. The first in the US seems to have been AXS Tesla and AXS NVIDIA, both launched in 2022. Trading volume and AUM data are scant. Morningstar did report a doubling in the pool’s AUM in the first quarter of 2024. What do they do? In general, they do not own the single stock in question. They own derivatives tied to the performance of the stock, but they are generally tied to one day’s performance: if Tesla drops 25% tomorrow, an inverse-leveraged TSLA ETF will drop by 25%, or 50%, or 75% in a day. The extent of the drop depends on the extent of the leverage provided. The same is true in the other direction. Two ugly realities: In general, these are toys for speculators. They are not investment products. Sadly, investors fall for marketing and overestimate their own abilities. They think they’ll track that 3X DraftKings ETF and move like a ballerina. Or, frankly, more likely, like Dumbo. In general, academic and professional research reach the same conclusion. If you’re a professional with vast tracking resources and a holding period of one day or less, these are fine tools. If you aren’t a professional and don’t intend to monitor hour-by-hour for the rest of your adult life, run away. Morningstar’s take: Single-stock ETFs can meet the needs of a few. High-conviction traders with a single-day or shorter holding period may find them useful vehicles to express their views. After all, it’s hard for everyday investors to use leverage or construct their own covered calls. But the fact is that these products are rarely sensible for everyday investors. They are flawed, costly, and liable to take more from investors than they give. (Ryan Jackson, “For Most Investors, Single-Stock ETFs Are Best Left Alone,” Morningstar.com, 4/9/2024) Which, of course, means that we’re being flooded with them. Here’s a sampling of the 485A prospectus filings that MFO came across during just two weeks in May 2025: More specialized new games include: On May 28, 2025, Mr. Trump’s Department of Labor rescinded a 2022 policy urging “extreme caution” about including cryptocurrency in retirement plans. The official announcement read: The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration has rescinded a 2022 compliance release that previously discouraged fiduciaries from including cryptocurrency options in 401(k) retirement plans. The 2022 guidance directed plan fiduciaries to exercise “extreme care” before adding cryptocurrency to investment menus. This language deviated from the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and marked a departure from the department’s historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions. “The Biden administration’s department of labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” One might pause at the breathtaking hypocrisy disguised as policy guidance. If we’re talking about crypto, beloved by Elon & co., the rule is “investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” If we’re talking about the option of socially-responsible investments in the same accounts, the rule reverses, and the government must surely make financial decisions rather than trusting fiduciaries. It’s a policy that marries the mendacious with the disastrous, a rare accomplishment. The proposed inclusion of cryptocurrencies in employer retirement plan options raises significant concerns about investor protection, particularly given the extreme volatility and risk characteristics these digital assets exhibit. The cryptocurrency market has experienced substantial growth in trading activity, with the top exchanges processing trillions in volume annually. According to current market data, there are literally millions of cryptocurrencies in circulation (really, you could make your own this afternoon since there are no regulations and no barriers to entry). The total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell 18.6% in Q1 2025 to close at $2.8 trillion, after briefly touching $3.8 trillion in January. This dramatic swing within a single quarter exemplifies the type of volatility that could devastate retirement portfolios, particularly for investors nearing or in retirement who have limited time to recover from significant losses. Consider, for example, the drawdown periods for the oldest and most liquid coin, Bitcoin. Source: LazyPortfolioETF, using Highcharts graphing. Remember, this is just the downside. There are lunatic price spikes the rest of the time. The point here is to help you get a big picture of how deep the knife plunges (the red drawdowns) and how long the wound lasts (the gray “ramps” shows months to recovery). Below are the five-year risk-return metrics for the two largest cryptocurrencies, which we assume are the two most likely to infiltrate a retirement plan. Sources: Lazy Portfolio ETF (for Bitcoin), Portfolio Labs ETH-USD, and S&P Ethereum Index The data reveals several alarming characteristics that underscore the inappropriateness of these investments for retirement accounts. Bitcoin, despite being the most established cryptocurrency, has experienced maximum drawdowns exceeding 70%, meaning investors could lose more than 70% of their investment. The recovery period for Bitcoin’s maximum drawdown required 19 months, during which retirement investors would face sustained and severe portfolio losses. Ethereum presents even more extreme risk characteristics, with a maximum five-year drawdown of nearly 79% (and a near-complete meltdown in 2018) The current Ethereum drawdown stands at 45.29%, that is, at the end of May 2025, an Ether is worth 45% less than it was at its November 2021 peak. For retirement investors, such sustained periods of substantial losses could prove financially catastrophic, particularly for those requiring portfolio withdrawals during retirement. The smaller cryptocurrencies are worse. Retirement investors require stable, predictable growth that preserves capital while generating reasonable returns over long time horizons. The documented maximum drawdowns approaching 95-96% for major cryptocurrencies represent existential threats to the retirement security of elderly investors. The extreme volatility documented in this analysis represents not an investment opportunity but rather a fundamental threat to retirement system stability and individual financial security. These decisions, government and corporate, continue to move the markets in the direction of a casino. Investors’ conviction that “patience is for losers” just makes them losers. Buy quality stocks from experienced managers. Diversify away from assets that depend on Washington acting like adults. Find managers who manage volatility thoughtfully. We list them! What’s an investor to do? Learn from the experience of others. When you suspect something wicked is around, do not go alone into the basement with a flickering light. When you suspect something wicked this way comes, do not wander off on your own – away from the security of friends – “to see what made that noise.” “Acting without knowing takes you right off the cliff.” ― Ray Bradbury, Something Wicked This Way Comes (1962) David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts).
