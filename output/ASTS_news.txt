Despite pushback from rival SpaceX, AST SpaceMobile has received FCC approval to launch the company’s massive prototype satellite for phone connectivity from space. On Friday, the FCC granted AST SpaceMobile an experimental license to essentially test FM1, a giant square-shaped satellite that the company has been aiming to launch this month. Although the experimental license prohibits AST from “conducting any commercial operations” through the satellite, the FCC's approval brings the company a step closer to building its satellite-to-phone internet system —avoiding what could have been a prolonged delay The FM1 marks AST’s first attempt at sending up a second-generation BlueBird satellite, which spans around 200 square meters — or about three times the size of the company’s first-generation BlueBirds. The FM1 weighs in at nearly 13,000 pounds and features a "phased array antenna" at about 199 square meters, letting it operate as a cell tower in space. The FM1’s increased size and capability promises to help the Texas-based AST SpaceMobile deliver even better satellite internet connectivity to everyday smartphones through carriers including AT&T and Verizon. The satellite connectivity is designed to power voice, video calls and data to users in cellular dead zones. But the company has been facing a growing rivalry with SpaceX, which has been developing its own competing solution in the cellular Starlink service, set to officially launch through T-Mobile on July 23rd. Earlier this year, SpaceX criticized AST’s plans to launch the FM1, pointing out alleged flaws in the company’s application, including its orbital safety plan for the satellite. Last month, the Elon Musk company also seized on the paperwork problems with AST’s application, and urged the FCC to dismiss it. “The inconsistencies, discrepancies and inadequacies of AST’s orbital debris showings suggest its system will not promote sustainable operations in low-Earth orbit as the Commission’s rules intend,” SpaceX told the FCC on June 27th. But in response, AST told the Commission days later that SpaceX’s objections were baseless and a sign of “anticompetitive behavior aimed at impeding AST SpaceMobile’s progress toward deploying its groundbreaking space-based cellular broadband network.” The FCC itself also found many discrepancies and minor errors in AST’s application, asking them to be corrected. However, the Commission's new head, Republican Brendan Carr, has signaled his overall support for the US to expand and dominate in next-generation satellite services. In April, Carr posted pictures of his visit to AST’s headquarters in Midland, Texas. AST’s goal is to kick off its own beta service to consumers early next year. But doing so will depend on whether it can launch enough second-generation BlueBird satellites in the coming months. Currently, the company only has five first-generation BlueBird satellites in orbit when it needs at least 45 to 60 to begin offering continuous service across the US and other markets. AST also still needs to secure regulatory approval from the FCC to operate the BlueBirds for commercial phone activities. To fly up the satellites, AST has tapped both SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin. Meanwhile, the FM1 is slated to launch through India’s national space agency.
