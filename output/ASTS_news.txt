Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © NicoElNino / Shutterstock.com Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is often seen as a core tech giant focused on search, advertising, and cloud computing. Yet beneath its main operations lies a quieter side: a venture arm that invests in promising companies in areas like space tech, geospatial data, and semiconductors. These bets target innovations adjacent to Alphabet’s ecosystem, such as enhanced connectivity for Android devices, Earth observation for AI-driven mapping in Google Earth, and efficient chip designs for data centers powering Google Cloud. Through GV (formerly Google Ventures) and CapitalG, Alphabet manages a portfolio of about 37 public stocks valued at $2.5 billion to $3 billion as of late 2025. The three largest positions — AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS), Planet Labs (NYSE:PL), and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) — highlight its strategy of backing high-growth plays in satellite networks, imaging analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. AST SpaceMobile tops Alphabet’s portfolio with a stake worth approximately $459 million at current prices, representing 18% of its equity holdings. The company aims to build a satellite-based cellular network that connects unmodified smartphones directly from space, eliminating dead zones in remote areas. Alphabet’s interest stems from synergies with Android, with plans to enable seamless SpaceMobile connectivity on billions of devices worldwide. This aligns with Alphabet’s push for ubiquitous access to its services, like Maps and YouTube, in underserved markets. The $155 million investment in early 2024, followed by an additional $203 million in shares during this year’s first quarter, underscores confidence in ASTS’s partnerships with carriers like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), which serve over 2.5 billion subscribers. Growth prospects look explosive. AST plans nationwide U.S. intermittent service by late 2025, expanding to Canada, Japan, and the U.K. in early 2026. Analysts forecast explosive revenue growth over the next few years, fueled by these deals. With a $1.2 billion cash buffer and a recent $420 million loan, funding for satellite launches is secure. The stock is up 143% year-to-date, despite losing half its value in the past month after missing Wall Street’s Q3 estimates last week. Trading around $52 per share, AST carries risks like execution delays in orbital deployments. For risk-tolerant investors, AST SpaceMobile offers moonshot potential — 50% upside by 2026 according to some models — if it captures even a slice of the $100 billion satellite broadband market. Alphabet’s bet signals it’s worth considering for those eyeing telecom disruption. Planet Labs holds the second spot in Alphabet’s portfolio at $356 million, or about 17% of holdings. Founded by NASA scientists, the company operates a fleet of over 200 satellites capturing daily global imagery, delivering geospatial data for agriculture, finance, defense, and climate monitoring. Alphabet invests here to bolster Google Earth and AI tools: Planet’s archives power environmental analytics, like deforestation tracking, and integrate with Google’s Earth AI models for pixel-level predictions on risks such as cholera outbreaks or hurricanes. This enhances Alphabet’s cloud services for enterprise clients needing real-time Earth intelligence. The growth case is compelling despite current unprofitability. Shares have surged 176% in 2025, trading near $11, but are down 33% from the highs hit last month. Fiscal Q2 backlog exploded 245% year-over-year to $736 million — 2.6 times fiscal 2026 revenue guidance — signaling locked-in demand. Analysts project 20% topline growth through 2027, driven by AI-enhanced subscriptions and government contracts. Partnerships with Airbus and the World Health Organization add credibility. At a 13.1 price-to-sales ratio, valuation feels stretched amid $22.6 million Q2 losses, but improving margins from fleet efficiencies could flip to profits by 2027. Wall Street’s “Buy” consensus targeting $14.55 per share implies 30% upside, but aggressive investors may buy for the 18% annual revenue growth forecast, outpacing the aerospace sector. Alphabet sees untapped value in data monetization, making PL a solid pick for thematic exposure to geospatial AI. Arm Holdings rounds out Alphabet’s top trio with a stake valued at around $258 million, roughly 11.5% of the portfolio. As a designer of energy-efficient CPU architectures, Arm licenses blueprints used in 99% of smartphones and increasingly in data centers. Alphabet’s investment ties directly to Google Cloud: Arm’s designs underpin custom chips like the Axion processor, offering 60% better performance-per-watt than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) or Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rivals, slashing costs for AI workloads. This supports Alphabet’s hyperscale needs, where Arm expects 50% data center CPU share by the end of 2025. Fiscal Q2 2026 revenue topped $1 billion (up 34% year-over-year), with royalties jumping 21% on Armv9 adoption. Q3 guidance calls for 25% revenue growth to $1.17 billion to $1.28 billion, fueled by smartphones, autos, and cloud. Analysts forecast 21% long-term earnings growth, pushing shares from $131 to a $168 target — 28% upside. The stock is up just 6% year-to-date after getting cut 28% during the market’s recent slide, but trades at a lofty 167 P/E. Still, partnerships with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and SoftBank, plus Compute Subsystems royalties, position Arm for dominance in edge AI. Investors chasing semiconductors could buy, as Alphabet’s stake validates its role in the $500 billion chip market, but a decision to make its own AI chips introduces much more risk.

In a new regulatory salvo, SpaceX is questioning whether rival AST SpaceMobile—a Texas-based satellite company—is too closely tied to Europe. Although it’s common for satellite players to criticize each other in regulatory filings, Elon Musk's company is now bringing geopolitics in the mix. In a 9-page filing, SpaceX urged the FCC to scrutinize AST SpaceMobile’s recent moves to establish a jointly owned European satellite service with British carrier Vodafone. The EU has been looking for alternatives to SpaceX's Starlink, and AST has described the project as ensuring "European sovereignty" in satellite communications. However, SpaceX is subtly suggesting that AST’s business isn’t entirely aligned with US interests. "AST’s application for a sovereign European system with an overseas 'command switch' raises fundamental interference, space sustainability, and national security concerns that require clarification and correction," SpaceX writes in its filing. AST says its satellite plans with Vodafone will include a “command switch to support European oversight and security,” providing European partners with a way to modify encryption keys for satellite communications and manage the satellite beams. In an earnings call last week, AST also indicated the satellite system for Europe will be part of the satellite constellation that serves all markets, including the US. "AST and its owners have made several claims recently that raise serious concerns about foreign control over its system," SpaceX argues. "In light of these claims, AST should clarify the extent of foreign ownership and control over its proposed system, including whether its application is more appropriately filed as a request for US market access." The FCC is currently reviewing AST SpaceMobile’s application to operate a satellite-to-phone service in the US through AT&T and Verizon. The application’s approval is crucial, especially since AST is hoping to kick off its service sometime next year. But the same system is also poised to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service, which is already available through T-Mobile, and can power texting, mobile apps, and video calls in dead zones. In its filing, SpaceX also claims that AST’s procedures to retire aging satellites contain “many holes,” warranting a closer look from the FCC before green-lighting the application. “To highlight just one example, AST maintains a post-mission disposal plan to barrel-roll its satellites through other satellite constellations in order to compensate for AST’s lack of adequate fuel reserves but fails to explain how it will avoid collisions during these dangerous maneuvers,” SpaceX alleges. On Tuesday, T-Mobile submitted its own filing to the FCC, urging the commission to "take no action" on AST's application until the company provides more details about how it’ll address potential radio interference with ground-based cellular networks. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But FCC Chair Brendan Carr has been a supporter of both SpaceX and AST SpaceMobile. In April, he posted a video of his visit to AST’s Texas headquarters, and touted the company as a counter to China’s satellite ambitions.

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. SpaceX's partner, T-Mobile, is pressing US regulators to scrutinize AST SpaceMobile, arguing that the company’s satellites risk causing harmful interference to terrestrial cell networks. On Tuesday, T-Mobile sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, which is reviewing AST SpaceMobile’s application to operate a satellite internet service for phones. It urges the FCC to "take no action" on AST's application "unless and until sufficient information is provided” about the radio interference concerns. “AST has failed to demonstrate that its proposed SCS [Supplemental Coverage from Space] operations will satisfy the Commission’s stated goal to minimize the risk of interference from SCS services to existing terrestrial networks,” the carrier says. T-Mobile adds that AST should be required to disclose its maps detailing where the satellite signals will reach in the US, including over traditional cellular sites. “Accordingly, AST must provide maps that show the overlay of its satellite beams on all geographic market areas, for all relevant elevation angles, including license areas to which it will have access to terrestrial spectrum, and how its satellites will be capable of confining SCS service to those licensed areas,” T-Mobile claims. It also alleges that AST has been using metrics to underestimate the potential radio interference to user equipment. Texas-based AST SpaceMobile didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the company’s upcoming constellation is poised to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink, which launched through T-Mobile in July. AST has partnered with AT&T and Verizon to deliver its own satellite-to-phone service, starting as soon as next year. To do so, the company is preparing to launch dozens of exceptionally large "BlueBird" satellites, with the first prototypes scheduled to fly in the coming weeks. But another crucial step is receiving FCC approval to officially operate the satellite-to-phone service in the US. The radio interference concerns from T-Mobile are a bit ironic, considering its partner SpaceX has faced and fought back against its own interference claims from other companies. Such disputes are nothing new at the FCC, where satellite operators routinely lobby for spectrum access and regulatory approvals. SpaceX previously challenged AST’s plans through earlier FCC filings. However, AST has fired back, calling out SpaceX as anticompetitive and criticizing its approach to satellites. My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years.
