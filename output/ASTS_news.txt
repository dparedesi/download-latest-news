As part of the U.S. Space Force, SDA is responsible for the rapid deployment of essential space-based capabilities to enhance terrestrial operations. This is achieved through the development, deployment, and operation of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. This latest contract builds upon the successful in-orbit testing of BlueWalker-3, conducted under a previous agreement announced in February 2024. The award further underscores AST SpaceMobile's technological advancements and their application in specialized government operations. The company plans to deploy its next-generation Block 2 BlueBird satellites, which feature the largest commercial phased array antennas ever placed in low Earth orbit. These antennas span an extraordinary 2,400 square feet, setting a new benchmark in connectivity and operational performance. "This second contract supporting the SDA underscores the confidence in AST SpaceMobile's innovative technology and its potential to support critical government missions," stated Chris Ivory, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Government Business at AST SpaceMobile. "We are deploying groundbreaking technology to create robust and resilient communications solutions and to enable new use cases for the U.S. government." AST SpaceMobile's extensive technology portfolio, supported by 3,500 patents and patent-pending claims, offers significant dual-use capabilities for both governmental and commercial applications. The company's large phased-array antennas and innovative architecture deliver resilient, scalable, and high-performance communication solutions to meet evolving operational demands.
