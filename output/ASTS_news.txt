T-Mobile's cellular Starlink service for phones is here. But rival AT&T isn’t staying quiet and reminding customers that its own satellite offering is on the horizon. On Wednesday, AT&T tried to grab some of the spotlight from the T-Satellite launch by revealing that it completed a native voice call using its radio spectrum through the company’s satellite partner, AST SpaceMobile, an emerging rival to SpaceX's cellular Starlink service. The voice call was routed through AST’s five BlueBird satellites in Earth’s orbit, “with a standard cell phone using AT&T spectrum and passing through the AT&T core network,” the carrier said. AT&T likely wanted to signal that its own satellite-to-phone technology is coming, with the goal of beating T-Satellite on features. Although T-Mobile has a head start, its satellite-to-phone service is currently limited to text messaging and sharing locations. SpaceX plans on adding voice and video call support, but the exact timeline remains unclear. Meanwhile, AST is developing its own rival service, which has attracted AT&T, Verizon, and European carrier Vodafone as partners while securing investment from Google. AT&T’s announcement underscores the growing competition in satellite-to-phone connectivity, which can beam signals to users in cellular dead zones. In February, the carrier demonstrated it was able to power a video call through AST’s satellites. The technology harnesses orbiting satellites to act as cell towers in Earth’s orbit. The problem is AST only has five BlueBird satellites in operation, whereas SpaceX currently has over 650 cellular Starlink satellites. That's enough for coverage across the globe, including in other markets such as Canada, Japan, and New Zealand. It’s also why AT&T (and Verizon) customers still need to wait. AST's five BlueBird satellites have only been able to offer two 15-minute windows of coverage per day, AT&T told us last year. But AST is aiming to dramatically increase its satellite constellation by launching more powerful, second-generation BlueBirds in the coming months. Its first prototype second-gen BlueBird is slated to launch next month through India’s space agency, according to a presentation slide posted on social media. AST’s goal is to kick off a commercial service for consumers early next year. “Our plan is for this service to be text, internet, data, and access to applications like video conferencing,” AST CEO Abel Avellan said in May. But reaching the goal will depend on whether AST can launch enough satellites in the intervening months while securing regulatory approval from the US Federal Communications Commission. If it can’t, then consumers can expect delays. Satellite industry analyst Tim Farrar also points out AT&T might be trying to lower the expectations for AST's service. The carrier has revised some of the language promoting the upcoming technology to say "one day it may also support video services. In contrast, weeks earlier, the site said the satellite service was being designed to offer a "full suite of connectivity: voice, data, text, and video services in remote, off-grid locations." In the meantime, T-Mobile has made its cellular Starlink service available to customers on rival carriers, including AT&T and Verizon, for $10 per month. T-Mobile even offered the satellite capability for free to AT&T and Verizon subscribers during the free beta period. But now, new customers will need to call or visit a T-Mobile store for access.

Title: Debris and Collisions? SpaceX Flags AST SpaceMobile's Satellites As Safety Risk

SpaceX has a new complaint against competitor AST SpaceMobile, warning that the company’s "tennis-court-sized" satellites pose a collision risk that could result in dangerous space debris. On Tuesday, SpaceX sent a new letter to the Federal Communications Commission, urging the agency to closely scrutinize AST’s proposal to operate 248 satellites in Earth's orbit to power cellular connectivity for everyday smartphones. AST already has five “BlueBird” satellites in orbit, each measuring 700 square feet. However, the company has plans to launch dozens of second-generation BlueBirds that are about three times larger and offer even stronger cellular connectivity. A prototype second-gen BlueBird is slated to launch in the coming weeks, following FCC approval. But in Tuesday’s letter, SpaceX claims that AST’s plan to safely orbit the proposed BlueBird constellation contains “critical gaps and inconsistencies” that raise questions about whether the satellites can avoid collisions in space while preventing debris from falling toward Earth. “Authorizing AST to launch its proposed spacecraft without resolving these issues would be irresponsible, potentially subjecting all other operators in LEO (low-Earth orbit) to unnecessary risk,” SpaceX wrote. The critical gaps include AST allegedly “underestimating” the collision risk of the company’s BlueBird satellites once they’ve been retired and “massively undercounting the number of objects it will need to avoid in its orbits.” In addition, SpaceX says AST’s application neglects to cover whether the satellites contain any “ferromagnetic components.” That’s a potential problem because AST plans on retiring its satellites by allowing them to burn up in the atmosphere. “These components are typically among the most challenging for demisability, meaning they are the most likely to survive re-entry and cause risk to human life,” SpaceX says, later adding: “AST routinely brags about the outlandish size of its satellites. But these large satellites may dramatically increase the risk of all operations in their orbits and below.” AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but the company has previously accused Elon Musk of using "bullying” tactics to try to derail the competition. SpaceX has fired back, alleging that AST has its own anticompetitive efforts. Tuesday's letter underscores the simmering rivalry between SpaceX and AST. Both companies are working to offer satellite services to everyday smartphones while trying to lobby the FCC to rule in their favor. However, the dispute also highlights the safety measures around today's growing satellite constellations. For example, SpaceX has been retiring and de-orbiting hundreds of Starlink satellites in recent months by letting them burn up in the atmosphere. The satellites are designed to disintegrate completely, but in some rare instances, they have caused debris to fall to the planet. In February, the company released a report that estimated the chances of a V2 Mini Starlink satellite causing a human casualty due to falling debris were less than "1 in 100 million." In the meantime, SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service is preparing to officially launch tomorrow through T-Mobile. AST, on the other hand, is aiming to kick off its own beta program early next year through partners AT&T and Verizon.
