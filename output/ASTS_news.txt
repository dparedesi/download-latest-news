Starlink rival AST SpaceMobile appears to be facing a longer-than-expected delay in launching its FM1 prototype satellite, which will provide cellular connectivity to smartphones. AST SpaceMobile has contracted India’s space agency, ISRO, to launch the FM1. It was originally supposed to happen this month and was later pushed to October/November. But on Thursday, the head of the space agency, V. Narayanan, indicated during a press conference that the satellite won’t fly until Q1 2026. "Most likely December-January time frame, this [launch] will be executed," Narayanan told local media outlet NDTV. The FM1 is important because it's the company's first stab at launching a massive satellite that's three times larger than AST’s first-generation BlueBird satellites. The increased size promises to boost the satellite’s capacity by 10 times, enabling it to serve more smartphones on the ground with better speeds. AST has partnered with AT&T and Verizon to eventually offer satellite connectivity to smartphones, putting it in direct competition with T-Mobile’s cellular Starlink service. AST has said it plans to kick off a “nationwide intermittent service in the United States” by year's end. But the delay at ISRO casts doubt on the company’s timeline, which has faced delays before. A year ago, the Texas-based company originally sought to launch the first second-generation BlueBirds in Q1 2025. To get the service working, the company needs to launch 45 to 60 satellites to deliver continuous coverage in the US when it currently only has five first-generation BlueBirds in orbit. "In the case of the US, when we get to around 45 [satellites], you get very close to a service that you can offer. And then as you get to 60, you are in full continuous service," AST CEO Abel Avellan said in a recent earnings call. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in its earnings presentation, the company said it anticipates “at least five orbital launches by [the] end of Q1 2026.” The FM1 is also supposed to ship to India this month. Avellan also indicated the FM1 wouldn’t hold back the company from launching other BlueBird satellites. “The other satellites are basically at the same few weeks after the FM1. So we are treating them separately. We're not conditioning any of the launches to any specific launch,” he said. This has raised speculation that AST will try to launch a separate second-generation BlueBird, known as the FM2, later this year. In addition to ISRO, the company has contracted SpaceX and Blue Origin to help it launch the satellites. The plan is to conduct launches “every one to two months on average to reach the goal of 45 to 60 satellites launched during 2025 and 2026,” AST says.

Title: Will AST SpaceMobile Stock Continue To Fly High?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AST SpaceMobile stock (NASDAQ:ASTS) has increased by about 4% in the past week and remains up more than 2x over the last year. The satellite design company is constructing a space-based cellular broadband network that connects directly to standard smartphones without requiring additional hardware. Its services are intended for both commercial use and government applications. In its Q2 2025 earnings update, the company stated that it had confirmed a strategy to launch 45 to 60 satellites into orbit by 2026 to support cellular-based broadband networks. The company aims for orbital launches every one to two months, on average, throughout 2025 and 2026, and indicated that the satellites are fully financed. Currently, AST operates six satellites in orbit and is set to introduce nationwide service in the U.S. by late 2025 through AT&T and Verizon, followed by expansion into the U.K., Japan, and Canada in early 2026. There is an ongoing competition to establish broadband services via satellites, with Elon Musk’s SpaceX currently in the lead, having over 8,000 Starlink satellites already in orbit. However, AST SpaceMobile’s strategy is distinct in several ways. While Starlink directly targets consumers by selling hardware and internet subscriptions, AST’s satellites are designed to operate like space-based cellular towers, directly integrating into the networks of existing mobile operators like AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, and Verizon. This approach enables users to access connectivity from these satellites using their regular smartphones and existing SIM cards. For carriers, this value proposition is significant. Collaborating with AST allows them to extend 4G and 5G coverage into deserts, oceans, mountains, and other under-served regions where traditional towers are not economically viable. This enables them to offer truly nationwide or even global coverage to customers. These advantages can enhance customer satisfaction and open up new revenue channels without carriers having to shoulder the hefty costs of rural infrastructure. Rather than marketing directly to consumers, AST generates revenue by charging carriers for access to its satellite capacity, with pricing based on usage or long-term contracts. This strategy could provide AST with a recurring, high-margin revenue model while establishing strong partnerships throughout the global telecom sector. Separately, wonder whether you should Buy Nvidia Stock Ahead of Earnings? With a market capitalization of approximately $16 billion, ASTS is trading at around 260x the consensus 2025 revenue estimates of $60 million. This represents a steep valuation considering the company is in its early operational stages. Nevertheless, growth has been swift, albeit from a small base, with revenues increasing by 249% over the last year to $4.9 million. See ASTS Revenue Comparison. Losses continue to be substantial, with operating losses reported at $260 million over the past 12 months. ASTS has performed significantly worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. In the 2022 inflation-driven market crash, ASTS stock plummeted 68.5% from a high of $22.50 on February 9, 2021, to $7.08 on June 1, 2021, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500. Read ASTS Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has rebounded from significant drops in the past. Nonetheless, the company boasts a robust balance sheet, with $924 million in cash and cash equivalents, a debt-to-equity ratio of just 4.3%, and cash comprising nearly half of its total assets. This financial flexibility should provide AST with the capacity to execute its satellite deployment strategy, though investors will need to be patient as the company transitions from technology rollout to commercial-scale revenue generation. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride overall, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
