T-Mobile’s (TMUS+0.63%) direct-to-cell (DTC) satellite messaging service powered by Elon Musk’s Starlink is now free for anyone in the U.S., at least for a limited time, as the company looks to draw in customers. The companies have been collaborating for a few years now, promising in 2022 to deliver coverage “above and beyond anything customers have ever seen before” through a new network using Starlink’s satellites. In December, Starlink parent SpaceX finished launching the first shell of DTC satellites and won regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the service. “We’re still in the early days — I don’t want to overhype the experience during a beta test — but we’re officially putting ‘no bars’ on notice,” T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said in a statement. “Dead zones, your days are numbered at the Un-carrier.” The service is currently in its beta trial and limited to text messages, although T-Mobile hopes to have additional functionality available by the summer. Services like WhatsApp, some mapping and trail apps, and the ability to send photos could be ready when the beta testing ends in July, T-Mobile’s head of marketing told The Washington Post. After that point, T-Mobile users will have to pay $15 per month for the Starlink service, although that fee will drop to $10 per month if they participate in the beta test during February. Customers paying for the company’s pricey Go5G Next plan will get the service for free. Verizon (VZ+0.98%) and AT&T (T+0.91%) customers will have to pay $20 per month per line. T-Mobile said on its website that it accepts users on a rolling, “first-come, first-served basis,” noting that there are limited spots available. The company says that Apple’s (AAPL+2.74%) iPhone 14 and later models, Google’s (GOOGL-0.81%) Pixel 9, REVVL’s 7, and a slew of Samsung Galaxy phones are compatible with the service, but they need to be fully updated. Motorola’s (LNVGY+0.34%) 2024 and newer models are also compatible. SpaceX has a number of partners in other nations, such as KDDI in Japan and Telstra in Australia, and worked with AST SpaceMobile (ASTS-4.82%) to launch nationwide coverage in New Zealand in late December. In October, Kyivstar said it would work with Starlink to provide “uninterrupted” service in Ukraine. Verizon and AT&T are also working with AST SpaceMobile to launch rival services. On Jan. 30, AST SpaceMobile said the FCC had approved it to begin testing its service. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. T-Mobile said today that customers on its most expensive Go5G Next plan will receive access to satellite-to-phone connectivity via SpaceX's Starlink as a free perk starting in July. On all other plans, it will be $15 per month per line. The interesting part is that T-Mobile also plans on offering the Starlink connectivity to AT&T and Verizon customers, who will pay $20 per month per line. They will only need a compatible and unlocked smartphone that supports eSIMs, says Clint Patterson, T-Mobile's SVP of marketing. "They add a second SIM to the phone" to get cellular Starlink, Patterson says. The T-Mobile-Starlink eSIM can then be used to receive satellite-based SMS messaging in areas without ground-based cell coverage. T-Mobile published an online list of supported phones, which will be updated over time with more device models. "We've done a lot of work with OEMs and handset providers. So this will work on most smartphones from the last four years," Patterson says. "When you see that list, you'll see things like Galaxy S21 and later, iPhone 14 and later." T-Mobile plans to officially launch its cellular Starlink service in July, when a free test beta announced in December ends. The carrier revealed the news in a Super Bowl commercial about T-Mobile's partnership with SpaceX. The resulting “space-based network,” spanning over 400 satellites, is capable of beaming data to unmodified smartphones on the ground, giving consumers a way to receive a signal even in a cellular dead zone. Last month, the carrier invited select T-Mobile users on newer iPhones, Samsung Galaxy and Pixel devices to try out the satellite connectivity. The Super Bowl ad takes things further, with T-Mobile confirming it’ll expand the free beta program to "anyone on any wireless carrier." The offer lasts until July. For now, the satellite connectivity only supports SMS-based text messaging in dead zones. But over time, SpaceX plans on rolling out support for voice calls and data downloads, pending some regulatory lobbying. In July, business customers will also get T-Mobile Starlink at no extra cost on Go 5G Business Next, first responder agencies on T-Priority plans, and other select premium rate plans. The move to include rival carriers is sure to turn heads since AT&T and Verizon are both pursuing their own satellite ventures through AST SpaceMobile and Skylo, respectively. But in AST’s case, the company still remains months away at best from offering the satellite-to-phone service to mainstream consumers. (T-Mobile says it didn’t initially plan to open Starlink’s cellular service to users on rival carriers. But that changed after Verizon aired a big-budget commercial last week touting its own satellite-to-phone capabilities.) As for SpaceX, the company received FCC clearance in November to commercially operate the cellular Starlink service. The license permits SpaceX to use T-Mobile’s radio spectrum in the 1900MHz block to beam the satellite connectivity to certified devices. The latest phones from Apple, Samsung, and Google have received an FCC Part 25 Supplement Coverage from Space certification. Hence, T-Mobile should be able to beam the satellite data connectivity to them, even though they may be running on another carrier’s network. T-Mobile customers with iPhones and Galaxy devices have already tried out the cellular Starlink service through the beta program. It has enabled them to send SMS text messages in remote areas in the US, but the signal quality isn’t always consistent. "It does drop signal quite often. You do get a notification when you are connected, though,” one beta tester told PCMag. That said, SpaceX is preparing to launch hundreds of additional cellular Starlink satellites, which promise to boost the signal quality. In a statement, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said: “We’re still in the early days — I don’t want to overhype the experience during a beta test — but we’re officially putting ‘no bars’ on notice. Dead zones, your days are numbered at the Un-carrier.” In terms of pricing, the $15 and $20 monthly fees may be high for consumers, especially if they don’t live near any cellular dead zones. But T-Mobile is offering an early adopter discount to its own subscribers through this month that cuts the price to $10 per month per line.

I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 9 Trending AI News Updates on Wall Street’s Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTS) stands against other trending AI news updates on Wall Street’s radar. Sarah Guo, founder of Conviction, spoke on Bloomberg Technology about the evolving AI space and the impact of open-source models. She noted that AI has developed rapidly since her firm launched, reinforcing its belief in its long-term significance. Initially, the firm invested in application companies and vertically integrated businesses, a strategy she believes remains relevant today. She pointed out that competition among foundation models has increased significantly in recent weeks. Guo also discussed Deep Seek and described it as a powerful model with multiple layers, including a base model, an instruction-tuned version, and a reasoning model. While DeepSeek’s origins in a Chinese hedge fund surprised many, she sees its open-source nature as beneficial for developers and a challenge for the U.S. to stay competitive in AI. She also emphasized that no single country holds exclusive control over AI talent, making export restrictions less effective. When the discussion shifted to investment trends, Guo explained that while AI is expanding economic opportunities across infrastructure, tooling, and model development, her firm prioritizes applications and industry-specific solutions. She noted that training large models remains costly, despite claims of lower expenses, and expects the most sustainable growth to come from application-focused companies. Guo also discussed agentic AI and how it improves customer experiences in industries such as finance and travel. She explained that AI’s ability to handle more complex tasks increases its value to businesses, making applications that automate tasks more attractive. As AI continues to advance beyond simple responses, she expects companies working on industry-specific automation to capture significant market value. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Title: Not Enough Sats? Starlink Director Throws Shade at Rival AST SpaceMobile

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. A director at SpaceX is questioning rival AST SpaceMobile’s plan to bring satellite connectivity to phones, casting doubt about the company’s technology and approach. In a tweet on Wednesday, Ben Longmier, senior director for satellite engineering at SpaceX, disputed how AST has said it only needs 45 to 60 company satellites to offer nationwide coverage for the US. According to Longmier, AST’s network simply won’t be large enough, resulting in spotty signal quality. “The notion that AST will cover the US with continuous data with 60 sats is incorrect. No one wants bursty data separated by tens of minutes of 0 bps,” he wrote. SpaceX is developing its own satellite-to-phone service via cellular Starlink. The company has already kicked off beta tests with T-Mobile users, delivering satellite connectivity to iPhones and Samsung devices using a growing constellation of over 400 satellites. The 400 satellites have already shown they can power SMS messages to phones based in cellular dead zones, although the signal quality can be inconsistent. SpaceX is also working (and lobbying) to bring voice calls and data downloads to the satellite network. In another tweet, Longmier added: “We want to launch a couple hundred more sats so that the whole US has a high-quality data experience. No user will tolerate long gaps in data coverage. Any LEO [low-Earth orbiting] operator needs many hundreds of sats for this type of coverage.” AST SpaceMobile didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the tweets from Longmier highlight the growing rivalry between the two companies. In October, SpaceX also accused AST of spreading misinformation to the FCC while deriding it as a “meme stock” out to derail progress on the company’s cellular Starlink technology. On the technology front, SpaceX has talked about operating thousands of cellular Starlink satellites in the coming years, similar to the home internet-focused Starlink business. In contrast, AST has talked about a smaller constellation spanning 60 larger satellites, although the company previously filed for regulatory authority to operate up to 243. So far, AST has only launched five of its “BlueBird” satellites, which recently gained FCC approval to start operational tests. However, each BlueBird is exceptionally large, with a 700-square-foot communication array capable of beaming high-speed data and powering video calls. To improve the signal quality further, the company is preparing second-generation BlueBird models that promise to be 3.4 times larger and deliver a 10 times boost in capacity. Both AT&T and Verizon have signed up to use the company’s technology, while a vocal group of stock investors has been touting AST as the future leader in mobile satellite connectivity. Hence, the public can expect more debates and regulatory spats over which company’s technology performs best, especially as T-Mobile aims to move the cellular Starlink system out of beta and to a mainstream release later this year.
