AST SpaceMobile is highlighting how it will ensure that its large satellites do not become a nuisance to astronomers through several changes, including rolling and tilting in space. Last week, the cellular satellite provider sent a letter to the FCC about its efforts to prevent the company's BlueBird satellites from interfering with astronomy. These satellites each boast an exceptionally large 700-square-foot panel, which can reflect sunlight, turning the satellites into some of the most luminous objects in the sky, akin to a bright star. In the letter to the FCC, AST says it’s close to reaching a “comprehensive coordination agreement” with the US National Science Foundation for both optical astronomy and radio astronomy. “The parties are in the final stages of approving the agreement,” Texas-based AST SpaceMobile writes. The document adds that AST has committed to taking several measures, which include “using commercially reasonable efforts to operationally roll or tilt spacecraft to avoid direct illumination of optical telescopes.” Another measure involves the satellites incorporating “deployable antenna elements that reduce brightness.” The company has also pledged to share its satellite location data with astronomers, giving them a way to plan their observations ahead of time. “AST SpaceMobile will also continue to evaluate ways to mitigate impacts on optical astronomy interests, including physical design changes, attitude maneuvering, maintaining authorized orbital elevations, and providing orbital information to astronomers,” the letter adds. AST SpaceMobile didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a statement, NSF said it's "in the process of coordinating with AST SpaceMobile [and will] share more information when coordination is complete." So it’s unclear how AST plans to roll and tilt its satellites, and what other design changes may be in store. But the FCC made the NSF coordination a condition to granting partial approval to AST operating its satellite constellation. The startup envisions one day operating dozens of BlueBird satellites in orbit, capable of beaming internet data to phones on the ground. But astronomers have been worrying about the brightness of the company’s satellites, especially since they could proliferate and disrupt telescopic observations. In the meantime, AST’s first batch of BlueBird satellites were sent into Earth’s orbit in September. Over a month later, all five satellites unfolded their antenna arrays. AST is now waiting for FCC approval so that it can start testing the satellites with phones on the ground.

This agreement positions AST SpaceMobile to combine its existing low-band spectrum coverage in the continental United States with premium lower mid-band spectrum access, creating an enhanced framework for reliable and widespread connectivity. The company's advanced communications arrays, the largest deployed in low Earth orbit, will support this integration to deliver better performance across diverse applications. "Adding premium lower mid-band spectrum access in the United States to the AST SpaceMobile network gives us long-term access to a large block of a scarce resource, significantly enhancing our planned space-based cellular broadband offering," said Abel Avellan, Chairman and CEO at AST SpaceMobile. "Alongside the previously announced 850 MHz nationwide network plans, access to the largest available block of high-quality nationwide spectrum will position us to deliver on our goal of peak data transmission speeds up to 120 Mbps, together with our mobile network operator partners, to enable a true broadband experience directly from space to everyday smartphones." The agreement, facilitated through a binding Restructuring Support Agreement with Ligado Networks ("Ligado") and its creditors, grants AST SpaceMobile long-term usage rights for 80+ years. This includes up to 40 MHz of L-Band MSS spectrum and an additional 5 MHz in the 1670-1675 MHz Band in the United States. Completion of the transaction depends on finalizing definitive documentation, anticipated in early 2025. Upon execution, Ligado will receive approximately 4.7 million penny warrants convertible into AST SpaceMobile Class A shares, subject to a 12-month lock-up. Regulatory approvals and other conditions will determine the transaction's closing, which also includes $550 million in additional consideration supported by institutional financing. AST SpaceMobile has arranged for a non-recourse senior-secured delayed-draw term loan facility to finance this commitment, with annual payments of approximately $80 million for spectrum rights. Ligado will also receive long-term net revenue sharing rights. The transaction aligns with Ligado's ongoing restructuring efforts. UBS Securities LLC is serving as the exclusive financial advisor for AST SpaceMobile. Legal counsel includes Freshfields and Sullivan and Cromwell. The company's advancements include the September 2024 launch of five BlueBird satellites, which are the largest commercial communication arrays in orbit. These satellites offer non-continuous broadband services across the United States and select global markets, with the aim of achieving nationwide coverage. The next-generation Block 2 BlueBird satellites will feature even larger arrays and deliver up to 10 times the bandwidth capacity, supporting speeds up to 120 Mbps for a full range of cellular services.

Title: AST SpaceMobile Acquires Radio Spectrum for Cellular Satellite Service

AST SpaceMobile, a rival to SpaceX's cellular Starlink business, has reached a deal to access its own slice of radio spectrum to power satellite communications for phones. AST SpaceMobile secured the radio spectrum from Ligado Networks, which is also working on cellular satellite services with partners such as Viasat and Skylo. But on Monday, Ligado filed for bankruptcy and entered into a spectrum deal with AST for about $113 million in stock. In return, AST gains the spectrum rights to a 45MHz block of Ligado’s L-band spectrum in the US and Canadian markets for 80+ years. The company is hailing the announcement as a win since it promises to bolster AST’s ability to beam satellite data to phones through the additional radio bands. It also means AST can offer its cellular satellite services independently, without always relying on its carrier partners. In the US, AST has reached deals with AT&T and Verizon to one day beam satellite connectivity to customer phones, but through their own licensed radio spectrum. AST didn’t go into details, but it expects the Ligado deal to help it increase its capacity “while enabling peak data transmission speeds up to 120Mbps to everyday smartphones everywhere in the continental United States.” On the downside, AST may need to redesign its BlueBird satellites to harness the L-band spectrum, according to satellite industry analyst Tim Farrar, who added that older phones typically don’t support L-band reception. AST launched its first batch of BlueBird satellites into Earth’s orbit in September. But the company still needs to launch dozens of additional satellites before it can begin offering full coverage to US customers. In addition, AST still needs to receive regulatory approval to both test and commercially operate such services in the US. In the meantime, the company’s deal with Ligado is expected to close during the first half of 2025. AST also notes Ligado could receive $550 million from the deal, depending on certain closing conditions. In addition, AST SpaceMobile would pay about $80 million per year for spectrum usage rights and “provide Ligado with long-term net revenue sharing rights.” I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017.
