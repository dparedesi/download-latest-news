In a rarity, SpaceX is bashing a key competitor, AST SpaceMobile, for allegedly spreading misinformation aimed at stopping the launch of SpaceX's cellular Starlink system. “AST and its investors continue their scorched-Earth campaign to hamstring competing direct-to-cellular operations,” the company told the FCC on Wednesday. In a letter, SpaceX derided AST SpaceMobile as a “meme stock” driven by investors and foreign partners out to slow progress on SpaceX’s cellular Starlink technology, which is aiming to launch a beta test with T-Mobile this fall. “Apparently not content with solely harming competition in America, AST is now taking its misinformation campaign overseas by recruiting its European investors and partners to parrot its talking points and harm competition there as well,” SpaceX claims. The company sent the letter after a group of European telecommunication providers warned the FCC they’d sue for damages if the commission loosens its rule for SpaceX and allows it to operate the cellular Starlink technology beyond normal radio emission limits. The European telcos say they fear the cellular Starlink system will create radio interference with their own networks. But at least three of the European companies—Vodafone, Telefonica and Orange—are backers of AST SpaceMobile, which is also developing a cellular satellite service to beam internet data to phones. A beta test for AST SpaceMobile could kick off in December. AT&T and Verizon—two other AST backers—have also urged the FCC not to loosen its radio emission rules for the cellular Starlink technology. SpaceX is dismissing the opposition as an orchestrated lobbying campaign from AST. “The commission should not bow to AST’s investors’ and partners’ unfounded legal threats,” SpaceX said, later adding: “The commission should see through the anticompetitive advocacy of AST and its collection of investors and partners.” SpaceX is getting closer to commercially launching its cellular Starlink system, which currently spans over 200 satellites. But to reach its full potential, the company has asked the FCC for a waiver to operate the technology beyond the so-called “aggregate out-of-band emissions power flux-density limits.” Without it, SpaceX has warned the cellular Starlink system will struggle to power real-time video and voice calls, forcing the technology to settle for text-based messaging. It’s led to a growing regulatory battle over radio emission limits; it's unclear which way the FCC will rule. In the meantime, SpaceX insists its cellular Starlink technology is designed to prevent interference, citing its own technical studies. “Tellingly, just like AST investor AT&T’s specious advocacy, these AST supporters provide zero technical support for their opposition to SpaceX’s out-of-band emissions waiver,” the company tells the FCC. AST SpaceMobile—which has seen its stock value increase more than 500% over the last 12 months—didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But last month, company partner AT&T criticized SpaceX for trying to operate the cellular Starlink technology beyond the normal limits. SpaceX "just need to follow the rules like everybody else. That’s what we’re doing, and we’re not having problems with the approvals," said AT&T’s Head of Network Chris Sambar.

In other recent news, AST SpaceMobile has made substantial progress with its satellite launch and financial growth. The company successfully launched five commercial satellites, named BlueBirds, advancing its mission to establish the first space-based cellular broadband network. These satellites are designed to provide cellular broadband speeds directly to mobile phones, with an aim to deliver non-continuous coverage across the United States and selected global markets. In addition to this, the company's stockholders approved the 2024 Incentive Award Plan, aligning the interests of service providers with shareholders. This development comes alongside Deutsche Bank's significant increase in the price target for AST SpaceMobile, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. AST SpaceMobile also confirmed the launch date for its first five BlueBird satellites, aiming to provide cellular broadband service directly to standard smartphones. B.Riley raised the stock price target for the company, reflecting confidence in its growth outlook. These developments are part of AST SpaceMobile's broader mission to bridge connectivity gaps for mobile subscribers and bring broadband to those currently unconnected. The company's innovation is backed by over 3,400 patents and patent-pending claims and has secured strategic investments from major industry players such as AT&T, Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD). AST SpaceMobile's recent warrant redemption aligns with its ambitious plans to develop a space-based cellular broadband network. According to InvestingPro data, the company's market capitalization stands at $7.16 billion, reflecting investor optimism about its potential. InvestingPro Tips highlight that ASTS holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide financial flexibility as it pursues its innovative technology. This strong cash position is particularly crucial given the capital-intensive nature of space-based communications projects. The company's stock has shown remarkable performance, with a 773.1% price total return over the past six months. This surge aligns with the growing interest in space-based technologies and the potential disruption of traditional telecommunications. However, investors should note that ASTS is not currently profitable, with a negative operating income of $238.34 million in the last twelve months. The InvestingPro Tip indicating that analysts do not anticipate profitability this year underscores the long-term nature of the company's ambitious projects.
