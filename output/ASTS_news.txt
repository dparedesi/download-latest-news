In a new regulatory salvo, SpaceX is questioning whether rival AST SpaceMobile—a Texas-based satellite company—is too closely tied to Europe. Although it’s common for satellite players to criticize each other in regulatory filings, Elon Musk's company is now bringing geopolitics in the mix. In a 9-page filing, SpaceX urged the FCC to scrutinize AST SpaceMobile’s recent moves to establish a jointly owned European satellite service with British carrier Vodafone. The EU has been looking for alternatives to SpaceX's Starlink, and AST has described the project as ensuring "European sovereignty" in satellite communications. However, SpaceX is subtly suggesting that AST’s business isn’t entirely aligned with US interests. "AST’s application for a sovereign European system with an overseas 'command switch' raises fundamental interference, space sustainability, and national security concerns that require clarification and correction," SpaceX writes in its filing. AST says its satellite plans with Vodafone will include a “command switch to support European oversight and security,” providing European partners with a way to modify encryption keys for satellite communications and manage the satellite beams. In an earnings call last week, AST also indicated the satellite system for Europe will be part of the satellite constellation that serves all markets, including the US. "AST and its owners have made several claims recently that raise serious concerns about foreign control over its system," SpaceX argues. "In light of these claims, AST should clarify the extent of foreign ownership and control over its proposed system, including whether its application is more appropriately filed as a request for US market access." The FCC is currently reviewing AST SpaceMobile’s application to operate a satellite-to-phone service in the US through AT&T and Verizon. The application’s approval is crucial, especially since AST is hoping to kick off its service sometime next year. But the same system is also poised to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service, which is already available through T-Mobile, and can power texting, mobile apps, and video calls in dead zones. In its filing, SpaceX also claims that AST’s procedures to retire aging satellites contain “many holes,” warranting a closer look from the FCC before green-lighting the application. “To highlight just one example, AST maintains a post-mission disposal plan to barrel-roll its satellites through other satellite constellations in order to compensate for AST’s lack of adequate fuel reserves but fails to explain how it will avoid collisions during these dangerous maneuvers,” SpaceX alleges. On Tuesday, T-Mobile submitted its own filing to the FCC, urging the commission to "take no action" on AST's application until the company provides more details about how it’ll address potential radio interference with ground-based cellular networks. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But FCC Chair Brendan Carr has been a supporter of both SpaceX and AST SpaceMobile. In April, he posted a video of his visit to AST’s Texas headquarters, and touted the company as a counter to China’s satellite ambitions.

SpaceX's partner, T-Mobile, is pressing US regulators to scrutinize AST SpaceMobile, arguing that the company’s satellites risk causing harmful interference to terrestrial cell networks. On Tuesday, T-Mobile sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, which is reviewing AST SpaceMobile’s application to operate a satellite internet service for phones. It urges the FCC to "take no action" on AST's application "unless and until sufficient information is provided” about the radio interference concerns. “AST has failed to demonstrate that its proposed SCS [Supplemental Coverage from Space] operations will satisfy the Commission’s stated goal to minimize the risk of interference from SCS services to existing terrestrial networks,” the carrier says. T-Mobile adds that AST should be required to disclose its maps detailing where the satellite signals will reach in the US, including over traditional cellular sites. “Accordingly, AST must provide maps that show the overlay of its satellite beams on all geographic market areas, for all relevant elevation angles, including license areas to which it will have access to terrestrial spectrum, and how its satellites will be capable of confining SCS service to those licensed areas,” T-Mobile claims. It also alleges that AST has been using metrics to underestimate the potential radio interference to user equipment. Texas-based AST SpaceMobile didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the company’s upcoming constellation is poised to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink, which launched through T-Mobile in July. AST has partnered with AT&T and Verizon to deliver its own satellite-to-phone service, starting as soon as next year. To do so, the company is preparing to launch dozens of exceptionally large "BlueBird" satellites, with the first prototypes scheduled to fly in the coming weeks. But another crucial step is receiving FCC approval to officially operate the satellite-to-phone service in the US. The radio interference concerns from T-Mobile are a bit ironic, considering its partner SpaceX has faced and fought back against its own interference claims from other companies. Such disputes are nothing new at the FCC, where satellite operators routinely lobby for spectrum access and regulatory approvals. SpaceX previously challenged AST’s plans through earlier FCC filings. However, AST has fired back, calling out SpaceX as anticompetitive and criticizing its approach to satellites. My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years.
