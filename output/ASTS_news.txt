Home » Space » AST SpaceMobile Plans 40 Direct to Cellphone Satellites Early in 2026 AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is developing a space-based cellular broadband network that provides direct-to-cellphone connectivity worldwide. This would eliminate deadzones without requiring special antennas like existing satellite phones and will work on standard smartphones. Their satellites, known as BlueBird, are designed to deliver 4G/5G service from low Earth orbit (LEO) by beaming signals directly to unmodified cell phones. The BlueBird 6 is the sixth BlueBird satellite shipped last month, August 2025. They are actively building components and phased arrays for the next 40 satellites to support expanded deployment by early 2026. This builds on their initial launch of the first five commercial BlueBird satellites (Block 1) on September 12, 2024, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The plan for 40 additional Block 2 BlueBird satellites is part of a broader initiative to deploy 45-60 satellites by the end of 2026, enabling continuous coverage in key markets. Each BlueBird satellite costs $19-23 million to manufacture and launch, with recent increases due to supply chain factors (up from $19-22 million previously). $1.3 billion is needed for the full deployment by 2026, including manufacturing, launches, and operations. They have nearly a $1 billion of cash on hand. AST Spacemobile satellites will be at 600-900 kilometers of altitude. AT&T, which along with Verizon has committed other spectrum access for AST SpaceMobile to reach mobile subscribers beyond the range of cell towers, previously announced plans to trial the service with select first responders in 2025. The long-term goal is a constellation of up to 168 satellites for global coverage. The full constellation of 168 satellites could take several more years, depending on funding and launch availability. The BlueBird satellites are large, unfoldable structures optimized for direct-to-device (D2D) cellular connectivity. Each satellite features a massive communications array measuring 693 square feet (about 64 square meters), which unfolds in orbit to create a phased-array antenna for beaming signals to cell phones. They are designed to support up to 40 MHz of bandwidth per beam, enabling peak data speeds of up to 120 Mbps. They are compatible with 3GPP-standard 4G/5G protocols, allowing seamless integration with existing cellular networks. On June 13, AST SpaceMobile announced a $550 million deal for long-term access to 45 MHz of premium lower mid-band spectrum in the United States and Canada for over 80 years. This deal with Ligado Networks, Viasat, and Inmarsat provides AST with 40 MHz of L-Band Mobile Satellite Service spectrum plus an additional 5 MHz in the 1670-1675 MHz band. AST SpaceMobile has secured agreements with over 45 mobile network operators (MNOs) worldwide, covering more than 2.8 billion subscribers.
