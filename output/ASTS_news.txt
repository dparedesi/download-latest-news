ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AST SpaceMobile stock (NASDAQ:ASTS) soared nearly 32% last week and has risen almost 4x year-to-date. The company is constructing a space-based cellular broadband network that connects directly to standard smartphones without requiring additional hardware for commercial and governmental utilization. The recent increase followed the announcement of a significant commercial partnership with Verizon to offer space-based cellular coverage throughout the continental U.S. beginning in 2026. This agreement enhances an initial strategic partnership from last year by formalizing the commercial rollout, integrating AST’s satellite network with Verizon's terrestrial infrastructure, and expanding Verizon’s 850 MHz spectrum coverage into remote regions. The agreement fortifies AST’s position against rivals such as SpaceX's Starlink and assists in strengthening its relationships with leading U.S. telecom providers. ASTS stock has experienced a substantial rise recently, yet there is considerable risk in depending on a single stock. Conversely, there is great value in a broader diversified strategy we adopt with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, ponder what the long-term performance of your portfolio could look like if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with equities. There is a continuous competition to establish broadband services via satellites, with Elon Musk’s SpaceX currently leading with over 8,000 Starlink satellites already in orbit. However, AST SpaceMobile’s approach diverges in crucial ways. While Starlink focuses on consumers directly by offering hardware and internet subscriptions, AST’s satellites are engineered to operate like space-based cell towers, integrating directly into the networks of existing mobile operators such as AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, and Verizon. This strategy allows users to access connectivity through these satellites using their regular smartphones and current SIM cards, helping to remove coverage dead zones. During its Q2 2025 earnings report, the company stated that it had verified a plan to launch 45 to 60 satellites into orbit by 2026 to energize cellular-based broadband networks. The firm aims to conduct orbital launches every one to two months on average throughout 2025 and 2026 and mentioned that the satellites are fully funded. For telecom providers, the value proposition is considerable. Collaborating with AST enables them to extend 4G and 5G coverage into deserts, oceans, mountainous regions, and other underserved locales where conventional towers are not financially viable. This allows them to offer truly nationwide or even global coverage to clients. These advantages can enhance customer satisfaction and open new revenue opportunities without telecom providers needing to incur the substantial costs associated with rural infrastructure. Instead of advertising directly to consumers, AST generates revenue by charging telecom providers for access to its satellite capacity, with pricing determined by usage or through long-term contracts. This model could afford AST a recurring, high-margin revenue stream while solidifying deep partnerships across the international telecom sector. AST has reportedly engaged with over 50 mobile network operators globally, enabling them to serve nearly 3 billion subscribers. With a market capitalization of approximately $31 billion, ASTS is trading at over 500x the consensus revenue projection for 2025 of $60 million and 120x the estimated revenue for 2026. This represents a steep valuation considering that the company is still in the nascent stages of its operations. Nonetheless, growth has been rapid, although on a small base, with revenues increasing 249% over the previous year to $4.9 million. See ASTS Revenue Comparison. Losses remain substantial, with operating losses amounting to $260 million over the last 12 months. ASTS has performed significantly worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. During the 2022 inflation shock market crash, ASTS stock plummeted 68.5% from a peak of $22.50 on February 9, 2021, to $7.08 on June 1, 2021, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500. Read ASTS Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. Nonetheless, the company continues to possess a robust balance sheet, with $924 million in cash and cash equivalents, a debt-to-equity ratio of merely 4.3%, and cash accounting for nearly half of its total assets. This financial flexibility ought to provide AST the necessary runway to implement its satellite deployment strategy, although investors will need to exercise patience as the company transitions from technology deployment to commercial-scale revenue generation. Robust demand is one of the factors we consider in our High-Quality portfolio, which has surpassed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What accounts for this? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The collaboration will integrate Verizon's terrestrial mobile network, its premium 850 MHz low-band spectrum, and AST SpaceMobile's next-generation satellite constellation in low Earth orbit. Together, the networks will enable seamless connectivity for customers in urban, rural, and remote regions without the need for specialized hardware. AST SpaceMobile's system employs the largest commercial communications arrays ever deployed in orbit, capable of connecting directly to everyday smartphones. The network is designed to utilize AST's licensed L- and S-band spectrum along with up to 1,150 MHz of partner mobile spectrum globally, advancing the company's vision of continuous, direct broadband access from space. "Through our definitive commercial agreement with Verizon, we are working to deliver space-based cellular broadband coverage from space across the continental United States," said Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman and CEO of AST SpaceMobile. "The agreement will extend the scope of Verizon's 850 MHz premium low-band spectrum into areas of the U.S. that would benefit from the ubiquitous reach of space-based broadband technology." This agreement follows successful tests that validated the AST SpaceMobile network's performance. In one milestone, a Verizon smartphone in Texas placed a crystal-clear Voice over LTE (VoLTE) call via an AST SpaceMobile BlueBird satellite to another Verizon device in New Jersey. The companies also demonstrated direct video and voice calls as well as two-way RCS messaging using unmodified smartphones, underscoring the maturity of the satellite-to-cellular technology. "This partnership with AST SpaceMobile is a good step forward in our mission to build a seamlessly connected world," said Srini Kalapala, Senior Vice President of Technology and Product Development at Verizon. "By integrating our expansive, reliable, robust terrestrial network with this innovative space-based technology, we are paving the way for a future where everything and everyone can be connected, regardless of geography."
