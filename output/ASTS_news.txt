Title: AST SpaceMobile Pitches US Military on Using Its Satellites for 'Tactical Communication'

Starlink rival AST SpaceMobile is pitching its satellite-to-phone technology to US military groups, a sign that AST and SpaceX are poised to go head-to-head in competing for defense contracts. Texas-based AST SpaceMobile has already demonstrated that its giant satellites can power voice and video calls on consumer smartphones in cellular dead zones. But on Thursday, the company touted a successful demo of its technology for "tactical satellite communication" purposes. The demo, conducted in Hawaii, involved using AST's BlueBird satellites to beam communications to a Tactical Assault Kit (TAK), which is usually mapping-related software designed for military operations. TAK can also be installed on smartphones. "The field test showcased key defense-related use cases, including real-time connectivity to the Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) over a VPN, multimedia streaming via TAK, and secure multi-party video calls, all executed on standard, unmodified smartphones,” AST said in the announcement. Importantly, representatives from the US Navy, Marine Corps, Army, US Space Command, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&E) FutureG team attended the demo. AST currently only has five satellites in orbit when it needs between 45 to 60 for global coverage. Still, the company says the demo showed how its satellites can supply connectivity to phones configured for military purposes. "This was the first in a series of planned prototype demonstrations to evaluate space-based mobile broadband for defense applications, with additional testing, including over open ocean environments, planned in the coming months," AST said. The news also shows how the company will try to compete with SpaceX’s Starlink for defense funding, in addition to serving consumers through mobile carriers. SpaceX has already received millions from various governments for providing Starlink broadband access to military forces in Ukraine. The US Navy has also adopted Starlink across its fleet and bases. In AST’s case, the company has partnered with Maryland-based Fairwinds Technologies, which specializes in bringing commercial tech to military customers. In 2023, AST reached an agreement with Fairwinds to explore marketing the satellite technology to the military market. Earlier this year, AST also received a new $43 million contract from the US Space Development Agency under the US Space Force to help advance military communications. In the consumer market, SpaceX is offering its cellular Starlink system through T-Mobile, with the official launch scheduled for July 23. Following the ongoing free beta program, the add-on satellite connectivity will cost $10 per month for most consumers. AST has been working on its rival satellite service through partners AT&T and Verizon. The company is aiming to kick off its own beta early next year as it prepares to launch dozens of large satellites into Earth’s orbit. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017. I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service. I also cover emerging online cyber threats, the rise of generative AI, the ever-changing landscape of today’s social media, and the PC graphics card market (which led me to camp out in front … PCMag is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.
