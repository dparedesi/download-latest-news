SpaceX is criticizing rival AST SpaceMobile’s plan to test a next-generation satellite, arguing that the company’s proposal is flawed and potentially threatens orbital safety. In a Thursday letter to the FCC, SpaceX urged the agency to ensure that "enormous experimental satellites" follow the rules. The FCC is weighing whether to grant an experimental license so AST SpaceMobile can test a larger, more powerful version of its BlueBird satellite. This "FM-1" satellite spans 223 square meters, making it about three times larger than AST's first-gen BlueBird satellites, five of which are currently in orbit. The FM-1 is important since AST aims to launch and operate a fleet of second-generation BlueBirds to deliver satellite connectivity for carriers, including AT&T and Verizon. AST is also facing a tight timeline since its partners want to begin offering satellite connectivity to customers as soon as next year. Although SpaceX doesn’t oppose the FM-1 satellite itself, the company has gripes with AST SpaceMobile’s proposal. In its letter to the FCC, SpaceX argues the “experimental license application for the FM-1 satellite contains worrying discrepancies in its orbital debris mitigation plan that require clarification before granting authorization to launch.” The discrepancies include how AST says the FM-1 satellite will be retired in 2.9 years by burning up in the Earth’s atmosphere once the satellite’s mission is complete. SpaceX’s analysis, using NASA software, claims the satellite will orbit the planet for 6.6 years after it completes its mission, violating the FCC’s disposal rule for low-Earth orbiting satellites. In addition, SpaceX claims “the actual collision probability of the FM-1 satellite is close to ten times higher than AST reports,” when other satellites, rocket pieces, and space debris orbit at the same altitude. “Strikingly, AST makes no effort to explain how it can mitigate the harm the ‘largest commercial phased array antenna in LEO’ will cause for optical astronomy,” the letter adds. (That said, AST has been working with the scientific community to address the potential astronomy interference.) SpaceX has become more vocal in attacking AST when both are developing cellular satellite services. In its letter, SpaceX stresses that AST’s new satellite follows the same requirements the company faced when the FCC authorized its second-generation Starlink satellites. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in October, the company accused SpaceX of using anti-competitive tactics to “intimidate and bully its competitors, regulators, and cellular operators.” In the meantime, the FCC told AST last week that its application for the FM-1 satellite was "incomplete," and sent AST 10 questions, which AST has until April 15 to address.

Title: FCC Chair Touts Starlink Rival AST SpaceMobile As a Counter to China

FCC Chair Brendan Carr has been a vocal supporter of Starlink, but on Wednesday, he touted SpaceX rival AST SpaceMobile, which is also developing satellites for cellular connectivity. On X, Carr posted pictures of his visit with GOP Senator Ted Cruz to AST SpaceMobile’s headquarters in Midland, Texas. One picture includes Carr and Cruz posing with AST SpaceMobile CEO Abel Avellan in front of the company's offices. He also published a video discussing the importance of AST, saying the company is creating manufacturing jobs in the US and helping the country counter China’s satellite ambitions. “Importantly, it’s going to help us secure our national defense, including by making sure we stay ahead of China,” Carr says. Curiously, Carr’s tweets didn’t mention AST by name. Instead, his video described the company as a “high-tech satellite production facility that’s putting up the biggest satellites we’ve ever had in the country.” AST’s CEO called out the video, posting on X: “Proud to be based in Texas, where we build and test our American satellite technology.” AST SpaceMobile still needs to secure FCC licenses to test and commercially operate its satellites. Last year, the commission only granted AST limited authority to operate its first five “BlueBird” satellites while tabling its request to launch and operate an additional 243 satellites. AST is also preparing to launch and test an even larger, more powerful BlueBird prototype satellite. But last week, the Indian Space Research Organisation postponed the satellite’s launch from Q2 to July. The FCC must also clear that prototype satellite for experimental testing, which could take months. AST faces a tight timeline since its mobile carrier partners in Europe and Japan want to start rolling out the satellite connectivity next year. The company needs between 45 to 60 satellites in orbit before it can offer continuous coverage over the US. The resulting satellite network is poised to compete against SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service, which is currently available as a beta and will officially launch in July through T-Mobile. Although Carr has supported Starlink, he’s indicated he backs next-generation satellite players in general. This includes saying the FCC must streamline regulations for Starlink and Amazon’s satellite internet rival, Project Kuiper. He’s also urged European governments to adopt Starlink over Chinese satellite services.
