SpaceX has a new complaint against competitor AST SpaceMobile, warning that the company’s "tennis-court-sized" satellites pose a collision risk that could result in dangerous space debris. On Tuesday, SpaceX sent a new letter to the Federal Communications Commission, urging the agency to closely scrutinize AST’s proposal to operate 248 satellites in Earth's orbit to power cellular connectivity for everyday smartphones. AST already has five “BlueBird” satellites in orbit, each measuring 700 square feet. However, the company has plans to launch dozens of second-generation BlueBirds that are about three times larger and offer even stronger cellular connectivity. A prototype second-gen BlueBird is slated to launch in the coming weeks, following FCC approval. But in Tuesday’s letter, SpaceX claims that AST’s plan to safely orbit the proposed BlueBird constellation contains “critical gaps and inconsistencies” that raise questions about whether the satellites can avoid collisions in space while preventing debris from falling toward Earth. “Authorizing AST to launch its proposed spacecraft without resolving these issues would be irresponsible, potentially subjecting all other operators in LEO (low-Earth orbit) to unnecessary risk,” SpaceX wrote. The critical gaps include AST allegedly “underestimating” the collision risk of the company’s BlueBird satellites once they’ve been retired and “massively undercounting the number of objects it will need to avoid in its orbits.” In addition, SpaceX says AST’s application neglects to cover whether the satellites contain any “ferromagnetic components.” That’s a potential problem because AST plans on retiring its satellites by allowing them to burn up in the atmosphere. “These components are typically among the most challenging for demisability, meaning they are the most likely to survive re-entry and cause risk to human life,” SpaceX says, later adding: “AST routinely brags about the outlandish size of its satellites. But these large satellites may dramatically increase the risk of all operations in their orbits and below.” AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but the company has previously accused Elon Musk of using "bullying” tactics to try to derail the competition. SpaceX has fired back, alleging that AST has its own anticompetitive efforts. Tuesday's letter underscores the simmering rivalry between SpaceX and AST. Both companies are working to offer satellite services to everyday smartphones while trying to lobby the FCC to rule in their favor. However, the dispute also highlights the safety measures around today's growing satellite constellations. For example, SpaceX has been retiring and de-orbiting hundreds of Starlink satellites in recent months by letting them burn up in the atmosphere. The satellites are designed to disintegrate completely, but in some rare instances, they have caused debris to fall to the planet. In February, the company released a report that estimated the chances of a V2 Mini Starlink satellite causing a human casualty due to falling debris were less than "1 in 100 million." In the meantime, SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service is preparing to officially launch tomorrow through T-Mobile. AST, on the other hand, is aiming to kick off its own beta program early next year through partners AT&T and Verizon.
