We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 9 Trending AI News Updates on Wall Street’s Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTS) stands against other trending AI news updates on Wall Street’s radar. Sarah Guo, founder of Conviction, spoke on Bloomberg Technology about the evolving AI space and the impact of open-source models. She noted that AI has developed rapidly since her firm launched, reinforcing its belief in its long-term significance. Initially, the firm invested in application companies and vertically integrated businesses, a strategy she believes remains relevant today. She pointed out that competition among foundation models has increased significantly in recent weeks. Guo also discussed Deep Seek and described it as a powerful model with multiple layers, including a base model, an instruction-tuned version, and a reasoning model. While DeepSeek’s origins in a Chinese hedge fund surprised many, she sees its open-source nature as beneficial for developers and a challenge for the U.S. to stay competitive in AI. She also emphasized that no single country holds exclusive control over AI talent, making export restrictions less effective. When the discussion shifted to investment trends, Guo explained that while AI is expanding economic opportunities across infrastructure, tooling, and model development, her firm prioritizes applications and industry-specific solutions. She noted that training large models remains costly, despite claims of lower expenses, and expects the most sustainable growth to come from application-focused companies. Guo also discussed agentic AI and how it improves customer experiences in industries such as finance and travel. She explained that AI’s ability to handle more complex tasks increases its value to businesses, making applications that automate tasks more attractive. As AI continues to advance beyond simple responses, she expects companies working on industry-specific automation to capture significant market value.

Title: Not Enough Sats? Starlink Director Throws Shade at Rival AST SpaceMobile

A director at SpaceX is questioning rival AST SpaceMobile’s plan to bring satellite connectivity to phones, casting doubt about the company’s technology and approach. In a tweet on Wednesday, Ben Longmier, senior director for satellite engineering at SpaceX, disputed how AST has said it only needs 45 to 60 company satellites to offer nationwide coverage for the US. According to Longmier, AST’s network simply won’t be large enough, resulting in spotty signal quality. “The notion that AST will cover the US with continuous data with 60 sats is incorrect. No one wants bursty data separated by tens of minutes of 0 bps,” he wrote. SpaceX is developing its own satellite-to-phone service via cellular Starlink. The company has already kicked off beta tests with T-Mobile users, delivering satellite connectivity to iPhones and Samsung devices using a growing constellation of over 400 satellites. The 400 satellites have already shown they can power SMS messages to phones based in cellular dead zones, although the signal quality can be inconsistent. SpaceX is also working (and lobbying) to bring voice calls and data downloads to the satellite network. In another tweet, Longmier added: “We want to launch a couple hundred more sats so that the whole US has a high-quality data experience. No user will tolerate long gaps in data coverage. Any LEO [low-Earth orbiting] operator needs many hundreds of sats for this type of coverage.” AST SpaceMobile didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the tweets from Longmier highlight the growing rivalry between the two companies. In October, SpaceX also accused AST of spreading misinformation to the FCC while deriding it as a “meme stock” out to derail progress on the company’s cellular Starlink technology. On the technology front, SpaceX has talked about operating thousands of cellular Starlink satellites in the coming years, similar to the home internet-focused Starlink business. In contrast, AST has talked about a smaller constellation spanning 60 larger satellites, although the company previously filed for regulatory authority to operate up to 243. So far, AST has only launched five of its “BlueBird” satellites, which recently gained FCC approval to start operational tests. However, each BlueBird is exceptionally large, with a 700-square-foot communication array capable of beaming high-speed data and powering video calls. To improve the signal quality further, the company is preparing second-generation BlueBird models that promise to be 3.4 times larger and deliver a 10 times boost in capacity. Both AT&T and Verizon have signed up to use the company’s technology, while a vocal group of stock investors has been touting AST as the future leader in mobile satellite connectivity. Hence, the public can expect more debates and regulatory spats over which company’s technology performs best, especially as T-Mobile aims to move the cellular Starlink system out of beta and to a mainstream release later this year.

I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service.
