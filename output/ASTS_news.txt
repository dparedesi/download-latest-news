SpaceX's approach to satellite cellular connectivity is facing criticism from rival AST SpaceMobile, which claims it can achieve the same results without flooding Earth’s orbit with “thousands” of satellites. Texas-based AST threw the subtle shade in a Tuesday post that touted its “commitment to responsible space operations,” which includes keeping the skies clear of satellite debris. The company didn’t name SpaceX, but it did allude to the home broadband-focused Starlink constellation, which currently spans over 8,000 satellites and could one day reach 30,000, if SpaceX receives regulatory approval. In contrast, AST says its own satellite system promises to be a leaner alternative. “This approach is remarkably efficient: with our large, powerful satellites, we can achieve global coverage with approximately 90 satellites — not thousands or even tens of thousands required by other systems,” the post said. "Beyond launching significantly fewer satellites overall, we are committed to minimizing our footprint in space through every aspect of design and operation," AST adds. SpaceX has been critical of AST’s upcoming next-generation BlueBird satellites, calling them out as "tennis-court-sized" spacecraft that threaten to upend orbital safety. The FCC is reviewing the company’s application to operate a satellite cellular service for phones in the US. If all goes well, AST will cross a crucial threshold and receive clearance to operate a constellation up to 248 satellites in size. But the same process also involves collecting public comments, including from competitors, forcing AST to answer and possibly defend its approach. That’s probably why AST’s post offers an overview of the company’s efforts to make its proposed satellite constellation safe and reliable. This includes ongoing agreements and collaborations with the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the International Astronautical Union to protect the Earth’s orbital environment and reduce the potential brightness of the satellites — something SpaceX has also been working on for Starlink. AST and SpaceX are competing to lead in the emerging market of satellite connectivity for smartphones. But SpaceX already has a significant head start. Its cellular Starlink system, which spans over 650 satellites, has already been delivering service through T-Mobile's T-Satellite add-on plan, including support for text messages and even satellite data for mobile apps. This week, Elon Musk's company also reached a $17 billion deal to acquire spectrum from Boost Mobile’s parent company, EchoStar, which promises to take the cellular Starlink service to the next level, making it comparable to a ground-based 4G service, according to SpaceX. Still, the company needs at least two years before it can begin utilizing the spectrum for commercial use since it’ll require smartphone vendors to update their products with chips capable of communicating over the additional radio bands. Meanwhile, AST is facing questions over whether it can launch enough satellites in time to begin offering the service through partners AT&T and Verizon by next year. The company currently only has five BlueBird satellites in orbit, when it needs between 45 and 60 to offer continuous service across the US. However, AST’s prototype second-generation BlueBird satellite, FM1, might not launch until December or January, when it was previously planned for August. Still, AST's CEO last month said that his company has "planned orbital launches every one to two months on average during 2025 and 2026. ... And we are on target to complete 40 satellites equivalent of microns by early 2026 to support full voice, data, and video space-based cellular broadband services.” My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years.
