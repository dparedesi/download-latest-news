T-Mobile’s (TMUS) direct-to-cell (DTC) satellite messaging service powered by Elon Musk’s Starlink is now free for anyone in the U.S., at least for a limited time, as the company looks to draw in customers. The companies have been collaborating for a few years now, promising in 2022 to deliver coverage “above and beyond anything customers have ever seen before” through a new network using Starlink’s satellites. In December, Starlink parent SpaceX finished launching the first shell of DTC satellites and won regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the service. “We’re still in the early days — I don’t want to overhype the experience during a beta test — but we’re officially putting ‘no bars’ on notice,” T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said in a statement. “Dead zones, your days are numbered at the Un-carrier.” The service is currently in its beta trial and limited to text messages, although T-Mobile hopes to have additional functionality available by the summer. Services like WhatsApp, some mapping and trail apps, and the ability to send photos could be ready when the beta testing ends in July, T-Mobile’s head of marketing told The Washington Post. After that point, T-Mobile users will have to pay $15 per month for the Starlink service, although that fee will drop to $10 per month if they participate in the beta test during February. Customers paying for the company’s pricey Go5G Next plan will get the service for free. Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T) customers will have to pay $20 per month per line. T-Mobile said on its website that it accepts users on a rolling, “first-come, first-served basis,” noting that there are limited spots available. The company says that Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 14 and later models, Google’s (GOOGL) Pixel 9, REVVL’s 7, and a slew of Samsung Galaxy phones are compatible with the service, but they need to be fully updated. Motorola’s (LNVGY) 2024 and newer models are also compatible. SpaceX has a number of partners in other nations, such as KDDI in Japan and Telstra in Australia, and worked with AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) to launch nationwide coverage in New Zealand in late December. In October, Kyivstar said it would work with Starlink to provide “uninterrupted” service in Ukraine. Verizon and AT&T are also working with AST SpaceMobile to launch rival services. On Jan. 30, AST SpaceMobile said the FCC had approved it to begin testing its service. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

T-Mobile said today that customers on its most expensive Go5G Next plan will receive access to satellite-to-phone connectivity via SpaceX's Starlink as a free perk starting in July. On all other plans, it will be $15 per month per line. The interesting part is that T-Mobile also plans on offering the Starlink connectivity to AT&T and Verizon customers, who will pay $20 per month per line. They will only need a compatible and unlocked smartphone that supports eSIMs, says Clint Patterson, T-Mobile's SVP of marketing. "They add a second SIM to the phone" to get cellular Starlink, Patterson says. The T-Mobile-Starlink eSIM can then be used to receive satellite-based SMS messaging in areas without ground-based cell coverage. T-Mobile published an online list of supported phones, which will be updated over time with more device models. "We've done a lot of work with OEMs and handset providers. So this will work on most smartphones from the last four years," Patterson says. "When you see that list, you'll see things like Galaxy S21 and later, iPhone 14 and later." T-Mobile plans to officially launch its cellular Starlink service in July, when a free test beta announced in December ends. The carrier revealed the news in a Super Bowl commercial about T-Mobile's partnership with SpaceX. The resulting “space-based network,” spanning over 400 satellites, is capable of beaming data to unmodified smartphones on the ground, giving consumers a way to receive a signal even in a cellular dead zone. Last month, the carrier invited select T-Mobile users on newer iPhones, Samsung Galaxy and Pixel devices to try out the satellite connectivity. The Super Bowl ad takes things further, with T-Mobile confirming it’ll expand the free beta program to "anyone on any wireless carrier." The offer lasts until July. For now, the satellite connectivity only supports SMS-based text messaging in dead zones. But over time, SpaceX plans on rolling out support for voice calls and data downloads, pending some regulatory lobbying. In July, business customers will also get T-Mobile Starlink at no extra cost on Go 5G Business Next, first responder agencies on T-Priority plans, and other select premium rate plans. The move to include rival carriers is sure to turn heads since AT&T and Verizon are both pursuing their own satellite ventures through AST SpaceMobile and Skylo, respectively. But in AST’s case, the company still remains months away at best from offering the satellite-to-phone service to mainstream consumers. (T-Mobile says it didn’t initially plan to open Starlink’s cellular service to users on rival carriers. But that changed after Verizon aired a big-budget commercial last week touting its own satellite-to-phone capabilities.) As for SpaceX, the company received FCC clearance in November to commercially operate the cellular Starlink service. The license permits SpaceX to use T-Mobile’s radio spectrum in the 1900MHz block to beam the satellite connectivity to certified devices. The latest phones from Apple, Samsung, and Google have received an FCC Part 25 Supplement Coverage from Space certification. Hence, T-Mobile should be able to beam the satellite data connectivity to them, even though they may be running on another carrier’s network. T-Mobile customers with iPhones and Galaxy devices have already tried out the cellular Starlink service through the beta program. It has enabled them to send SMS text messages in remote areas in the US, but the signal quality isn’t always consistent. "It does drop signal quite often. You do get a notification when you are connected, though,” one beta tester told PCMag. That said, SpaceX is preparing to launch hundreds of additional cellular Starlink satellites, which promise to boost the signal quality. In a statement, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said: “We’re still in the early days — I don’t want to overhype the experience during a beta test — but we’re officially putting ‘no bars’ on notice. Dead zones, your days are numbered at the Un-carrier.” In terms of pricing, the $15 and $20 monthly fees may be high for consumers, especially if they don’t live near any cellular dead zones. But T-Mobile is offering an early adopter discount to its own subscribers through this month that cuts the price to $10 per month per line.
