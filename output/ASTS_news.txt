BARCELONA—The satellite-to-phone broadband firm with the biggest to-do list checked off one notable item during MWC when it announced a deal with Vodafone to provide service across Europe. But another task remains: Getting 40 more satellites into low Earth orbit to inaugurate commercial service for partners that include AT&T and Verizon. In a Wednesday interview here, Scott Wisniewski, president and chief strategy officer at AST, walked through the firm's next steps to bring satellite roaming to existing phones. SatCo, the joint venture AST will create with Vodafone, will see that wireless carrier build out a set of ground stations to link AST's satellites with mobile networks across Europe. “We're more deeply integrated into their network than others who are developing add-on tech services,” Wisniewski said. He added that AST will not be making a capital contribution to Vodafone’s work on the ground and plans to split revenue 50/50 with that company. He also noted one bonus for Europeans anxious about the large role of US tech firms on the continent: “One side effect of that is the traffic goes up, the traffic goes down, but it all stays within the country.” From conversations here, those concerns have ratcheted up in just the last month, thanks to the Trump administration’s transactional approach to foreign relations and Elon Musk’s dual roles as SpaceX CEO and White House henchman. Wisniewski acknowledged those concerns but described SatCo as a key step in ensuring broader “European sovereignty.” As he put it: “Political environments come and go, but having a solution that's European is important, and that's what we're trying to create with Vodafone here.” AST is also preparing to follow up on its successful September launch of the first five BlueBird satellites. AST used a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket for that mission, but its next launch will take place in India. It will also use Blue Origin’s large New Glenn rocket to speed up its delivery. “We made contracts in a diversified way,” Wisniewski said of AST's approach to securing launch services. “We're counting on Blue Origin, and they've done a great job so far.” The massive payload fairing of New Glenn, which had a successful debut in January, is particularly appealing to AST because its BlueBird satellites are so large. “It can support up to 8 satellites each,” he said. These spacecraft—some 2,400 square feet each—are designed to support far more devices than SpaceX’s tiny Starlink satellites. AST says that will allow it to begin offering service with 45 in space and reach a first buildout with 60. Wisniewski pushed back against skepticism such as a potshot on X from Ben Longmier, senior director for satellite engineering at SpaceX, who suggested AST customers would have “tens of minutes” between working connections. Wisniewski said those first 45 satellites would allow “continuous service” in latitudes across the US, Europe, and Japan. “We've tested and demonstrated about 20Mbps,” he said of AST’s downloads. Uploads will be “about half as good as the downlink,” which in past testing has supported video calling via space. Sometime over those next 40 satellites, AST plans to cut over to including the custom ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) that it developed to maximize capacity. The simpler processor on earlier-build satellites will allow the same coverage but will leave satellites with about half the network capacity of the ASIC, which he said is “checking out as designed.” In the US, AST may be facing a much larger change to its in-space hardware as a result of a January deal to acquire satellite-specific radio spectrum from the bankrupt firm Ligado Networks. That L-band spectrum doesn’t require new regulatory authorization and could allow AST to sell service direct to customers. But unlike AST’s current offering, this spectrum requires specific hardware in phones (which is why Globalstar’s satellite messaging for iPhones, also delivered via satellite-specific spectrum, only works on recent models) and new hardware in orbit. “It’s the same satellite design, but the active payload is changed a little bit,” Wisniewski said of possible L-band satellites. But first the company has to spin up service for AT&T and Verizon and see those carriers get paying customers. Rob Pegoraro writes about interesting problems and possibilities in computers, gadgets, apps, services, telecom, and other things that beep or blink. He’s covered such developments as the evolution of the cell phone from 1G to 5G, the fall and rise of Apple, Google’s growth from obscure Yahoo rival to verb status, and the transformation of social media from CompuServe forums to Facebook’s billions of users. Pegoraro has met most of the founders of the internet and once received a single-word email reply from Steve Jobs.

SatCo aims to deliver seamless satellite-based mobile broadband services to mobile network operators (MNOs) across Europe, ensuring full geographic coverage. The new entity will exclusively distribute AST SpaceMobile's satellite capabilities through a comprehensive service offering that includes network management and operations, all managed from a European-based center leveraging Vodafone's engineering expertise. As part of its operations, SatCo will establish a network of ground stations to provide backhaul connectivity between MNOs and AST SpaceMobile's low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite network. This initiative is expected to bolster European digital sovereignty, as AST SpaceMobile's satellites function as remote radio heads while core network control remains with each respective MNO. Under Vodafone's co-ownership, SatCo will further enhance this sovereignty with its own backhaul capabilities and European-based leadership. "Vodafone's space-based mobile broadband will mean our customers can stay connected, wherever they are. Our new satellite company will be able to offer this pioneering technology to other European mobile operators through a turnkey service that combines Vodafone's leading network and engineering with AST SpaceMobile's 'antennas in the sky,'" said Margherita Della Valle, Vodafone Group CEO. Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of AST SpaceMobile, added, "Together with Vodafone, we are poised to accelerate our commercialization plans across all of Europe, making true mobile broadband from space a reality." On January 27, 2025, Vodafone successfully conducted the world's first space-based mobile video call using its newly launched BlueBird satellites, demonstrating its commitment to providing uninterrupted mobile coverage for its 340 million customers across 15 countries, as well as its network partners operating in 45 additional markets. Vodafone plans to launch commercial space-based mobile broadband services across Europe in 2025 and 2026. AST SpaceMobile's unique satellite technology will enable direct mobile broadband connectivity to standard 4G and 5G smartphones without requiring software updates or specialized devices, seamlessly integrating with Vodafone's terrestrial networks. Satellite connectivity will serve as a crucial supplement to existing mobile and fixed infrastructure, ensuring continuous coverage in remote locations such as mountainous regions and offshore areas while also enhancing network resilience across Europe. In addition, Vodafone, AST SpaceMobile, and the University of Malaga have collaborated to establish a new space and terrestrial mobile broadband research and validation hub. Supported by the Spanish Space Agency, the facility will be based at Vodafone's Innovation Centre in Malaga and is set to commence operations by summer 2025. This hub will focus on developing integrated LEO satellite and terrestrial broadband solutions. Further expanding its European footprint, AST SpaceMobile has also inaugurated a 5,600-square-meter manufacturing and office facility in Barcelona, aimed at boosting production capacity and advancing the testing of its satellite and telecom technologies.

Title: Starlink Rival AST SpaceMobile Eyes Major Expansion in Europe

Texas-based AST SpaceMobile is laying the groundwork to deliver satellite-to-phone services across Europe amid growing competition with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink system. British carrier Vodafone, a major investor in AST, is working with the company to establish a "jointly owned European satellite service business" designed to serve mobile carriers in Europe. The joint venture, dubbed SatCo, promises to supply “100% geographic coverage in every part of Europe” to both consumers and businesses through their local mobile carriers, the companies said in the announcement. They're also emphasizing that “SatCo’s solution will fully support European digital sovereignty,” giving countries control over the data that flows through AST’s emerging satellite network. AST is preparing to operate dozens of so-called “BlueBird” satellites that can act as cell towers in space. But in Europe, SatCo is going to build the ground stations and network backhaul to feed and route the data to the BlueBird satellites. “Together with Vodafone, we are poised to accelerate our commercialization plans across all of Europe, making true mobile broadband from space a reality,” says AST CEO Abel Avellan. The European Union has been trying to develop its own satellite internet systems without relying on SpaceX’s Starlink, which has also been expanding into mobile connectivity. Separately, the EU is investing $11 billion to create a satellite internet service called IRIS² to supply high-speed broadband to governments, businesses, and consumers. In contrast, the Vodafone and AST deal is focused on mobile phones, enabling European carriers to deliver a satellite service to handsets, without any hardware modifications. Last month, Vodafone demoed the technology by using the BlueBird satellites to power a video call from a remote region in Wales that lacked traditional cell coverage. AST is also partnering with AT&T and Verizon to deliver the same capabilities to users in the US, giving consumers a way to receive connectivity in cellular dead zones. The big question is when AST can commercially launch the service. The Texas-based company has only sent five BlueBird satellites into orbit when it needs at least 45 to 60 to provide continuous coverage to users on the ground. Still, Vodafone expects the satellites to deliver the space-based mobile broadband across Europe “during 2025 and 2026.” Meanwhile, SpaceX is already operating close to 500 cellular Starlink satellites in orbit, which have begun powering SMS messaging to T-Mobile phones as part of a beta program. T-Mobile plans on officially kicking off the service in July by selling access to both its own subscribers and to customers on other carriers, including AT&T and Verizon. The cellular Starlink service will also arrive for carriers in Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. But in Europe, SpaceX seems to have only reached deals with a local carrier in Ukraine and another carrier in Switzerland. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017. I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service.
