After several months of delays, AST SpaceMobile looks ready to launch its first next-gen “BlueBird” satellite before the end of the year as it competes with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink effort. In an earnings report on Monday, AST SpaceMobile said the BlueBird 6 satellite, also known as FM1, is expected to launch in the first half of December. India’s space agency, ISRO, also told local media that the satellite is scheduled to fly in the second week of December. AST first aimed to launch its first batch of next-generation BlueBird satellites in Q1 2024. But it later said it planned on only launching one next-gen BlueBird, a prototype called the FM1, in Q2, before pushing that back three times, with some concern it might not occur until January. Monday's announcement pegs the launch to early next month. The company hasn’t explained the delay. But the second-generation BlueBird satellites are about three times larger than AST’s first-gen models, and will each span at over 2,000 square feet, making them exceptionally large and heavy. In addition, the US Federal Communications Commission only granted the company an experimental license to test the FM1 back in July, following objections from rival SpaceX. Despite the delays, AST is indicating it plans on launching another second-generation BlueBird, dubbed the FM2 soon, possibly in December. “BlueBird 7 (FM2) expected to ship to Cape Canaveral in November with orbital launch anticipated shortly thereafter,” the company said in the earnings report. Ironically, SpaceX has been contracted to launch FM2 using a Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites are crucial to AST’s business of supplying satellite connectivity to everyday phones, including powering messaging and video chats in cellular dead zones. AST has entered into partnerships with AT&T and Verizon to supply the satellite service to customers sometime next year. However, AST has repeatedly said it needs between 45 to 60 satellites in orbit to offer continuous service across the US. So, launching enough satellites on time is crucial to the company’s effort to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink, which is already available through T-Mobile and soon Boost Mobile. For now, AST is saying it’s “on track for five orbital launches expected by the end of Q1 2026, with launches every one to two months on average to reach [a] goal of 45 to 60 satellites by end of 2026.” In an earnings call, the company also said it was "fully funded" for a total of 100 plus satellites to improve the constellation's coverage and capabilities globally. In the call, AST executives also mentioned that a single SpaceX Falcon 9 has the capacity to carry around three next-generation BlueBird satellites. Meanwhile, Blue Origin's more powerful New Glenn should be able to carry an estimated 8. The company also agreed with an estimate that the AST constellation can kick off beta tests in North America once it has around 25 satellites in orbit. Editor's note: This story has been corrected to say the New Glenn vehicle should be able to carry an estimated 8, not 18 BlueBird satellites. My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years.

Title: Vodafone and AST SpaceMobile Announce New EU Satellite Constellation and Select Germany for European Sovereign Satellite Operations Centre

November 07, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: Vodafone Group PLC Vodafone Group PLC London London LONDON, Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vodafone Group and AST SpaceMobile Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) have selected Germany as the location for their main Satellite Operations Centre. The centre will allocate, and map satellite connectivity used by SatCo to serve mobile network operators (MNOs) across Europe to ensure ubiquitous mobile broadband in underserved areas and support emergency services and disaster relief agencies. It will be located near either Munich or Hannover, depending on final negotiations with all relevant parties. AST SpaceMobile is building the first and only space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by everyday smartphones, designed for both commercial and government applications. SatCo aims to provide a scalable European satellite mobile broadband service for use by MNOs to benefit all European citizens, businesses and public sector organisations. MNOs in 21 European Union (EU) member states and other European countries have expressed interest in adopting the service, with commercial launch planned to commence from 2026. The planned EU constellation will include a comprehensive ‘command switch’ feature to support European oversight and security. This capability supports updating all telemetry, tracking, and control (TTC) encryption keys for both S-Band (used to connect smartphones from space) and Q/V-Band (used for links between satellites and earth stations). It also allows for the modification of service encryption keys for communications across the continent, as well as manages the activation, deactivation, and direction of satellite beams in Europe. In addition to commercial mobile broadband, the constellation will support public protection and disaster relief efforts (PPDR). It does this by providing reliable, broadband-speed connectivity from space directly to the everyday smartphones and other cellular devices of emergency responders, even in the most dangerous and challenging environments. Margherita Della Valle, CEO of Vodafone, said: “SatCo delivers a sovereign satellite solution to the whole of Europe. It will give European operators access to secure and resilient satellite communications, complementing existing terrestrial telecommunications networks. By establishing a satellite constellation in the EU and our principal command centre in Germany, we are ensuring the next frontier of communications infrastructure is firmly embedded in Europe.” “Together with Vodafone, we are accelerating the arrival of true mobile broadband from space across Europe,” said Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman and CEO of AST SpaceMobile. “Germany’s Operations Centre will be the operations hub for our BlueBird constellation in Europe, enabling us to serve millions of users. Alongside our gateways, we are building a robust, secure infrastructure that ensures Europe stays connected with seamless mobile broadband, always.” The planned satellite constellation can also contribute to the development of a pan-European mobile broadband system, enhancing the communication and coordination of emergency services during crises and disasters, in line with the EU Critical Communication System (EUCCS) vision. In particular, the satellites will support frequency bands that are suitable for PPDR radio communications, subject to national decisions and deployment choices. While many functions are automated, specialist engineers at the Operations Centre will monitor and respond to extraterrestrial events such as solar flares, as well as manage issues that arise on Earth. It will also house one of a network of SatCo ground-based gateway stations across Europe. These gateways provide secure backhaul links between the satellite constellation and terrestrial 4G/5G networks, enabling users to switch automatically between space-based and land-based coverage for uninterrupted, resilient connectivity. AST SpaceMobile has submitted through Germany the appropriate filings with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialised agency of the United Nations. This will help manage and mitigate any signal interference and ensure the smooth integration with existing mobile telecoms networks. Germany’s strategically central location provides SatCo with the ideal foundation to complement terrestrial networks, supporting the need to keep users across Europe remain securely connected anytime, anywhere. In addition to providing service to all EU MNOs using their national spectrum bands, SatCo is a candidate for access to the EU 2GHz Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) spectrum. If secured, this would enable existing MNOs to distribute a fully pan-European, sovereign, space-based broadband service directly to their customers. The aforementioned PPDR frequency bands (698–703/753–758 MHz and 733–736/788–791 MHz) would be used to support this capability.
