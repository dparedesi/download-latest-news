Title: SpaceX Slams AST SpaceMobile as a 'Meme Stock' Out to Stop Cellular Starlink

In a rarity, SpaceX is bashing a key competitor, AST SpaceMobile, for allegedly spreading misinformation aimed at stopping the launch of SpaceX's cellular Starlink system. “AST and its investors continue their scorched-Earth campaign to hamstring competing direct-to-cellular operations,” the company told the FCC on Wednesday. In a letter, SpaceX derided AST SpaceMobile as a “meme stock” driven by investors and foreign partners out to slow progress on SpaceX’s cellular Starlink technology, which is aiming to launch a beta test with T-Mobile this fall. “Apparently not content with solely harming competition in America, AST is now taking its misinformation campaign overseas by recruiting its European investors and partners to parrot its talking points and harm competition there as well,” SpaceX claims. The company sent the letter after a group of European telecommunication providers warned the FCC they’d sue for damages if the commission loosens its rule for SpaceX and allows it to operate the cellular Starlink technology beyond normal radio emission limits. The European telcos say they fear the cellular Starlink system will create radio interference with their own networks. But at least three of the European companies—Vodafone, Telefonica and Orange—are backers of AST SpaceMobile, which is also developing a cellular satellite service to beam internet data to phones. A beta test for AST SpaceMobile could kick off in December. AT&T and Verizon—two other AST backers—have also urged the FCC not to loosen its radio emission rules for the cellular Starlink technology. SpaceX is dismissing the opposition as an orchestrated lobbying campaign from AST. “The commission should not bow to AST’s investors’ and partners’ unfounded legal threats,” SpaceX said, later adding: “The commission should see through the anticompetitive advocacy of AST and its collection of investors and partners.” SpaceX is getting closer to commercially launching its cellular Starlink system, which currently spans over 200 satellites. But to reach its full potential, the company has asked the FCC for a waiver to operate the technology beyond the so-called “aggregate out-of-band emissions power flux-density limits.” Without it, SpaceX has warned the cellular Starlink system will struggle to power real-time video and voice calls, forcing the technology to settle for text-based messaging. It’s led to a growing regulatory battle over radio emission limits; it's unclear which way the FCC will rule. In the meantime, SpaceX insists its cellular Starlink technology is designed to prevent interference, citing its own technical studies. “Tellingly, just like AST investor AT&T’s specious advocacy, these AST supporters provide zero technical support for their opposition to SpaceX’s out-of-band emissions waiver,” the company tells the FCC. AST SpaceMobile—which has seen its stock value increase more than 500% over the last 12 months—didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But last month, company partner AT&T criticized SpaceX for trying to operate the cellular Starlink technology beyond the normal limits. SpaceX "just need to follow the rules like everybody else. That’s what we’re doing, and we’re not having problems with the approvals," said AT&T’s Head of Network Chris Sambar. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017. I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service.
