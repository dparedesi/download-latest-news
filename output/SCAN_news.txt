Is it time to panic for Bitcoin investors? The data currently doesn’t support that view. Bitcoin dropped 4.5% in the past 24 hours to trade at $104,343, while Ethereum crashed 8.2% to $2,552 as escalating Middle East tensions sparked a massive risk-off move across cryptocurrency markets. The selloff, which began during Asia trading hours on June 13, wiped out over $420 billion from the total crypto market cap and triggered $1.2 billion in leveraged liquidations. Following news that Israel had launched a major military operation against Iran, digital assets indeed tumbled sharply. The pre-dawn airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear and military facilities sent shockwaves through global financial markets, with cryptocurrencies bearing the brunt of the selling pressure as investors fled to traditional safe havens. The odds of such dramatic escalation seemed remote just days ago. The probability of Israel attacking Iran was trading at less than 20% throughout the week on the prediction market Polymarket, dipping as low as 11% at various points. And this is something markets don’t like—not war, but uncertainty. Currently, on Myriad Markets—a prediction market developed by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan—the odds of a US-Iran nuclear deal before the end of the week has dropped to just 4.7%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped 0.66% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.17% as investors fled to traditional safe havens. Gold surged 1.8% to $3,445 per ounce, approaching its record high of $3,500.05, while Brent crude oil prices jumped as much as 9.21% during Asia hours before settling around 7% higher at $72.6 per barrel. The sharp moves in commodities reflected genuine supply concerns. Iran, as OPEC's third-largest producer, controls critical oil infrastructure, and any prolonged conflict could severely disrupt global energy markets. Defense stocks predictably surged. Just for context, Lockheed Martin and Palantir jumped about 3% as investors positioned for potential military escalation The crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures investors’ appetite for these risk assets, retreated from 65 to 54, moving from "greed" to "neutral"—an arguably healthy reset rather than the extreme fear readings typically associated with major market bottoms. This measured shift in sentiment, combined with continued ETF inflows of $86.31 million into Bitcoin despite the price decline, suggests institutional conviction remains intact. Against this backdrop of panic in traditional markets, Bitcoin's 2.4% decline to $104,343 appears remarkably contained. Yes, the leading cryptocurrency triggered $1.2 billion in leveraged liquidations as it broke below the psychologically important $106,000 level. But considering the magnitude of the geopolitical shock, the selloff lacks the hallmarks of genuine panic. The technical picture supports this thesis. Bitcoin's Relative Strength Index, or RSI, on the daily chart sits at 47—down from overbought levels near 80 last week but still firmly in neutral territory. This suggests profit-taking rather than capitulation. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures the strength of a trend regardless of direction, is now at 17, which indicates weak directional momentum. That means the current move lacks the conviction typically seen during crisis-driven crashes, which tracks with the coin’s recent lateralization. Bitcoin’s Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, is even more telling. EMA measures the average price of an asset, in this case Bitcoin, over a given period of time. Bitcoin’s 50-day EMA at $102,513 provided initial resistance on the bounce attempt, suggesting technical levels still matter—a sign that algorithmic trading rather than emotional panic is driving price action. The 200-day EMA sits much lower at $92,687, showing the longer-term uptrend remains intact. For Bitcoin, the immediate test lies at reclaiming the $105,757 level (50/200-day EMA confluence). Failure to break back above this level would target: $100,000 as psychological support, and $95,000 as visible support, based on the charts. Upside resistance stands at $110,000, with the recent all-time high near $111,891 remaining the key level for bulls to reconquer. Ethereum's steeper 7% drop to a daily low of $2,439 before bouncing to its current $2,552.30 reflects the typical risk-off rotation from altcoins to Bitcoin during market stress. Despite recording 19 consecutive days of ETF inflows, ETH couldn't maintain support above $2,700 as traders de-risked portfolios. The second-largest cryptocurrency's technical indicators paint a more bearish picture than Bitcoin's. With RSI at 50.6 and the ADX at 22 showing that the bullish bounce is now very, very weak, and the longer bearish trend is still in play, Ethereum shows stronger directional movement to the downside. The price is currently hovering near the 200-day EMA ($2,473), having broken below it during the selloff. The 50-day EMA sits at $2,417, and a break below would signal a more significant trend change. Ethereum bulls, then, must defend the current $2,552 level to avoid a deeper correction. The key levels to watch are the resistances at $2,738 and an immediate support hear the psychological levels of $2,417. Meme coins suffered disproportionate losses, with Fartcoin—this week’s epitome of meme coin bullishness for absolutely no meaningful reason—plummeting 12% to $1.1968. The token's breakdown from its ascending wedge pattern, combined with strong selling pressure, exemplifies how speculative positions unwind rapidly during times of uncertainty. The RSI at 50 shows neutral momentum after falling from overbought conditions, while the ADX at 22 confirms the switch from bullish to neutral move. And even with all that said, the chart still paints an overall bullish picture for Fartcoin, and meme coins tend to do weird things. As a general rule, though, you can expect meme coins and other altcoins to mirror Bitcoin’s moves, but with a lot more volatility.

Title: Smart Speculation vs. Gambling

By Adam Sharp PostedJune 12, 2025 Watching sports these days feels completely different than it did a decade ago. These days, half the ads are about gambling. During pre-game shows, analysts seem to spend more time on betting strategies than actual analysis. Major sports leagues like the NFL now openly partner with sports books and gambling platforms. That was once a red line which respectable leagues wouldn’t cross. Influencers promote “parlay” strategies which involve 5-10 legs and offer the chance to earn 50x. But in truth, parlays are where the sports books make the most money. Another hard truth is that only about 5% of sports bettors withdraw more than they put in. It’s very difficult to overcome the house’s edge. The average sports bet has a commission rate of around 9%, which only a very lucky minority can overcome. Lower income households are disproportionately affected by sports gambling. This group spends a much larger percentage of income on sports betting, as shown in the chart below. Source: Gambling Away Stability: Sports Betting’s Impact on Vulnerable Households As you can see from the chart, this problem is only getting worse. In 2024 Americans legally wagered around $148 billion on sports, up a massive 23% from 2023. Look, it’s a free country and some people are capable of gambling responsibly. I myself play in a few fantasy football leagues with friends and co-workers, and it’s great fun. But I won’t allow myself to download a sports book app. It’d be too tempting to gamble on 8-leg parlays in the hopes of hitting a 50x. Much better to stick to what I know: contrarian and long-term investing. The fact that Americans increasingly see sports gambling as a path to riches is downright scary… Our nation’s obsession with gambling extends beyond sports. We see it in crypto markets, margin trading, meme stocks, options mania, and crazy stock valuations. America is in the midst of a decade-long speculation bender. This trend is being driven by fundamental factors which cannot be ignored. The core problem is that the cost of living is rising far faster than wages. Younger generations face completely unaffordable home prices, expensive stocks, a brutal job market, and stagnant pay. Many see speculation and gambling as the only way out. The average person knows little about the stock market, but they do know something about sports. So the sports gambling path seems to offer an exit from the rat race. But it’s the worst possible route to riches. Overcoming the house advantage may as well be impossible. If you find yourself in a situation where you “need” to speculate, do it smartly. Don’t bet on 9-leg sports parlays which are never going to hit. For people with limited savings, speculation shouldn’t even be on the menu. It’s much better to invest in yourself. Try building a business on the side. This is how the vast majority of self-made individuals become wealthy. In contrast, the number of people who got rich through pure speculation is miniscule. Especially from a low starting point. If you have $500 to invest, it’s much better to buy a pressure washer and hit the streets rather than speculate on dubious investments. The pressure washer has a high probability of paying for itself many times over, assuming the owner is willing to apply the necessary elbow grease. Meanwhile, $500 on sports parlays may as well be flushed down the toilet. Building a business today is more accessible than ever. A motivated and curious person can use cheap AI tools to build a website, write a business plan, get legal advice, and brainstorm marketing ideas. Just a few years ago these setup costs could have easily totaled $10,000+. If you’re unemployed or struggling, one of the best investments you can make is in your own AI skills. Just go to ChatGPT.com and start experimenting. You can do a lot even with a free account. A premium subscription costs $20 per month and used correctly can provide an incredible ROI. One could argue that a $20/month ChatGPT membership is far more valuable than a $150k MBA in today’s world. The future belongs to entrepreneurs and those who learn to harness AI to its full potential. For those who do have funds to invest, only a portion should be used for high-risk bets. The majority should be put into tax-protected retirement accounts like a 401k or IRA, and invested in index or target-date retirement funds. Of course, a portion of your portfolio can be invested in speculative assets. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with smart and disciplined speculation. For example, well-researched and executed options bets can improve long-term returns. But we need to recognize the increased risk in this area, and treat it with respect. Keep options betting to a small portion (5% or less) of your overall portfolio. And no, that doesn’t mean invest 5% on a single options trade. It means that only 5% of your total portfolio should be dedicated to options, and that’s it. If you lose that 5%, don’t dip into the core. Personally, I feel safe putting a larger percentage of my assets in long-term contrarian investments. For me, that often means buying out of favor assets like emerging markets (Brazil is a personal favorite currently – see more here). Silver miners are another of my favorite speculative investments today. They are a classic asymmetric trade, meaning they have far more upside potential than downside. Read more about the silver miner thesis in Something to Behold. These examples are speculative, but in a smart way. They couldn’t be more different from sports gambling. This method takes patience, but it has an infinitely higher chance of producing wealth than gambling and other dubious methods. Look for more contrarian investment ideas in the near future.

Title: Here’s Why You Should Be Wary Of 401(k) Crypto Options

ByChris Carosa ByChris Carosa, Senior Contributor. It seems you can’t avoid crypto. It’s everywhere. In ads. On X posts. And, maybe soon, in your 401(k). But is that a good thing? If you’re thinking of dipping your toe into this undeniable buzz, it’s crucial you conduct a little due diligence. Professional fiduciaries have been pondering the enigma wrapped in a mystery that calls itself cryptocurrency. What are their feelings about this highly volatile and complex digital asset? Why have so many been so reticent about adding this asset class to portfolios? How might their thoughts inform you? Like any other hot investment, you only see the headlines trumpeting the good news. After all, no one ever goes to a cocktail party and enthusiastically brags, “You won’t believe how much money I lost on this stock!” The truth is, what goes up often goes down. And what goes up dramatically can just as quickly go down dramatically. It’s this downside that most alarms (or should alarm) retirement savers. For this reason, the Department of Labor issued a release in 2022 that told 401(k) plan sponsors to proceed carefully before offering investment options based on digital currencies. “The DOL’s Compliance Assistance Release No. 2022-01 cautioned plan fiduciaries to use extreme care when deciding whether to offer 401(k) plan participants cryptocurrency investment options,” says Michelle Capezza, of counsel at Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. in New York City. “EBSA raised many concerns, including the possibility of fraud, the speculative and volatile nature of these investments, valuation, custodial and recordkeeping challenges, and difficulty for participants to make informed decisions. EBSA also warned about conducting investigations of plans that offered such investment options and questioned plan fiduciaries on their decisions to offer them in the plan. So, even though financial institutions brought products to market to facilitate these investments, including through digital asset accounts designed to address custody and cybersecurity issues, and through brokerage window models, the DOL guidance had a chilling effect on many plan fiduciaries and raised questions concerning whether they were subject to a new, heightened standard of extreme care review for cryptocurrency investments.” Set aside the idea that this is about digital assets. Think instead about highly volatile stocks. As you approach retirement, you’re more appreciative of certainty. The last thing you want is for your retirement savings to take a sudden drop just when you need to start withdrawing funds. That’s the way fiduciaries think. They look out for what’s best for you. It’s what being prudent is all about. Now, there are those who feel it’s one thing for a professional you willingly hire to take that demeanor. On the other hand, having the government tell you what to do? That just rankles some the wrong way. In effect, the DOL’s 2022 advice merely reiterated what every fiduciary should always do. When the DOL recently rescinded that ruling, it did not remove that duty. The hurdles for adding cryptocurrency to 401(k) investment menus remain today as they always have. “DOL has now issued Compliance Assistance Release 2025-01, formally rescinding the prior release and, importantly, reaffirming for fiduciaries the legal framework governing the evaluation of what particular investments should be included within a 401(k) plan,” says Max Fuller, senior director of government solutions, TaxBit in Denver, Colorado. “While the rescission is great, I am not sure it will result in the floodgates being opened for direct crypto investment within 401(k) plans just yet.” It is this “extreme care” requirement that has fiduciaries walking on eggshells. “The new guidance opens up a Pandora’s box of questions,” says Lyle Himebaugh, managing partner at GGA Retirement in Stamford, Connecticut. “The first question is liability. I would imagine that most 3(38) investment fiduciaries are not equipped to do due diligence and therefore would not take on the liability.” If fiduciaries continue to shy away from crypto, does that raise a red flag for you? Sure, they might be more concerned about potential liabilities than you might be. But that’s precisely where the red flag pops up. Why? The purpose of 401(k) plans is to provide long-term growth and, eventually, stability. This clashes with the inherent volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. The crypto risk magnifies as you approach retirement. But you can realize it at any age. “Given turnover rates and the volatility of closing prices, there is considerable risk that participants would realize a loss when assets are distributed at separation,” says J. M. “Jack” Towarnicky, of counsel at Koehler Fitzgerald, LLC in Powell, Ohio. This is the big challenge with cryptocurrencies. They’re on 24/7. If you invest in them, you’ll have to be on your toes, ever watchful of what’s happening in their markets. With digital assets like these, there are no “closing bells.” Their prices can move at any time, day or night. Still, the positive shift in the regulatory tone means crypto fans may advocate for these investments to be included in their 401(k) plans. While plan sponsors may bow to these demands, their service providers are likely to remain skeptical. “I am sure some investment fiduciaries will put them in the plan,” says Himebaugh, “but there are so many unforeseen and incalculable risks that it will have a mild impact.” Because of these issues, don’t be surprised if digital assets fail to become a mainstream 401(k) option as quickly as some hope. For one thing, it’s not just a decision of whether to include them, it’s how to include them. “The challenges will the same as any asset class consideration,” says Jason Grantz, CEO of Integrated Pension Group in Highland Park, New Jersey. “They’ll have to prudently decide that having crypto available in plans is in the best interest of the participants, without conflict and not solely to appease a small handful of employees who might be clamoring for it. If the asset class does get added, the second hurdle will be even more daunting, which is to decide on which crypt or to simply offer a crypto fund, and that will need to pass Investment Policy criteria like other fund offerings.” There’s clearly retail interest in digital assets. It would not be a surprise if that interest spills over into the 401(k) realm. The rescission of the DOL’s 2022 advice makes it harder for plan sponsors and their advisers to quickly rule out including cryptocurrency products on the plan’s investment menu. The new DOL guidance, however, doesn’t remove the best interest standards when evaluating the appropriateness of adding such investments to retirement plans. “Fiduciaries now face the usual significant challenges in evaluating cryptocurrencies for 401(k) plans,” says Jonathan Rose, CEO of BlockTrust IRA in Beverly Hills, California. “Issues like volatility, valuation uncertainty, custody risks, and changing regulatory oversight will be the focus, although each of these respective topics are making massive strides. The primary challenge fiduciaries will now face is a lack of experience in the cryptocurrency market itself, as demand from their clients increases. Many retail investors, 401(k) investors in particular, are looking for a solution that offers the unmatched upside of the crypto market with a minimized risk profile.” Are professional fiduciaries the only ones wary of 401(k) crypto? Like annuities, the actual interest in these investments may be smaller than headlines would suggest. “Prior to the 2022 guidance,” says Towarnicky, “according to a GAO report, no surveyed 401(k) plan had added crypto as a core option, or a window to a crypto asset trading program, and less than 6 in 10,000 401(k) plans (about 300 total) offered crypto via self-directed brokerage windows.” The regulatory bias against 401(k) crypto may be lifting, but that doesn’t mean the fog has dissipated. The underlying risks remain significant. While the DOL has removed its heavy hand, it has not eliminated the fiduciary duty that goes with ERISA plans. Cryptocurrencies expose investors to extreme volatility and difficult pricing mechanisms. The potential for losses at distribution is very real. Does that mean you shouldn’t invest a portion of your retirement assets in them? As with all investments, the decision depends on your individual circumstances. Making prudent decisions is the key, as the elements surrounding both your personal conditions and the cryptocurrency market are ever-changing.
