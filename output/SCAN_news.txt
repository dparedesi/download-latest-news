ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Military Mission at twilight Let’s talk about oil and gold dividends. Whether or not the new peace in the Middle East holds, there are some high-quality dividends worth owning anytime. These generous payers (up to 8%) provide peace of mind just in case the geopolitical Jenga set gets knocked loose again. We’ll start with crude, which had rallied to one-year highs. I was originally going to advise not chasing the Strait of Hormuz oil rally. Futures indicated (and still do) that lower prices are likely ahead. January 2026 still trades cheaper—suggesting temporary disruption at worst. Back at home, you’ve probably heard (not least from me, often) that President Donald Trump wants a lower fed funds rate To achieve this, he and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are targeting lower oil (“drill baby, drill”) so that inflation continues to cool and the Fed can ease. Given policymakers’ penchant for deregulation and drilling, it’s best to sidestep the producers here. We have done well owning Exxon Mobil (XOM) in the past but the time to buy the stock is when oil prices are likely to rise. Exxon has grinded sideways since we sold it from our Contrarian Income Report portfolio. Let’s consider Kinder Morgan (KMI) and its 4.2% yield instead. Kinder funds its dividend by “collecting tolls” on its 79,000 miles of pipelines. Crude oil and most notably natural gas flow through Kinder’s North America pipelines. As long as energy moves, the cash flows. A huge 40% of U.S. natural gas flows through Kinder’s systems to 139 company-owned terminals storing petroleum products, chemicals and renewables. With market share like this, Kinder can raise its pricing regularly and therefore boost dividends often too. When the company was founded back in 1997 (or “back in the 1900s” as my kids say) by Richard Kinder and William Morgan, they structured it as a master limited partnership. MLPs issue K-1 forms at tax time, which can be a bit of a headache. Instead of forcing shareholders into a lifetime of tax-time headaches, Kinder converted into a simpler corporation in 2014. Corporations issue a traditional 1099, which is easier for accountants and users of tax software. This move made Kinder more popular and awarded it a perennially higher valuation. For those of us who prefer lower valuations (and higher yields), Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) is an elite 8% dividend play. Alerian buys MLPs and packages them into one fund, consolidating messy K-1s into a neat 1099 at tax time—a “cheat code” for easy 8% energy dividends. These are salad days for Alerian, too. The fund has raised its dividend for three straight quarters! AMLP Dividend Let’s move on to gold, the “barbarous relic” that investors buy when they feel nervous. We contrarians are bullish because: Creditors will be paid back, because the U.S. owns the global printing press. But they will ultimately receive depreciated dollars due to some “monetization” of this massive debt load. The U.S. dollar is already eroding, falling 28% versus gold year-to-date — 28%! A shiny sign of capital flowing into assets immune to central bank printing. VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) is a one-click way to play higher gold and lower oil prices. Energy is the main cost input for gold miners. Profit margins will expand from here if gold stays high and oil slumps. A high-quality discounted alternative is GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust (GGN), a closed-end fund trading at a 2% discount to its net asset value. About half of the fund’s portfolio sits in mining stocks—both gold and non-gold plays like iron miner Rio Tinto (RIO). Thanks to the deal we can snag these stocks for 98 cents on the dollar. GGN pays a steady 3-cent monthly dividend (8% annualized), giving investors income stability with upside potential. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Nvidia Rises to Record as AI Spending Momentum Stays Strong

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares rose to an all-time high on Wednesday, with the leader in artificial intelligence chips extending an advance that has cemented its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock rose 3.8% to $153.46, taking out an all-time intraday high that has stood since January. The record is only the latest milestone for the company, which has risen 63% off an April low, a rally that has added more than $1.4 trillion to its market capitalization. Recent earnings results from Nvidia were the latest catalyst for bulls, as the report showed robust growth and pointed to more strength ahead despite the impact of restrictions on the sales of advanced semiconductors in China. Prints from Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. — which together make up more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue, per supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg — further underlined how the company’s biggest customers continue to spend aggressively building out their AI infrastructure. “My confidence in Nvidia’s growth is higher than it was a couple months ago, and it seems the AI arms race will continue through 2025 and probably 2026,” said Michael Smith, co-portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “The momentum has clearly been re-established, and Nvidia’s moat has only widened and deepened, meaning its position has only strengthened.” At Nvidia’s shareholder meeting Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang reassured investors that demand remains strong. He reiterated his view that the computer industry is only at the beginning of a massive AI infrastructure upgrade. Little known just a few years ago, Nvidia has emerged as a household name and perhaps the most important stock on Wall Street by becoming the poster child for all things AI. The shares’ gain of more than 14% this year follow a rally of more than 170% in 2024, which itself came in the wake of 2023’s surge of nearly 240%. Even with this strength, it continues to screen as attractive next to its history by some valuation metrics. Nvidia trades at 31 times expected 12-month earnings, below its 10-year average and not far from the Nasdaq 100 Index’s multiple of 27 — despite Wall Street estimates calling for faster growth at Nvidia than the broader tech market. The stock’s PEG ratio — a measure of valuation relative to growth — is at about 0.9, by far the lowest among the Magnificent Seven. The combination of high growth and a reasonable multiple is a key reason why Wall Street remains optimistic about its prospects. Nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while it trades 13% below the average analyst price target, suggesting many expect the momentum to continue. Despite all that, Nvidia remains under-owned by market professionals relative to other Big Tech peers, an additional sign there is potential for more buying in the weeks to come. Nvidia is owned by 74% of long-only funds, according to data from Bank of America. This puts it behind Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, which is the most owned at 91%. “I’m bullish on this year and next, but like everyone else we don’t know what will happen after that,” said Smith. “The stock doesn’t look expensive, but there can be a limit to how much upside there is in one of the biggest companies in the world. Ultimately the duration of Nvidia’s growth will depend on how long its customers increase their investments in AI. If they slow their spending, it won’t take much to see a big shift in volatility.” (Updates with shareholder meeting in fifth paragraph.)

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - APRIL 26: In this photo illustration, the logo of Amazon.com, Inc. is displayed ... More on a smartphone screen, with the company's iconic smile branding visible in the background, on April 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Amazon’s stock has already delivered impressive gains, rising over 150% from $85 levels in early 2023 to around $210 now. But what could propel the stock to double from current levels over the next few years? The answer lies in AWS and AI – the primary growth engine for Amazon. AWS remains Amazon’s most lucrative segment and the key catalyst for future stock appreciation. AWS revenue growth of 19% year-over-year in 2024 and 17% in Q1’25 was strong, and it is expected to remain in high teens in the near term. The artificial intelligence boom is driving accelerated demand for cloud computing services, with enterprises turning to AWS to leverage AI capabilities quickly. Separately, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Also, see – Should You Buy RKLB Stock At $33? Amazon is making a significant investment in its AI infrastructure. In 2024, the company spent approximately $75 billion on capital expenditures, and CEO Andy Jassy expects this to exceed $100 billion in 2025. This substantial investment is largely driven by the increasing demands of generative AI. Recently, Amazon further underscored its commitment by announcing plans to invest $54 billion in the UK over the next three years. This investment aims to expand both its warehouse network and artificial intelligence infrastructure, bolstering its e-commerce and cloud operations. AWS revenue reached $108 billion in 2024, representing 17% of Amazon’s total revenues. However, the segment’s high margins establish it as Amazon’s primary profit driver. Continued double-digit growth in AWS could significantly increase the company’s overall valuation. For perspective, AWS alone accounted for an estimated 40% of Amazon’s total EBITDA in 2024. Wondering about Amazon’s profitability, check out – Amazon Operating Income Comparison and Amazon Operating Cash Flow Comparison Amazon’s AI investments create a multiplier effect across all business segments. In e-commerce, AI will help enhance recommendation engines, optimize logistics networks, and improve inventory management, driving higher conversion rates and operational efficiency. For advertising, AI will likely enable more precise targeting and dynamic pricing, increasing ad effectiveness and commanding premium rates. These cross-segment AI benefits compound revenue growth while reducing operational costs, creating a virtuous cycle of scaling revenues and expanding margins. Amazon's advertising business has become a significant revenue generator, hitting $56.2 billion in 2024, marking its first time exceeding $50 billion annually. This was a 20% increase year-over-year. The strong momentum continued into Q1 2025, with advertising revenue reaching $13.9 billion, a 19% increase compared to the previous year. Amazon's unique position as both a marketplace and a media platform gives its advertising business a significant advantage. The recent introduction of ads on Prime Video has expanded ad inventory, while the company's extensive e-commerce data offers powerful targeting capabilities for advertisers. While attention often focuses on AWS and advertising, Amazon's foundational e-commerce business remains a substantial revenue source. Last year, the online stores segment brought in $247 billion in annual revenue, accounting for 39% of Amazon's total business. This strong base provides consistent cash flow, enabling Amazon to fund growth investments in its higher-margin segments like AWS and advertising. For Amazon's stock to double, the company needs to show consistent growth across its key businesses. This growth will likely be fueled by AWS's AI-driven expansion, the rapid increase in advertising revenue, and the stability of its e-commerce operations. Key factors that could drive stock appreciation include AWS consistently growing above 20%, advertising revenue reaching $80-90 billion annually (expected within 2-3 years), and improved operating margins as AI investments start paying off. Amazon's substantial AI infrastructure investments strategically position it to capture a significant share of the emerging AI market. Looking at the numbers, we project Amazon’s revenues to exceed $900 billion in the next three years, with earnings nearly doubling from 2024 to over $10 per share. Currently, with AMZN stock trading around $210, it’s valued at approximately 39 times trailing earnings. If it maintains a similar valuation, the stock could surpass $400 within the next three years. Should investors assign an even higher multiple, it would imply more than a two-fold growth. Also see – Amazon’s Valuation Ratios Comparison Amazon’s diverse revenue streams and leadership in cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising offer multiple avenues for sustained growth. This revaluation, coupled with fundamental business growth, provides the basis for the stock to double, reflecting sustained revenue increases and a reassessment of Amazon's long-term earnings potential in the AI economy. Amazon's diversified revenue streams and leadership in cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising provide multiple pathways for sustained growth. If these segments continue their current trajectories, the stock could potentially double from here, driven by both revenue growth and margin expansion as AI investments mature. The convergence of scaling revenues across all segments and improving profitability from AI-driven efficiencies could fuel significant investor optimism. As Amazon demonstrates its ability to monetize massive AI investments while maintaining market leadership, investors may assign premium valuation multiples typically reserved for high-growth technology companies. This multiple expansion, combined with fundamental business growth, provides the mathematical foundation for the stock to double—requiring both sustained revenue increases and a revaluation of Amazon's long-term earnings potential in the AI economy. While Amazon’s pathway looks promising, several factors could hinder the stock from doubling. Intensifying competition in cloud computing from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, for example, could put pressure on AWS's margins and growth rates. Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny over Amazon’s market dominance, especially in e-commerce and advertising, might lead to antitrust actions. These could limit expansion or even force business restructuring. Google and Meta are already facing the heat. The company's massive AI capital expenditures also carry execution risk; if these investments don't deliver expected returns or take too long to materialize, investor sentiment could turn negative. Additionally, economic downturns could reduce enterprise cloud spending and consumer e-commerce activity. Elevated interest rates could also make high-growth stocks like Amazon less appealing compared to fixed-income alternatives. Overall, investors willing to bet on Amazon should take into account these risks as well. Now, we apply risk assessment framework while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: High tariffs give Trump less room for error in Iran | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The US economy needs the fragile ceasefire President Donald Trump brokered in the Middle East to hold. If the pause in fighting between Israel and Iran fails and major hostilities resume, oil prices would likely spike again. And surging gasoline prices are the last thing the US economy needs right now. Inflation is already expected to heat up this summer because of Trump’s massive tariffs on imports. An oil shock would make matters worse — perhaps much worse. “It would be a bit of a double-whammy. First there’s the stagflationary shock from tariffs. And then a potential oil shock,” Alan Blinder, economics professor at Princeton University and a former top Federal Reserve official, told CNN in a phone interview. In many ways, Trump’s trade war gives him less margin for error in the Middle East. He can’t afford another world event that causes inflation to rear its ugly head again and further delays rate cuts from the Fed. “The economy is vulnerable to anything that could go wrong, and this certainly qualifies,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. That’s why investors are breathing a huge sigh of relief in recent days. Stocks have popped and oil prices have plunged in one of the biggest sell-offs in years. Iran’s response to US strikes on nuclear sites was far more limited, and symbolic, than feared. Not only that, but the ceasefire between Israel and Iran eases fears that vital energy infrastructure in the region will get caught in the crossfire. The nightmare scenario had been that Iran would try to close the Strait of Hormuz, the most critical oil chokepoint on the planet. Analysts have warned that if this waterway shut down, oil prices could easily spike beyond $100 or $120 a barrel, causing a return of $4 to $4.50 gas in the US. As of Sunday, the odds of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz spiked to about 60% on prediction platform Polymarket. But by Tuesday, the odds plunged to just 17% as investors bet the worst in the Israel-Iran crisis may be over. Observers have noted that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be counterproductive for Iran, which relies on the waterway to get its own oil to customers, mostly in China. “They would be shooting themselves in the foot,” Blinder said, “but countries have been known to do that.” Critics of Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs warn that they will backfire, too. However, inflation has cooled in recent months even as Trump has lobbed tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum and imports from most countries. Yet many economists say this is the calm before the storm, with tariff-fueled price hikes on the way. Some items exposed to tariffs like appliances, toys and electronics have already become more expensive. “In many ways, the past few months may be transitory low inflation before the price effect of tariffs hit,” Bob Elliott, CEO of alternative investment firm Unlimited, told CNN in a phone interview. “No serious economist would look at inflationary trends and forecast they will exist into the future.” Unless tariffs get dramatically scaled back, Elliott said inflation is likely to heat up by 1% to 1.5% from current levels. “That’s not going to be acceptable for the Fed,” said Elliott. In testimony before Congress Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank’s wait-and-see stance, telling lawmakers: “I wouldn’t want to point to a particular meeting. I don’t think we need to be in any rush because the economy is still strong.” If the situation in the Middle East does turn south again, it would create a potential boost to energy prices. “It would be a tricky combination,” said Elliott, a former executive at hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates. Oil shocks can be very inflationary because energy prices feed in to many parts of the US economy. Not only that, but there can be a psychological effect given how closely Americans follow gas prices. And it’s only been three years since gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon for the first time ever after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Inflation skyrocketed to four-decade highs and the Fed was forced to put the fire out by dramatically lifting borrowing costs. “People look at prices at the pump as a litmus test for inflation broadly,” said Zandi, the Moody’s economist. For now, gas prices appear to have stabilized. The national average price of regular gas was flat at $3.22 a gallon on Tuesday, according to AAA. That’s up from $3.13 a gallon when Israel attacked Iran earlier this month. However, it’s still lower than $3.45 a gallon a year ago. In a speech on Tuesday, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack noted oil prices “bear watching” given the recent price swings from geopolitical events. “The pain of large increases in energy prices still weighs on consumer spending,” Hammack said, while noting that the US is less exposed to oil shocks than in the past. “Recent increases in oil prices pose an upside risk to the stability of inflation expectations.” The scars of $5 gasoline in 2022 loom large. For now, investors are hoping the ceasefire in the Middle East means there won’t be a repeat today. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Higher Market Volatility Shines a Light on Buffer ETFs

Advisor usage of the products had been on the rise even before the recent tumult, and the new wave of uncertainty has only fueled that growth. June 24, 2025 Markets are facing a fresh round of uncertainty with the United States striking Iranian targets over the weekend and Iran retaliating by firing missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar. Questions loom about the potential for spiking oil prices as observers wait to see if tensions escalate or simmer down. It’s just the latest shock to markets this year. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs and subsequent announcements have sent stocks and bonds whipsawing amid on-again, off-again developments. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) currently sits at about 20 and at one point in April reached 50—the highest level since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Easily and efficiently maximizing returns while mitigating risk is the promise driving one of the biggest recent success stories in exchange-traded funds: Defined outcome ETFs. By buying and selling options on the underlying portfolio, like a structured product, these ETFs promise to let investors realize market gains while still getting protection when they fall. The tradeoff: Sacrificing some portion of those gains should the market climb higher than the pre-determined limit. The funds have grown from $5 billion in assets at the end of 2020 to $50 billion by 2025, according to Morningstar. In a recent report, BlackRock projected the space will reach $650 billion by 2030. Even institutional investors are buffing up their portfolios. In December, Bloomberg reported that the University of Connecticut’s endowment sold almost all of its hedge fund exposure in favor of the funds. Related:$6.5B RFG Advisory Launches Suite of Active ETFs “What’s really resonating is the certainty in the downside protection,” said Graham Day, executive vice president and CIO, with Innovator, the firm that launched the first buffer ETF in 2018. “The ability of bonds to protect is now a huge question mark. And so that’s starting to stir the pot more in terms of what advisors are using to manage risk.” Overall, more than 300 buffer ETFs are on the market. Two managers—Innovator and First Trust—still dominate the space, though others are competing by launching variations on the theme (i.e., Calamos has debuted Buffer crypto ETFs) or with lower fees (BlackRock’s funds cost slightly less than the average). Other managers jumping on the buffer ETF train include Goldman Sachs Asset Management, PGIM, Alliance Bernstein and Allianz. “For something that started as a niche product, now the largest asset managers are hopping into the game, which we would expect to drive down costs,” said Patrick Nerney, vice president, investments, with St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Dynasty Financial Partners. “But at the end of day, this is a complex product that requires a nuanced understanding.” Related:Retail Investors Power US ETF Flows Past $500B in 2025 Despite Macro Risks Providers offer a range of buffers, so advisors can choose what percentage of losses they are willing to tolerate and how much upside they are willing to forego. Downside protection can be as low as single-digit percentages or go all the way to 100%. The upside caps vary accordingly. More downside protection, less upside gains and vice versa. As ETFs, they easily fit into most advisor trading platforms and performance reporting tools. They require more handholding than plain-vanilla ETFs. They have fixed time spans—typically a year. Buffer ETFs tied to major stock indices tend to come in monthly flavors, while some newer ETFs offering protection on Bitcoin and other assets are issued quarterly. Investors can roll over into a new version at the end of the defined outcome period. Some try their hand at tactical plays—trading in or out may reduce the protections or, conversely, lock in early gains, but only if timed correctly. In addition, some providers now offer laddered products with blended exposures to provide time-based diversification and automatically roll over into new issuances annually. Related:Seven Must Reads for This Week (June 24, 2025) “The beauty of those is that you can hold them for the long term,” said Rob Kane, director of alternative investments with $285 billion AUM Commonwealth Financial Network. “We continue to see the evolution of trying to make these more of a strategic allocation in a portfolio … something that will be in a portfolio for the next 20 years.” More adventurous advisors use the funds as tactical investments, opportunistically moving in and out of the funds regardless of the time frame in the prospectus. For example, if an investor buys a defined outcome ETF with a 15% upside cap in one month for $100 and the market goes up 5%, they can opt to sell, enter a new buffer ETF, lock in their gains and reset their protection levels. “We do see tactical use where an investor sells if the cap is running out or they want to reset the protection level,” said Lan Anh Tran, a manager research analyst for Morningstar who tracks the sector. “There are people buying in after the buffer periods have started. So, there is some opportunistic investment. But the more common use case is to use these as a hedge. And they make more sense as laddered products.” Because of the options strategies, investors in these ETFs do not receive dividends. “The conversation we often have is, ‘Are you willing to forego dividends and returns in excess of a certain percentage in exchange for downside protection?’” said Curtis Congdon, president of XML Financial Group in Bethesda, Md. “And for many clients who are approaching retirement or wanting to be more conservative, buffer ETFs give them a way to retain equity exposure while having less tail risk.” In addition, buffer ETFs carry higher fees than passive ETFs. Average expense ratios are in the 70 to 80 basis point range. “This category of buffers has not seen the fee compression that other categories of ETFs have,” said Mike Venuto, chief investment officer at Tidal, which advises asset managers on launching ETFs. “Our internal research says that it has an average expense ratio of 72 basis points. If you weigh by assets, it’s 65 basis points. That’s light years away from traditional ETFs. I can see why new issuers are drawn to them.” While recent volatility may have triggered some advisors to give the funds a fresh look, interest has been steadily building over time. In fact, in the year-to-date through the end of April, $5.6 billion flowed into the category, according to data from Morningstar Direct. During the first quarter, “we got about $368 million in inflows,” said Matt Kaufman, senior vice president and head of ETFs at Calamos Investments, which has a variety of defined outcome products, some offering 100% downside protection on the major stock indices as well as Bitcoin. “We see people who are buying new. We also see people selling out of old series, capturing gains and moving into other series to reset their starting points. People are using these exactly as we anticipated and expect them to.” Not everyone is a fan. In March, asset manager AQR Capital Management analyzed 99 ETFs using Morningstar data and found that the ETFs performed worse than passive funds tracking market indices coupled with investments in three-month Treasuries. The researchers argued that there are better ways for investors to hedge risk. That triggered a pair of responses from Vest, the subadvisor that builds First Trust’s buffer products. Vest President Jeff Chang questioned the dataset that AQR chose, which included both buffer and non-buffer ETFs. Chang also pointed out that evaluating buffer ETFs on returns misses the point since the products are not intended to beat the market, but to provide protection. Morningstar’s Jeffrey Ptak joined the debate on his Substack, posted shortly after another article he wrote on Morningstar’s site. Ptak said buffer ETFs, by and large, had delivered on their promises and found “the average dollar invested in buffer ETFs has exceeded the ETFs’ total returns, meaning investors have been able to achieve the potential outcomes advertised.” The buffer funds have weathered the initial COVID-19 market disruptions in 2020 and the wave of supply chain disruption and inflation that hammered 60/40 portfolios in 2022. “They did what they were supposed to do,” Innovator’s Day said. “Sometimes we are asked if these have been tested. In 2020, the VIX was at 70, and they did what they were supposed to do.” However, Jack Zhang, chief investment strategist, alternative investments, with Sequoia Financial, cautioned about how surrendering the upside, at the wrong time, is also a risk of the ETFs. “In the case of the COVID recovery, we essentially got many years of returns crammed into a short time period,” Zhang said. With a capped upside, investors can miss out on those kinds of substantial gains. “In times of crisis, they can provide benefits, but perhaps not as much as other asset classes. Over cycles, being diversified in stocks, bonds and alternatives gives you more of an all-weather approach. I think over the long-term horizon, that just works better than buffer ETFs.” “Our team moved a considerable portion of our client’s domestic and international equity exposure—almost 40%—into these products in February and late March,” said Phillip Knight, a managing director and partner with Americana Partners, a Houston-based wealth management firm with over $8.5 billion in assets under management. “We’re beyond glad that we made this move, but we’ve also found that using these types of tools in a portfolio model adds an element of optionality, and to maximize benefits for our clients, you need to closely monitor the P&Ls of each position.” “We tend to recommend them as a complement to a traditional stock and bond portfolio,” said Gary Quinzel, vice president, portfolio consulting with Minneapolis-based Wealth Enhancement, an RIA with about $100 billion in client assets. “Our dynamically-hedged equity building block portfolio aims to provide exposure to U.S. equities with less beta risk relative to the overall market. Investors can expect a smoother experience.” Wealth Enhancement uses a variety of buffer ETFs diversified by buffer ranges and time periods. Depending on the client, it recommends allocating 10% to 25% of portfolios to the products. “We like to combine the different strategies so we’re hedged against time periods as well as potential downfalls. The end result, if done optimally, is that it can lower beta in a portfolio by 30% to 50%.” Brent Coggins, chief investment officer with Triad Wealth Partners, a Lawrence, Kan.-based RIA with $460 million in AUM, outlined a similar philosophy. “If you look at our investment platform, you will see a bit of everything,” Coggins said. “We have strategies that use the full principal protection outcomes, all the way up to more aggressive, high-single digit protection levels that may have a levered upside. It’s very much case-by-case and all anchored back to identifying the strategy that’s going to maximize the success for the client’s financial plan.” They can be particularly good fits for clients who are more concerned about principal protection than about increasing their wealth—such as investors in or near retirement. “There’s a massive chunk of wealth transitioning from the accumulation phase to the decumulation phase. For them, it’s no longer about, ‘Did I beat the S&P or did I miss it by a couple hundred basis points.’ It’s about, ‘Am I harnessing growth potential,” said Mike Loukas, principal and CEO of TrueMark Investments, which operates a suite of active ETFs, including buffers, under the TrueShares banner. “Investors, to a large degree, are far more comfortable with that tradeoff and the world of hedging than they used to be.” Loukas still sees the benefit of uncapped funds. “There are moments where I’m OK in a normal market, trailing the S&P by a little bit, but in these massive up markets, you can’t afford to trail by 2000 basis points,” Loukas said. “Something that is uncapped has the ability to track the S&P up the ladder without being capped out. It comes down to what individual investors or modelers are looking for, and matching expectations and intents with the right defined outcome for the needs of the portfolio.” While it is always important to see what makes any fund perform the way it does, that’s particularly true with buffers. “The largest education hurdle we’ve had with advisors is that some of these products own underlying large cap stocks. And while those held up awesome at the end of the year, in the recent slide the Mag 7 got hit hard,” said Dynasty’s Nerney. “The index wasn’t down as much as those names, so how were these products lower than the S&P? It was because you’re long large cap tech.” Still, Nerney said the ETFs do have a role to play. “I hope our teams that were using them continue their allocations even though the payoff prolife wasn’t as exciting as it typically is,” Nerney said. “You need to remain systematic in your allocation in any product set you use. [When] portfolios are shedding 5% to 6% a day, there’s nothing like actual protection.” Generally, advisors using buffer ETFs are allocating anywhere from 10% to 25% of a client’s assets to the funds. Buffer ETFs are more common in the RIA space, as broker/dealers more often restrict the investments allowed on the platform, and some have limited the use of buffer ETFs because of the underlying options. “One of the things that still surprises me is that some home offices … say that sounds risky. So, they limit how much an advisor can use them,” Day said. “It’s backwards. If you are an aggressive investor, you can allocate more to these buffers, but if you’re conservative, you can allocate less, which is counterintuitive.” One of the biggest benefits advisors see for the products is mitigating investor behavior, such as panic selling, when markets fall. “Most folks, just by human nature, don’t want to lose money,” Kane said. “So, when you come out and say, ‘We have an option to protect you,’ that’s absolutely great. It’s an easier sell than ‘I would like to put option overlay strategy over your portfolio’, which requires much more nuance to describe. Buffer ETFs are a great way to package it together.” Vest’s Chang also points to behavioral factors as a key selling point. “One of the biggest risks is not volatility. It’s staying invested,” he said. Studies show that investors experience losses 2.5 times more than they experience gains, which often leads them to sell and then miss out when markets turn. “The average equity investor underperforms by 3.5% every year. They would have doubled their returns if they had something that kept them invested.” That makes sense to clients concerned about the heightened volatility roiling markets. “This is when pricing can be extremely attractive,” Chang said. “We are always one tweet away from a 10% move up or down. That’s going to persist for a bit. ... When Henry Ford created the seat belt, less than 10% of consumers paid for that option. But if you’re going to be out there in a Lamborghini, you want to put a seat belt on.” David Bodamer Editorial Director, WealthManagement.com David Bodamer covers investments for WealthManagement.com, including hosting the Wealth Management Invest podcast.

Title: HIMS Stock To $25?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/03/31: In this photo illustration, the Hims & Hers Health logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Hims & Hers Health (NASDAQ: HIMS) experienced a devastating 35% stock crash on June 23, 2025, after Novo Nordisk abruptly terminated their brief partnership. The dramatic sell-off reflects not just the immediate loss of a key business relationship, but fundamental questions about the company’s long-term viability in the weight-loss drug market. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception. On a separate note, see – Is Iran Bluffing While Readying An Attack? The collaboration between HIMS and Novo Nordisk, which began in April 2025, was supposed to be a game-changer for the telehealth company. The partnership promised direct access to Wegovy, Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight-loss drug, through HIMS's platform. This arrangement had fueled much of HIMS's remarkable 150% stock surge earlier this year, as investors bet on a clear pathway to sustained revenue growth. However, the partnership lasted barely two months. Novo Nordisk cited concerns over what it called "illegal mass compounding and deceptive marketing" by HIMS, specifically pointing to the company’s continued sales of personalized, compounded versions of semaglutide (Wegovy’s active ingredient) rather than focusing solely on the branded medication. The dispute highlights a fundamental tension in the weight-loss drug market. Following the FDA’s declaration that the semaglutide shortage had ended, compounding pharmacies technically lost their legal justification to produce copycat versions of the drug. Yet HIMS continued marketing personalized versions of the treatment, which Novo Nordisk viewed as undermining their branded product and potentially violating regulatory requirements. This strategic misstep by HIMS reveals a deeper problem: the company appeared to prioritize its existing compounded drug business over nurturing the partnership that investors had priced as its future growth engine. The decision to continue selling personalized versions while simultaneously partnering with Novo Nordisk created an untenable conflict of interest. The stock crash, while severe, may still not fully reflect HIMS’s diminished prospects. Even after the 35% decline, HIMS trades at approximately seven times trailing revenues— more than double its five-year historical average of three times revenues. This elevated multiple made sense when investors expected the Novo Nordisk partnership to drive explosive growth, but that rationale has now evaporated. If HIMS were to revert to its historical valuation multiple of three times revenues, the stock would fall to around $25 — representing another 40% decline from current levels. This suggests the selling may not be finished, particularly as investors reassess the company’s growth trajectory without its key partnership. HIMS can theoretically continue selling personalized obesity treatments, but this approach faces multiple headwinds. The regulatory environment remains uncertain, with the FDA potentially intervening if it determines that companies are abusing compounding loopholes rather than providing genuinely personalized medicine. The loss of Wegovy’s direct sales potential also eliminates what could have been a massive revenue stream from the company's existing member base. The question now becomes whether HIMS’s remaining business model can generate sufficient growth to justify any premium valuation. The company's personalized approach may serve a niche market, but it's unlikely to match the scale that direct Wegovy sales could have provided. The HIMS situation represents a classic case where investors should resist the urge to "buy the dip." While the stock’s 35% decline appears dramatic, the fundamental investment thesis has now been altered. The company has lost its clearest path to significant revenue growth and faces an elevated risk profile regarding regulatory compliance. For now, the prudent approach is to wait and observe how the situation develops. HIMS may find alternative pathways to growth, but without the Novo Nordisk partnership, those routes are far less certain and likely less lucrative. The market's brutal reaction to the partnership termination sends a clear message: when a company's primary growth catalyst disappears overnight, even a 35% decline may not be enough to restore attractive risk-adjusted returns. Now, regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. 1.
