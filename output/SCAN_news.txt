Bitcoin price prediction 2025 is heating up as crypto expert Ran Neer, who’s nailed every major crypto cycle since 2017, reveals his bold $250,000 forecast. With Bitcoin nearing all-time highs, Neer says the real bull run is just beginning—and it could peak by November 2024. He’s betting big on BTC, Layer 1s, DeFi tokens, and crypto stocks like Coinbase and MicroStrategy. But this time, he warns, not all altcoins will rise. Backed by strong macro trends and institutional momentum, Neer believes this cycle could be faster, sharper, and even bigger than before. Could Bitcoin hit $300,000 next? Let’s break it down.

Title: Bitcoin eyes $150,000 — analysts reveal the key moves that could send it soaring

Bitcoin price is once again heading toward the $120,000 mark, but the big question traders are asking is—what will it take for Bitcoin to reach $150,000? Driven by a $1 billion futures short squeeze, strong Bitcoin ETF inflows, and growing institutional interest, BTC’s momentum is building. Support from Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, potential passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill, and a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern with a $143K target all fuel the rally. With Cantor Fitzgerald eyeing a 30,000 BTC acquisition and inflation data stabilizing, Bitcoin could be ready for its next breakout toward $130K and ultimately $150K. Bitcoin is heating up again — and this time, analysts are setting their sights on a massive $150,000 target. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has surged past $120,000, gaining over 28% in just the past 30 days and reigniting hopes of a new all-time high. According to data from CoinShares, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $14.8 billion in net inflows since May, marking one of the strongest periods of institutional adoption in crypto history. Analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence and ARK Invest now forecast Bitcoin reaching $150,000–$200,000 by early 2026, with some more aggressive models predicting a run to $250K if market conditions remain favorable.

Title: Watch These Palantir Levels as Stock Continues to Hit Record Highs Amid AI Boom
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-palantir-levels-as-stock-continues-to-hit-record-highs-amid-ai-boom-11772160

Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares hit another all-time high during Tuesday's session amid optimism that the data analytics software provider will benefit from massive AI spending. The company's CEO, Alex Karp, was among the executives in attendance Tuesday, along with President Donald Trump, at an energy and AI summit in Pittsburgh, where companies announced tens of billions of dollars in investments in energy infrastructure and data centers. Jeff Swensen / Getty Images Last week, Wedbush analysts said in a client note that Palantir could be in a “sweet spot” to benefit from federal spending in North America and Europe, adding that the Trump administration’s focus on AI initiatives provides another tailwind for the stock. Palantir shares have nearly doubled since the start of the year, making the stock the biggest advancer in the S&P 500 in 2025, boosted boosted by surging enterprise and government AI spending, including several lucrative defense contracts. The stock hit an intraday record of near $151 Tuesday morning, but closed the session slightly lower at $148.58. Below, we break down the technicals on Palantir’s chart and point out price levels that investors will likely be watching. Palantir shares traded within an ascending triangle before nudging above the pattern’s top trendline in Monday’s trading session, when the stock closed at a record high, potentially setting the stage for a continuation move higher. Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum, though the indicator remains below overbought levels, providing the shares with ample room to explore higher prices. Let’s apply technical analysis to forecast how an ongoing uptrend in Palantir shares may unfold and also identify two support levels worth monitoring during future pullbacks in the stock. Investors can forecast how a move higher in Palantir shares may look by using the bars pattern tool, a technique that analyzes earlier trends on the chart to projects future directional movements. When applying the analysis, we extract the stock’s trend higher between a prior flag and the ascending triangle and reposition it from the pattern’s upper trendline. This projects an upside target of around $195 and indicates the shares could continue trending until late August if price action rhymes with that earlier move. The bulls’ failure to defend the ascending triangle’s top trendline could see the shares retrace toward $125. This area, currently positioned just below the 50-day moving average, would likely provide support near the prominent February peak and a period of sideways drift that formed on the chart throughout most of May. Finally, a deeper pullback in the stock could lead to a retest of lower support around $107. Investors may look to accumulate Palantir shares in this region near the high to February’s earnings-driven breakaway gap, which closely aligns with the completion of a brief profit-taking dip in early May.
