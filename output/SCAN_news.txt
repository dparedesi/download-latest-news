Title: This Dividend Aristocrat Turned $100k Into $4 Million in 25 Years
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/09/this-dividend-aristocrat-turned-100k-into-4-million-in-25-years/

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Vadi Fuoco / Shutterstock.com When you first think about a Dividend Aristocrat stock, it’s likely not Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ). People usually assume Dividend Aristocrats are slow-growing cash cows that will keep you ahead of inflation with dividends, and perhaps a bit more on top of that. Very rarely do you assume a Dividend Aristocrat would have the bearings to outperform even the Nasdaq-100 over the past 25 years. That’s a perfect sign that you’re underestimating the power of compounding. These dividend stocks look boring on the surface, but their snowballing dividends can make you outperform even growth stocks in the long run. Let’s take a look at what made it possible with CNQ and whether or not you can expect similar returns in the next 25 years with this stock. Canadian Natural Resources is one of the world’s largest independent crude oil and natural gas producers. It operates across the entire oil and gas value chain, from exploration to marketing. The company also owns midstream infrastructure. The magic behind its outperformance over the long run is the rising dividend and the company’s ability to capitalize whenever there’s an increase in oil and gas prices. CNQ stock is up over 180% in the past five years and still comes with a forward dividend yield of nearly 5%. It has been raising its dividends for 25 years straight and has returned over CAD 6 billion in the first nine months of 2025. What’s even more impressive is that the 5-year dividend growth rate is at 22.37% annually. The forward payout ratio is still 64%. If there’s ever trouble in the oil and gas markets, there’s ample breathing room. CNQ raised dividends through 2020 (when oil prices briefly dipped into the negatives). It also kept paying dividends through the 2014 oil price collapse. If you invested $100k in mid-2000 and kept reinvesting dividends, your overall return would be 3,925.28%. This means your original investment would top $4 million today. If you put the same amount of money into the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) and reinvested the meager dividends, you’d end up with $823,680 today. The Dot Com bubble slowed down the QQQ significantly, whereas the 2014-2016 oil slowdown also caused CNQ stock to underperform for a long stretch. Regardless, long-term investors still made progress as they reinvested dividends, and the company eventually made a recovery in earnest. CNQ stock is unlikely to hand you another 40x in the next 25 years, but it is still worth owning since it comes with great yields and still has upside potential. The company’s performance in the past 25 years was due to oil prices rising significantly in the early 2000s, which coincided with the company building out massive oil sands mining and thermal operations, transitioning from higher-decline conventional assets to 57% long-life, low-decline production with only an 11% corporate decline rate. This gave it a large early head start. Average crude oil prices jumped from $19.69 in 1999 to $98.69 in 2008. So far in 2025, it is much lower at $64.39. If you adjust for inflation, crude oil prices are actually lower today than they were in late 2000. This shows the company can keep expanding and paying dividends even if the broader energy market is flat or trending downwards. The demand for oil and gas should remain strong, at least for a North American company like Canadian Natural Resources. There is an ongoing push towards re-industrialization and onshoring. Plus, the drive towards renewable energy has been nowhere near as aggressive as previously thought. Countries are relying heavily on oil and gas, even more so than before. Sanctions on certain countries after 2022 make it even more likely that CNQ stock is well-positioned to deliver. European countries have turned to North America for their energy needs. Both the U.S. and Canada are seeing an oil and gas export boom to Europe, with analysts saying Canada’s current Prime Minister’s aim is “…to author a sequel to the oil boom that Canada experienced between the start of the century and 2014. He’s never put it so plainly, but it’s clearly the target.” In short, CNQ can keep growing in the coming decades and keep outperforming most other dividend stocks. Analysts expect EPS to double from 2025 to 2029. Dividend stocks shouldn’t be dismissed as boring investments that end up underperforming the top growth picks of Wall Street. Even… Income investing isn’t meant to create fabulous wealth in a month or even a year.

Title: Bitcoin vs. XRP: Which Is the Better Long-Term Bet Right Now?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 Choosing between two top-tier dominant forces in any particular sector can be a difficult task. In the world of crypto, investors looking to put long-term capital to work in tokens they view as long-term stores of value outside the monetary system do have a few choices to choose from. Of course, there’s the first (and still the largest) cryptocurrency out there which is most often viewed as such a monetary system hedge – Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC). Bitcoin’s historical performance, its sheer size at a market capitalization of more than $1.8 trillion, and its ardent investor base makes this top token one investors have to consider up front. That said, there are other base layer networks such as XRP (CRYPTO:XRP) which are quickly becoming their own unique asset classes investors want to own. Plenty of XRP investors, who have held through Ripple’s long and arduous legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), may now view this token as truly battle-tested. XRP’s network, at least in terms of transaction activity, is a dominant force in the crypto landscape. So, which top-tier digital asset is the better long-term bet right now? Let’s dive in. There’s really not much that needs to be said about Bitcoin. It’s the biggest, largely considered to be the most stable, well-known, and liquid cryptocurrency out there. For traders, speculators and long-term investors alike, Bitcoin is often the only choice when it comes to playing momentum-driven moves in this space. And notably, the early introduction of spot ETFs and other exchange traded products which offered traditional investors an avenue to gain exposure to Bitcoin has propelled massive amounts of investor capital into this network. Now, given Bitcoin’s size at a market capitalization that’s nearing $2 trillion, absolute floods of capital are going to need to continuously pour into this ecosystem in order for investors today to see upside. Indeed, a 10x from here would require Bitcoin to achieve a market capitalization of roughly $18 trillion, which would make this digital asset (which doesn’t generate cash flows and can’t be seen or held) worth more than any other entire stock market index of any country outside the United States (China currently has the second-largest equity market capitalization of around $12 trillion). That’s an incredible statistic. Of course, Bitcoin’s dominant position in terms of network value, liquidity, usage and as a perceived store of value will remain. This is among the most integral pieces of infrastructure in this sector, with a n important role for corporate treasuries and the balance sheets of financial institutions. As such, there are now many vested interests in seeing Bitcoin’s price continue to rise. Over the long-term, most investors would say Bitcoin will be the more stable bet. But will it outperform XRP? XRP visual XRP is certainly a more compelling opportunity for investors looking more for outright growth right now. As far as a utility-focused network is concerned, XRP’s key XRP Ledger technology, which allows individuals, companies and large financial entities to transfer vast amounts of capital around the world at lightning fast speeds and ultra-low costs (compared to other networks such as SWIFT which can take days to close, and take percentage points off each transaction), is very valuable. In the world of cross-border finance, XRP is clearly a long-term winner. I’m bullish on this area of the crypto market myself, and I think that this is ultimately what Bitcoin’s founders intended (at least in part) when creating the Bitcoin network to begin with. To a certain extent, XRP has capitalized on this initial mission, and perhaps done a better job than Bitcoin of creating the sort of integrated rails many coming out of the GFC hoped would exist. Being able to transfer money outsize of the system, while retaining key remittance data that ensures one will reliably receive these funds same-day, can provide immense value to an immeasurable number of counterparties. 24/7 Wall St. In my view, Bitcoin’s bull case is more conducive to long-term investors who may be more concerned around capital preservation over long periods of time. Indeed, the reality for the digital assets sector is that there are a number of high-profile blowups which have effectively pulled the rug out from underneath some pretty savvy investors. There are simply plenty of investors out there who won’t want to fall prey to such a situation, and given Bitcoin’s aforementioned status as a key treasury holding on many balance sheets within the U.S. economy (and even the U.S. government), there’s a broad vested interest in seeing this token continue to appreciate over time. Despite XRP’s enhanced utility and status as a key network to “get things done,” that’s the way things stand right now in my view. As such, and being an investor who is inherently more conservative than many out there, I’m going to stick with Bitcoin as my top crypto pick for right now. Of course, every investor’s risk tolerance preferences and investing style will differ. There are plenty of investors out there would would pick XRP over Bitcoin any day of the week (and by way of each network’s sheer size, it’s mathematically easier for XRP to 10x in value from here). But for those looking to steer clear of as much unnecessary volatility as possible, while generating market-beating returns over time, Bitcoin still stands as my preferential pick (particularly during selloffs). The crypto market is buzzing with excitement, as the overall market capitalization of this sector continues to remain above the… As the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) matters a great deal to investors looking to amplify their upside in a market that’s… Bitcoin’s (CRYPTO: BTC) incredible rise to new highs has many investors thinking through various scenarios with respect to where this token… Crypto investors today face a critical choice.

However, sectoral performance remained mixed as Nifty Financial Services fell 0.44 per cent to 27,563.95 and Nifty Bank slipped 0.06 per cent to 59,204.05, while Nifty Midcap 100 edged up 0.03 per cent and Nifty Smallcap 100 gained 0.58 per cent.

Market participants remained cautious as the Indian rupee continued to trade past the 90 mark against the dollar amid persistent dollar strength. Fresh concerns emerged from U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments threatening additional tariffs on rice imports from India, adding to the risk-off sentiment. Technical analysts noted that Nifty’s immediate resistance was placed at 25,950-26,000, while support stood at 25,800. The day’s session saw 54 stocks hitting 52-week highs against 483 stocks touching 52-week lows.

Bengaluru, India, 9th December 2025 - According to Zerodha Fund House, digital only passive fund house in the country, in its recent study cited that total Gold ETF AUM in India has crossed ₹1L crore as of Oct 2025. This surge, matched by a spike in new investor accounts, shows that the ETF route is becoming the preferred choice for Indian gold investors since Gold also plays a key role as a strategic long-term investment and as a foundational allocation in a well-diversified portfolio. The 2025 data tells a decisive story - driven by record inflows and a price rally. “To confirm, there has been no discussion, decision, or proposal before the Board or the Audit Committee regarding any change in the statutory auditors,” it said.

His deep experience across various sectors and ability to leverage his established network will strengthen our investment capabilities in a growing market like India and deliver long-term value for our investors. We look forward to Prateek’s leadership in advancing MAM India’s next phase of growth.” Delhivery announced the launch of Delhivery International, an Economy Air Parcel service designed to make global exports affordable, simple and more reliable for SMEs and enterprise customers across India.

The resignation has been accepted, and his last working day with the Company will be December 31, 2025. Gold and silver prices are stable, supported by risk aversion and anticipation of a 25bp rate drop by the Federal Reserve at its meeting on December 9-10. With the Fed generally expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, traders will be watching the latest economic predictions (the Dot plot) and comments from Chair Jerome Powell for signals on the central bank’s plans for 2026 and beyond. Current market pricing indicates a 90% chance of such a move, with expectations now pointing to two additional cuts next year, down from three only a week ago. The market may be anticipating that the Fed may signal that, after this rate cut, there may be a halt in the first quarter of 2026 for a few months. Technical Triggers\u0009 Gold has started its upward journey again; the next target is $4300 (~Rs 132,000) and $4345 (~Rs 133,500) with strong support at $4200 (~Rs 129,000). Silver can continue its rally towards $60 (~Rs 185,500) and $62 (~Rs 191,000), with firm support at $57 (~Rs 177,000), if tight supply conditions continue. “Bitcoin slid slightly and is holding near the $90,000 zone, but the market tone remains cautious as liquidity has thinned and participation has noticeably faded into year-end. Multiple desks highlight the same issue: spot demand is soft, ETF flows are still negative, and futures activity has reset to much lower levels. With more than seven million BTC now sitting at an unrealized loss and hedging costs elevated, the market is signalling reluctance to chase upside until visibility improves. Even short-lived rallies toward $92,000 are meeting resistance as pro traders remain defensive and continue paying up for downside protection. For now, BTC looks pinned in a narrow range, with the buy-side backdrop too light to sustain a clean breakout. Macro remains the dominant driver, and traders are approaching the Fed meeting with a fully priced-in 25 bps cut. The divergence in global policy signals (the BOJ’s tightening stance, a divided BOE, and a steady ECB) has added another layer of complexity. Soft U.S. labour data, weak housing indicators, and anxiety around AI-linked equity valuations are encouraging a more risk-averse tone across assets. Rising long-bond yields and China’s stablecoin discount point to broader caution rather than overt stress. Against this backdrop, the clearest market consensus is that direction will hinge more on Fed chair Powell’s messaging than the rate move itself. This is especially so with traders expecting a shallow easing path rather than a full cycle. Altcoins continue to trade unevenly but are showing pockets of relative strength as Bitcoin consolidates. Ethereum has held up better and is aided by improving flows and structural catalysts. It is trading near its strongest level versus BTC in over a month. XRP and Cardano are benefiting from rotational flows, while others remain pressured by weak liquidity and lingering regulatory noise. Zcash continued its climb as the token surged by 16%. If Bitcoin remains range-bound after the Fed, the environment may favour continued selective outperformance in altcoins rather than a broad rally. Still, without a pickup in market participation or clearer macro signals, sustained momentum across the altcoin complex is likely to remain sporadic and catalyst-driven. Our advice: For customers, the practical stance is to build positions gradually only near strong support. Keep leverage light and wait for a clear break above $92,000-$94,000 before expecting sustained upside.” IndiGo flights cancellation, IndiGo stocks & share price today live updates: IndiGo has signaled a recovery from its recent crisis on Monday, announcing it will operate more than 1,800 flights across its network even as government officials intensify on-ground inspections at major airports.

Title: What bubble? Asset managers in risk-on mode stick with stocks

Time Published: 2025-12-07T23:55:22Z
Full Content:
There’s a time when investments run their course and the prudent move is to cash out. For global asset managers who’ve ridden double-digit gains in equities for three straight years, that time is not now. “Our expectation of solid growth and easier monetary and fiscal policies supports a risk-on tilt in our multi-asset portfolios. We remain overweight stocks and credit,” said Sylvia Sheng, global multi-asset strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “We are playing the powerful trends in place and are bullish through the end of next year,” said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer at DWS. “For now we are not contrarians.” “Start the year with sufficient exposure, even over-exposure to equities, predominantly in emerging market equities,” said Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, EMEA chief investment officer at Lombard Odier. “We don’t expect a recession in 2026 to unfold.” Those assessments came from Bloomberg News interviews with 39 investment managers across the US, Asia and Europe, including at BlackRock Inc., Allianz Global Investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Franklin Templeton. More than three-quarters of the allocators were positioning portfolios for a risk-on environment through 2026. The thrust of the bet is that resilient global growth, further developments in artificial intelligence, accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus will deliver outsize returns in all fashion of global equity markets. The call is not without risks, including simply its pervasiveness among the respondents, along with their overall high degree of assuredness. The view among the institutional investors also aligns with that of sell-side strategists around the globe. Should the bullishness play out as expected, it would deliver a stunning fourth straight year of bumper returns for the MSCI All-Country World Index. That would extend a run that’s added $42 trillion in market capitalization since the end of 2022 — the most value created for equity investors in history. That’s not to say the optimism is without merit. The artificial intelligence trade has added trillions in market value to dozens of firms plying the industry, but just three years after ChatGPT broke into the public consciousness, AI remains in the early phase of development. The buy-side managers largely rejected the idea that the technology has blown a bubble in equity markets. While many acknowledged some pockets of froth in unprofitable tech names, 85% of managers said valuations among the Magnificent Seven and other AI heavyweights are not overly inflated. Fundamentals back the trade, they said, which marks the beginning of a new industrial cycle. “You can’t call it a bubble when you’re seeing tech companies deliver a massive earnings beat. In fact, earnings from the sector have outstripped all other US stocks,” said Anwiti Bahuguna, global co-chief investment officer at Northern Trust Asset Management. As such, investors expect the US to remain the engine of the rally. “American exceptionalism is far from dead,” said Jose Rasco, chief investment officer at HSBC Americas. “As artificial intelligence continues to spread around the globe, the US will be a key participant.” Most investors echoed the sentiment expressed by Helen Jewell, international chief investment officer of fundamental equities at BlackRock, who suggested also searching outside the US for meaningful upside. “The US is where the high-return high-growth companies are, so we have to be realistic about that. But those are already reflected in valuations, and there are probably more interesting opportunities outside the US,” she said. Profits matter above all else for equity investors, and huge bumps in government spending from Europe to Asia have stoked estimates for strong gains in earnings. “We have begun to see a meaningful broadening of earnings momentum, both across market capitalizations and across regions, including Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea,” said Wellington Management equity strategist Andrew Heiskell. “Looking into 2026, we see clear potential for a revival of earnings growth in Europe and a wider range of emerging markets.” India is one of the most compelling opportunities for 2026, according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions. “We see real potential for India to become the Korea-like re-rating story of 2026, a market that transitions from tactical allocation to strategic core exposure in global portfolios,” she said. Nelson Yu, head of equities at AllianceBernstein, said he sees improvements outside of the US that will mandate allocations. He noted governance reform in Japan, capital discipline in Europe and recovering profitability in some emerging markets. At the sector level, the investors are looking for AI proxies, notably among clean energy providers that can help meet the technology’s ravenous demand for power. Smaller stocks are also finding favor. “The earnings outlook has brightened for small-capitalization stocks, industrials and financials,” said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of Franklin Templeton Institute. “Small-cap stocks and industrials, which are typically more highly leveraged than the rest of the market, will see profitability rise as the Federal Reserve trims interest rates and debt servicing costs fall.” Over at Santander Asset Management, Francisco Simón sees earnings growth of more than 20% for US small caps after years of underperformance. Reflecting the optimism, the Russell 2000 Index of such equities recently hit a record high. Meanwhile, the combination of low valuations and strong fundamentals makes health care one of the most compelling contrarian opportunities in a bullish cycle, a preponderance of managers said. “Health-care related sectors can surprise to the upside in the US markets,” said Jim Caron, chief investment officer of cross-asset solutions at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “This is a mid-term election year and policy may at the margin support many companies. Valuations are still attractive and have a lot of catch up to do.” Virtually every allocator struck at least a note of caution about what lies ahead. The top worry among them was a rekindling of inflation in the US. If the Fed is forced by rising prices to abruptly pause or even end its easing cycle, the potential for turbulence is high. “A scenario — which is not our base case — whereby US inflation rebounds in 2026 would constitute a double whammy for multi-asset funds as it would penalize both stocks and bonds. In this sense it would be much worse than an economic slowdown,” said Amélie Derambure, senior multi-asset portfolio manager at Amundi SA. “The way investors are headed for 2026, they need to have the Fed on their side,” she added. Another worry is around President Donald Trump’s capriciousness, particularly when it comes to trade. Any flareup in his trade spats that fuels inflation through heightened tariffs would weigh on risk assets. Oil and gas producers remain unloved by the group, though that could change if a major geopolitical event upends supply lines. While such an outcome would bolster those sectors, the overall impact would likely be negative for risk assets, they said. “Any geopolitical situation that can affect the price of oil is what will have the largest impact on the financial markets. Clearly both the Middle East and the Ukraine/Russia situations can impact oil prices,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Multiple respondents flagged European autos as a “no-go” area for 2026, citing intense competitive pressure from Chinese carmakers, margin compression and structural challenges in the transition to electric vehicles. “Personally I don’t believe for a minute that there will be a rebound in the sector,” said Isabelle de Gavoty at Allianz GI. Outside of those worries, most asset managers simply believe that there’s little reason to fret about the upward momentum being interrupted — outside, of course, from the contrarian signal such near-uniform bullishness sends. “Everyone seems to be risk-on at the moment, and that worries me a bit in the sense that the concentration of positions creates less tolerance for adverse surprises,” said Amundi’s Derambure.

Title: Ethereum supply drops – Yet Tom Lee insists ‘$3K is still undervalued’

ETH is trading differently than traditional tech stocks. Ethereum [ETH] is sending mixed signals. Some mid-size whales are trimming their holdings, while the biggest players barely care. Yet despite ETH trading at elevated valuations for years, more people continue to hold it… and less ETH sits on exchanges. Are investors seeing Ethereum through a different, longer-term lens? Ethereum’s accumulation heatmap shows that the 1-10K ETH cohort was the first to sell into strength, and they did it right near the price top. These mid-size whales sold heavily during the peak, capturing profits while the market was still celebrating new highs. What’s more, is that they haven’t stopped. Source: Alphractal Selling from this group continues, keeping pressure on ETH even as sentiment remains upbeat. In contrast, the largest holders (wallets with more than 10K ETH) are far more neutral. They’re neither panic-selling nor aggressively buying. This might be why ETH’s rally has struggled to find smooth momentum. ETH held on CEXs has been dropping, falling from around 14.5 million ETH in late July to nearly 12.5 million ETH at press time. Investors (both retail and institutional) are moving coins off exchanges and into long-term storage. So far, consistent outflows reduce immediate sell pressure and prove confidence. Source: X Even as mid-size whales continue taking profits, the broader trend shows fewer holders keeping ETH available to sell. Despite Ethereum trading at a fully diluted P/S ratio above 100x for years, levels most dot‑com companies never sustained, the number of holders continues to rise. Charts reveal Ethereum’s P/S repeatedly spiking above 1,000x, at times approaching 3,000x, while total addresses have now surpassed 250 million. Source: X Holders aren’t treating ETH like a revenue-driven tech stock. Instead, many appear to value it as a long-term settlement asset. The idea is probably that its utility, network effects, and role in shaping digital money outweigh its short-term financial ratios. Adding to the bullish outlook, Bitmine’s Tom Lee says Ethereum at $3K is grossly undervalued. He mentioned the probability of ETH reaching $12K based on its 8-year average, with upside scenarios of $22K and even $62K per ETH. This is the long-term potential that many investors seem to already price in.
