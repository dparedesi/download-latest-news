ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a humble start at $2 in early 2024, SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), a voice AI platform enabling businesses to deliver conversational AI experiences, has seen its stock skyrocket by an astonishing 500% to its current price of around $13. This explosive ascent isn't just luck; it's a direct result of the company's compelling AI growth story, which has seen its technology become a staple in the automotive industry and expand into new frontiers. This monumental rise can be traced to three critical factors: So, the key question remains: Can these factors continue to propel SoundHound stock higher? We’ll delve into the specifics of what's driving this momentum and whether this AI growth story has the legs to keep soaring. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – CoreWeave Stock To $200? SoundHound AI’s strong revenue growth is far more than a simple market trend; it's the result of a deliberate and powerful three-pronged strategy that has transformed the company from a niche player into a diversified force. The most impactful move was the acquisition of Amelia in August 2024. This wasn't just a bolt-on purchase; it was a game-changing maneuver. By adding Amelia’s mature enterprise AI business and its substantial $45 million in recurring revenue, SoundHound didn't just grow—it supercharged its top line. This single strategic acquisition fundamentally reshaped the company's financial profile, providing a stable, high-value enterprise foundation that its previous business lacked. Historically, SoundHound was heavily reliant on the automotive sector, with over 90% of its revenue tied to a single industry. That dangerous dependency has been shattered. The company has executed a masterful diversification strategy, with well-balanced revenue streams now flowing from automotive, restaurants, financial services, healthcare, and insurance. This critical shift not only mitigates risk but also unlocks a vast array of new revenue streams, proving the company's technology is adaptable and in demand across multiple lucrative sectors. While diversification is key, SoundHound has not abandoned its core. The company has deepened its penetration in the automotive market, forging crucial partnerships with global powerhouses like Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, and Stellantis brands such as Peugeot, Opel, and Alfa Romeo. This isn't just about selling a product; it’s about becoming an integral part of the next generation of in-vehicle technology. The recent broad rollout of its Chat AI to new Stellantis brands across Europe shows that this expansion is ongoing and gaining momentum, solidifying its position in this crucial market. While acquisitions and partnerships are the most visible drivers, a more fundamental force is at play: the company’s proprietary technology and product innovation. SoundHound’s Polaris foundation model and the launch of the Amelia 7.0 agentic AI (acts proactively) platform are key. These platforms offer superior accuracy and lower latency compared to rivals, which is a massive competitive advantage. It's this continuous technological edge that convinces major enterprises and automakers to choose SoundHound and is what allows the company to land new contracts and expand existing relationships. The tangible growth we see is the direct result of a superior product that's winning in the market. SoundHound AI’s valuation has exploded higher. Its price-to-sales ratio has skyrocketed from a rich 10.6x in 2023 to a staggering 37.6x today. This isn't just about revenue growth; it's a story of market frenzy driven by four powerful forces. While SoundHound's revenue surged by 187%, the stock's appreciation has been far more dramatic. The market is paying a premium for what it believes is a hyper-growth story. The projections of another 35% growth in 2025 and 65% by 2026 are fueling this narrative. This isn't just a bet on past performance; it's a forward-looking wager on a company they believe is just getting started. In the crowded tech landscape, SoundHound stands out as a pure-play voice AI company. Investors hungry for direct exposure to the AI theme have few alternatives, creating a scarcity premium that drives up its valuation. SoundHound offers a concentrated bet on a market that's just beginning to unlock its full potential. The recent acquisition of Amelia has allowed SoundHound to enter the lucrative enterprise generative AI market, a much larger playing field. This strategic move has fundamentally reshaped how investors perceive the company, justifying the higher multiples in their minds. The valuation expansion reflects a deep-seated optimism about SoundHound's future in this fast-growing sector. Finally, SoundHound's valuation is also a product of market momentum and speculation. The stock's extreme volatility has drawn in capital from traders and short-term investors, amplifying its moves during broader AI sector rallies. These technical factors have a self-fulfilling effect, pushing the valuation multiple even higher. Beyond these factors, a crucial, often-overlooked driver of SoundHound's valuation is the value of its unique data. Every voice command processed in a car, every order taken at a drive-thru, and every customer service interaction adds to its proprietary dataset. This data is the lifeblood of its AI models, making them smarter and more effective than a rival's. As the dataset grows, it creates a powerful network effect and a competitive moat. This is why major companies are signing long-term deals—they aren't just buying a service; they're contributing to and benefiting from an ever-improving AI. On a separate note, check out our take on – At $25 Is Pfizer Stock Deep Value Or A Falling Knife? At its current price of around $13, SoundHound's stock is trading at a lofty price-to-sales ratio of 37.6x, still below its two-year average of 48.7x. However, while the valuation multiple will likely compress to more reasonable levels, the strong growth in revenues will more than offset that, resulting in higher levels for SOUN stock. See, Voice AI is not just a feature for SoundHound; it's a transformative technology poised to revolutionize human-computer interaction across multiple industries. The company's strategic positioning in conversational AI is set to capitalize on a massive wave of digital transformation across its entire customer ecosystem. Voice AI is the new frontier for SoundHound AI, fueling a multi-industry revolution. The company is capitalizing on a massive digital transformation, solidifying its position as the go-to provider in the automotive sector through partnerships with giants like Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis. Beyond the car, its AI-powered conversational interfaces are transforming customer service in enterprise, while also unlocking new revenue streams in the restaurant and hospitality industries by enabling voice-activated ordering and reducing labor costs. This strategic expansion across multiple fronts is the engine behind its accelerating revenue growth. Despite its remarkable surge, SoundHound AI stock is a high-risk bet with a history of sharp, punishing downturns. Its journey is a masterclass in both extreme volatility and resilience. When markets turn sour, SoundHound doesn't just dip—it plummets. During the 2022 inflation-driven market sell-off, SOUN stock fell a staggering 94%, a far steeper and more painful drop than the S&P 500's 25% decline. This history proves that the stock can fall harder and faster than its peers, leaving investors with little room to maneuver. More recently, the stock suffered another major blow when Nvidia exited its stake in early 2025, a powerful signal that contributed to its later volatility. Beyond market-wide shocks, SoundHound faces significant, company-specific vulnerabilities. The Profitability Paradox: Despite its impressive revenue growth, SoundHound continues to burn through cash with persistent losses. A Crisis of Credibility: The company is grappling with allegations of misleading financial reporting and inflated goodwill. These accusations have created a credibility gap that increases risk for institutional investors and injects a new layer of volatility into the stock. The Valuation Disconnect: At a price-to-sales multiple of 38, SoundHound's stock is trading at lofty levels that may not reflect its underlying fundamentals. Without a clear timeline to profitability, a disconnect exists between its sky-high valuation and its financial reality. This makes it vulnerable to a sudden and significant correction. For a deeper dive into the specific risks that could trigger a severe downturn, we've outlined a full downside scenario in our separate analysis, SoundHound AI: The Downside Case. Despite its potential, SoundHound AI stock is a high-risk, high-reward investment. While near-term volatility will likely continue, the company's strong position in the fast-growing voice AI market, combined with its accelerating revenue and expanding partnerships, presents a compelling case for significant upside over the next two to three years. However, investors should be aware of the inherent risks, including a lofty valuation, intense competition, and a history of extreme volatility during market downturns, which could severely impact returns. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful, of stocks. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: What’s Driving Amazon Stock To New Highs?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In early 2023, Amazon's stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) was trading at a modest $84. Today, it has soared to $232, a stunning 176% jump that significantly outpaces the broader NASDAQ index's 2x rise. So, what's fueling this incredible surge? The answer lies in three critical factors: But the question remains: Can this powerhouse performance continue? We’ll dive into what’s driving this momentum and what the future holds for Amazon. But if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – CoreWeave Stock To $200? Beyond its sheer size, Amazon's revenue growth is driven by a hidden engine: a powerful shift in its business model. While its e-commerce sales are impressive, they are no longer the primary force. The real story lies in the company's strategic diversification, with three key areas serving as the main catalysts for its recent surge. The undisputed heavyweight champion of Amazon's growth is Amazon Web Services (AWS). This cloud computing arm has proven to be an exceptionally valuable asset, far outpacing the growth of Amazon's traditional retail operations. While North American and international sales grew by 23% and 21% respectively between 2022 and 2024, AWS revenue surged by a solid 34% over the same period. Its high-margin, scalable services for businesses, governments, and individuals make it the company's most important growth engine. Another crucial, and often overlooked, driver of Amazon's financial success is its rapidly expanding digital advertising business. Much like Google and Meta, Amazon has leveraged its vast customer data and massive platform to become a dominant player in the ad world. This segment, which includes sponsored product listings and display ads, has been growing at a remarkable pace, providing a high-profit-margin revenue stream that diversifies the company's earnings beyond e-commerce and cloud services. Amazon's third major growth driver is its subscription services, most notably its Prime membership, which has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem of benefits beyond free shipping to include streaming video and music, exclusive deals, and more. This has created a loyal and engaged customer base that not only pays a recurring fee but also spends more on Amazon's platform than non-Prime members. This steady, predictable revenue stream provides a solid financial foundation and strengthens the company's competitive moat. Looking ahead, these drivers face a new challenge: the intense competition in the AI arms race. AWS's leadership in cloud computing is being challenged by rivals like Microsoft (Azure) and Google (Cloud), who are making massive investments in generative AI. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI and Google's rapid expansion of AI services pose a significant threat. To maintain its market leadership, Amazon is also pouring tens of billions into AI-related capital expenditures, a strategic move that will shape its future and determine if its extraordinary growth can continue. Amazon's stunning rise in valuation can be attributed to its dramatic financial transformation, where a once-unprofitable e-commerce giant has become a profit-making powerhouse. This shift has reshaped investor sentiment and sent its valuation soaring. The most significant catalyst behind this change is AWS. This high-margin cloud business has single-handedly revolutionized Amazon's profitability. Since 2022, Amazon's operating margin has skyrocketed by an astounding 377%, climbing from a meager 2.4% to a robust 11.4%. This incredible expansion in profitability, fueled by AWS, is the key reason investors are now willing to pay a premium for Amazon's stock. It signals a new era of sustainable, high-quality earnings. This surge in profitability, combined with strong revenue growth and the strategic expansion of AWS, has directly impacted Amazon’s valuation. Investors now value the company as a technology and cloud leader. As a result, the company's price-to-sales valuation multiple has ballooned by 124%, jumping from 1.7x trailing revenues in 2022 to an impressive 3.7x today. This multiple expansion is a direct reflection of the market's newfound confidence in Amazon's long-term profit potential. At its current price of around $230, Amazon's stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.7x, which aligns closely with its five-year average of 3.2x. However, there are compelling reasons to believe the valuation multiple could expand further. See, AI is not just a buzzword for Amazon; it's a strategic weapon poised to supercharge its growth and reshape its financial future. The company's massive investments in artificial intelligence are set to ignite a new wave of expansion across its entire business empire. Within AWS, AI is the new frontier. As businesses race to develop and deploy their own AI applications, they are driving unprecedented demand for AWS's cloud infrastructure. This isn't just about incremental growth; it's a direct catalyst for skyrocketing cloud sales, solidifying AWS's position as a profit powerhouse. In fact, if you want a detailed breakdown of how this growth can help Amazon's stock, take a look at our analysis – Amazon Stock: Path to 2x Growth – which highlights the key factors. But the AI revolution isn't limited to the cloud. On the retail side, AI is being woven into the very fabric of the shopping experience. Think smarter product recommendations, lightning-fast search, and deeply personalized storefronts. These aren't just minor upgrades—they're powerful tools designed to boost sales, increase the value of every order, and make advertising on the platform more effective than ever. This enhanced ad targeting will also extend its influence across the wider digital advertising landscape, creating a lucrative new revenue stream. All of this adds up to a compelling financial outlook. Amazon projects low double-digit sales growth over the next three years, with its bottom-line profits expected to grow even faster. This blend of accelerating profitability, continued AWS dominance, and an ironclad grip on the e-commerce market, presents a powerful case for a higher valuation. Investors are already taking notice, recognizing that Amazon's strategic AI initiatives are not just a plan—they're the blueprint for a new era of growth and value creation. Despite its powerful rise, Amazon’s stock is not without its vulnerabilities. Its history is marked by sharp drops that have far outpaced the broader market, highlighting both its inherent volatility and remarkable resilience. During the 2022 inflation-driven market sell-off, Amazon stock plunged a staggering 52%, a far steeper decline than the S&P 500's 25% drop. The stock's recovery took over a year, not regaining its previous high until February 2024. More recently, during periods of heightened trade war concerns, the pattern repeated—Amazon plummeted 30% while the S&P 500's peak-to-trough decline was a more modest 19%. This history shows that when markets turn, Amazon can fall harder and faster than its peers. Beyond market-wide shocks, the company faces significant company-specific risks. A primary concern is its massive capital expenditure. Since 2022, Amazon has invested a colossal $257 billion in CapEx. This is a high-stakes gamble, and a critical question looms: What if these massive investments don't yield the returns investors expect? Simultaneously, the explosive growth of its core profit driver, AWS, could be threatened by intense competition from rivals like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. A slowdown in AWS growth, combined with concerns over the payback on its huge investments, could create a challenging scenario. For a deeper dive into these risks, including the factors that could cause a severe downturn, we've captured a full downside scenario in our separate analysis: How Amazon Stock Falls By 50%? See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful, of stocks. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The AI bubble may be about to pop — here’s what MIT’s 95% failure stat means

The AI bubble might be closer to bursting than anyone wants to admit. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The AI market is undeniably booming. The six companies at the top of the world's valuation index, including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Meta, are all deeply invested in AI in some form, and it seems like US stock markets are largely being held afloat by the unbelievable profits raked in by the firms. NVIDIA, the company supplying the world with an estimated 90% of the specialized GPUs required in AI data centers, recently became the first company to hit (and surpass) a $4 trillion market valuation. Microsoft also passed the $4 trillion valuation milestone roughly a week later, and it has invested a massive sum in OpenAI, its ChatGPT LLM, and Windows 11's Copilot AI assistant. Despite all of the promises and hypotheses from major AI players as to what their technology will unleash on the world, for good or for bad, tech trends and major studies have increasingly pointed to the AI boom being one massive bubble that will rival (or surpass) the dot-com era. A new report published by MIT's NANDA initiative — a program designed to help develop a "true internet of AI agents" — suggests that only about 5% of AI pilot programs actually make it beyond the incubation stage (via Fortune). A new report published by MIT's NANDA initiative suggests that only about 5% of AI pilot programs actually make it beyond the incubation stage. MIT's research involves surveys and interviews with hundreds of employees and heads of firms, as well as outside analysis of hundreds of AI pilot programs that may or may not have found success before completely stalling out. What are those other 95% of AI pilot programs doing to fail? MIT's report suggests that it's the enterprise sector and its inability to easily adapt to AI tools that's the issue, rather than a lack of quality in the offered AI models. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. As Fortune points out, resource misallocation is also a cause, with "more than half of generative AI budgets" being spent on marketing tools rather than what makes the most money — using AI to automate and streamline. MIT's paper arrives about a month after a report from Gartner predicted that "at least 30% of generative AI projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025." When nearly every AI pilot winds up a cautionary tale, the most exceptional successes now stand out, not because they cracked some secret algorithm, but because they treated AI like any other high-stakes investment. The 5% that succeed start with a problem worth solving. Successful companies are not after generative AI because it's trendy, but because they are chasing inefficiencies or opportunities with measurable upside. That means setting KPIs (key performance indicators) before a line of code is written and attaching those metrics directly to revenue, cost savings, or reduced risk. They also build for adoption, not just proof-of-concept glory. Good pilots are built to fit in with what already exists with as little friction as possible, and the step from "pilot" to "production" should feel effortless. Finally, they have champions at every level—from engineers who can iterate rapidly to executives who appreciate their strategic value and are willing to protect the project from short‑term budget cutbacks. That cross-functional alignment maintains momentum when early results are messy and is usually the difference between a pilot that scales and one that stalls. In short, the successful 5% aren't just lucky. They are disciplined, purposeful, and relentlessly focused on business outcomes. Following the release of the MIT NANDA paper, tech stocks in the US shed about $1 trillion worth of value over the course of four days. The main culprit? Overevaluation of AI companies that have no problem sucking up billions of dollars in investments, with meager results to show. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — creator of the most popular AI model, ChatGPT — didn't help the situation. Five days earlier, The Verge interviewed Altman and quoted him as saying that AI is in a bubble. When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth. If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Altman's comments arrived following the disastrous rollout of OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5. GPT-5, which Altman hyped to incredible heights, was so bad that it forced OpenAI to resurrect older models, including GPT-4o. The catch? GPT-4o is no longer free, forcing users to pay a monthly subscription to return to what they viewed as the superior AI model. OpenAI's failure to live up to its GPT-5 promises didn't come out of nowhere. A report from 2024 suggested that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic had hit a wall in terms of developing advanced AI models. Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates, predicted in 2023 that this type of plateau seen with GPT-5 would play out at some point. Consumer perception is not only a PR problem; it's a measure of survival. Now, AI is caught up in a hype wave that's half excitement, half suspicion. Each over‑promised rollout (hello there, GPT‑5) erodes public trust. When users feel like they're beta-testing half-baked technology, they're less likely to stick around — and less likely to rave about it within their companies or networks. Gary Marcus, a psychologist, cognitive scientist, and AI researcher who publishes the "Marcus on AI" Substack and newsletter — of which I've been an avid reader for the past 16 months — has also been sounding the AI bubble alarm for several years. A recent entry published August 20 from Marcus highlights the MIT NANDA study, stock market concerns, and the changing temperature surrounding AI firms and their promises. Marcus originally broached the AI bubble subject when OpenAI was still working with GPT-2, positing that the economics of AI simply don't make sense. As Marcus says, "But until recently enthusiasm kept rising and rising, no matter what I said." But then we all saw what happened with GPT-5; Altman spent years promising the moon, and in the end, long overdue, didn’t even come close to delivering. A lot of people took note. Leading figures in the AI world haven't been shy about laying out the destruction that AI will bring to white collar job sectors and even to humanity itself. And there's certainly the potential for this sort of dystopian future to arrive. But as I (and many others) have begun to suspect, these prosthelytizations could be more for the sake of bolstering hype and investments than accurate warnings of the future. AI has the potential to do great things, and I don't imagine it's going anywhere in the near future. But is there an inflating bubble that's threatening now more than ever to pop? Absolutely. What are your thoughts on the recent MIT study and the implications it has on the AI market? Is AI overhyped and in a massive bubble? Let me know in the comments section below!

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN: BMNR) has surged 600% year-to-date, holding the world’s largest corporate Ethereum position of 1.7 million ETH valued at $8 billion. This far exceeds other corporate ETH holders, giving the company unmatched leverage to Ethereum price movements. With continued purchases underscoring management’s conviction, traditional metrics like revenue or margins become secondary—this is pure cryptocurrency exposure on a massive scale. But can the stock double again from here? The answer is yes. Below, we outline the potential drivers behind such a move. That said, if you want upside potential with less volatility than an individual stock, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering more than 91% returns since inception.

BitMine’s holding of 1.7 million ETH provides interesting opportunities, including strategic initiatives and institutional partnerships, that smaller holders cannot achieve. Ongoing purchases reinforce management’s confidence and bolster its leverage with crypto infrastructure providers. For the stock to double, two factors must align: Ethereum must appreciate in value, and the company must manage its treasury effectively. While the upside is immense, the risks scale equally. For instance, the stock once lost 88% of its value during the 2022 downturn. Ultimately, BitMine delivers unmatched Ethereum exposure through the public markets. But success depends almost entirely on the cryptocurrency’s trajectory, not traditional business fundamentals. Keep in mind, investing in individual stocks—especially those tied to cryptocurrencies—carries substantial risk. For broader exposure, explore the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a strong record of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks have typically offered higher returns with less volatility than the benchmark—delivering a smoother ride, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Will AI Be the Next Dot-Com Bubble?

As AI continues to rake in funds despite questions about long-term profitability, some experts are calling for more diversification. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Is it time for investors to slow their AI roll? Some experts think so. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made headlines last week when he described the AI craze as a bubble. Combined with ChatGPT-5’s botched rollout earlier this month and some signs of sliding among tech stocks, that prompted investors to question whether the AI boom is set to go bust in the near future, like the dot-com bubble of the late ’90s. Still, AI-focused ETFs continue to hit the market, with VettaFi listing 48 in its database, and expert outlooks are mixed. “I think it’s important to be aware of the risk,” said Claire Cantalupo, senior market analyst at InvesTech Research. “It doesn’t necessarily mean AI is going to crash tomorrow.” There are a few things to look for when evaluating a possible bubble, Cantalupo said. One is a paradigm shift: a new technology or innovation leading to a surge in optimism and high valuations, with investors losing their sense of risk and reward. Another is “a universal belief that this time is different.” AI could, and probably will, change the world, she added, but it may also be causing inflated valuations that aren’t sustainable. During the dot-com boom, for example, equipment provider Cisco ranked as a major player, briefly becoming the world’s most valuable company with a market cap topping $500 billion. But it lost 90% of its value in the two years after the bubble burst in 2000. “The unfortunate reality is the top 10 companies in the S&P make up 40% of it by market capitalization,” Cantalupo said. “So investors who think they’re diversified by investing in index funds are actually far more exposed to just a small basket of stocks than they think they are.” Other potential indicators that the AI boom is a bubble include: Artificially Sweet. The S&P 500 continues to climb because of a few tech stocks — Nvidia, Meta and others — with massive AI projects. The projects could lead to too much hype, said Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. Meta, for instance, has reportedly offered huge compensation packages to AI engineers that could lose value if the company’s stock falls. Still, Colello expressed optimism, based in part on continued demand for Nvidia’s products. “Certainly, there will be businesses that fail to live up to lofty valuations and times where AI expands too quickly,” he said. “However, we don’t think these dynamics are plaguing the large AI leaders just yet.” There isn’t an ETF for everything, but the volume of leveraged products coming to market shows a strategy of filling any voids. Cash is king, but income-generating mutual funds and ETFs are increasingly being used for clients, Nasdaq found. The company’s massive asset moves may, in part, reflect institutional investors’ entry into the industry, particularly crypto. Meg Ryan, a lecturer at Harvard with a background in military law, will take over next month as director of the SEC Division of Enforcement. The latest ETFs from F/m Investments and Compoundr help institutional investors avoid taxes on income distributions. Crypto assets are increasingly available as spot ETFs like IBIT, and investors may have a fear of missing out, despite the volatility. ETF volatility plays a large role in the gap between returns for investors and for funds as a whole, Morningstar data show. A set of Vanguard funds subadvised by Wellington will mark the first active stock-picking ETFs in the company’s fleet. Energy demand is rising globally, in part because of AI use, and a handful of ETFs focused on nuclear energy stand to benefit. Cyclical industries can provide some regularity for ETF investors, but not without downsides. The filing marks President Trump’s latest move to bring his spot bitcoin strategy to the ETF market. Will advisors bite? Following revised jobs reports data, Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics head. His successor choice at the BLS may raise red flags. © 2025 The Daily Upside
