Title: SpaceX, Private Ventures Fuel Elon Musk’s Trillion-Dollar Dreams

Tesla’s sleek cars and futuristic trucks have defined Elon Musk’s public image, but SpaceX is the real engine behind his growing net worth. Jennifer Ablan Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Elon Musk, often described as a modern-day Thomas Edison, may soon add an unprecedented title to his résumé: the world’s first trillionaire. Tesla’s sleek cars and futuristic trucks have defined his public image, but SpaceX is the real engine behind his growing net worth. The buzz around a potential IPO valued at as much as $1.5 trillion for the high-flying government contractor has emerged as the primary swing factor in the entrepreneur’s net worth at the same time that Tesla shareholders have approved a massive, performance-based compensation package that could significantly expand his stake in the electric-car maker. Together, these developments have shifted Musk’s path to extreme wealth from incremental gains to a handful of high-stakes corporate milestones. Musk’s net worth has surged nearly 50% year over year to an estimated $645 billion. In October, he became the first individual to surpass a $500 billion net worth, propelled by rising private-market valuations for SpaceX and renewed confidence in Tesla’s long-term strategy. If Musk meets the aggressive performance targets tied to his Tesla compensation plan, and if SpaceX continues on its current trajectory, he could break the trillion-dollar barrier. Such an accomplishment would test the upper bounds of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, created and named when the idea of a trillionaire still seemed unfathomable and absurd. Now, it no longer does. Already, Musk has been cast front and center, most recently by Forbes, as the maestro of this era’s wealth creation. SpaceX, which has invested aggressively in reusable rockets, launch infrastructure, and satellites, is the single largest lever in the trillionaire equation. Musk owns an estimated 42% of the private rocket and satellite company, which recent secondary share transactions have valued at $350 billion to $800 billion in private markets; that makes his stake worth roughly $136 billion to more than $300 billion on paper today. The real upside comes from long-term growth and the potential for a public offering; if SpaceX lists at valuations some analysts forecast (up to about $1.5 trillion), Musk’s stake alone could exceed $600 billion, reshaping his net worth significantly. Indeed, Starlink has rapidly become the financial backbone of SpaceX. The satellite internet service has added 1 million new customers in under seven weeks, bringing its total to more than 9 million active users across 155 countries and territories, according to the company, implying a growth rate of more than 20,000 new users per day since early November. That momentum caps an explosive year. In December 2024, SpaceX reported 4.6 million Starlink customers; by August 2025, the figure had climbed to 7 million, before accelerating sharply in recent months. The service now operates on a constellation of more than 9,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites, enabling broadband connectivity in rural, maritime, aviation, and defense-critical regions beyond the reach of traditional networks (For my part, I can now use Wi-Fi on routes to and from New York and Hawaii, even over the Pacific Ocean — something that was previously impossible — because of Starlink.) Musk has said Starlink is now “by far” the largest driver of SpaceX’s revenue — a distinction that has materially altered how investors assess the company. While SpaceX and Starlink represent the transformational upside, Tesla remains a critical component of Musk’s wealth trajectory. His 2018 compensation package, revived after the Delaware Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that had voided it, entitles Musk to acquire stock options tied to ambitious operational and market-capitalization milestones. Most of those milestones have already been achieved, giving Musk the right to purchase roughly 304 million Tesla shares at deeply discounted prices, currently valued at approximately $139 billion. Adding to this, Tesla’s shareholders have also approved a new performance-based pay plan, further increasing Musk’s potential upside and consolidating his control over the company. If fully realized, these packages could add hundreds of billions in theoretical value, though the actual gain depends on hitting aggressive targets and on public-market conditions. All told, the new performance plan positions Musk to unlock value as Tesla begins monetizing AI-driven initiatives, including full self-driving, autonomous fleet operations and robotics. In this framework, Tesla serves as an accelerant rather than the primary driver of Musk’s net worth. Its gains are meaningful but incremental, constrained by stock performance, earnings multiples and investor sentiment. SpaceX, by contrast, offers the potential for sudden, transformative gains: an IPO, Starlink expansion or secondary-market repricing could add hundreds of billions almost overnight. “Heading into 2026, this marks a monster year for Tesla and Musk as the autonomous and robotics chapter begins,” analyst Dan Ives writes in his latest report on Top 5 Names to Play the AI Revolution into 2026. “The AI valuation will start to get unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next six to nine months has now begun, with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla’s installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose for Musk & Co. We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year, and in a bull-case scenario, $3 trillion by the end of 2026.” Beyond Tesla and SpaceX, Musk holds stakes in several ventures that extend both financial upside and strategic influence, positioning him across AI, social platforms, neurotechnology and infrastructure: In true “Musk fashion,” the venture was inspired when Musk was stuck in LA traffic. Greg Abel earned Warren Buffett’s trust and, eventually, his job. Here’s what you need to know about Berkshire Hathaway’s new, lower-key CEO. Bitcoin, the No. 1 crypto by market cap, hasn’t recovered from a flash crash, chopping more than $1 trillion from the broader sector’s value. With an estimated half a million workers needed to fill the construction industry’s labor shortages, AI investments this year may get stalled. US automakers General Motors, Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) and Ford are bracing for slowing sales in 2026 amid rising unemployment. The last three months of 2025 are only the start of a downturn for EV sales: The pace is expected to keep slowing next year. Despite initial concern from motorists, robotaxi services are finding plenty of passengers as they expand across the country. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs proved they’re still the go-to middlemen for Wall Street deals amid a near-record $4.8 trillion global M&A bonanza Forecasters predict gold’s rally will stretch through December 2026, although one analysis says there’s reason for caution. For the first time since 2018, the Wells Fargo stagecoach is rolling into a new year without the burden of a Federal Reserve asset cap. Commerce Department data released this week showed US GDP rose 4.3% in the third quarter, with the American consumer to thank for it. Despite a recent pickup in dealmaking, the industry is sitting on a backlog of at least 31,000 companies valued at $3.7 trillion. Standout deals included Union Pacific’s $88 billion purchase of Norfolk Southern and the $56.6 billion deal to take Electronic Arts private. © 2026 The Daily Upside

The session was marked by extreme sectoral divergence, with the automobile index surging over 1 per cent on robust December sales data, even as the FMCG sector plunged more than 3 per cent following the imposition of fresh excise duty on cigarettes. The trading day witnessed the narrowest intraday range since September 2025, with the Nifty moving within a mere 84-point band, reflecting subdued participation amid global market holidays and continued foreign institutional investor selling. Market breadth remained neutral with 2,211 stocks advancing against 1,952 declining on the BSE, where 4,335 stocks were actively traded. As many as 144 stocks hit their 52-week highs, while 87 touched their 52-week lows. ITC emerged as the session’s biggest casualty, crashing 9.69 per cent to ₹363.95, wiping out massive investor wealth as cigarette stocks reacted sharply to the new excise duty announcement. Other notable losers included Tata Consumer Products, which declined 1.57 per cent to ₹1,173.30, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories down 1.53 per cent at ₹1,252, Bajaj Finance falling 1.13 per cent to ₹975.60, and ONGC slipping 1.03 per cent to ₹237.90. “The domestic market started the year with a range-bound session and ended slightly higher amid thin trading due to global holidays and continued FII selling,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments Limited. “Sectorally, auto stocks gained on strong December sales, while value buying supported IT stocks. However, overall advances were capped as FMCG stocks declined following the newly imposed excise duty on cigarettes.” The automobile sector provided the session’s bright spot, with Bajaj Auto leading the gainers’ pack with a rally of 2.59 per cent to ₹9,585. Shriram Finance advanced 2.39 per cent to ₹1,020, NTPC climbed 1.99 per cent to ₹336.10, Eicher Motors gained 1.98 per cent to ₹283.55, and Wipro rose 1.52 per cent to ₹267.30, reflecting strong investor appetite for quality stocks backed by solid fundamentals. Broader markets outperformed the benchmark indices, with the Nifty Midcap 100 rising 0.44 per cent to 60,750.45, gaining 265.95 points, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 closed marginally lower by 0.05 per cent at 17,704.90. Among sectoral indices, Nifty Bank gained 0.22 per cent to close at 59,711.55, Nifty Financial Services advanced 0.19 per cent to 27,666.80, and Nifty Next 50 jumped 0.45 per cent to 69,675.40. “Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a range-bound trading session,” noted Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities. “Among sectors, the Auto Index was the top gainer, rallying 1 per cent, whereas the FMCG index corrected sharply, shedding over 3 per cent.” From a technical perspective, analysts maintained a cautiously optimistic outlook. “The zone of 26,200-26,240 will act as an important hurdle for the index,” said Sudeep Shah, Head of Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities. “Any sustainable move above the 26,240 level will lead to a sharp upside rally in the index up to the 26,400 level in the short term.” Looking ahead, market participants expect volatility to pick up as attention shifts to the upcoming third-quarter earnings season and Union Budget expectations. “In the days ahead, Q3 earnings, budget expectations, and global cues such as the India-US trade deal and potential Fed actions are expected to guide market direction, with earnings growth likely to remain the key driver in 2026,” Nair added.

A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton's Susan Wachter explains how inflation, interest rates, and shifting buyer behavior are shaping residential and commercial markets for the coming year. Susan M. Wachter Dan Loney Listen to the podcast. Wharton professor of real estate Susan M. Wachter discusses the outlook for housing and commercial real estate, focusing on inflation trends, interest rates, inventory challenges, and what these forces mean for markets in the year ahead. This episode is part of the “Faculty Predictions” series. Dan Loney: The housing market has had an interesting year in 2025 because of how home prices have reacted to inflation, decisions by the Federal Reserve, and a consumer that has become a bit more cautious. What does this all mean for housing as we head into a new year? We are joined by Susan Wachter, Wharton professor of real estate and of finance. Susan, great to catch up with you. When we do these year-end interviews on real estate, we look at two components — residential and commercial. Let me start with residential. We’ve seen some pricing coming down, there’s still an inventory issue out there, and there’s still lots to talk about in this marketplace. What’s your general sense of where the residential market is at this moment? Susan Wachter: The residential market is being driven by the buyers, who are sidelined. They’re loath to buy. They’re loath to buy because of uncertainties that you’ve just gone through, but also because of the certainty of high interest rates— higher, and longer. Even if they come down some — and [mortgage rates] have come down to 6.3% — much lower than 9% — but it still means a lot of buyers are not qualified. And also, housing prices are still near all-time highs. Therefore we’ve got buyers sidelined, and inventory is increasing somewhat. It’s still lower than before the pandemic. But it’s increasing, which means it’s more of a buyer’s market, and prices are likely to fall — certainly, [to] inflation-adjusted [levels] across the country. But even nominally, we’re likely, in many markets, to see some declines. Loney: Let me ask you about the rate question. It’s something we’ve talked about in years past, but it’s still important in that you still have a large swath of the public that either — when we had the pandemic — either got in at a mortgage rate of 3-3.5%, or they refinanced at that rate at that point. And realistically, they don’t want to get out of that really nice rate. How much of a concern is this longer-term for this industry, that you’re going to have a segment of the population that is more willing to maybe do a DIY project at their current home than look for that new home? Wachter: Well, it’s an impact for the industry. We see it in the builder stocks, which have not recovered to the highs by any means. At the high end, [it has] a little bit. But others, no. So it’s not only concern for builder stocks and profits, but it’s also concern for the overall economy, because it slows mobility. Obviously it’s a concern for the K-shaped economy — the younger households who are not getting in because older households are staying put. And this slows down transactions. That’s really the message for the coming year — another year of slow transactions in the housing sector. Loney: Susan, something interesting that was floated by President [Donald] Trump a few months ago was the idea of a 50-year mortgage. Give us your thoughts on that idea, if it’s viable or not. Wachter: It’s not viable, and you could just look at the number 50. If you purchase your home at 30 and you have 50 years to pay it off, you’re 80. No one wants to go into retirement paying that hefty mortgage bill. So it’s not a solution because of that, and also because mortgage payments are doubled, simply because you’re paying mortgages over a much larger portion of your life. And although the initial mortgage payments are somewhat lower, we don’t know how much lower they are. This is greater risk to the investor — greater inflation risk, and greater in risk of default, because you don’t pay down that balance [soon enough] and build up equity. There’s not much consensus on ideas, but there’s a lot of consensus on this one, and it’s negative. Unfortunately, it’s not going to be the magic bullet. Quite to the contrary, this one just won’t fly. Commercial real estate on the recovery path Loney: Let me switch over to the commercial market. Give us your general thoughts on where the landscape sits on commercial real estate at the moment. Wachter: Commercial [real estate] is healing. And commercial, of course, has gone through two major hits — the major hits of higher interest rates and the work-from-home [trend], which devastated offices. Office is still down from its high by more than 30%. Also, multifamily has excess supply across many markets because of the low rates for builders getting in. And that supply has yet to be absorbed. However, the good news is, I think we’re on the slow march to recovery, and price points have been found. There’s not a huge interest in getting back into real estate. In this market, you’re not going to get the kind of returns that people are betting on in some other markets. But nonetheless, commercial real estate, is on the mend. And it’s not likely to be the source of any downside that’s major, which is good news. Loney: What are some of the areas we need to focus on, then, as commercial real estate continues this recovery? Wachter: Well, there is still a wall of debt coming out of the banking system — the refinancing of commercial mortgages. That needs to go okay. It looks as though that’s being managed. The key answer is the same answer for residential as it is for commercial. It would be good to get those rates down back to more normal, post-World War II, 5% levels. Loney: You’re still at a point where, if you look at a lot of communities right now, there are still lots of properties that are vacant, that are looking to be filled. Wachter: Absolutely. And we’re likely to see that vacancy. It’s not going to be quick and easy to get those properties repurposed. Partially, because it costs money to get that done, and the cost of money is pretty high. So while buy-in is occurring — deals are not exploding, but there are some more, and strategic investors are coming back in — nonetheless, putting a lot of money into these properties. But money is so expensive, that’s not clearly going to happen. However, all that said, the bigger picture is, what’s the remote-work trend, and what’s going to happen to our cities and downtowns of America? They could have been eviscerated. But it looks like that is not [likely in] the long run. The long run, I’m somewhat optimistic about, as with AI and technology, there’s a still a need for the in-person economy. In fact, perhaps increasing need for in-person. And that’s where downtowns shine. Loney: What’s interesting is that with so many companies with remote work, I think everybody expected that firms were going to pare down the size of the properties that they had. Correct me if I’m wrong — I don’t think we’ve seen a massive move by firms to do that. Wachter: There is some. There is some savings that’s happening. There’s some repositioning and some savings. But on the other hand, in some markets, in some industries, there’s an increase in demand. Of course, AI. San Jose, San Francisco are coming back. Those are markets to watch. And New York City, also. Loney: Is there anything then, as you look at real estate, larger scale, that as we turn the calendar to 2026, that really has grabbed your attention — that you want to keep an eye on as we go into the new year? Wachter: Well, actually, it’s the overall economy. It’s the major factors moving the overall economy. It’s inflation, and inflation’s impact on interest rates. That’s the potential positive upside going forward. We’ve seen recently that the inflation numbers — the CPI — came in a little lower. And 2026 may see a continuation of that.
