Title: Tech Stocks That Are Down Today: AMD, Palo Alto Networks, DataDog and Micron Technology

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © alexgo.photography / Shutterstock.com After yesterday’s debacle in which approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization was erased from the stock market, some technology stocks are still hunting a bottom. With the Nasdaq Composite now down 3% for the month of November so far, the AI rally has lost its steam for the time being as the markets wrestle with bullish fundamentals overshadowed by negative headlines. While the selling hasn’t been pretty for the bulls, it does not appear to be over, at least not yet. The following technology stocks – Micron Technology (Nasdaq: MU), Data Dog (Nasdaq: DDOG), Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) and Palo Alto Networks (Nasdaq: PANW) – are heading lower today in a most volatile time to be invested in the U.S. stock market. After sinking as much as 11% in Thursday’s market sell-off, and even dipping below the psychologically sensitive $200 threshold, the bottom has seemingly fallen out in the stock. Today MU stock is down another 3.6%. Investors have been spooked by Micron’s aggressive AI capex plans in which management conceded that its $18 billion plan would face headwinds. Investors are having to get used to these massive balance sheets committed massive amounts of capital to stay in the AI race. Also, profit taking is normal with a stock that has run up over 100% year-to-date. Rosenblatt has a whopping $300 price target on the stock, owing to its massive total addressable market and leaving room for plenty of upside potential. Morgan Stanley analysts are targeting a very bullish $325 stock price with an “overweight” rating. Therefore investors might look to any pullback in the stock as a potentially strategic buying opportunity but not for the faint of heart. After spiraling by 9.5% on Thursday, Datadog is widening its losses today, falling 3.4% as of mid-morning trading. After nearing the $200 level in November, Datadog has taken a step backwards, threatening to fall below the $150-per-share level in recent days. Year-to-date, the stock is up 8.2%, and Wall Street analysts are bullish with an average price target of $218 attached. With OpenAI integration a bullish sign, today’s declines may be technical in nature, as there is no apparent negative catalyst, but the declines are still hitting investor portfolios hard. After losing 7.8% in Thursday’s market downturn, Advanced Micro Devices stock can’t get out of its own way. AMD stock has now dipped below the $200 level, falling a steep 4% in today’s session. AMD clinched its latest all-time high last month when it rose as high as $264 per share, and investors may be taking profits off the table. AMD also has a spot in the coveted OpenAI club, having clinched a recent partnership with the maker of ChatGPT. The consensus is that the stock is worth close to $300 per share, but the ride up is likely going to be bumpy. After falling 7.4% yesterday, Palo Alto Networks is down a further 1.2% today. The cybersecurity company reported earnings and suffered a downgrade by HSBC, which lowered its view on the stock from “hold” to “reduce” with a price target of $157. PANW announced a merger in which it is buying a cloud-management company in a $3.3 billion transaction, which as the buyer could also be weighing on the stock.

Title: Nvidia’s $54B Earnings Test and Fed Minutes Put Best Wallet Token in Play

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Markets are walking a tightrope this week. Nvidia is set to report $54B+ in Q3 revenue, a figure big enough to make or break the AI trade that has driven much of 2025’s risk rally. Futures across stocks and crypto have been drifting as traders wait to see whether the world’s top AI chipmaker can justify its massive valuation and keep the AI narrative alive. Economists expect roughly 50K new jobs, a clear comedown from earlier in the year. A softer payrolls print combined with divided Fed views on further cuts would reinforce the idea that policy is slowly tilting back toward easier conditions, even if inflation is still above target. Bitcoin has already been slapped down to near seven-month lows, roughly 25–30% below its recent peak, in a pullback analysts describe as sentiment-driven rather than structural. If Nvidia smashes expectations and the macro data lean dovish, that combination could flip the switch back to ‘risk-on’ and give both Bitcoin and altcoins room for a sharp relief rally. When that kind of macro reset hits, fresh liquidity doesn’t just chase the majors. It needs rails, wallets, and launchpads that make it easy for new users to move from fiat into crypto, hop across chains, and discover the next wave of tokens. That’s where infrastructure plays come in, and it’s exactly the lane Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is trying to own with a multi-chain wallet, in-app presale access, and a presale that has already raised more than $17.2M at $0.025975 per token with around 76% staking rewards. The current non-custodial wallet landscape is messy. Newcomers juggle multiple apps, seed phrases, and gas settings across chains, while veterans still pay too much in swap fees and miss early-stage deals because everything is fragmented. Best Wallet is designed to stitch that chaos together, and Best Wallet Token is there to help. The app is a true multi-chain wallet, with support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, Base and more, letting users buy, store, deposit, send, and swap thousands of tokens from one interface. Fiat on-ramps are integrated through partners like Onramper to surface aggressive rates and lower card processing costs, which matters when altcoin rotations kick off and every percentage point of friction eats into upside. Security is handled with MPC tech from Fireblocks and cloud backups instead of exposed seed phrases, plus features like 2FA, biometric login, and advanced anti-fraud tooling. That’s aimed squarely at the next wave of users who want self-custody without feeling like they’re one mistyped word away from losing a portfolio. On top sits the $BEST token. Holding $BEST reduces transaction fees when buying or swapping crypto in-app, cuts swap costs across the 330-DEX, 30-bridge routing stack, and boosts rewards on the upcoming Best Card, which plans up to 8% cashback for heavy users. Best Wallet’s launchpad feature also gives $BEST holders early access to the best crypto presales at a ‘Phase 0’ price before wider listings, letting them rotate into new narratives faster and cheaper than users stuck on legacy wallets. This lines up neatly with where the market is heading. Tokenized funds, regulated stablecoins, and payments giants experimenting with on-chain rails all point toward a future where compliant wallets with deep DeFi hooks become the main interface for value transfer. Best Wallet is built to sit in that intersection, connecting regulated stablecoin flows with native DeFi and presale access. As capital trickles back into risk assets, a wallet-plus-token combo that makes multi-chain navigation easy could attract both first-timers and battle-hardened degen traders. Watch $BEST as onboarding demand grows. The presale is currently priced at $0.025975 per token, with more than $17.2M already raised and a sizeable social footprint across X, Telegram, and Discord. Staking is live during the presale, offering 76% APY powered by an 800M-token (8%) allocation dedicated to staking rewards. That lets early buyers immediately put idle tokens to work while the sale is still ongoing, compounding exposure if the token lists into an improving macro backdrop. Learn how to join and stake in our guide to buying $BEST tokens. If Nvidia’s earnings confirm that the AI boom still has legs and the Fed’s tone softens on the back of a weak 50K jobs print, that cocktail could refill the risk-asset punch bowl. In those conditions, a presale-stage wallet token plugged directly into multi-chain liquidity, presales, and stablecoin rails becomes a clear way to get leveraged exposure to the next adoption wave without betting on a single niche sector like meme coins or gaming. Join $BEST before the presale closes. This article is informational only, not investment advice; crypto prices and presale outcomes are highly speculative and capital is at risk.

Title: Nvidia’s $57B Quarter, Bitcoin’s Rebound, And 3 Tokens Aligned With The Next Risk Cycle

Nvidia’s fiscal Q3 numbers didn’t just beat expectations, they detonated them. Revenue came in at $57.01 billion, almost $2B above what Wall Street was pricing in, with a jaw-dropping $51.2 billion from data-center alone. AI spending isn’t easing off the accelerator; it’s compounding like a tech-market feedback loop on steroids. And yes, that matters for crypto. Bitcoin had slipped under $89,000 after a 27% drawdown from its $126K+ peak six weeks ago. But the moment Nvidia’s earnings hit, BTC snapped back above $91,000, and risk appetite started seeping back into the broader market. Traders suddenly remembered that the so-called “AI bubble” looks a lot more like a structural capital cycle than a blow-off top. The pattern is getting hard to ignore: Through 2024 and 2025, the correlation between high-growth tech and Bitcoin has only tightened as both assets increasingly express the same macro trade, long compute, long scarce digital assets, short fiat dilution. So the question isn’t just where Bitcoin goes next, it’s which parts of the crypto stack actually benefit from this returning liquidity. Capital is rotating into assets with real throughput, real user demand, and tangible cash-flow potential, not just shiny narratives. That’s where programmable Bitcoin layers, multi-chain wallet ecosystems, and even high-octane meme assets start to separate. Below, we look at three projects across that spectrum. One aims to fix Bitcoin’s structural limitations. One is positioning itself as the next major wallet-distribution and order-flow engine. And one is pure speculative beta packaged in meme culture, the kind that historically thrives when risk cycles flip from cautious to greedy. Together, they outline how this next phase of the market could unfold across infrastructure, utility, and culture. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as the first Bitcoin Layer 2 to integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), effectively grafting Solana-grade parallel execution onto Bitcoin’s settlement layer. The pitch is simple but powerful: let Bitcoin handle security and finality, while an SVM-powered L2 processes everything that requires speed, throughput, and programmability. That architecture directly targets Bitcoin’s three long-running frictions: slow block times, high fees during congestion, and limited support for complex applications. Because the SVM stack has already proven itself at high throughput and ultra-low latency, Bitcoin Hyper aims to deliver sub-second performance to wrapped BTC payments, DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and even gaming environments, without dragging interactions through 10-minute blocks. A decentralized Canonical Bridge manages BTC flow between layers, while SPL-style token support and Rust tooling make it easier for Solana-native developers to deploy dApps that tap into Bitcoin’s liquidity without learning an entirely new stack. Momentum on the fundraising side has been strong. The presale has now raised more than $28.1M, placing it among the larger early-stage Bitcoin L2 launches, with tokens currently priced at $0.013305. Recent on-chain activity shows four whale wallets accumulating roughly $532K, including a $53K single purchase, a sign of early conviction from size-on-chain buyers. Those looking to position early can explore how to buy $HYPER, while long-term analysts may want to revisit the latest Bitcoin Hyper price prediction to understand where the project could sit if demand for scalable BTC layers continues to build. Join the $HYPER presale now. If Bitcoin Hyper is a bet on Bitcoin becoming a high-performance settlement engine, Best Wallet is a bet on controlling the front door that users walk through to access that ecosystem. Its pitch is bold: capture a massive share of the wallet market by the end of 2026 by merging security, presale access, liquidity routing, and a smoother user experience into a single interface. The stack behind it is surprisingly serious. Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP architecture at the wallet layer, the same institutional-grade key management used by major exchanges, then layers on portfolio analytics, presale discovery, and Rubic-powered DEX aggregation. In a market where users hop between Bitcoin L2s, Ethereum rollups, Solana, and Base within the same session, routing matters. If a wallet controls where swaps, bridges, and presale entries originate, its native token can effectively tax that flow via fee rebates, yield boosts, or future governance over routing paths. Traction has also been strong. The Best Wallet presale has raised $17.22M+ so far, with tokens currently priced around $0.025975. Staking utilizes a dynamic APY model (currently 76%), adjusting rewards based on demand, lock durations, and liquidity conditions. This mechanism is designed to prevent runaway emissions and keep incentives responsive as volumes shift. If the next cycle brings another wave of retail onboarding as Bitcoin pushes toward or past its highs, the wallets that sit closest to user intent become some of the most leveraged positions in the ecosystem, and Best Wallet is aiming directly at that layer. For traders mapping out the potential upside, our Best Wallet token price prediction offers useful context on how its market share ambitions could translate into value. Explore Best Wallet’s roadmap and presale details. SPX6900 ($SPX) lives on the far end of the spectrum: a meme-driven ERC-20 that blends parody, market cynicism, and pure speculative energy into a single ticker. It primarily runs on Ethereum but extends across Solana and Base via Wormhole, providing multichain liquidity and cross-community reach. Circulating supply sits near 930M SPX, supported by deflationary burn mechanics that lean into the “engineered scarcity” meme. The token’s breakout moment came in early 2024 when it briefly crossed the $1.5B market-cap milestone before cooling toward the mid-hundreds of millions, still enough to hover near the top-100 bracket and sit shoulder-to-shoulder with established meme heavyweights.] Its culture centers on satire, speed, and collective in-jokes rather than utility, but that’s precisely why traders watch it. In risk-on windows, especially when AI stocks rip or Bitcoin reclaims momentum, SPX tends to act as a volatility amplifier. Liquidity often rotates from majors into meme assets with cross-chain presence, and SPX’s ties to Project AEON NFTs give it extra surface area for speculative flows. Track SPX6900 across major exchanges and analytics dashboards. Explore Bitcoin Hyper now.
