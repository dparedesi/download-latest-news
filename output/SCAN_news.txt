Title: Who do Cooper Flagg, Dylan Harper compare to? NBA player comps for 2025's top 6 draft prospects
URL: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/who-do-cooper-flagg-dylan-harper-compare-to-nba-player-comps-for-2025s-top-6-draft-prospects/

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Comparison is the death of joy … but you have to wonder if Mark Twain would stick to that tune if the NBA Draft were around back then. For draft fans, player comps can in fact be the root of joy. While no comp is ever perfect, it provides a context for fans to quickly familiarize themselves with prospects in a fun way. Don't kid yourself -- real NBA decision-makers also participate in such activities. Again, it's about context but also precedence. If you're projecting a prospect to the next level and trying to figure out what role they'll be able to play, it's only natural to ask yourself if similar players have had success in that role. So, with the 2025 NBA Draft now little more than three weeks away and with six prospects most commonly being mocked in the top half of the lottery, here are the player comps to help prepare you for draft night and shed some light on what front offices may be contemplating. Kirilenko was my comp for Flagg coming into the season. A game-changing defender off-ball, with versatility on the ball at 6-foot-9, he approached nearly 5 stocks (steals + blocks) per game in his prime and had a rare ability to stuff all columns of the stat sheet. Offensively, he could impact winning without needing to the be the focal point, but was capable of being a very good secondary threat, if not a consistent shooter. While the validity of this comp still holds on the defensive end, Flagg has outgrown AK-47's offensive correlation. Coming into the year at Duke, we had two questions about Flagg: the consistency of the shooting (both from an accuracy and mechanical standpoint) and the self-creation. He addressed those by continuing to elevate his game and making glaring progress throughout the season, to the point where he shot over 40% from behind the arc in ACC play. He still tends to have two different releases -- a set shot when spotting up and a true jump shot when shooting on the move or off the dribble -- so there are some lingering questions, but not nearly to the same extent. There's also much more optimism that he can be a primary scoring option in the NBA, and yet his game -- specifically his passing and natural unselfishness -- is ideal to complement another alpha scorer. This is where the Pippen comp comes in. He looks like he can headline an offense, but whether that's the offense of an NBA championship caliber team is still to be determined. Harper is a big lead guard, measuring in at just under 6-foot-6 with shoes on and a massive wingspan that eclipses 6-foot-10. He has terrific natural instincts and feel for the game that manifest itself with floor vision, timing, and creative footwork. All of that helps him compensate for the fact that he is neither a totally knockdown three-point shooter, nor a dynamic vertical athlete. He came into college viewed as a combo-guard, capable of playing on or off the ball. While that versatility will translate to the next level as well, he was the full-time point guard at Rutgers and now is most natural as a primary initiator, which makes a potential fit for guard-stocked San Antonio at No. 2 overall questionable. Our description of Harper is reminiscent of Cunningham, who was just a bit bigger, but from a very similar archetype when he came into the league. He's made strides with his shooting, as Harper should be capable of doing, while simultaneously maintaining his ability to make plays for himself and others with his instincts and mental acuity for the game. Many believe that Harper has a similarly bright future, but durability will be a key variable, as it has been for Cunningham. This past season was the first time in his four-year career that he's played 70 games and he responded with his first All-NBA season. In late December of his senior year, Bailey's McEachern High School team traveled to New Jersey to play in an event at Rutgers' Jersey Mikes Arena. The future Scarlet Knight delivered a 40-point 21-rebound performance that was one for the ages, and was streamed directly by the NBA. It was on that night that Tracy McGrady comparisons were born. While those may be mocked now, to see it in person was to see the validity. The 6-foot-9 wing soared for numerous incredible dunks and simultaneously put on a tough shot-making show. This year at Rutgers there were more undeniable highs (39 points at Indiana, 37 at Northwestern), but not the overall consistency to perpetuate comps to one of the NBA's all-time great wing scorers. So his comp drops several rungs. Nonetheless, Bailey still has a combination of wing size, athleticism, and shot-making that gives him undeniable upside. His assist-to-turnover numbers are concerning and his inability to put more pressure on the rim in the halfcourt is somewhat surprising given his athletic tools. Porter had that same overlap of size, shooting and athleticism, along with similar measurables, and even some of the same concerns such as assist-to-turnover ratio and lack of blow-by in the halfcourt. Bailey's range of outcomes is perhaps wider than any other player in the top 6, but Porter's path provides a clear template that could lead to long-term success and impacting winning. Victor Oladipo was once known as an undersized wing who compensated for a lack of skill and positional size with extreme length, athleticism, and the high-motor. Edgecombe too was much more of a wing than true guard in high school and known for his extreme athleticism and two-way competitiveness. We saw him make notable strides with his guard skills during the course of his season at Baylor, but that process is one that will need to be on-going. He measured in at 6-foot-4 without shoes with a 6-foot-7 wingspan. By comparison, he's a little bigger than Oladipo, but not quite as long. The athletic similarities aren't just based on their high-flying athleticism, but the sheer force and explosiveness they can utilize in to cover the court and explode downhill. Edgecombe, like Oladipo, not only has to keep polishing and expanding his ball-skills and ability to make reads, but he has a chance to weaponize his physical gifts on the defensive end of the floor. He's not yet quite as far along as advertised on that end, particularly off the ball, but the potential is there, both from a physical and mental perspective. Johnson is a potent scorer and tough shot-maker. He's been that since high school. There was little doubt he was going to be given an opportunity to put up numbers this year at Texas, but the big question centered around his efficiency and ability to impact winning in the process. There was a very similar narrative for Thomas when he arrived at LSU in 2019. He went on to put up 23 points on 17 shots per game for a team that went 19-10. Since then, his scoring prowess has continued to ascend in the NBA, but questions persist about whether his spurt bucket-getting can drive winning. Conversely, Johnson put up 20 points this year on 16 shots per game, but exceeded expectations when it came to his overall efficiency. His 43/40/87 shooting splits were more than respectable, especially for a freshman that was the top priority for opposing defenses on a nightly basis. He also made clear gains with his passing this year. It was the combination of that unexpected efficiency, albeit amidst steady volume, along with the gains in his processing that has helped him surge up draft boards. There is optimism Johnson can be an instant-offense type scorer like Thomas, but if the growth we saw this season continues, there may be a path for him to be even more than that. Knueppel may not be the 6-foot-8 that Duke listed him at this year. In reality, he's 6-foot-5 without shoes on with a wingspan just over 6-foot-6. In short (no pun intended), he's not very long or athletic, but is still one heck of a basketball player. Knueppel is skilled and smart. He's a shooter and floor-spacer who thrived as a floor-spacer secondary playmaker for Duke this year and even may have had more primary playmaking potential than he got to show running alongside Flagg all year. All of that is on par with what we've seen from Austin Reaves in recent years, as he took on a bigger role than expected right away for the Lakers and has seen his output grow with each passing year because of his ability to both play off more dynamic individual talents, but then have spurts where he can carry a second-unit. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Title: Sodium azide mutagenesis induces a unique pattern of mutations
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634

The nature and effect of mutations are of fundamental importance to the evolutionary process. The generation of mutations with mutagens has also played important roles in genetics. Applications of mutagens include dissecting the genetic basis of trait variation, inducing desirable traits in crops, and understanding the nature of genetic load. Previous studies of sodium azide-induced mutations have reported single nucleotide variants (SNVs) found in individual genes. To characterize the nature of mutations induced by sodium azide, we analyze whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 11 barley lines derived from sodium azide mutagenesis, where all lines were selected for diminution of plant fitness owing to induced mutations. We contrast observed mutagen-induced variants with those found in standing variation in WGS of 13 barley landraces. Here, we report indels that are two orders of magnitude more abundant than expected based on nominal mutation rates. We found induced SNVs are very specific, with C → T changes occurring in a context followed by another C on the same strand (or the reverse complement). The codons most affected by the mutagen include the sodium azide-specific CC motif (or the reverse complement), resulting in a handful of amino acid changes and few stop codons. The specific nature of induced mutations suggests that mutagens could be chosen based on experimental goals. Sodium azide would not be ideal for gene knockouts but will create many missense mutations with more subtle effects on protein function. Sodium azide is frequently used as a mutagen for experimental studies in plants. It induces primarily C → T changes. We find that these most often occur when a cytosine (C) is followed by another cytosine. In coding sequence, this results in a limited yet distinct set of amino acid alterations that differ from natural variants in barley. Notably, harmful mutations prevalent in sodium azide-treated samples include glycine to aspartic acid and proline to serine, while untreated landraces exhibit distinct sets of putatively harmful changes. The mutated lines demonstrate an average yield reduction of 37.7% due to induced single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels), which disrupt numerous coding variants. Although detecting putative deleterious mutations is straightforward, discerning the individual impact of these variants remains complex. However, advancements in understanding the context of these mutations may facilitate the training of machine-learning models to predict and rank their effects, ultimately benefiting plant and animal breeding and research on complex human diseases. The findings suggest that the occurrence of specific mutations induced by chemical mutagens can be anticipated, enhancing our comprehension of mutagen-induced genetic diversity and its phenotypic implications.

The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or manuscript preparation. Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Mutagens can quickly generate novel, heritable genetic variation for identifying gene function when naturally occurring variation will not suffice. Sodium azide (NaN3), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), and fast neutron (FN) radiation have been the most commonly used mutagens in plants. Sodium azide and EMS are chemical mutagens expected to cause point mutations [1]. FN is known for generating many large structural variants and small indels (especially deletions) that generate frameshifts that disrupt gene function [2,3]. Mutagenizing agents have been used in many species to create knockouts or knockdowns of individual genes to understand gene function [4]. Despite decades of active use [5,6] and growing interest in the applications of mutagenesis [7,8], the characterization of the nature of the mutations generated has been limited [9]. More generally, the number of studies examining the effects of mutagens at the nucleotide sequence level is limited [1,3,10,11]. The nature and context in which mutations occur are essential determinants of their likely functional impact [12,13]. Recently reported efforts to employ sodium azide mutagenesis on a massive scale (500,000 mutated lines) clarify the need for an improved understanding of the number and types of mutations likely to be generated [7]. We can characterize induced mutations by comparing newly generated (de novo) mutations to variants occurring naturally in untreated lines. However, there are essential considerations to minimize false positives when distinguishing between induced mutations and existing variants. One challenge with identifying induced de novo changes is that the mutations are always a mixture of induced de novo and spontaneously occurring mutations [13]. The experimental design necessary to study induced mutations in plant populations requires multiple generations of seed bulking before the mutagenesis treatment and several generations in which new mutations are made homozygous in inbred lines; thus, multiple generations in which new spontaneous variants can arise [3]. Mutagenesis experiments often use multiple generations of self-fertilization to ensure that mutations are meiotically heritable [14]. Mutagen dosage also affects the nature of observable mutations, with an effective dosage of mutagens defined by the LD50, or lethal dose for 50% of the treated sample, which results in the death of half the individuals. Of course, this creates significant attrition due to lethal mutations, resulting in some mutations or combinations that cannot be observed directly. Observable mutations are less damaging, allowing the plant to survive and reproduce. New mutations, whether induced or naturally occurring, are more likely to be harmful than segregating variants subject to generations of natural (purifying) selection. More potentially harmful changes are observed among newer mutations in very deep resequencing panels [15] and induced mutations [3]. Newer mutations tend to include more changes of large effect, including nonsynonymous variants, changes in start and stop codons, intron splicing variants, and frameshifts [16,17]. Comparative approaches using phylogenetic constraint have been used for decades to predict which mutations are more likely to harm the organism [18,19]. More recent studies of induced mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana suggest that these approaches accurately identify phenotype-changing variants and are more likely to have a major effect on organismal fitness [20]. Thus, predicting the harmfulness of mutations has the potential to identify the nature of variants most likely to impact organismal fitness or yield in crops [21–23]. In barley, sodium azide primarily generates cytosine-to-thymine changes [24]. More recent studies have determined that mutagens create unique suites of mutations and that these mutations typically occur in a specific, immediate nucleotide context [1,13]. This observation is important because the nature of mutations, particularly when they occur predominantly in the presence of flanking motifs, can determine their relative effect. For example, C → T transitions, particularly in specific local sequence contexts, may limit the potential for mutagens to generate premature stop codons, even when the reverse complement of a mutation motif is considered. [24] identified sodium azide mutations in the barley Ant18 gene, finding that A.T → G.C base-pair transitions were most frequently generated. However, resequencing this single barley gene does not capture the effects of sodium azide at the whole-genome scale. In the present study, we examine sodium azide-induced mutations in 11 mutagenized lines of Morex, the barley variety used as the primary reference genome [25]. We also generated whole-genome sequence for a sample of the Morex seed stock used for mutagenesis. In addition to single nucleotide changes, we find evidence of sequence insertions and deletions (indels) private to each mutagenized line. Mutations identified in sodium azide-treated lines were compared to variants in 13 barley landrace samples subject to whole-genome sequencing. To understand the nature of mutations induced by sodium azide, we address the following questions: 1) What is the nature of the variants induced by the mutagen? More specifically, does sodium azide tend to generate SNPs, indels, or other types of structural variants? 2) What is the observed mutation rate in sodium azide-treated samples in barley? 3) Do induced variants differ in type or predicted effect from variants occurring in untreated individuals? and 4) Is a greater number of harmful mutations associated with a reduction in yield in barley? Data collected and analyzed in the present study includes three distinct datasets. First, we used multiple resequencing datasets to identify differences in our Morex samples and the Morex reference genome. This included new Illumina paired-end data with 10X Genomics linked reads, as well as both new and previously published Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and published Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequence [25] (Tables 1 and S1). A second data set included lines treated with sodium azide that were resequenced with Illumina paired-end data; for a subset of these lines also generated linked reads and ONT DNA sequencing data (S1 Table). We used this data to identify single nucleotide and structural variant differences between our Morex line published Morex_v3 reference genome [25]. We then identified mutations in lines subject to mutagenesis. For contrast between variants in mutagen-treated lines and naturally occurring variants, we used Illumina paired-end data to identify spontaneous variants in 13 barley landraces. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.g001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.t001 A major challenge in isolating de novo variants induced by the mutagen treatment is the need to distinguish between variants present in the mutagenized seed stock (i.e., Morex) and those that arise during mutagenesis. Heterogeneity, genetic variation within an inbred cultivar or variety, can contribute large numbers of variants [26] that are not due to the mutagen. Experimental contamination through unintended hybridization [3,27] can also contribute to large numbers of variants (S1 Fig). Mutagen-induced variants are expected to be relatively rare, requiring filtering of the variants that account for: (1) differences between the parental line used for mutagenesis and the reference genome, (2) uncallable regions (see Materials & Methods) that include genomic regions with unknown nucleotide state in the reference, or the regions where sequence reads do not align uniquely, and (3) heterogeneity among lines (S2 and S3 Figs). We identified callable portions of the genome that were 820 Mb and 817 Mb (the latter excludes low complexity sequence) relative to the 4.2 Gb genome size for Morex_v3 [25]. Callable regions capture 88% of high-confidence (HC) genes (31,625 HC genes out of 35,827 total HC genes) in the Morex_v3 reference genome. No individuals in our experiment show an excess of variants, runs of variants, or high heterozygosity consistent with recent hybridization [27]. Differences between the Morex_v3 reference genome and our Morex sample are mutations that have arisen in individual seed stocks, errors in the reference assembly, or errors in variant calling. To address these issues, we generated 10X Genomics-based resequencing with 46x and an ONT data set with 5x average mapped read coverage (S1 Table). We identified 52,596 SNPs, 8,203 1-bp indels (insertions and deletions), 3,182 indels ranging in size from 2-204 bp, and 53 deletions ranging from 41 bp - 60 Kbp that survived rigorous filtering (S2 and S3 Figs). Filtered ONT variant calls include 68 insertions and 42 deletions. Using published ONT (at 85x coverage) and PacBio data (at 27x coverage) sampled from 100 seedlings [25] (Table 1) that were incorporated in the Morex_v3 assembly, we detected an additional 178 insertions and 93 deletions that were excluded from callable regions. Reference-based read mapping, variant calling in GATK [17,28,29], and filtering of the 11 M5 mutagenized lines identified 23,339 SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variants) with an observed transition to transversion ratio (Ts/Tv) = 5.24. This compares to a ratio of Ts/Tv = 1.7 previously reported based on resequencing of naturally occurring variants in barley [17]. Among mutagenized lines, we also identified 5,376 smaller indels ranging in size from 1 - 296 bp for 28,715 variants potentially induced by the mutagen (Fig 1A). Here, we use SNV (Single Nucleotide Variants) to identify variants generated during mutagenesis and SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) to identify variants segregating in the non-mutagenized population. Each variant is private to a mutagenized plant (i.e., occurs in only a single individual). There was an average of 2,122 SNVs and 489 indels per mutated sample, with more indels identified in 10X Genomics samples utilizing linked reads (Fig 1B and Table 2). Those numbers are much higher (17x and 139x) than estimates of the average number of mutations that would spontaneously arise in the absence of a single-generation of sodium azide treatment. Those estimates were calculated as below (see Materials & Methods). Using the mean nucleotide substitution rate estimate of 6.5 x 10-9 base substitutions per site per generation from [30] and accounting for our experimental design, we expect ~124 SNVs per individual in the 4.2 Gbp genome. For indels, we expect ~3.5 indels per individual to arise without the mutagen treatment based on an average indel mutation rate of 0.45 x 10-9 for 1–3 bp indels and 0.5 x 10-9 for >3 bp indels [30]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.t002 The ONT sequence and 10X Genomics linked reads of the same three mutagenized lines improved the detection of larger structural variants (SVs). No inversions passed the filtering criteria, and a set of high-quality duplications could not be identified; thus, structural variant calling focused on insertions and deletions. The SVs detected in the 10X Genomics data set included 52 deletions ranging from 41 bp to 60 Kbp (S4 Fig). ONT reads for three samples (S1 Table) were generated to validate the larger structural variants identified in the 10X Genomics data. The average ONT mapped read coverage was 3.4x (S1 Table). A total of 86 insertions (36–4,786 bp) and 26 deletions (36–300 bp) were called by Sniffles2; 8 insertions (21–172 bp) and 6 deletions (16–116 bp) were called by cuteSV (S4 and S5 Figs). These ONT calls provided direct sequence read-based confirmation of two larger deletion calls that were also called based on the 10X Genomics data set. For comparison, we generated whole-genome resequencing of 13 barley landraces [31]. Average coverage ranged from 41 - 93x (S1 Table), and after variant calling and quality filtering, we identified a total of 6.7 million SNPs with Ts/Tv = 1.74 and 849,618 indels ranging in size from 1 - 388 bp. Out of the 6,746,637 SNPs, 2,277,853 SNPs were categorized as rare (i.e., non-reference allele count of two or less, the allele was identified in one or two genotypes) with Ts/Tv = 1.71 and 4,468,784 were common (i.e., non-reference allele count of three or higher) with Ts/Tv = 1.76 (Fig 1A). Rare variants were compared to de novo variants in the treated lines because they have experienced fewer generations of selection, and their mutational spectrum is likely more similar to that in treated lines. SNPs in untreated samples are primarily transitions, particularly C → T* (Fig 2), where the notation C → T* includes the reverse complement G → A. Partitioning variants in the untreated samples into “rare” or “common” had a limited effect on the proportion of variants among each class, with a slight skew of rare variants to more C → T* transitions and fewer A → G*. Variants in sodium azide-treated lines were dominated by C → T* transitions, which comprised 79.1% of all SNVs in the mutagenized lines (Fig 2). Each bin includes the reverse complement. For example, the C → T* bin also includes G → A changes. Each bin includes the reverse complement. For example, the C → T* bin also includes G → A changes. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.g002 Single base pair changes dominate insertion and deletion variants, particularly in sodium-azide treated lines, constituting 28.3% of insertions and 36.4% of deletions (Fig 3). The pattern of indels in treated lines is similar to that in rare and common variants in standing variation. Notable differences include more 1- and 2-bp deletions and 1-bp insertions in treated lines (Fig 3). The 53 larger deletions (41 bp - 60 Kbp) called in the 10X Genomics data set represent roughly 1.7% of all 3,135 deletions in the mutated lines. Linked and long read sequencing was not possible for the landrace lines, precluding a direct comparison. Insertions are shown as positive values and deletions are shown as negative values. Only variants with lengths <20 bp are shown here. Insertions are shown as positive values and deletions are shown as negative values. Only variants with lengths <20 bp are shown here. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.g003 In mutated samples, 9.7% of SNVs and 8.9% of indels occur in genic regions (S6 Fig). The percentage of variants in genic regions is lower in untreated lines for rare and common variants. Rare variants had 6.5% SNPs and 1.7% indels occurring in genic regions and are more directly comparable with mutated sample SNVs and indels. Variant Effect Predictor (VeP) [32] identified most sodium azide-induced variants as occurring in intergenic regions or genomic regions up or downstream of genes. A larger proportion of variants were found in intergenic regions among induced variants than in untreated lines. Fewer sodium azide-induced SNVs and indels were adjacent to genes (S7 and S8 Figs). Sodium azide-treated lines have a slightly higher proportion of missense variants (3.86%) than untreated lines (2.19% Rare, 2.32% Common), but this effect is small. Slight increases in the proportion of start-stop-related changes (0.2% Mutated, 0.09% Rare, and 0.07% Common) and splice donor and acceptor sites are also observed (0.09% Mutated, 0.01% Rare, and 0.01% Common). However, these variants are considered the most potentially damaging based on VeP categorization (S7 and S8 Figs). Larger deletion variants (41 bp - 60 Kbp) detected among the three lines with linked reads disrupt a genic region in 11.3% of cases (6 out of 53 total). On average, sodium azide-treated lines include 78.6 nonsynonymous SNVs per sample, with 865 nonsynonymous SNVs identified among the 11 mutated lines (S9 Fig). Estimates of putative variant effects based on phylogenetic constraints [20] were used to identify potentially damaging nonsynonymous variants among primary transcripts in the barley genome. This analysis includes missense variants (a change in amino acid), start lost, stop gained, and stop lost variants based on the Sequence Ontology definition of nonsynonymous changes [33]. For the 11 mutated lines, 611 nonsynonymous mutations in primary transcripts were tested for phylogenetic constraint relative to 72 other angiosperms to identify potentially universally harmful mutations. Among the successfully annotated mutations, 155 (35.9%) were annotated as “harmful” (i.e., putatively deleterious), while the remaining 277 (64.1%) were identified as “tolerated.” This value compares to 9,716 “rare” nonsynonymous variants tested in 13 barley landraces, where 1,633 (13.2%) are identified as “harmful” and 10,693 (86.8%) as tolerated. For “common nonsynonymous variants, 14,537 were tested, where 23,506 (7%) are “harmful,” and 311,121 (93%) are tolerated. An average of 14.1 (± 6.46) deleterious SNVs were identified per mutagenized sample (S10 Fig). Given that these changes at conserved coding positions are frequently phenotype-changing [20], this suggests roughly 14 disrupted SNVs per individual treated line. The ratio of nonsynonymous SNVs (nSNV) to synonymous SNVs (sSNV) in mutated lines is 1.8:1. In comparison, the ratio of nSNVs:sSNVs in rare and common SNP categories is 1.36:1 and 1.22:1, respectively. The proportion of nSNVs inferred to be deleterious was 17.9% in treated lines versus nSNPs at 3.2% in rare and 4.1% in common categories. To standardize results among samples, we identified the number of harmful mutations per codon in 10 Mbp windows. The proportion of dSNPs per codon was lower near the centromeres for rare and common SNPs in the landraces (S11-S13 Figs). Biochemical interactions between mutagenic compounds and DNA produce SNVs in specific nucleotide contexts [13]. We used the program Mutation Motif [9] for all SNVs to examine this effect in sodium azide-treated barley lines. The predominant mutation types in both treated and untreated lines are C → T* changes. In sodium azide-treated lines, the cytosine that changes to thymine is frequently followed by another cytosine, creating a CC context of mutation on the forward strand (Fig 4). To our knowledge, there have not been previous studies on the preferential context of sodium azide mutations. There are highly significant differences between sodium azide-induced variants and variants spontaneously originating in the genome (S2 Table). In untreated lines, the mutated cytosine is generally followed by guanine at the + 1 or +2 site (downstream) from the C, thus resulting in a CG or potentially CGG context in which mutations occur. In the complete 4.2 Gb Morex_v3 genome assembly, the CC, CG (the two bp motif for CpG changes), and CGG motifs occur ~228 million, ~ 154 million, and ~40 million times, respectively. In the 820 Mb region in which unique single nucleotide variants could be called, CC occurs ~48 million times, CG occurs ~35 million times, and CGG motifs occur ~9 million times. This suggests that, on average, a single generation of sodium azide treatment resulted in the mutation of 0.013% of CC sites at which unique mutations could be detected. The CC and CG motifs constitute 5.8% and 4.3% of all two nucleotide combinations in the 820 Mb callable regions, and the CGG motif constitutes 1.1% of three nucleotide combinations. In contrast, AA and TT motifs are the most frequent two nucleotide motifs, making up 8.1%. Position 0 indices where the C → T change occurred. The relative height of the letters indicates their relative entropy (RE), with a higher RE indicating a position has a greater influence on the mutation. Upright letters indicate overrepresented bases, whereas upside-down letters indicate underrepresented bases at positions neighboring position 0. The null expectation (RE of zero) is based on randomly sampling a nearby location with the same starting base (e.g., for a C → T mutation, a random choice of a position with a C is selected. Position 0 indices where the C → T change occurred. The relative height of the letters indicates their relative entropy (RE), with a higher RE indicating a position has a greater influence on the mutation. Upright letters indicate overrepresented bases, whereas upside-down letters indicate underrepresented bases at positions neighboring position 0. The null expectation (RE of zero) is based on randomly sampling a nearby location with the same starting base (e.g., for a C → T mutation, a random choice of a position with a C is selected. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.g004 Amino acid changes identified in sodium azide-treated lines are dominated by those that include the CC or (reverse complement) GG motif (S14 Fig). Glycine to aspartic acid, proline to serine, and alanine to threonine are the three most abundant amino acid changes in SNVs identified as harmful (i.e., deleterious) (Table 3 and S15 Fig). The top four changes in tolerated SNVs (tSNVs) in mutagenized samples are similar to those annotated as harmful; tolerated amino acid changes include alanine to threonine, alanine to valine, glycine to aspartic acid, and proline to serine (Table 3). This contrasts with amino acid changes induced by rare and common variants in standing variation, where transitions associated with CpG are more abundant. For rare and common dSNPs, alanine-to-threonine and alanine-to-valine changes appear at the highest frequencies. The arginine-to-cysteine amino acid change had the third highest frequency in the common dSNPs class and frequently annotates as deleterious. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.t003 A total of 25 mutagenized barley lines self-fertilized for five to seven generations (M5:7) were used for yield testing at one location in the first year (St. Paul, MN) and three locations in Minnesota (Crookston, Lamberton, and St. Paul) in years 2 and 3. Yield testing was performed in the presence of 5–8 check lines (see Materials and Methods) and the original Morex line untreated with the mutagen. Data for heading days after planting (DAP) and plant height were also collected. After spatial adjustment for variation across plots, the average yield for each line was calculated for all years combined. As expected, most mutagenized lines had lower grain yields than the Morex W2017 parental line, with six mutagenized lines yielding roughly the same or slightly higher than the parental line (Fig 5). M29 is among the three lowest-yielding lines and is the only mutagenized line with a visibly distinct phenotype, described as onion-like, short-stature, and very compact (S16 Fig). Mutagenized lines tend to have diminished yield relative to Morex, though some line-by-year combinations slightly exceeded the yield in Morex and some checks (S17 Fig). The average diminution in yield across years and lines for the mutagenized lines was 32.8% relative to the Morex W2017 parent. The heading DAP in mutagenized lines increased by 6.2%, and height was reduced by 15% compared to the Morex W2017 parent line. To determine if observed damaging mutations impacted yield, we compared the relative order of yield to the number of damaging mutations per line. We found a slightly negative but nonsignificant correlation of -0.28 (P = 0.4) between the number of harmful variants and yield (S3 Table). Most mutagenized lines had lower variance across replicates than the check lines. This is likely due to the experimental design with seeds originating from plants that can be traced through single-seed descent following the mutagen treatment, whereas check lines derive from more heterogeneous seed stocks. The box plots are sorted by the median for each line, and the bars in the box plot indicate the mean. Sodium azide-treated lines are represented by red outlines. Red shaded boxes indicate mutated lines that were sequenced in this study. The box plots are sorted by the median for each line, and the bars in the box plot indicate the mean.

It has been frequently used for inducing variants in barley [24,34], including recent reports of extremely large-scale experiments involving the characterization of hundreds of thousands of individual plants [7]. Other mutagens used historically have included X-rays, neutrons, ethylene imine, sulfonates, other chemical mutagens, and various combinations of mutagens [detailed in 35]. However, most studies have focused on the phenotypic effects of mutagenesis [4,36,37] or changes induced at individual genes [24]. The genome-level effects of the mutagen have rarely been examined. Consistent with a prior single gene resequencing study, we find that C → T* transitions dominate induced mutations [7,24,38] (Fig 2). A similar pattern of nucleotide change has been found for ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) induced mutation [10,39]. N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) induced mutations in mice produce primarily A → G* or A → T* mutations [13]. In contrast, C → T* transitions predominate among the variants observed after fast neutron treatment, but with less enrichment relative to other SNVs [3,10]. Sodium azide appears to generate single nucleotide variants primarily. We identify an average of 2,122 SNVs per mutagenized line. This is an ~ 88-fold increase in SNVs compared to expectations in the absence of a single-generation sodium azide treatment (see Materials and Methods for equations 1–6). Induced indels of all sizes are less abundant (Figs 1 and 3) but occur at ~130–140 fold higher rate than nominal mutation rates. The observation of higher indel rates derives from the comparison of data from multiple sequencing platforms, including linked-reads and long-read sequencing, with an average of 489 indels per line in mutagenized M5 lines. The mutations present in M5 lines are necessarily a mixture of induced mutations and mutations that arose spontaneously during line maintenance [13]. However, based on mutation accumulation resequencing studies in Arabidopsis thaliana, the 1–3 bp mutation rate was estimated as an average of 0.45 x 10-9 indels per site per generation, and the large deletions (>3 bp) mutation rate was estimated as 0.5 x 10-9 [30]. In the 820 Mb portion of the barley genome, where variants can be called unambiguously, we expect ~3.5 indels per individual to arise naturally without mutagenesis treatment over the course of the experiment (see Methods for equations 1–6). In the 4.2 Gbp barley genome, we would expect ~18 indels per individual (Fig 1B). This is a ~ 130–140-fold increase in the indel mutation rate of treated lines to an average of 5.13 x 10-7 indels per site per generation. Most sodium azide-induced mutations occur in a specific nucleotide sequence context, as C → T* changes in a CC mutation motif (Fig 4) or the reverse complement. This results in a relatively small number of amino acid changes that predominate among induced mutations. [10] describe similar results for mutations found after EMS or EMS/ENU treatment, where the most common changes within codons produce only a fraction of all possible amino acid changes. In a similar manner, sodium azide-induced amino acid changes are very distinct from most amino acid changes segregating in barley. The amino acid changes that annotate as harmful and predominate in the mutagenized samples are glycine to aspartic acid, proline to serine, and alanine to threonine. In comparison, the top three amino acid changes annotated as harmful and segregating in the untreated barley landraces include alanine to threonine, alanine to valine, and arginine to cysteine. For projects seeking to induce novel changes, for example, in disease resistance genes or genes associated with stress tolerance, sodium azide will induce many coding changes that are rarely observed among standing variation. Resequencing of individual genes identified many sodium azide-induced SNVs in barley [24]. Induced indels and SVs were not previously reported but would be difficult to identify with Sanger sequencing. Indeed, sequencing technology continues to present a limitation. Many of the SVs identified here were identified by linked reads (in two cases verified by ONT long reads) but could not be identified by Illumina paired-end reads alone. Regarding relative effect, indels and SVs identified with linked reads and verified with ONT result in six disruptive mutations that either induce a frameshift or eliminate a portion of a coding gene. This results in an average of two structural disruptions of genes per individual instead of an average of 33.4 per individual due to 1–3 bp nucleotide sequence-level changes. Our mutated lines average a 37.7% reduction in yield relative to their non-mutated parental Morex line. This reduction in yield can be attributed to an average of 14.1 induced SNVs and 37.3 indels per line. The typical line has an average of 249.1 disruptions of coding variants, including SNVs and indels (S6 Fig). The approach used in this study identified a finite number of deleterious (i.e., harmful) mutations induced by sodium azide. It was successful at creating lines that had lower yield than the untreated Morex parent line in the experiment. The reduction in fitness (using yield as a proxy for fitness) following the mutagen treatment was expected, given that most new amino-acid-changing mutations that impact fitness will be deleterious [16,40]. In practical applications, deleterious variants are relatively easy to detect, which makes it possible to select against them or eliminate them via targeted replacement of individual variants [22,23,41,42]. However, it is still challenging to identify the effects of individual deleterious variants. With lines that have reduced yield and a better understanding of the nature of changes generated by sodium azide and the sequence contexts in which they occur, there is the possibility of training machine-learning models to predict which variants contribute to harmful phenotypic change [43,44]. Then, quantify the effect size of each harmful variant into a ranked list and combine the predictions with existing genomic prediction approaches to benefit plant and animal breeding programs [45] and the study of complex human diseases. All of these applications require a means to identify the most harmful variants. Barley from a Morex seed stock was treated with sodium azide following the protocol in [46]. Morex is a 6-row malting barley variety used as the primary reference genome [25]. Morex was chosen for these experiments to facilitate the identification and isolation of de novo variants because the reference makes it easier to distinguish between variants that are different between our parent sample and the reference genome versus variants that arose from the mutagen. The Morex line in this experiment traces back to the parent seed stock used to generate the Steptoe x Morex doubled haploid barley mapping population [47]. To generate sufficient Morex seeds for sodium azide mutagenesis, 120 seeds were planted from a single Morex plant (S1 Fig). Next, 200 seeds from the resulting bulk of seeds were planted; this was repeated one more time. A portion of the seeds was treated with sodium azide (1 mM NaN3) following the [46] protocol; the remaining portion of untreated Morex seeds was planted for another round of seed bulking and then planted to collect leaf tissue for sequencing (S1 Fig). After mutagenesis, the resulting mutagenized seeds were grown to maturity and harvested, forming the M1 generation. These individuals then underwent single-seed descent until M5. Estimates for the expected number of spontaneous mutations occurring without mutagen treatment were calculated using the experimental design for seven generations of self-fertilization (S1 Fig) and rate estimates from [30]. The mutation rates used for SNPs was and for 1–3 bp indels was . For the 820 Mbp (820,594,305 bp) callable regions, a diploid genome size of 1,641,188,610 bp was used. For estimates of the 4.2 Gbp (4,225,605,719 bp) genome size [25], a diploid genome size of 8,451,211,438 bp was used. Each generation, new mutations appear in the heterozygous state, and the number of new heterozygous mutations (Nhet) is given by The experimental design involved multiple generations of selfing, meaning de novo mutations from previous generations are being lost or fixed over time. In each generation, heterozygous mutations are inherited (Ihet) and are represented by where x is the current generation. Similarly, each generation homozygous mutations are inherited (Ihom) and are represented by The number of heterozygous and homozygous spontaneous mutations accumulated by generation seven in our experimental design is given by and is used as our estimated number of spontaneous mutations that would have been present without mutagen treatment. Twenty-five M5:7 mutated lines and F1:2 W2017 Morex parent line were evaluated in yield trials with two replicates at one location (St. Paul, MN) in 2020 and three locations in Minnesota (Crookston, Lamberton, and St. Paul) in 2021 and 2022. Lines were grown in a randomized complete block design. Phenotypic data on grain yield, heading days after planting (DAP), height, and lodging were collected. Check varieties were used to adjust for spatial variation across trial plots for traits with a continuous scale (yield, heading DAP, and height). Spatial adjustments were performed using the R package mvngGrAd [48]. Check lines were chosen because of well-qualified field performance and included Conlon, FEG141–20, Lacey, ND20448, ND26104, ND_Genesis, Pinnacle, and Rasmusson. We generated whole-genome sequencing in 25 barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) accessions: the parent of the mutagenized lines (W2017 Morex), 11 mutagenized lines, and 13 barley landraces [31] for comparative analyses (Tables 1 and S1). High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from 4-6 week-old leaf tissue collected on ice using the Cytiva Nucleon PhytoPure kit for the mutagenized lines. We sequenced three of the 11 M5 mutagenized lines (M01, M20, and M29) and the W2017 Morex line using the 10X Genomics linked read library preparation followed by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing with 150-bp paired-end technology to a target depth of 40x. For the remaining eight M5 mutagenized lines (M02, M11, M14, M28, M35, M36, M39, and M41), libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep followed by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing with 150-bp paired-end technology to a target depth of 16x. Sequences for the 13 landraces were generated using the Illumina TruSeq DNA Nano Prep followed by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing with 150-bp paired-end technology to a target depth of 40x. We used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to sequence W2017 Morex and three of the 11 M5 mutagenized lines (M01, M20, and M29, see Tables 1 and S1). This data was collected to provide read-level confirmation of SVs indicated by the Illumina short-read resequencing. For sample M01, following the ONT protocol, a high molecular weight gDNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen Genomic-tip kit (10262) with Carlson Lysis buffer (10450002–1). High molecular weight gDNA extractions for samples M20 and M29 were generated using the NucleoBond HMW DNA kit (740160.20) from Takara Bio USA. Size selection was performed using Circulomics SRE buffer, and DNA was quantified using the Qubit assay. The libraries were prepared with 400 ng of gDNA using the Rapid Sequencing Kit (SQK-RAD004) following the protocol version RSE_9046_v1_revT_14Aug2019. The library was primed using the flow cell priming kit (EXP-FLP002), then 400 ng of the library was loaded onto an R9.4.1 flow cell (FLO-MIN106D). M01 was run for 72 hours on a MinION Mk1C (MIN-101C). We found the flow cells were no longer collecting new data after 24 hours and modified the run for the remaining two samples. For M20 and M29, 400 ng of the library was loaded onto an R9.4.1 flow cell, run for 12 hours, and then paused. At this point, the pores were cleared using the flow cell wash kit (EXP-WSH004), then 400 ng of additional library was loaded and run for another 12 hours before the run was paused. Again, pores were cleared with the flow cell wash kit, then 400 ng of an additional library was loaded. The flow cell was run for an additional 24–30 hours. Three reactions were run for a single flow cell; a single sample with two washes ran for a total of 48–56 hours. This approach produced the highest data output for our samples. This process was repeated until each mutagenized line was sequenced to a target depth of 2-3x (S1 Table). Basecalling was performed using Guppy v5.0.12 + eb1a981 (for all runs except one) and Guppy v5.0.17 + 99baa5b (for one M01 run #3) using the default setting on the MinION Mk1C. Read alignment and variant calling for the eight mutagenized and 13 landrace WGS lines were processed using the sequence_handling workflow (https://github.com/MorrellLAB/sequence_handling), which integrates publicly available software into a series of bash scripts [49]. The configuration files, which identify software versions and parameters, and scripts are available in the GitHub repositories https://github.com/MorrellLAB/hybrid_barley and https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Barley_Mutated. Reads were aligned against the third version of the barley Morex reference genome (Morex_v3) [25] with parameters adjusted to account for the level of nucleotide diversity in barley. Variants were called as part of a larger set of samples and followed the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practices recommendations [28,29]. SNPs underwent GATK VariantRecalibrator with the following as input: filtered variants and SNPs from genotyping assays, which include 2,975 BOPA SNPs [50], 7,541 9K SNPs [51], and 41,813 50K SNPs [52]. Only polymorphic and biallelic SNPs were included. Additional SNP filtering criteria include allele balance [53,54] deviation of 0.1, proportion heterozygous genotypes at a site > 0.1, per sample minimum DP < 5, per sample maximum DP > 158, proportion missing genotypes at a site > 0.30, QUAL < 30, and GQ < 9. SNPs identified in a barley Sanger resequencing dataset [55,56] were used for validation. Indels were filtered following GATK’s Best Practices Guidelines for hard filtering since we did not have enough truth and training datasets to run indels through VariantRecalibrator. All filtering criteria are detailed in the scripts available in the GitHub repository https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Barley_Mutated. For the four 10X Genomics samples (W2017 Morex and three mutagenized lines, see S1 Table), reads were aligned to the Morex v3 reference genome, and variants were called with the 10X Genomics software, Long Ranger v2.2.2. The Long Ranger pipeline processes the Chromium-prepared sequencing samples. Variants were filtered based on filters generated by Long Ranger, which include: 10X_QUAL_FILTER, 10X_ALLELE_FRACTION_FILTER, 10X_PHASING_INCONSISTENT, 10X_HOMOPOLYMER_UNPHASED_INSERTION, 10X_RESCUED_MOLECULE_HIGH_DIVERSITY, and LOWQ. SNPs and 1-bp indels were filtered to sites with per sample DP between 5 and 78 and an allele balance deviation of +/- 0.2 (from the expected 0.5) for heterozygous genotypes. For the ONT data of W2017 Morex, M01, M20, and M29, read quality and summary statistics were generated with NanoPlot v1.38.1 and pycoQC [57]. Adapters were trimmed with Porechop v0.2.4 [58]. Reads were then aligned to the barley Morex v3 reference genome using Minimap2 v2.17 [59] with parameters recommended for ONT sequence reads. The resulting SAM files were then realigned using a modified version of the Vulcan pipeline [60] (customized version, https://gitlab.com/ChaochihL/vulcan), which utilizes NGMLR [61] for read realignment, converted to BAM format, and sorted using Samtools v1.9 [62]. Structural variants were then called using Sniffles v2.0.3 [61,63]. We also used a publicly available Morex individual sequenced with PacBio CCS reads (BioProject PRJEB40587, ERR numbers ERR4659245-ERR4659249) [25]. We used HiFiAdapterFilt [64] to filter adapters. Reads were aligned using Minimap2 v2.17 [59] using parameters recommended for PacBio sequence reads. Similar to the ONT data, the resulting SAM files were realigned using a modified version of the Vulcan pipeline [60] (customized version, https://gitlab.com/ChaochihL/vulcan), converted to BAM format, and sorted using Samtools v1.9 [62]. Structural variants were called used Sniffles v2.0.3 [61,63]. For all datasets in this study, mapped coverage was estimated using Mosdepth v0.3.1 [65]. All mapping parameters and filtering criteria are detailed in scripts available in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Barley_Mutated). To identify de novo variants induced by the mutagen, we generated a list of regions where variants were called in Morex-sample2 (W2017 Morex); these are differences between the Morex parent in this study and the Morex reference genome. Variants called in the [25] Morex ONT and PacBio data were also counted as differences from the reference; these are potentially due to heterogeneity (variation among individuals in the Morex variety). To minimize spurious SV calls in difficult-to-call regions for the 10X Genomics, ONT, and PacBio data, we filtered out variants that overlap with uncallable regions, which includes annotated repeats, stretches of N’s in the reference genome sequence, and “high copy” regions (i.e., regions where plastids, rDNA repeats, and centromere repeats align). For the ONT and 10X Genomics data, SVs that overlap low complexity regions (defined as regions containing low-copy sequence) were also filtered out because they can be non-biological artifactual sequences that result in unmapped sequences or sequences mapped to multiple locations. Low complexity regions were generated using BBMask from BBTools (BBMap – Bushnell B. – sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/) with entropy set at 0.7, which was determined through data exploration to capture a majority of low complexity sequences (scripts available at https://github.com/MorrellLAB/morex_reference/tree/master/morex_v3). For the ONT and PacBio data, SVs were filtered out if they had less than five supporting reads. For Morex-sample2, SNPs in 100 bp windows with >2% diversity were filtered out. Such high diversity windows are unlikely when aligning Morex-sample2 to the Morex reference genome. SVs were then visually inspected in IGV or scored in SV-plaudit (in the case of the 10X Genomics larger deletions), and filtering criteria were tuned if necessary (summarized in S2 Fig). The filtered SVs form a high confidence set of places where de novo variants shouldn’t be called due to regions that are difficult to align or are heterogeneous among Morex individuals. For the 10X Genomics and ONT sequenced mutagenized lines (M01, M20, M29), SVs that overlap uncallable regions or low complexity regions were filtered out (S3 Fig). To benefit from using the strengths of distinct SV callers for ONT data, we utilize Sniffles2 [60] and cuteSV [66]. SVs called by cuteSV and Sniffles2 in the ONT data were filtered similarly, except in the Sniffles2 calls, we required at least five supporting reads. For all sequenced mutagenized lines (10X Genomics, ONT, and Illumina WGS), variants that overlap the “differences from reference” regions were filtered out (summarized in S2 Fig). SNPs identified in the mutagenized samples that also appear in the BOPA (Barley Oligo Pooled Assay 1 and 2) on the Illumina Golden Gate genotyping platform [50], Barley 9K Illumina Infinium iSelect Custom Genotyping BeadChip [67], and Barley 50K iSelect SNP array [52] panels were also excluded. Variants were filtered to those private to individual mutagenized samples, meaning the variant only exists in one of the mutagenized samples at a genomic position. This is based on the expectation that variants induced by the mutagen are new (arose after the mutagen treatment was applied) and unique to each individual. So, variants identified in the mutagenized lines that also exist in the Morex samples are likely due to heterogeneity in Morex and were not generated by the mutagen treatment. Again, variants were visually inspected in IGV [68] or igv-reports (https://github.com/igvteam/igv-reports), and filtering criteria were tuned if necessary. An image scoring approach was used to verify the larger deletions in the 10X Genomics three mutagenized samples. Images of the SVs were created with the SamPlot software [69]. Following the pipeline implemented in SV-Plaudit [70], the SV images were stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud storage and scored by multiple investigators through the PlotCritic website (https://github.com/jbelyeu/PlotCritic) based on the following criteria: coverage, insert size, and linked/split read evidence. This produced a set of scored deletions where a majority of scorers confirmed read evidence for the variant. This confirmed variant set was then verified using the ONT-sequenced samples (M01, M20, and M29). Mutation Motif [9] was used to identify the most frequent sequence motifs that affect SNPs in the mutated, rare, and common variant classes. This program performs comparative statistical analyses of neighborhoods (5 bp windows) centered around each SNP to identify the frequency of sequence motifs and the influence of neighboring bases for each SNP. The neighborhood of each SNP (e.g., C → T mutation) is compared to the neighborhood of a reference occurrence of the same nucleotide (e.g., C) randomly sampled from within +/- 100 bp of the mutation. Comparing the motifs associated with mutated, rare, and common classes of SNPs allowed us to identify specific motifs that sodium azide may preferentially target. The number of 2- and 3- bp motifs in the 4.2 Gb reference genome and 820 Mb callable regions was calculated using the EMBOSS [71] compseq tool. Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VeP) [32] was used to determine the predicted effect of each variant in the filtered VCF file, which includes SNPs, insertions, and deletions. Identification of nonsynonymous variants (includes missense, start lost, stop gained, and stop lost variants) used gene models provided by [25]. Nonsynonymous variants for the mutated samples and landraces were extracted from the VeP reports and assessed using BAD_Mutations [17,20], which includes a likelihood ratio test [72] that compares codon conservation across Angiosperm species to determine if a base substitution is likely to be deleterious. We ran the BAD_Mutations pipeline with a set of 72 Angiosperm species genome sequences that are available through Phytozome v13 (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/, last accessed November 29, 2021) and Ensembl Plants (http://plants.ensembl.org/, last accessed November 29, 2021). We ran BAD_Mutations using 35,827 primary transcripts. A SNP was annotated as deleterious if the P-value for the test was < 0.05 with a multiple tests correction based on the number of tested codons, minimum of 10 sequences, maximum constraint of 1, and if the alternate or reference allele was not seen in any of the other species. Our thresholds for the three data groups were 8.1E-5 (611 codons tested) for the mutated samples, 5.1E-6 (9,716 codons tested) for the rare variants, and 3.4E-6 (14,537 codons tested) for the common variants. SNPs that failed this set of criteria were annotated as tolerated. Gx is the generation used for spontaneous mutation estimates (see Methods). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s001 (TIFF) These are regions where induced mutations should not be called as they are more likely to be variation among Morex individuals. Example screenshots from IGV are shown, from top to bottom: 1) A deletion called in ONT data in a region where the reference is missing - can’t be confirmed as a deletion, 2) Regions with excessively high diversity based on the expectations in the most diverse barley genes are excluded, these are more likely due to alignment issues rather than real variation, and 3) Read support for 10X Genomics called deletion with the same variant called in the ONT data providing additional support for the call. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s002 (TIFF) Larger SVs were visually evaluated with a similar approach as in part 1 of the filtering (S2 Fig). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s003 (TIFF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s004 (TIFF) Larger insertions were not called in the 10X Genomics dataset. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s005 (TIFF) A) A summary of the percentage and number of SNPs and indels in genic regions that can potentially disrupt genes for sodium azide-treated samples and rare vs. common categories.

Title: These 5 Special Dividends Are More Than Meets The Eye

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Young businessman working on laptop at home. getty Most mainstream financial websites are not “smart enough” to include special dividends. The yields they display reflect plain ol’ quarterly or monthly payouts. For most stocks this does not matter. But for a select few “special payers” this is a costly oversight. One that we can capitalize on as thoughtful contrarians. In a moment we’ll discuss five special dividends. The vanilla screens say they pay as little as 3.2% but in reality they dish up to 13.8%! What exactly is a special dividend payment? It is a one-time cash payout, often the result of a massive cash influx from, say, selling off part of the company or having an unusually profitable year. Usually it is a one-shot deal. But it can be a regular thing. Let’s consider chicken producer Pilgrim’s Pride (PPC), which recently paid a $6.30 per share special dividend. This is a tremendous 12.7% yield. That’s amazing for people who held PPC at the time, but given the company’s dividend history, it’s likely this is it: PPC Dividend Ycharts PPC is a classic example of a one-time payer. We are looking for exceptions—the one-time payment that happens every year! These are “regular” special dividends, sometimes called “supplemental dividends,” that the company pairs with a regular dividend they know they can afford. Example: ABC Inc. pays 25 cents per share quarterly, but at the end of the year, it pays out 50% of its free cash flow as a supplemental dividend. That dividend still might vary—say, $1 in 2023, $1.50 in 2024, and $1.25 in 2025—but it’s extra yield on top of what it can afford to pay on the regular. In some cases, these special dividend payers can be quite generous. Let’s take these 3.2%-11.3% yielders that actually pay out 9.0%-13.8% once we include their special distributions: Buckle (BKE)Stated Dividend Yield: 3.2%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 9.0% Buckle (BKE) is a mid- to high-end fashion retailer that’s primarily known for its jeans, but it also sells all sorts of apparel, activewear, swimwear and accessories. Fashion stocks have always been fickle, but post-COVID, they’ve been downright counterintuitive. Numerous “mall retail” stocks found themselves slowly declining in the years preceding the pandemic, only to find new life despite COVID broadly knocking brick-and-mortar retail on its tail. That includes the Buckle, whose top and bottom lines have dipped from their post-COVID highs but are still far better than what the store delivered for years prior to the pandemic. Looking at its regular dividend over the past decade or so, the difference is hard to notice—a couple of small raises in 2021, but that’s it. However, that’s because Buckle’s dividend has long been unlike its fashion retail brethren. The company prefers to pay a modest regular quarterly dividend, then top it up each year with sometimes spectacular special dividends that boost BKE’s yield by double, triple, sometimes even more. Naturally, the rub is that, by virtue of offering massive special dividends, the amount of income we collect from Buckle has the potential to shift enormously from one year to the next—even if the specials have been fairly consistent of late, and even if operational results are largely expected to remain steady over the next couple of years. Even the potential for income volatility isn’t great for retirement planners, but for more adventurous investors, it’s a secret store of upside that most people will typically overlook. Amerisafe (AMSF)Stated Dividend Yield: 3.3%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 9.7% Amerisafe (AMSF) is a relatively unusual insurer that deals in workers’ compensation. The company operates in 27 states and deals in “high-hazard” industries such as construction, trucking and agriculture. Anyone who wants to invest in an industry with consistent profits should sprint away from the insurance space. AMSF is actually relatively stable compared to, say, P&C insurance, where even good operators may occasionally suffer annual losses. But even then, Amerisafe’s bottom line is a moving target. Which makes a regular-and-specials program an extremely responsible way to manage the dividend. AMSF pays a modest (but growing!) quarterly dividend that typically yields around 3%. Then every year, usually in December, it will pay a special dividend with whatever profits it can spare. Like with Buckle, this payout usually doubles or triples the amount of income its shareholders collect in a given year. Again, retirees can’t plan their budgets around dividends like Amerisafe’s. But consider this: AMSF’s 2024 special dividend was the company’s lowest in roughly a decade, and it still boosted the stock’s total yield to nearly 10%. With that level of dividend, we don’t need much positive price action to have a great annual return. I’d keep an eye on that bottom line, though. AMSF’s profits, which have already slid for a couple years now, are projected to thin this year and next, too. One area of the market that’s rife with “regular” special dividends is the business development company (BDC) community. These companies share a lot in common with real estate investment trusts (REITs): they were both created by Congress, they both exist to allow regular investors to invest in an otherwise difficult-to-reach asset, and they both are required to pay out at least 90% of their taxable income in the form of dividends. But BDCs invest in dozens if not hundreds of small businesses: not exactly a hotbed of stability and reliability. So in the BDC space, we’ll frequently see fairly generous regular dividends complemented with specials that take already good yields and make them downright great. Gladstone Investment Corp. (GAIN)Stated Dividend Yield: 6.4%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 14.3% Gladstone Investment Corp. (GAIN) is part of my favorite Wall Street family: the Gladstones! This group of businesses also includes another publicly traded BDC, Gladstone Capital Corp. (GLAD), as well as a pair of publicly traded REITs: Gladstone Land Corp. (LAND) and Gladstone Commercial Corp. (GOOD). GAIN’s target portfolio company will generate $4 million to $15 million in annual EBITDA, have a proven business model, stable cash flows and minimal market or technology risk. As far as BDCs go, GAIN has a narrower portfolio than most, at just 25 companies—mostly manufacturing, business services and consumer services firms, but a few consumer product specialists, too. What sticks out most about Gladstone Investment Corp., however, is its willingness to deal in equity. Most BDCs will typically only have 5% to 10% exposure to equity, but GAIN’s target mix is 25% equity/75% debt. This is essential to GAIN’s “buyout” strategy. Gladstone Investment typically provides most (if not all) of the debt capital along with a majority of the equity capital. Its debt investments allow it to pay out a still-high regular dividend, but then it also pays out (extremely variable) supplemental payouts when they realize gains on equity investments. To wit, GAIN’s regular monthly dividend accounts for 6% worth of yield, but a 54-cent special dividend to be paid in June and a 70-cent distribution last October work out to an additional 8.3% in yield! That said, Gladstone’s specials are all over the place. The company paid three in 2022 and five in 2023, but just one in 2024 and (so far) just one in 2025. Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending Corp. (NCDL)Stated Dividend Yield: 11.3%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 13.8% Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending Corp. (NCDL) is among a handful of other BDCs, such as Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) and Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD), that’s connected from a big-name asset manager with a sterling reputation. In this case, NCDL is tied to both fund manager Nuveen, as well as its parent TIAA. The fund’s external manager—Churchill, a Nuveen affiliate—invests the BDC in senior secured loans to private equity-owned middle market companies in the U.S. The $2.1 billion portfolio is 210 companies strong right now. The vast majority of holdings (91%) are first lien loans, though Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending also deals in second lien debt, subordinated loans and equity co-investment. This is a relatively young BDC that has only been in existence since 2018, and it just went public in 2024. I wrote plenty about the company in a September column, but here, I want to focus on the payout. Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending has come out of the gate with a regular-and-specials format. The regular quarterly dividend has been set at 45 cents per share, and it has so far paid an additional 10-cent special in every quarter since its IPO. That’s a strong double-digit yield base with, at least for now, a meaningful 2.5 percentage points in special sweeteners. The special distributions were declared in connection with the IPO, and April’s 10-cent payout was the final dividend in that tranche. Indeed, NCDL’s streak might stop this summer—based on its previous activity, any special dividends to be paid in July likely would have been announced in April. If nothing else, investors should keep their eye on NCDL over the next few quarters to see whether these specials were a one-off event or something the BDC will come back to following strong financial results. Also, NCDL is young, so it’s difficult to tell where its “normal” valuation range will lie, but for now, the BDC is trading at an 11% discount to NAV. Barings BDC (BBDC)Stated Dividend Yield: 11.3%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 12.9% Barings BDC (BBDC) is the cheapest of these three BDCs, trading at an 18% discount to NAV right now. The Barings name might not mean much to some readers, but longtime BDC investors will surely remember the name “Triangle Capital.” That’s what the company was known as until August 2018, when the company rebranded following years of writing off bad investments and hacking away at its dividend. But it wasn’t just a rebrand—it was a new lease on life. Global financial services firm Barings became an external advisor and overhauled BBDC’s portfolio. Today, Barings primarily invests in senior secured private debt investments in “well-established” middle-market companies across numerous industries. Target companies for its sponsor-backed investments (issuers owned by private equity firms), the largest part of its business at 75%-85% exposure generally, generate between $15 million and $75 million in EBITDA annually. It also has smaller exposure to non-PE-owned businesses, as well as a pair of middle market first lien loan originators, Eclipse Business Capital and Rocade Capital. Meanwhile, about 70% of its investments are first lien loans, though it also has exposure to second lien, mezzanine, equity, structured, and joint venture investments. We’ve booked gains in BBDC twice through our Dividend Swing Trader service, so I frequently have my eye on this one for short- and long-term opportunities alike. So I was pleased to see when Barings made a splash in Q1. After a few years of dividend growth, the company’s quarterly dividend had been stuck at 26 cents per share since mid-2023. However, in February, Barings announced it would pay 5-cent special dividends across the first three quarters of 2025 “based on these strong results, our confidence in our portfolio, and the momentum we have seen so far in 2025.” While I’d prefer growth in the “stickier” regular dividend, this is a welcome development. The company hasn’t made “top-up” specials since 2014 and 2015. If BBDC makes this a lasting habit, its already stellar dividend will become even tastier. I’ll be keeping a close eye on the stock over the next couple of quarters to see if it extends this line of specials into the end of 2025 and into 2026.
