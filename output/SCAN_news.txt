Title: Stocks Over Spot: The Case For Buying Bitcoin Treasury Companies Instead Of BTC

Bitcoin is among the world’s most important assets, but owning it directly is not the only way to get exposure. A growing number of public companies hold massive amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. For investors buying these stocks, it can sometimes offer even greater upside than holding BTC itself. In a thought-provoking post on X, Adam Livingston, author of the Bitcoin Age and the Great Harvest, offers a compelling argument for why investors should consider buying the stock of Bitcoin treasury companies, rather than just BTC itself. His perspective goes beyond a simple leveraged play and speaks to a long-term vision of a new financial infrastructure built on a BTC foundation. Livingston’s thesis is that a new paradigm-shifting financial infrastructure built over the coming years will take Bitcoin to $100-200 trillion BTC market, supporting an equal magnitude of Bitcoin-denominated credit and equity. This new infrastructure would enable global transactions at light speed on open ledgers, providing everyone with a censorship-resistant, inflation-proof yield stream. The key takeaway from the recent unconference is that this infrastructure needs to be built because it is where solving complex issues, such as custody, compliance, and distribution across different jurisdictions, comes into play. It also involves creating products that cater to traditional investors who may not want or need a volatile, infinite-duration asset like Bitcoin itself. Thus, these products can strip away volatility, manage duration, or FX risk, allowing institutions and individuals to gain the spread and recycle profits back into BTC collateral. However, Livingston argues that Bitcoin can enable the exact instruments they do want. If BTC is to reach $1,000,000, it will require a robust financial infrastructure to funnel global capital into the asset. Crypto analyst Rajatsonfinance has highlighted a contrarian perspective on Bitcoin investing, urging people to abandon the common strategy of waiting for a bear market to start buying. Instead, he advocates for a more proactive approach centered on value creation and consistent accumulation. According to Rajatsonfinance, trying to time the market is a flawed and often unsuccessful endeavor. He argues that waiting for a crash could be used to build skills and create value in the real world. His primary advice is to focus on earning more money and then exchanging that income for Bitcoin, whether by selling services for dollars and converting them or by accepting BTC directly as payment. The analyst emphasized that if executed with a solid idea, passion, and consistent effort, it can lead to a far more significant BTC stack than one could ever accumulate by trying to buy the dip. He suggests that a successful business or a well-executed side hustle has the potential to generate far more than a modest $10,000 to $15,000, which would result in a holding far exceeding 0.1 BTC.

Title: BlockDAG Leads the Pack: The Best Crypto Presale of 2025 Holders Can’t Ignore

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. The crypto market is entering one of its most exciting phases yet, and presales are at the heart of this momentum. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate headlines, the real upside often comes from presales that combine utility, community growth, and visionary roadmaps. Among the flood of projects vying for attention, a few stand out for their strong numbers and ambitious goals. BlockDAG, in particular, is rewriting the rules of what a presale can achieve, while others, such as BlockchainFX, JetBolt, and Little Pepe, are building strong momentum. Below, we break down why these coins are generating hype and why BlockDAG is emerging as the clear frontrunner. BlockDAG is proving to be one of the most explosive presales the crypto market has seen in years. With nearly $410 million already raised and more than 26.3 billion BlockDAG coins sold, this project is racing toward its ambitious $600 million goal at record speed. Right now, the coin sits at just $0.0013 in Batch 30, but this golden entry point won’t be around for long as it ends in the next 24 hours. Once it hits its confirmed listing price of $0.05, current holders are guaranteed a 3,746% ROI from day one of trading. But the hype isn’t just numbers on paper. BlockDAG already has 312,000+ holders, has started shipping over 19,900 ASIC miners worldwide, and is powering a massive base of 3 million X1 mobile miners actively running every day. Add in the soon-to-launch Awakening Testnet, which will showcase its technology in real time, and it’s clear this project has execution, not just promises. BlockchainFX has already raised $7.24 million from more than 9,000 participants, making it one of the most promising best crypto presale contenders in the fintech app sector. At a token price of $0.023, early holders are securing a steep discount before its official $0.05 launch price. What sets BFX apart is its “super app” positioning: it connects crypto, stocks, forex, and commodities in a single trading ecosystem. With a beta app already live and presale bonuses, including a 30% token boost for early holders, BlockchainFX is gaining strong momentum. JetBolt is another project generating hype as a fresh best crypto presale option. Built on the SKALE network, it offers zero gas fees, AI-powered utilities, staking rewards, and scalable smart contracts. However, details around tokenomics and pricing remain scarce. While the buzz is strong, JetBolt is still in a very early stage, meaning the upside could be significant if execution follows through, but so could the risks. Little Pepe has taken the meme coin space by storm, raising over $25 million in presale funds. Now priced at $0.0021 in Stage 12, the project has already sold out over 15 billion tokens across earlier rounds. Unlike many meme tokens, LILPEPE runs on its own Ethereum-compatible Layer-2, featuring near-instant transactions, zero trading tax, and anti-sniper bot protection. With additional incentives like mega giveaways and staking rewards, analysts project this presale could deliver 25× returns post-listing, making it another hot contender for the best crypto presale list. The search for the best crypto presale of 2025 is heating up, and holders have no shortage of options. BlockchainFX is building a multi-asset super app, JetBolt promises next-gen scalability, and Little Pepe combines meme power with serious Layer-2 utility. Each has potential, but none match the scale, adoption, and guaranteed ROI of BlockDAG. With nearly $410 million raised, a $0.0013 entry price, and a locked-in 3,746% ROI at launch, BlockDAG is emerging as the best crypto presale opportunity. BlockDAG’s real-world adoption: 312,000+ holders, 19,900 ASIC miners being shipped, and 3 million X1 app users, shows momentum that most projects never achieve. In 2025, the winners will be the buyers who recognized early that BlockDAG was not just another presale, but a game-changing crypto revolution.

Title: Bitcoin’s Big Flip: More Stable Than the Nasdaq 100 as Best Altcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Benefits

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. There’s a massive shift occurring in the financial world, and it’s a big deal for Bitcoin. For the first time, Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped below that of nearly every company on the Nasdaq 100 index. A cryptocurrency once known for its wild, unpredictable price has now become more stable than giants like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. The data in CEX.io’s report shows that over the past 3 months, Bitcoin’s realized volatility is now lower than 99 of the 100 companies in the index. Just a month ago, it was steadier than 91% of them. It seems the days of Bitcoin’s stomach-churning volatility might be behind us. Exciting developments being brought to the Bitcoin network by projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) further signal a bullish momentum is building for $BTC. With nearly $17M raised on presale and a promise to turn Bitcoin from a store of value into a DeFi-ready ecosystem, $HYPER stands out as one of the best altcoins today. The CEX.io report explains that it’s all about maturity. As Bitcoin’s market cap has exploded, it’s created a much deeper liquidity pool. Basically, there’s a lot more money flowing in and out of the market, which means a single big buyer or seller can’t rock the boat like they used to. This is a significant vote of confidence for Bitcoin, demonstrating its status as a serious investment. What’s even more impressive is that Bitcoin hasn’t sacrificed its returns for this new stability. It outperformed almost all of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks, a famous group of tech behemoths like Alphabet and Nvidia. In fact, among that group, Bitcoin’s gains were only topped by Alphabet. You’re not just getting a calmer asset; you’re getting one that’s still delivering spectacular results. Let’s face it, results are what’s important, and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is shaping up to deliver in a big way with increased speed and development on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin has always been the gold standard of crypto: secure, decentralized, and a rock-solid store of value. But let’s be honest, it’s not exactly built for speed. Transaction are slow and fees get high during network congestion, making it tough to use for daily payments or cutting-edge dApps. It offloads network traffic off Bitcoin’s L1 through a canonical bridge, which securely cross-mints wrapped $BTC ($wBTC) on the Hyper network. While the $wBTC is usable for L2 dApps and DeFi protocols, Bitcoin’s L1 remains the settlement layer. The L2 taps into the incredible speed of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which helps unlock lightning-fast, ultra-cheap transactions and a new universe of possibilities for Bitcoin. This isn’t about replacing Bitcoin; it’s about making it faster, more flexible, and future-proof. Visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website to learn more. The Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem combines Bitcoin’s security and Solana’s speed, making it a perfect combo for the Web3 world where Bitcoin risks being left behind. The $HYPER token is the fuel that powers this upcoming ecosystem, and the project’s promise has drawn in a lot of bullish investors. As the project races towards its mainnet launch in Q3, with top exchange listings following in Q4, $HYPER is poised to become a core part of the Bitcoin universe. Indeed, Bitcoin Hyper’s presale has been a massive success, raising over $16.8M so far. It’s a massive vote of confidence that shows people are hungry for ways to make Bitcoin more useful. With $HYPER fueling network fees, DAO governance, and giving 68% APY rewards to early presale buyers, its incentives and value as a utility token make it an attractive play in late 2025.

Goldiam has responded swiftly with a U.S.‐origin casting model, a globally accepted and compliant approach that effectively mitigates tariff exposure:  Through its U.S. subsidiary, Goldiam now casts raw gold into unfinished jewellery pieces within the United States.  These castings are then shipped to India for finishing, polishing, and diamond setting.  The final jewellery is re‐exported to the U.S., where it qualifies for tariff exemptions under U.S. Customs rules. Because the gold is bought and casted in the U.S., the product retains U.S. origin status. As a result, no tariff applies to the gold component, and instead 5.5% duty is levied on the incremental value addition (diamonds and labour). Facing steep U.S. tariffs, Gokaldas Exports is boosting EU and UK shipments and shifting production to Africa, aiming to protect margins and diversify markets.

For emerging economies like India, this sparks opportunity and risk. A weaker U.S. dollar drives capital inflows through carry trades and FDI, boosting India’s stock market and supporting its 7% GDP growth trajectory. However, currency volatility and imported inflation pose challenges, requiring careful policy navigation to ensure sustained economic gains.” Markets rise on Fed rate cut, Sensex at 82,885.17, Nifty 50 at 25,392.10; HDFC Life top gainer.

The partnership will soon be expanded to include other products such as gold loans and housing loans. The Fed’s neutral rate for the U.S. economy is estimated at about 3.25%. In 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board reduced the Federal Funds Rate from 5.375% to 4.375%. Today, after an extended pause, they cut it again from 4.375% to 4.125%. More importantly, the Fed signalled two additional rate cuts in 2025, which would bring the Federal Funds Rate down to 3.625% by year-end, still slightly ahead of the neutral rate. There is more room to cut rates in 2026. Historically, when the Fed lowers rates, capital tends to shift out of safe assets such as U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits into riskier assets, including equities, private equity, venture capital, and emerging markets. The anticipated rate cuts in 2025 and in 2026 are expected to boost the valuations of risky assets. As a result, India should expect stronger capital inflows—particularly in Q4, when large global asset managers finalize allocations. This comes at a time when the Indian economy is demonstrating resilience, even in the face of headwinds such as the Trump administration’s imposition of a 50% tariff on Indian exports. Overall, India stands to benefit from a “double engine” of global liquidity easing and strong domestic fundamentals. Vikram Kasat, Head - Advisory, PL Capital. “The Fed Cuts, Wall Street Yawns Wish Granted - Like a dog chasing cars, Wall Street didn’t know what to do with itself once it finally got its rate cut. 2025 now marks the 3rd year since 1996 where rate cuts have happened with the S&P 500 at record highs The Recession That Never Was - The base case remains for a 25bp rate cut even though inflation is still running well above the 2% target based on the latest data. US headline CPI and core CPI were up 2.9% YoY and 3.1% YoY, respectively, in August. The official reason is growing evidence of labour market weakness US commercial banks’ total loan growth has risen from 1.5% YoY in mid-March 2024 to 4.6% YoY in early September 2025, while commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth is up from a negative 2.6% YoY to 4.1% YoY over the same period - For such reasons it is entirely possible to make the argument that the US economy could be in the early days of a new cyclical rebound Nifty 25330.25 Nifty has decisively closed above the high of 25250 Support Levels 20HMA: 25209 40HEMA: 25130” EaseMyTrip partners with Hoi for India's first Smart Kiosk Rewards Program at major airports, offering travel benefits to passengers.

KPI Green Energy's green bond listing marks a milestone in sustainable finance for India's renewable sector. Renisha Chainani, Head of Research of Augmont, writes - Gold and silver prices continued to decline as a result of the dollar’s rise, after the U.S. Federal Reserve dropped interest rates by 25 bps, as anticipated, and signalled two more cuts this year as the job market deteriorated. · Chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile, expressed caution about additional easing, characterising the action as a risk-management strategy in reaction to a deteriorating labour market. The central bank will evaluate the future trajectory of interest rates “meeting-by-meeting,” he continued. · Due to persistent geopolitical concerns, Fed easing expectations, and robust central bank demand, gold has increased 40% so far this year. · The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are anticipated to maintain policy stability this week, while the Bank of Canada also reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points. Technical Triggers · Gold Oct Futures seems to have topped out, and if it sustains below $3700 (~Rs 109,500), then we could only see further profit booking up to $3650(~Rs 108,000) and $3600 (~Rs 106,500). · Silver Nov Futures also seems to have topped out around $43, the next target is $41(~Rs 123,500). Sell on rallies The Nifty IT index surged 0.92 per cent to 36,780.85 points in morning trade, with all constituent stocks advancing as investors responded positively to the Federal Reserve’s 25 basis point interest rate cut announced overnight. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group. The U.S. Fed’s 25 basis points rate cut is expected to have a measured impact on Indian markets. Softer U.S. yields enhance the relative appeal of Indian assets, which could draw interest from global investors into emerging markets. But the wide anticipation of at least a 25 bps cut was already factored in by the market to a great extent. That said, a more decisive driver for market sentiment would be the progress on the U.S.–India trade deal, which would ease some pressures by lowering tariff barriers. Domestically the ongoing momentum is being supported by GST reforms, while the prospect of an agreement with the US. Further, the Fed projections of an additional 50 basis points cut in 2025 ahead, coupled with the previous stated factors would greatly ease the situation and FII positioning for Indian markets. Still, in the near term, sectors with exposure to international borrowings and export-oriented industries could benefit, providing selective opportunities.

With US being a large market for exports, the fed cut post the implementation of tariffs will drive momentum in exports by bringing in some relief to the business. In terms of gold, the prices declined in the domestic as well as international markets after setting a new high in India before the Fed rate cut. It is expected that the gold prices in India will further rise though but this can be cushioned if the rupee gains strength against the dollar. Going ahead, we expect gold prices to be elevated with lower U.S yields making the metal more attractive to investors. In the domestic market, the demand is likely to remain steady even with mild price fluctuation, given the festive and wedding season. Prices could hover in the range of INR 1,10,000 to 1,12,000/10 gms in the domestic market and USD 3600 to 3700/Oz in the international markets in the near term.” China’s exports of refined oil products in August rose 8.5% year-on-year, according to customs data, but slowed from July when it recorded the highest monthly total since June 2024. - Reuters The rupee depreciated 16 paise to 88.01 against the US dollar in early trade on Thursday, as traders assessed the US FED outlook following a rate cut. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points, marking its first reduction of the year. This decision reflects a cautious approach to supporting the labour market amid increasing employment risks. The dovish stance is expected to lower borrowing costs and encourage consumer spending in the U.S. markets, which could lead to gains in equities, bonds, and real estate. However, some volatility may persist due to internal divisions. In India, the Fed’s actions could attract foreign capital, strengthening the rupee and benefiting stock indices like the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty. This favourable environment may help ease inflationary pressures and provide the RBI room for adjustments, although exporters might face challenges from currency strength. When combined with domestic factors, including the RBI’s earlier interest rate reductions, specifically a 50 basis point cut in June 2025 and another cut in April, as well as GST rate rationalization and various measures to boost consumption, the outlook for India’s economy appears strong. Potential GDP growth is projected to remain steady at around 6.5% to 6.7% for FY2025/26. Given these favourable conditions, several sectors, including Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), Information Technology (IT), Metals, and Domestic Consumption (FMCG, Retail, Durables), are positioned for potential gains.

Retail Participation in Cash Segment – A Sharp Decline Retail investors once dominated direct equity trading, but their share in NSE’s cash market has dropped to 34.2% in FY25-26 (till August). This is a sharp fall from the pandemic peak of 45% in FY20-21, when retail enthusiasm was at its highest. Current levels are comparable to 2015-16, highlighting a gradual retreat from direct market dominance. 2. Why Retail Investors are Withdrawing Pandemic Euphoria Faded: During COVID, easy apps and abundant liquidity brought millions of new investors. But many came for quick gains and exited after facing cycles of poor returns. Shift Towards Indirect Routes: Instead of trading themselves, many retail investors now prefer mutual funds, insurance-linked products, and PMS where professionals manage money. Regulatory Tightening: SEBI has raised margin rules, introduced stricter norms, and curbed speculative trading in F&O. Losses in F&O: Data shows most new entrants lost money in F&O, and sharp corrections in many mid- and small-cap stocks further discouraged direct participation. 3. Where Retail Money is Moving Mutual Funds & Systematic Plans (SIPs): Steady inflows suggest retailers are now choosing professional fund managers over self-trading. Insurance & PMS: Increasing reliance on structured, long-term wealth management solutions. Indirect Exposure to F&O: Retailers’ footprint in futures & options rose from 23% in FY15-16 to 27.7% in FY25-26 (till August). 4. Key Risks and Lessons for Retailers Chasing Quick Profits Backfires: Many investors entered for short-term gains but faced losses. The lesson: discipline matters more than thrill. High-Risk Speculation Curbed: Stricter rules may reduce short-term excitement, but they are designed to protect investors from reckless losses. Market Reality Check: Small and mid-cap stocks have fallen 30-40% from peaks, versus only 4-5% in the broader index. This proves that investing without understanding fundamentals can be dangerous. 5. Outlook – A More Mature Market Ahead Experts believe that although curbs may dampen high-risk speculation, they will foster a healthier, long-term investing environment. With retail investors moving towards mutual funds and institutions playing a stronger role, India’s market is slowly shifting to a sustainable growth path. Future success for retailers lies in: Understanding fundamentals rather than speculation. Diversifying via funds instead of only direct stocks. Adopting discipline and patience rather than chasing momentum. Aluminium prices expected to stay high in 2025 due to a weaker dollar and stable Chinese demand.

Bulls Stay in Control, Key Levels to Watch Post Fed Rate Cut The US Federal Reserve delivered a widely anticipated 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday. With the US being the world’s largest economy, this decision has global market implications and early cues are already reflecting in positive US indices and Gift Nifty, hinting at a positive opening for Nifty today. Nifty 50 extended its winning streak on Wednesday, gaining 91.15 points (+0.36%) to close at 25,330.25. The index continues to exhibit strong bullish momentum, backed by robust volumes. Technically, the spot remains well above its 9-, 20-, and 50-day EMAs, with the RSI (14) reading at 67 — inching toward the overbought zone. While this does not guarantee a reversal, traders should watch for potential consolidation or a healthy pullback towards the psychological 25,000 level. Such dips could present attractive buy-on-dip opportunities if the bullish bias sustains. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at 25,400 — a breakout above this zone could open doors for 25,500–25,600 levels. On the downside, 25,250 acts as the first line of support, followed by 25,100. For Thursday’s session, the expected range is between 25,470 on the higher side and 25,160 on the lower side if 25,250 fails to hold. In the institutional flow space, FIIs continued their selling streak with net outflows of ₹989.81 crore, while DIIs stepped in aggressively by pumping in ₹2,205.12 crore which provided strong support to the market’s bullish undertone. The U.S. Fed’s 25-bps rate cut marks a pivotal policy shift, lowering borrowing costs and reviving global risk appetite. Growth-sensitive sectors such as housing, tech, and small caps stand to benefit, though banks may face margin compression. A softer dollar also improves the prospects of stronger FII inflows into India. Coupled with consistent DII support and stable technical underpinnings, this development strengthens the case for continued market upside—so long as global cues remain favorable. FII Caution vs DII Confidence FIIs remain cautious, having offloaded ₹11,330.08 crores in the cash market month-to-date. However, their strategic additions in index futures (₹4,727.78 crores) and options (₹6,739.97 crores) reflect hedging activity rather than outright bearishness. Counterbalancing this, DIIs have infused ₹32,892.91 crores, supported by resilient retail SIP flows and confidence in India’s long-term growth story. This steady domestic support has anchored sentiment and offset external nervousness. Open Interest Signals Open Interest data indicates firm resistance around the 25,500–26,000 strike, where rising call OI suggests sellers may assert pressure. At the same time, concentrated put OI at 25,150–25,000 highlights strong defensive positioning, reinforcing the support base. The balance of OI shifts suggests cautious optimism, with market participants hedging while staying positioned for an eventual breakout. Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty 50 are likely to open gap up, as trend in GIFT Nifty suggests a positive start for the broader index. Asian markets were trading mixed in early trade.

Title: Alphabet Rides The AI Wave Over The $3 Trillion Mark

Alphabet is the newest member of the $3 trillion club, and it’s counting on rolling AI ambitions to take it higher. Jamie Wilde Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Tech giant Alphabet joined the $3 trillion club this week, making it the fourth company to reach that impressive market cap. Certainly, you’ve heard about the other three — Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia — but, if not, just Google them. A favorable ruling earlier this month in an antitrust case against Alphabet kickstarted the stock’s latest upward swing. A US court ruled the company didn’t need to sell off its Chrome browser or Android operating system, two outcomes investors feared would cut into the company’s core biz. Then there’s what pushed the stock over the top into $3 trillion territory: growing enthusiasm for Alphabet’s AI investments. Alphabet’s stock has climbed more than 70% from its April low. Its cloud-computing unit’s revenue surged a better-than-expected 32% in the second quarter, lifted by demand for new AI offerings like the Gemini chatbot from its Google subsidiary. Earlier this month, Google Cloud’s CEO said the company’s already made billions from AI and has $106 billion in customer demand for its cloud computing services. The success highlights Alphabet’s efforts to diversify beyond its advertising businesses, including at Google and YouTube, which make up more than half of revenue. And, following Google Cloud’s success, Alphabet’s bringing AI to more products: Surface Tension: Fears of the AI bubble bursting haven’t been realized, as investors continue to bet that massive investments into the tech will pay off. AI chip-maker Nvidia is still the most valuable company with a market cap of more than $4 trillion. And Oracle signed a $300 billion cloud deal with OpenAI last week, pouring fuel on its stock’s rally. If AI is a bubble, it seems to be made of something more durable than soapy water. And yet, last week, Tesla scored a couple key brownie points from Wall Street analysts. So why the optimism? Unfortunately for Intel, the deal does not provide a direct lifeline to its floundering chipmaking foundry business. Meta will likely soon face competition from Amazon, Alphabet, Snap and other tech firms with augmented-reality glasses in development. Quantum computers are expected to solve previously unsolvable problems (or ones that would take ages) across industries. Apple’s latest generation of iPhones were debuted with modest aplomb last week. Presales show the company has plenty to be confident about. Between 2000 and 2002, after the dot com bubble popped, the Nasdaq lost nearly 80% of its value, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Oracle said its remaining performance obligations is now sitting at $455 billion. That’s up 359% from where it stood just a year ago. Mistral has been hailed by policymakers as key to Europe’s ambitions to compete with dominant US and Asian rivals. iPhone sales surged to $44.5 billion in the quarter ending in June, besting analysts’ $40 billion expectations and rising 14% year-over-year. Pubmatic’s lawsuit comes after a US Judge ruled in April that Google was maintaining an illegal monopoly in the ad tech industry. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, having successfully diversified into cloud computing, is now making a push into artificial intelligence. So far, Tesla has launched limited rideshare services in Austin and the Bay area, and it’s looking to expand into Florida, Arizona and Nevada. © 2025 The Daily Upside
