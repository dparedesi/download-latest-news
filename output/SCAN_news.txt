While the DTX Exchange attracts attention for its features and prospective profits, Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies are generating spectacular gains as the cryptocurrency bull run heats up. As the bull run is about to start, several of the leading cryptocurrencies are already generating net double-digit profits. The massive surge in meme coins is accelerating as the price of Bitcoin surpasses $71,000, and the cryptocurrency market approaches $2.5 trillion. The market value of meme currencies has increased to $62.23 billion with a trading volume of $9.74 billion, with Dogecoin leading the field with a 15% rise over the past day. This largest meme coin has a huge 140% upside, and the other tokens are probably going to provide exponential gains. Here, we will review the best coin for the upcoming spectacular surge in November same as DOGE. Dogecoin was a pioneer in 2021 in the meme coin activity, which later became the multibillion-dollar industry it is today. Dogecoin’s value skyrocketed after Elon Musk’s tweet, hitting its highest peak ever at $0.73. However, will it be able to surpass this level in the next bull run? Although several indicators support Dogecoin breaking its all-time high, analysts are split on the price projection for this cycle. In and of itself, Elon Musk’s affiliation with pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump is a bullish trigger, and Musk could send Dogecoin skyrocketing with a well-timed X tweet. Although the potential for parabolic growth is somewhat limited, Dogecoin, the largest meme, is predicted to profit from many meme rallies over the course of the next 12 months. Since DOGE bounced back from its monthly lows under $0.1, the price volatility has increased. Since then, the volume has continued to climb noticeably, indicating that bulls and other market players are sufficiently involved. As a result, the DOGE price is poised for a further 25% increase that might happen at any moment now that market opinions have changed. Additionally, the 50-day and 200-day EMAs’ golden crossing increases the likelihood of an upward move. By the end of November, Dogecoin is probably going to hit $0.3713 if the upward momentum continues. Another cryptocurrency bull run, like the one that occurred in 2021, is almost upon us. After surpassing popular cryptocurrencies like DOGE, DTX Exchange (DTX) is now at the forefront. The next destination for investments by the crypto community is the current DTX presale. Just a few weeks into the presale period, the new hybrid exchange has already raised an incredible $6.1 million. Additionally, forecasts indicate that DTX Exchange will do something significant if its token is listed on significant cryptocurrency platforms. The duplicate trading tool on DTX Exchange is designed to help traders who are fed up with intricate techniques. You don’t need to be an expert to follow the strategies of successful traders, learn from them, and maybe increase profits. Additionally, DTX Exchange offers a variety of assets for those who are restricted to trading solely cryptocurrency. In one location, you may access tokenized assets, FX, CFDs, and stocks. In this manner, you may use both traditional and digital markets to diversify your portfolio without having to transfer platforms.

Title: College basketball rankings: Top 100 And 1 transfers to know entering the 2024-25 season

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Transfer rankings go out the door once everyone steps onto campus, but it's clear as day that the hits (and misses) from the bonkers 2024 portal cycle will make or break numerous clubs that have championship expectations. Let's dive into 100 and 1 transfers to know this season. Factors like talent (duh), fit into the new roster and the scheme that they will be playing were heavily weighed. Transfer from: Seton Hall Richmond might never be a knockdown catch-and-shoot sniper, but his positional size is a cheat card on both ends of the floor. St. John's has the bones of an excellent defensive club with Richmond's nastiness and versatility at the forefront. Richmond, a 6-foot-6, 205-pound bowling ball, put up enormous numbers (15.7 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 5.1 apg) in a slow-paced, Seton Hall system last season. Rick Pitino is going to ramp up the tempo to lightning-strike levels, so Richmond is in an eruption spot. Transfer from: Florida Atlantic From Derrick Rose to Rob Dillingham and numerous ballers in between, John Calipari annually hands the keys to a lead guard and lets 'em cook. That formula won't change in Arkansas. Davis is poised to be the Razorbacks' new alpha. The Florida Atlantic transfer is armed to score with every tool in the shed. Ball screens, post-ups, transition, drives or handoffs? You name it, Davis can get buckets with it. Transfer from: Drake The 6-7, 210-pound forward is an elite three-level scorer. DeVries is truly a big guard. He makes high-difficulty shots look way too easy from the midrange and downtown. DeVries' off-movement shooting sets up everything about his game. He's so big and can create space so effortlessly. But he can also use his frame as a bootyball weapon in post-ups. He didn't get to the rim a ton, but he shot over 67% when he got there. DeVries is just an all-around star who passes it well, rebounds well, plays defense and gets to the free throw line religiously. He was a star for his dad, Darian, at Drake. He'll be a star for his dad at West Virginia. Transfer from: Wisconsin Storr would carry Wisconsin and occasionally, shoot the Badgers out of games. He'd terrify both coaching staffs. But his strengths are so obvious. The big, explosive wing is a brutally tough cover when he gets the rock on an empty side, rips it and gets downhill. Storr can put anybody on a poster, even Mount Edey. Storr has the most juice of anybody in Kansas' wing corps. If Storr embraces cutting with a purpose, Bill Self could spoon-feed him four points a game with brilliant halfcourt sets. If he embraces running the floor hard in transition, that's another easy six points a game with Dajuan Harris or Hunter Dickinson whipping bullet, look-ahead passes. Storr could saunter to 20-point nights in this scheme without breaking a sweat. If it coalesces properly, Storr could be Kansas' best player and an All-American candidate. Transfer from: Duke Roach-to-Baylor is one of the rare high-floor, high-ceiling additions in the 2024 portal cycle. The Duke transfer will waltz into Baylor's starting lineup and give Scott Drew a veteran who has played a variety of roles over the years. He can be a go-to scorer. He can be an initiating point guard. He can be a spot-up shooter. Baylor is also getting the best version of Roach. He shot 43% from 3-point range, 40% on midrange jumpers and 56% at the rim last season. Baylor can lean on Roach to go create a bucket for himself or others in late-clock situations. Maybe most importantly, Roach doesn't block any of Baylor's talented freshmen. If intriguing freshman point guard Rob Wright III is ready to go, Roach can slide to an off-ball role. If five-star VJ Edgecombe is ready to be a freshman sensation, Roach can shift to a secondary role, but Roach is a sleeper Big 12 Player of the Year candidate in this scheme. Transfer from: Indiana State Few bigs are as skilled as Avila. The former Indiana State star smartly stuck with his guy, Josh Schertz, who took the Saint Louis job. Schertz helped turn Avila into a star, and the duo should be up to their old tricks again in the Atlantic 10. Avila has established himself as one of the best small-ball bigs in the country. His skill is off the charts, both as a passer, low-post threat and a true floor-stretching big man. Saint Louis smartly added athletic forwards like Kalu Anya and AJ Casey to cover up some of Avila's deficiencies on the defensive end. He's not a shot-blocker, but Avila is a cheat code offensively, so that makes up for it. Cue the Cream Abdul-Jabbar or Larry Nerd jokes. Transfer from: Miami Playing with a ridiculous motor can make up for a lot. Omier, a 6-7, 240-pound forward, doesn't have elite height, but he plays so hard. Omier has turned himself into one of the best players in the country. Omier eats rebounds for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He will sprint the floor whether he's getting the ball or not. He sets good screens and plays with toughness and physicality. The little stuff is a constant. The intangibles are glorious. But Omier added an extra layer to his game with his 3-ball. Omier shot 35% on 68 attempts from downtown last season. Omier at the 5 will be a cheat code for a Baylor offense that didn't need much help. Five-shooter lineups will be a staple and the paint will be cleared for Baylor's guards to get to the tin. Baylor's offense has been awesome without a five-out option. Now it has one. Look out. Transfer from: Illinois Kansas State paid up to win the Coleman Hawkins sweepstakes, and Jerome Tang's next priority is getting the Dug McDaniel-Hawkins, pick-and-pop game humming right away. McDaniels' speed and Hawkins' deep range should open the floor up for Kansas State's offense, but Hawkins, the creator, might be more important than Hawkins, the shooter. His ability to carve up defenses as a passer and a handler will be a wrinkle that few other big men possess. Tang is also one of the best defensive coaches in the sport, and a now-healthy Hawkins gives Tang so much lineup versatility because he can switch onto guards and pester big wings. Hawkins has some of the best hands in the country. He should be a deflection machine for a K-State defense that usually wants to take the ball away. Transfer from: Utah State Danny Sprinkle is bringing Osobor with him again to a new job. This time with way more fanfare and a whole lot more NIL money. Osobor is one of the best small-ball centers in the portal who may have to downshift to the 4 if Franck Kepnang can ever get healthy. You would feel that duo. Osobor can play with anybody thanks to his rim pressure and playmaking. He flirted with some triple-doubles last season at Utah State, and Washington will need him to make great decisions if it wants to compete in a gauntlet of a Big Ten. There's optimism that Osobor can expand his jumper out to the perimeter but that hasn't happened yet. He's a career 64% free throw shooter. Sprinkle would be overjoyed if he can crack the 70% range because he could lead the Big Ten in free throw attempts next season. Transfer from: Washington State Indiana's pitiful pick-and-roll offense needed a life raft, and Rice will team up with Stanford transfer Kanaan Carlyle to be the solution. The vibrant point guard waltzes into a new-look backcourt with a real chance to be The Man. Rice is a jitterbug with the ball in his hands. An explosive first step helps Rice navigate into the paint left and right. Washington State played two non-shooting bigs so often last season, so IU's crowded paint won't be anything new to Rice. He's a capable shooter but he wasn't efficient last season because he was often Washington State's late-clock, bail-out guy. He makes up for it with a barrage of finishes and proficient reads in the ball-screen game. Rice is also an awesome point-of-attack defender who more than held his own for a Washington State defense that finished second in the Pac-12 in league play. Rice, simply, refuses to get screened. That's a skill. Rice can be a first-team, All-Big Ten player next season. Transfer from: Tennessee Aidoo was one of the few no-brainers in the portal. Aidoo is a plug-and-play big man who can do it all. He can protect the rim, uncork soft-touch jumpers, post up, run the floor, pass a little bit and convert his free throws. There's just so much to like about his game, and the table is set for Aidoo to be a top-two option at Arkansas. He'll be the outlet for Arkansas' electric backcourt. If his engine is revving non-stop, Aidoo can be one of the best big men in the country. Transfer from: Rutgers Alabama's rim defense went from a major strength in 2022-23 to a major weakness last season. Omoruyi's presence should single-handedly make Alabama a vicious rim defense again. The Rutgers transfer is an excellent drop-coverage defender who has an insane wingspan that he uses on both ends. The offensive ecosystem at Alabama is so much better than it was last season at Rutgers. Omoruyi as a legit lob threat who can loom in the dunker spot will be more effective than heavy post-up reps. Omoruyi is also one of the best raw athletes in the country. His dunks will shake the rim for days. Transfer from: USC Johnson is expected to be a massive piece of this UCLA team. He's one of the best all-around defenders in the country, and under Mick Cronin's guidance, he could transform into a Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year frontrunner. Playing with a point guard like Isaiah Collier was supposed to help Johnson's offensive game, but he regressed big-time as a shooter. There's still plenty of reason for cautious optimism of a bounceback in that regard. Johnson's slashing and defense give him such a high floor. He doesn't have to be a star for the Bruins, but fresh scenery could unlock his full bag. Johnson-to-UCLA is pound-for-pound as good a fit as anyone in the portal. Transfer from: Duke Mitchell was a piece for Duke, but he will be the piece for Mizzou. It's an excellent bet by both sides. Mitchell could give Dennis Gates a Kobe Brown-like, jumbo initiator who can be the centerpiece of an offense. His drives can be nasty, especially when an opposing center is guarding him. A top dawg role at Missouri should help him play with more confidence and assertiveness, two attributes that started to dissipate at Duke down the stretch. Mitchell can be a terrific two-way piece for the Tigers, and he's positioned to put up career-best numbers in his new home. Transfer from: BYU A hint of familiarity is just so huge for a new coach. Robinson had a breakout season under Mark Pope at BYU, and he smartly chose to run it back. This time he'll don the Kentucky threads. Robinson demands so much attention because he's a legit 6-7 shooter who never stops moving and can elevate over just about every defender. Robinson was also one of the top transition scorers in college basketball last season, despite only shooting 28% on his transition 3s. Some positive regression is coming in that department. As he continues to grow as an on-ball creator, Robinson's game will reach new heights. But he's a darn good college basketball player right now and could lead the SEC in 3-point shooting. .@Robinsonjaxx starting off HOT 🔥🥵19 PTS (7-12 FG, 5-9 3FG) | 3 REB pic.twitter.com/5l5Z9dGPFn Transfer from: Saint Mary's Mahaney is the only player on this UConn roster who has been the No. 1 option on the scouting report in college. That'll be invaluable. The 6-foot-3 junior guard has all the qualities that Hurley wants. He's tough. He's a winner. He's reliable. He's smart. Oh, and he can shoot it. Mahaney shot 38% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers as a sophomore and 46% as a freshman. Per Synergy, no high-major team generated a higher percentage of open catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season than … UConn. Mahaney should fit like a glove in this backcourt, and he's a killer in late-clock scenarios. UConn should maximize his strengths and cover up the warts in his game. Transfer from: East Carolina Small and DeVries give West Virginia a 1-2 punch that can play with anybody. Small was one of the top pick-and-roll scorers in the portal, but playing next to a stud scorer like DeVries should open up more spot-up opportunities for Small. That should be money in the bank. Small was a bad catch-and-shoot weapon at East Carolina, but he worked tirelessly to make it a strength. He splashed 47% of his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season at Oklahoma State. Small was a good No. 1 option for Oklahoma State last season. He should be a great No. 2 option for WVU in 2024-25. Transfer from: Indiana State Xavier scored the fifth-most points off handoffs last season, per Synergy. It added one of the best shooters in the portal who excelled on … handoffs. Only 15 players in the country made more 3-pointers off handoffs than Conwell last season. Conwell's shot profile is all 3-pointers or stuff at the rim. Conwell splashed over 42% of his catch-and-shoot triples and also shot over 62% at the rim. He was one of the best shooting guards in the country last season, and he's going to a scheme that excels at letting snipers cook. Conwell only has one season under his belt where he was a plus-shooter, but if that sticks (as expected), he can be one of the best players in the Big East. Transfer from: FAU New Michigan coach Dusty May did not get his entire FAU band to follow him to Michigan, but he did land maybe the most important one. Goldin can be one of the Big Ten's best big men next season. He's a complete load in the paint, but his improved mobility and touch around the basket has helped him become a much better target in the ball-screen game. Goldin isn't super fluid but he's so powerful. When he stays under control, he's a monster. Goldin is not some Nikola Jokic-like distributor, but he'll make the simple reads if he's doubled or on the short roll. He has real high-major size, so Michigan can play him one-on-one against just about anybody defensively. Goldin should be highly productive at Michigan. Transfer from: Arizona Indiana's rebounding was not a strength last season, but Ballo can single-handedly raise that floor significantly. The 7-foot, 260-pound center is impossible to move, and he's become one of the best rebounders in the sport, period. Ballo is an outstanding play-finisher in pick-and-rolls and should set bone-crushing screens for IU's ball-handlers. Ballo will seal his man and finish in the paint efficiently with post-ups. He also offers a solid interior defense. Arizona's top-10 defense was fantastic with Ballo on the floor, but he's pretty much limited to just drop coverage and teams will try to exploit that. Big men like Ballo are usually a cheat code for regular-season success, but he needs to get fully healthy. THE POWER. 😤@OumarBallo32 | #IUBB pic.twitter.com/oRjMj5nEgH Transfer from: Michigan No one scored more points in pick-and-rolls last season than McDaniel. Now, he's headed to the Octagon of Doom where short kings like Markquis Nowell (and Tylor Perry to a lesser extent) have put up numbers. McDaniel has legit defensive questions, but he's such a tough cover due to his speed, deep jumper and nifty floater. Kansas State's funkily-built roster is dependent on McDaniel being a superstar. His usage rate should be ridiculously high. He will put up numbers. Will it impact winning? Transfer from: Utah Smith's speed, competitiveness, defense and court vision should be everything Pitino craves from his point guards. The fit between Richmond and Smith has been questioned from the start. Both high-usage guards aren't high-volume, 3-point shooters. But Richmond is more of a halfcourt hub and Smith is awesome in transition. That push-pull should add some diversity to St. John's profile. Smith's ability to bend defenses and create long closeouts for Richmond to attack is the way for this duo to thrive together. Transfer from: Virginia Tech Pedulla is just an all-around great player. The 6-1 guard is a flamethrower shooter who gets to the free-throw line and is very unselfish. His efficiency numbers might have been better without numerous late-clock heaves that litter his Virginia Tech tape, but Pedulla is a real three-level scorer. He quickly assimilated to various roles at Virginia Tech, and that should pop up in a more-talented Ole Miss roster. If Ole Miss needs Pedulla to score, he will. If Ole Miss needs Pedulla to be a pass-first guy on some night, he'll do that, too. Pedulla's ability to play on or off the ball gives Chris Beard real flexibility with his lineup construction blueprints. Transfer from: New Mexico Texas Tech is a haven for former Mountain West Freshman of the Year winners. Last season, it was Darrion Williams. This year, it's Toppin. The 6-foot-9, 210-pound big man should slot in as Texas Tech's starting 4-man, and he can be one of the most impactful defenders on the roster. Toppin can slide those puppies on the perimeter while offering legitimate rim protection. Toppin was a stocks (steals and blocks) machine last season at New Mexico, and he's a junkyard dawg on the glass. Toppin has to grow as a shooter, both from downtown and from the free throw line, but Elijah Hawkins should generate so many open looks for Toppin to eat around the rim. Transfer from: Xavier Claude is the best addition for new USC coach Eric Musselman. The 6-foot-6, 207-pound guard will be the No. 1 option for this Trojans' club. Claude will be an impact defender from the jump, but USC will rely on him to be a late-game closer, too. Claude has outstanding positional size, and Xavier put him in a ton of ball screens. Expect more of the same at USC. Claude should take another step as a shooter which could help him become a true three-level scorer. If that happens, he can be one of the best players in the Big Ten. Don't be stunned if he flirts with some triple-doubles eventually. Jumbo-sized initiators have thrived under Musselman in the past. Claude is up next. Transfer from: South Florida The fifth-year senior is an utter deadeye on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. Youngblood drained 40% of his treys for three straight years. Why would that change next year in one of the best offensive systems in the country? But Youngblood shouldn't be painted as just a specialist. The South Florida transfer was well-coached into a well-rounded hooper. He's a broad-shouldered, thick veteran who isn't afraid to post up against smaller guards and rack up fouls. It's a good strategy when you're a career 82% free throw shooter. His pull-up jumper is so, so silky. Youngblood-to-Alabama is one of the best fits in the transfer portal. Transfer from: Harvard Mack is a shifty point guard who can break down defenses left and right and uncork two-handed, frozen ropes or one-handed, live-dribble whips to shooters. The sophomore's playmaking is why he's the jewel of this Georgetown transfer haul. Mack has all the physical tools to be one of the better point guards in the Big East. Transfer from: North Florida Lanier was one of the coveted guards in this transfer cycle because of his silky-smooth jumper that he can get to off the catch or off the bounce. His mechanics are a little funky. Sometimes his knees nearly touch the basketball on his gather and load, but he's able to get it off. Tennessee will likely play him off the ball and run him off a ton of floppy actions for 3-pointers, similar to what it did with Dalton Knecht. Tennessee's horde of nasty defenders should cover up some of Lanier's perceived deficiencies on that end. Transfer from: Oklahoma Uzan is a plug-and-play starting point guard for Kelvin Sampson who will provide an outstanding feel for the game and get the ball where it needs to go. Uzan finished with a two-to-one, assist-to-turnover ratio last season, but it can be way better at Houston. Uzan has loads of outstanding play-finishers that he can find along with two absolute net-shredders like LJ Cryer and Emanuel Sharp to keep the floor spaced properly. Uzan can manipulate the defense and find cutters or shooters at the very last second, and he's a willing, active defender. The jumper will be the swing skill set. Uzan can shoot it. He proved that as a freshman when he shot over 38% from downtown in Big 12 play. But he regressed last season. If he can get back to the mid-to-high 30s to go along with his fabulous floater, terrific court-mapping and well-rounded defense, Uzan can be a massive piece for a Houston club that has its sights set on a national championship run. Transfer from: Belmont Tyson was such a necessary addition to a UNC offense that so badly needed a big, rangy shooter. Tyson does not create much offense for himself off the bounce, but that could be another wrinkle to add to his game this offseason. Being able to attack smaller matchups with post-ups (similar to what Harrison Ingram did) would be a huge boost for Tyson's NBA stock. At minimum, Tyson is a plug-and-play sniper who was efficient from downtown, the midrange and at the rim, but Tyson is far from a finished product. Transfer from: James Madison Edwards should make everything easier for Louisville's rebuild. The James Madison veteran transfer is a true two-way player who was asked to do a little bit of everything. Edwards owned one of the highest pick-and-roll usages last season, and he's got lots of counters in his bag. He owns a tight spin move to get to the rim or to his soft-touch floater. Edwards has grown a ton as a shooter, but he's still at his best when he hits attack mode and seeks out the creases. Edwards is slated to earn a heavy usage rate when he's on the floor, and Louisville's decision to load up on big men who can stretch the floor should open the paint for Edwards' defense-bending drives. Transfer from: Ohio State Gayle has a real shot at being the jewel of Michigan's transfer haul. Gayle has all the qualities of a pass-dribble-shoot guard who also happens to be hellacious defensively. Being able to attack space off the bounce is essential in May's drive-and-kick offense. Gayle does all of that. He shot over 60% at the rim on enormous volume. Nearly 43% of Gayle's shot attempts were at the rim last season. He is a walking paint touch, and Gayle should continue to be a staple at the free throw line. Gayle's 3-point jumper is streaky and the mechanics are a bit iffy at times. But it's not unsolvable. There's All-Big Ten upside here one day with room for even more. 🪣🪣 pic.twitter.com/5L00SQVAnV Transfer from: Arizona Boswell, a Champaign native, is coming home to adopt the biggest role of his career. Boswell had an 18% usage rate last season at Arizona. He could sniff the 25% range at Illinois. Underwood pitched Boswell on an expanded offensive role, but Illinois certainly needs Boswell to buff up its perimeter defense. When dialed in, Boswell can be a difference-maker at the point of attack. Illinois landed prized international freshman Kasparas Jakucionis to handle most of the true point guard reps, which should allow Boswell to slide into a score-first, off-ball role. Boswell is a knockdown 3-point sniper, but he did not get to the rim often last season and barely shot any free throws. Attacking the rim is a massive priority for Underwood. It has to be a point of emphasis for Boswell. Transfer from: Alabama Griffen shot over 39% on 146 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season at Alabama. He's exactly the type of sidekick this Kansas roster needed to accentuate Hunter Dickinson and Dajuan Harris. But he's so much more than just a shooter. Griffen is a comfortable secondary handler who flashed pockets of nifty decision-making. Griffen could be an elite 3-and-D wing once the D catches up to the 3-point shooting. He's shown flashes on that end, but it's time to level up. Kansas is banking on it. Transfer from: Oklahoma McCollum is a stud. He was one of the top pick-and-roll scorers in the country last season for an undermanned Oklahoma club. McCollum is so dynamic off the bounce, and he can operate as Georgia Tech's lead guard or as a spot-up assassin next to emerging sophomore Nait George. McCollum's 31% 3-point mark is a bit deceiving. McCollum often had to operate as Oklahoma's late-clock, bail-us-out option. He shot just 4-for-24 on 3-pointers with less than four seconds left on the shot clock. McCollum can be one of the best offensive guards in the ACC with a few subtle tweaks in his game. Transfer from: Texas Tech Greg McDermott has a long history of maximizing his best offensive players. Isaacs should be up next to jump on Creighton's jetpack joy ride. Isaacs' jumper last season was hit-or-miss, partially due to a hip injury and some iffy shot selection. But he's fearless and hard to contain off the bounce. Isaacs shot just 43% at the rim as a freshman, but that improved slightly to 48% last season. Is another spike coming? Isaacs will be Creighton's best late-clock option and his pick-and-roll chemistry with Kalkbrenner should be on full display. Isaacs is an easy pick to lead this Bluejays team in scoring. Transfer from: Oregon State Bilodeau is a huge get for a UCLA offense that needed fixin' in the worst way. UCLA was one of the worst layup-shooting teams in the country last season. Bilodeau was automatic around the rim. He finished with the sixth-highest offensive efficiency rating in Pac-12 play, per KenPom. He shot over 71% at the rim, and he's a legitimate floor-spacer. Bilodeau should give point guard Dylan Andrews his first real pick-and-pop threat. He's such a big offensive upgrade over what UCLA trotted out last season in its frontcourt, but Cronin will demand more out of him defensively. Transfer from: Kentucky Wagner was outshined by Reed Sheppard and Rob Dillingham at Kentucky, but his freshman year wasn't nearly as bad as some would lead you to believe. Wagner is good, and he can put opposing perimeter defenders in hell with his drives. Wagner is excellent at attacking the top foot and getting his defender off balance. The drives were impactful but Wagner has to improve finishing around the rim. That's arguably more important than continuing to progress as a shooter. Arkansas should give Wagner the runway to be a huge piece of this backcourt, but there are questions about his fit next to ball-dominant guards like Davis and freshman Boogie Fland. Maybe last season's experience next to Sheppard, Dillingham and Antonio Reeves will help Wagner find the sweet spot at Arkansas. Transfer from: Miami Poplar is really good at what he does. The 6-5 guard is a proven, high-level shooter who splashed over 37% of his treys in each of the past two seasons. He's also capable of attacking the rack with a vengeance for some monster posters, and Poplar will stick his face in the fan on the glass. He's been a productive role player, but Poplar transferred to Villanova to show he can be more than just a spot-up guard. Poplar wants the ball in his hands as a primary initiator, and Villanova's backcourt needs a star. Poplar believes it's his turn to prove that he can be that alpha once and for all. Transfer from: Texas It's been a struggle for Hunter to stay consistent offensively, but at his best, he's still one of the premier on-ball defenders in the game. Hunter is the closest thing to a true, set-the-table point guard of this new-look Tigers bunch, but his experience playing both on and off the ball at Texas should pay off next to new running mate PJ Haggerty. Memphis certainly needs Hunter's 3-point jumper to stick to open up extra space for Haggerty's drives. Hunter has shot over 36% from downtown in conference play in back-to-back seasons. Hunter should be unleashed to be in the hunt for First Team All-AAC honors. Transfer from: Wisconsin Hepburn is so much better when he doesn't have to be a go-to scorer. When Hepburn can unleash extra energy on defense, his value elevates. The Wisconsin transfer was well-schooled on the defensive end under Greg Gard, and he projects to be one of the best on-ball defenders in the ACC while giving Louisville's offense a steady hand. Hepburn is a career 36% 3-point shooter who makes great decisions and can go for 20 on nights when he has the right matchup. But the veteran point guard hits the floor trying to make others better. Pat Kelsey's high-tempo system could unlock the best version of Hepburn. Transfer from: Minnesota Hawkins is one of the top initiator point guards in the country, and this was a fantastic coup for Texas Tech's new-look backcourt. The Minnesota transfer will be the table-setter for Toppin's buckets around the rim and the 3s from Chance McMillian and Kerwin Walton. He will have the keys to this Texas Tech offense, and Hawkins deserves that opportunity. Hawkins throws exceptional lobs and he's so easy to play with. Hawkins also shot over 38% from downtown on over four attempts per game during Big Ten play, so you can't go under every screen. That opens up more space in the ball-screen game. Hawkins is only 5-foot-11 and 165 pounds, so he's an easy target for opposing offenses, but Texas Tech has insulated him with sturdy perimeter defenders to cover up some of his weaknesses on that end. Transfer from: Furman Pegues is a killer. He will take and make tough shots, and that type of guard is exactly what Auburn needed in the portal. Pegues played a variety of roles at Furman, first as a spot-up guy playing off Mike Bothwell and Jalen Slawson and then as a lead guard who had to initiate everything. That experience and variety should pay off right away for the Tigers. His nifty drives, pure jumper and smart playmaking give Pegues a chance to be Auburn's No. 2 option behind Johni Broome from the jump. Big fan of defense ➡️ offense plays pic.twitter.com/w7FMzFDSxU Transfer from: Georgia Tech Auburn's offense could bog down in late-clock situations last season, but it addressed that issue with Pegues and Kelly. At Georgia Tech, Kelly had to be a high-usage scorer who took tough shots. At Auburn, he'll have to embrace a lower-usage role with the benefit of much cleaner looks. Don't be fooled by the percentages, Kelly is a dynamic shooter and he can hit some tough stepbacks against even the best defense. Auburn coach Bruce Pearl has raved about Kelly often this season, often describing him as one of the best shooters he's ever had. Transfer from: South Carolina Johnson was a top-of-the-scouting report killer for South Carolina last season. He had a ton of responsibilities on his plate offensively. That experience should reap benefits in Round II at Ohio State. Johnson should slide right next to Bruce Thornton and form one of the top bucket-getting guard duos in the league next season. Johnson was the best version of himself at South Carolina with a pick-and-pop big man like BJ Mack. That's still an unproven question for Ohio State's frontcourt. But there's no doubt Johnson's drives are impactful. That first step is nasty. He'll be productive in his return to Ohio State. Transfer from: Eastern Washington Remember when Great Osobor followed his coach, Danny Sprinkle, from Montana State to Utah State and became a household name? Something similar could happen with Coward who followed David Riley from Eastern Washington to Washington State. The 6-foot-6, 205-pound wing is on NBA radars thanks to his versatility. Riley smartly uses Coward like the queen on the chess board, posting him up against smaller matchups or letting him stretch the floor and bend defenses with his drives. Coward shot 75% at the rim and 40% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. That'll play. He's a two-way player, too. Coward should get way more exposure in the WCC. Transfer from: Belmont All of Gillespie's advanced offensive stats last season at Belmont were terrific. Gillespie was extremely efficient from 3-point range, and he shot nearly 70% at the rim in halfcourt settings. That's nuts for a 6-foot-1 point guard. The question is whether all of that efficiency will translate against high-major opponents. Maryland is banking on it. Gillespie does not have to be Jahmir Young 2.0, but he'll get the first crack at replacing the Terps' All-Big Ten guard. Gillespie's dribble-handoff game with skilled five-star big man Derik Queen should be terrific. Transfer from: UNC Wilmington TCU coach Jamie Dixon has leaned into a heavy-transition offense the last few years, and White can help keep that train rolling. The slashing wing is a good, low-volume shooter, but he's just an awesome driver who constantly breaks down defenses and gets to the paint. He's so wiry and tough to stay in front of. History says you can find productive transfer-up targets from the CAA ranks, and White is up next. He's one of the best wing-handlers in the portal, and White can be one of TCU's better defenders from the jump. He doesn't check off quite as many boxes as Emanuel Miller, but White should replace a bunch of that production. Transfer from: Arkansas Mark was one of the top isolation scorers in the country last season. Mark shot over 70% at the rim and drew nearly five fouls per 40 minutes. He's constantly putting pressure on the defense with his drives and a midrange jumper he can comfortably get to whenever. He shot a career-best 36% from 3-point range for Arkansas, but it was on a bit lower volume (3.2 attempts per game). Mark should be one of Texas' best two-way players, and he might earn that closer role. Transfer from: Evansville Humrichous was one of the most impactful players in the country last season. Evansville was competent with Humrichous on the floor (+3.6 net rating) and a complete dumpster fire without him (-16.8 net rating). Illinois wants at least four shooters on the floor at all times, and that's Humrichous' game. Humrichous shot 42% on 142 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. The 6-foot-9 forward can fire over just about anybody. Humrichous also owns real wiggle off the bounce. If the right matchup presents itself, Illinois will be comfortable giving Humrichous the green light to go to work one-on-one to get to his fadeaway, midrange jumper. Humrichous is easily one of the top stretch forwards in the portal, and there weren't many of them in the free agency pool. Transfer from: Saint Mary's Saint Mary's defense was impenetrable when Jefferson was on the floor. Now, he heads to Iowa State to be a key cog for another elite defense. He'll guard those rangy forwards in the Big 12 that Milan Momcilovic would've had issues with. Jefferson's playmaking, defense and rebounding give him such a high floor. Iowa State can use him to back down good matchups from the slot, and he's a willing passer who can spray it and create advantages for drivers like Keshon Gilbert or shooters like Momcilovic, Tamin Lipsey or Curtis Jones. Jefferson is easily one of the most talented forwards T.J. Otzelberger has coached at Iowa State, and if the jumper continues to improve, he will leap into a new tier. Transfer from: Ohio State Richmond and Smith are the big-name gets for St. John's, but Scott is such a stud. There was a real shortage of stretch 4s in the portal, but St. John's landed one of the best out there. Scott shot over 37% on 115 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season, and he is very comfortable getting into his post-ups from the slot. Plus, Scott projects to be an outstanding multi-positional defender. His floor spacing will be invaluable for St. John's. He might never sit. Transfer from: Pepperdine Everyone is looking for forwards as well-rounded as Ajayi. Gonzaga scooped him up quickly, and it was super familiar with his game after he tangled with the Zags often during his Pepperdine days. Ajayi should get the first crack at replacing versatile stud Anton Watson. Ajayi is more of a wing-handler who can play on the perimeter thanks to his gorgeous stroke and ability to attack long closeouts, but he's got a proven knack for rebounding. Gonzaga can use him in post-ups, as a popper in pick-and-rolls or even as the initiator for some ball-screen reps. Ajayi should be a high-level connector for a Gonzaga squad that has National Championship aspirations. Transfer from: Northern Colorado Saint Thomas balled out in the Dalton Knecht role at Northern Colorado. He's a big, physical wing who shot over 67% at the rim last season. That efficiency might come down in the Big Ten, but that aggressiveness has to be maintained. Thomas should settle right into a No. 1B option behind Claude. He'll have a high usage rate, and USC can use him as a post-up weapon or in ball screens. Thomas could also be featured as USC's pseudo-point guard, but his growth as a catch-and-shoot weapon is key. Transfer from: Virginia Tech The 6-10 big man should give Miami's defense some much-needed size on the back line. Kidd's best asset is his low-post dominance. Kidd was one of the top post-up scorers in college basketball last season and he has great hands in the pick-and-roll. Miami smartly added East Carolina transfer sniper Brandon Johnson to this frontcourt to make it even harder to send another big to double-team Kidd. Miami just has a cavalry of shooting surrounding Kidd. Transfer from: Drexel Skilled size is everything for Mark Pope's offense, and a center who can be a playmaker on the perimeter is vital. Williams is not a 3-point shooter, but he can clear open space with screens and dribble hand-offs. He's also an adept passer who had a 17% assist rate this past season at Drexel. Kentucky will also rely heavily on Williams to protect the rim and scoop up boards. The 6-foot-10, 265-pound big man has enough bricks in his britches to handle one-on-one coverage against just about any big man, so Kentucky won't have to send double teams. Playing with incoming sophomore Brandon Garrison might be a blessing in disguise for Williams. Kentucky can keep him fresh, out of foul trouble and his motor should be revving for the 20-to-25 minutes he's on the floor. Seven foot playmaker 🦄12 PTS (5-6 FG) | 6 AST | 5 REB pic.twitter.com/QH3oEW0oR7 Transfer from: Louisville \Huntley-Hatfield is the jewel of the NC State transfer haul. Huntley-Hatfield's tape was impressive amidst a rocky Louisville campaign. He became a double-double threat every night and played with outstanding effort. He's 6-foot-10 and 240 pounds with the ability to play multiple defensive coverages, and Huntley-Hatfield should continue to grow as a floor-stretcher. There's no reason to think he won't be a productive monster for NC State who knows how to feature its big men. Transfer from: Kentucky Bradshaw might make or break Ohio State. If his production matches his potential, the Buckeyes could be one of the best teams in the Big Ten. Bradshaw's ability to stretch the floor would open up the paint for Johnson and Thornton to get to the rack. The former five-star, 7-1 center was also regarded as a big-time rim protector during his high school days. Ohio State is banking on a Kel'el Ware-like bounceback season in a new place with a full bill of health. Transfer from: Tulsa Haggerty is a lean, mean, foul-drawing machine. The Tulsa transfer can put a ton of pressure on the rim, and his floater is a real weapon. And he pitches a tent, starts a fire and calls the free throw line home. Haggerty shot double-digit free throws in 15 games last season. That's a skill. Penny Hardaway needs Haggerty to shoot it better from downtown and find a way to impact winning without super high volume. Haggerty owned a 30% usage rate last season at Tulsa. It was his team. Memphis is loaded with talent. Haggerty's usage might not sniff 30% with Tyrese Hunter, Dain Dainja and Colby Rogers all needing to get theirs. But Haggerty's a heckuva talent who can be one of the engines of this club. Transfer from: FAU Martin is a big, physical 2-guard who will hunt his jumper and is a menace in transition. Martin struggled with injuries a bit last season, but if he's back to full strength, Florida was a smart landing spot for both sides. Florida coach Todd Golden is likely banking on Martin being the Gators' best perimeter defender. Martin gets in some trouble when he tries to create his own offense, but he's awesome in transition, an area that Florida heavily prioritizes. Transfer from: Michigan State Hoggard's strengths are obvious. Hoggard is a very good defender who can lock down just about any perimeter option. He's a terrific playmaker who nearly racked up a 3-to-1, assist-to-turnover ratio this past season. Hoggard shot a serviceable 35% from 3-point range last season, but his issues offensively came inside the arc. For a big, strong guard, Hoggard struggled mightily to finish around the rim and his pull-up jumper went off the rails. Hoggard shot just 5-for-42 on those pull-ups. That almost feels too bad to replicate. Positive regression seems inevitable. Transfer from: South Dakota State Mayo is just a bucket, but his shots will come in different spots at Kansas than they did at South Dakota State. Mayo is expected to move into more of an off-ball role which should unlock more catch-and-shoot opportunities. Mayo drilled 43% of his 96 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season. Oh, and Mayo is a midrange maestro. That ability to go get a bucket should be a huge stress reliever for a KU offense that needed an extra jolt. Mayo is probably closer to a two-level scorer than a true three-level scorer, but his comfort as a primary scorer/creator at South Dakota State should help him ace a slightly scaled-down role for Kansas. We could get used to this 🎯#Payheed x @zekexmayo pic.twitter.com/RI8yundO7m Transfer from: Villanova Oregon crushed it in the portal and it starts with Bamba. The Villanova transfer is good at a little bit of everything. He shot over 43% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season and he can smartly attack long closeouts. Bamba is capable of handling some on-ball responsibilities as well, and he'll be an impactful defender for the Ducks. Bamba is a plug-and-play, two-way starter who should be a double-digit performer, at minimum. Transfer from: Stanford Stojakovic has excellent bloodlines and needed a fresh start after a rough freshman-year showing at Stanford. The flashes of brilliance were there as an off-ball sniper who is an excellent cutter and can smoothly drive it. When he played with confidence (check the USC film), Stojakovic was a baller. But the dark days were grim. The odds are strong that Stojakovic is going to be a really, really good player one day, but he has to clean up the mechanics on his jumper and continue to improve his body. Similar to Jaylon Tyson, Stojakovic made a wise choice in the portal to go somewhere where he can earn a high usage rate and have the ball in his hands from the jump. Transfer from: Oakland Good things happen when you pair a smart player like Townsend with a smart coach like Tommy Lloyd. The 6-6, 228-pound forward isn't a stretch 4 (he's made 50 3-pointers in 126 games), but he's closer to a wing handler who can constantly create advantages. He's in that Jaime Jaquez-lite mold as an excellent post-up weapon, good cutter, smart decision-maker who will not hurt you. Arizona ranked outside the top-60 nationally in points per possession in halfcourt settings, per Synergy. Not bad, but not great, either. An elite transition offense helped Arizona finish No. 11 overall in offensive efficiency, but there were real pockets when Arizona's offense could get bogged down. Townsend might be part of the solution. Townsend provides another halfcourt hub who can win one-on-one matchups and get to the free throw line. Transfer from: Ohio State Opponents shot just 54% at the rim against Ohio State when Okpara was on the floor. His length, court coverage and rim presence are extremely valuable. Okpara is a willing role player who is an excellent lob threat in pick-and-rolls, but he's not a center you want to run your offense through. Okpara still has work to do to become a reliable post-up scorer, but he should team up well with Zakai Zeigler's pinpoint lobs. Transfer from: Iowa Perkins has been a staple in Iowa's rotation for three years but the leap into being a legitimate First Team, All-Big Ten guy never truly materialized. But the 6-4, 205-pound guard is the most proven piece on this Mizzou roster. He's a very good scorer at two levels. Perkins loves to get to the middle of the floor for a midrange jumper. He's also constantly putting pressure on the rim and getting to the free throw line. Nearly 40% of his shots last season came at the rim, per Synergy, and he averaged over five free throw attempts per game in Big Ten play. His decision-making overall really grew which is encouraging. Perkins finished with a 2.4-to-1, assist-to-turnover ratio. That'll work every single day of the week and twice on Sundays. Transfer from: Kansas State When Kaluma keeps it simple, he can be effective. Kaluma shot a career-best 36% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season at Kansas State. The 6-foot-7, 225-pound wing is a willing rebounder and has been part of good defenses both at Kansas State and Creighton. Kaluma can be an impactful piece when he attacks straight-line drives, drills spot-up 3s and hunts buckets in transition before the defense gets set. But he gets in so much trouble when he tries to be a top of the scouting report creator. Kaluma had a dreadful, negative assist-to-turnover ratio. He takes tough shots off the dribble and doesn't make 'em. He's yet to record an above-average offensive rating in conference play in each of the last three years. The flashes are there, but eliminating the negative plays will be so important. Transfer from: North Texas Edwards is a bucket. He was the high-usage engine of North Texas' offense, and Edwards finished with fantastic efficiency from downtown and the midrange despite his tape being filled with a ton of tough shots. The 6-foot guard just knows how to score, and a lightning-quick first step makes him such a tough cover. Vanderbilt's decision to pair a defensive-first playmaker like Hoggard with a score-first guard like Edwards looks like smart roster-building. Transfer from: Kentucky The powerful, 6-8 wing will be one of Arkansas' best multi-positional defenders. Thiero has pogo-stick bounce and can be an excellent secondary rim protector. He's probably best-suited guarding bigger wings or forwards, but Thiero can definitely hang on the perimeter and he'll always chip in on the glass. Offensively, he's a connector and a high-energy role player. Thiero is an outstanding cutter and offensive rebounder, but he can also attack long closeouts. Trying to hide your center on Thiero was not a great idea because of his fluid drives. But he needs to finish better at the rim and continue to expand his perimeter game. Thiero is rapidly getting better. He's a good bet to be in Arkansas' closing lineup because of his defense. Transfer from: Texas Cincinnati was an outstanding offensive-rebounding team while also being one of the best rim defenses. Mitchell will fortify those areas even more. The 6-8, 205-pound forward is one of the best athletes in the country. He covers so much ground defensively and racked up a block or a steal in 31 of 34 games last season. Cincinnati can play Mitchell at the 4 next to Aziz Bandaogo and build an iron wall around the rim. Cincinnati will dominate the glass with those two guys on the floor together, even if the floor-spacing is a real question. Mitchell has not made a jump as a shooter yet, but he's a phenomenal play-finisher. Mitchell shot over 77% at the rim and threw down a whopping 55 dunks last season. Mitchell is a legitimate lob threat and an excellent cutter who never stops moving. Maybe most importantly, Cincinnati had a way higher transition rate than Texas. That's money in the bank for Mitchell who can put on a show in the open floor. Transfer from: Dayton One of the best 3-point shooters in the country is joining one of the best offensive schemes for 3-point shooters. Is there truly anything else to say? .@kobybrea is just getting started 😮‍💨13 PTS (5-7 FG, 3-5 3FG) | 2 AST pic.twitter.com/dumTubh5aY Transfer from: Arkansas Gonzaga doesn't have many holes on the roster, but the Zags' staff hit the portal looking for one more get out of jail free card. Insert Battle. The Arkansas transfer won't be asked to shoulder a monster, alpha role, but he can slide into any lineup, whether off the bench or in the starting lineup, and just go get buckets. This is the best ecosystem of Battle's career. He'll give Gonzaga that rim pressure that it certainly needs from its backcourt. Transfer from: Florida Last offseason, Kugel was regarded as one of the top NBA prospects in the SEC, but his sophomore season at Florida was a major disappointment culminating with multiple "DNPs" in the SEC Tournament. Kugel's body language was ... not great. Mississippi State is hopeful a fresh scene can unlock his sky-high potential. The 6-foot-5, 205-pound guard just floats off the ground. He's a fantastic athlete, and that comes alive in transition. But his decision-making has to markedly improve and quickly. While the turnovers were harmful, the shot selection might have been even more detrimental. Kugel can make every shot in the book but that can be a blessing and a curse. This is an upside play by Chris Jans. If it clicks, Kugel can be the best overall player on the team, even better than stud sophomore guard Josh Hubbard. Transfer from: Stanford Angel shot over 43% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers and over 70% at the rim. That will play all day, every day. The 6-8, 240-pound, fifth-year senior just plays winning basketball. You can post him up against smaller defenders and he'll drag slower-footed bigs onto the perimeter. He's not overly dynamic but the Stanford transfer can knife to the rim and he's a heady cutter. Angel is only additive to everything else Oregon has cooking. Dana Altman found a gem. Transfer from: Tulane James is an elite role player who Jon Scheyer smartly added to this rotation. James is a warrior who rarely came off the floor at Tulane. He's not some high-volume sharpshooter, but 39% on 81 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers will play. He makes defenses pay for leaving him open. But it's all the little things that make James a stud. He's an excellent defender who is absolutely chiseled. He can hound shooters, big wings or lead guards while providing a little secondary rim protection, too. James might not start but he's going to carve out a major role for Duke. Transfer from: Stanford Carlyle was a former prized prospect but his freshman year at Stanford was filled with extreme highs (31 points against Washington State) and gut-wrenching lows (4-for-17 shooting against Colorado). He gives IU a second dynamic lead guard who can go get buckets in pick-and-rolls. He took more off-the-dribble 2-point jumpers (55) than catch-and-shoot 3-pointers (53). Get to the middle of the floor, and make something happen. That's his game. Refining his decision-making is paramount because the turnovers and shot selection were rough last season. Carlyle has a chance to be an excellent player down the road if the jumper sticks and he improves his meager 19% rim rate. He's too fast to let defenses off the hook by settling for pull-ups that often. A sixth-man role could make sense, but Carlyle can earn a spot in the starting (and closing) lineup if he guards his tail off. Transfer from: Toledo Xavier's floor spacing should be immaculate with Maddox and Conwell on the floor together. The Toledo transfer shot over 40% from 3-point range in three of his four seasons at the college ranks. The 6-foot-2, 195-pound guard is just a flamethrower, and he has sneaky bounce when he attacks the rack. Transfer from: Duke Power was buried at Duke, but he will get every opportunity to be a featured piece for Virginia. Power, a former five-star prospect, is a big-time shooter who showed real playmaking abilities in high school. Off-movement shooting is so valuable in Virginia's blocker-mover offense, and Power can do all of that. He's poised to be a productive ACC starter next season, but if Virginia can keep him around for multiple years, he has a chance to be a real star. Transfer from: Oregon State Texas has so many guys who are used to being the featured scorer. There's only one ball, so that could force Pope to change his game to help everyone else. Pope had to be a scorer first for an undermanned Oregon State club, and he did it well. Pope has a phenomenal jumper. He'll give Texas' offense real gravity, but he can be a bit jumper-reliant. He had a very low rim rate last season, but Pope was a sniper both off the catch (38%) and off the bounce (36%). IPope's jumper seems legit. That gives him a high floor. Transfer from: Minnesota Payne is a complete handful. Texas A&M is one of the elite offensive rebounding programs in the country, and the Minnesota transfer had the third-highest offensive rebound rate during Big Ten play. That'll work. He's so powerful and explosive. Payne is an awesome target in pick-and-rolls, and his physicality shows up on the defensive end. Payne plays really, really hard, and there's some intriguing skill starting to develop here too. Payne can occasionally run into problems when he faces up at the elbow and tries to create, but that freelancing ability is fun. He'll make some decent reads, too. He's not just an awesome screen-setting big man who will be a play-finisher, glass-cleaner and rim protector. There's more coming to his game in time. Transfer from: Chicago State Cardet is going to be a big part of the Devin Carter Replacement Plan. The 6-6, Chicago State transfer wing just wants to get to the rack. Over 50% of his shots last season came at the rim and he had a sky-high free throw rate. Playing off two feet will be essential to finish off his drives a bit better. Cardet is capable of getting going from all three levels, but simplifying his game will be key to finding success in a Big East that is so well-scouted If healthy, Bryce Hopkins is Providence's alpha, but Cardet is another capable double-digit scorer who can be the engine of the offense. He's a better shooter than the numbers suggest. He shot over 35% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season, but he rarely played off the ball at Chicago State. Getting freed up for more spot-up opportunities should help Cardet's efficiency rise. Cardet should be an exceptional defender under Kim English who is one of the rising defensive coaches in the game. Transfer from: Omaha Michigan State needed a bucket-getting wing, and Fidler should get the first crack at earning that job. Fidler doesn't beat you with loads of athleticism, but he does a ton of his work before he gets the rock and the jumper is pure. Fidler was much more effective playing off the ball, and Michigan State will continue that trend. Improving as an on-the-move shooter would be huge. Fidler can use his size to rise over smaller defenders, and he uses shot fakes to clear space well and draw fouls. Fidler should be an efficient play-finisher for MSU who could be the answer in late-clock scenarios. Transfer from: Boston College Zackery is only additive and doesn't detract from anything else Clemson has cooking. He's thickly built and should be solid in so many areas. He's a career 40% 3-point shooter on just under three attempts per game. He guards. He takes good shots. Zackery developed into a nice ball-screen initiator with a pick-and-pop big man like Quintin Post at Boston College. Clemson can do some of the same things with Zackery and Ian Schieffelin or Chauncey Wiggins. Transfer from: Vanderbilt Lubin does not have elite length or size, but he will outwork you. The Vanderbilt transfer has a ridiculous motor and attacks the rim with a vengeance. His second-jump burst is real. Lubin grew significantly as a roller, and he'll be a rock-solid, ball-screen partner for UNC's elite backcourt. UNC needed a reliable play-finisher offensively, and Lubin can do all that and then some. He's not some elite back-line defensive anchor, but Lubin should be able to play multiple coverages defensively and hold serve against some bigger 4s and smaller 5s. Transfer from: South Florida Pryor could be the X-Factor for this Louisville offense. Pat Kelsey just desperately needs the South Florida transfer to keep making 3-pointers at a high clip to pull centers away from the rim. Pryor is very comfortable playing in space and attacking long closeouts, but he gets very hard to guard in transition after he grabs-and-goes and attacks defenses who can't get set yet. His playmaking and unselfishness is something. Transfer from: Virginia Milicic is a sharp stretch 4. He shot 38% from 3-point range and that's his path to playing time. But he's not just roaming around the perimeter. Milicic is comfortable handling it and attacking open spaces off the bounce. He finished everything around the rim, and he's a tough cover off the ball. He'll dart in and out of screens, cut baseline, 45-cut and everything in between. Milicic's nose for the ball on the defensive glass should translate. Tennessee will have to adjust some things personnel-wise for Milicic's defense, but he's not a stiff. He should be just fine guarding 4s. Transfer from: Vanderbilt Lawrence is a streaky shooter, but he's best when he's slashing to the tin. Two seasons ago, he shot over 64% at the rim at ridiculously high volume. Everything kinda cratered last season for a Vanderbilt team that splintered, but Lawrence's talent is still obvious. Lawrence is easily the most proven, high-major scorer on this much-improved Georgia roster. For the Dawgs to reach their goals, Lawrence has to regain his form and play like one of the best two-way guards in the SEC again. Transfer from: Michigan UConn has made the big-man platoon a huge part of their roster-construction gameplans, and it's not going anywhere in 2024-25. Samson Johnson and Reed will form a two-headed monster. Johnson is bouncy, athletic and extremely fast. Reed will bring more power. The 6-10, 265-pound big man has been watching plenty of Adama Sanogo tape. That type of physical, low-post monster is such a different archetype compared to Johnson. Reed is an elite rebounder, and he's going to draw fouls because of his activity and pure, raw power. UConn's proven player-development chops should be a huge boon. Transfer from: Ohio State Everything looks better when you shoot 46% from 3-point range on just 62 attempts, but Middleton should head into his sophomore season at Seton Hall with plenty of confidence. the former prized recruit was utilized as an off-ball wing at Ohio State who only had a 15% usage rate. Seton Hall can bump that up a bit, but we'll see just how ready Middleton is to be one of the top guys on the scouting report. If the 3-point stroke is real, Middleton will be a massive piece of this club. Seton Hall coach Shaheen Holloway needs him to stretch the floor, attack long closeouts and be a nasty wing defender. Middleton left Ohio State looking for more. Seton Hall gives him the chance at a huge role. Transfer from: Princeton This is one of the best fits in the portal. Allocco is a pure hooper. The Princeton transfer is so comfortable playing mismatch-hunting basketball, which is a staple of Micah Shrewsberry's game plan. He shot over 40% from downtown on both off-the-dribble 3-pointers and catch-and-shoot treys. He's also super comfortable getting to his midrange jumper or slicing his way to the rim. The decision-making is a nice benefit, too. Allocco has to get stronger to make his drives more impactful. He's also not the most explosive dude on the floor, but the wiggle is real. Allocco is a needle-mover, and Shrewsberry should have some fun cooking up some open looks for him to feast. Transfer from: Yale Wolf's tape is so fun. The Yale product can drop dimes from the middle of the floor, and he shot 35% on 83 3-pointers last season, so you have to respect the jumper. Michigan will likely try to play Wolf next to Goldin. Multiple 7-footers on the floor at the same time could be a little clunky, but both guys are so smart and Wolf's playmaking and shooting might make it work. Wolf isn't quite as intimidating a rim protector as Goldin, but his hands in drop coverage are sticky. He forced numerous deflections at Yale. Wolf is going to be a useful piece next year. He could be a terror in 2025-26 when Goldin exhausts his eligibility. 🐺🐺 pic.twitter.com/6VJAWxmCzA Transfer from: Syracuse Brown is an outstanding multi-positional defender who will help this unit compete to be the best defensive team in the country. Brown was an All-ACC defensive team selection in 2023-24, but he might be even better at Duke now that he doesn't have to bang with centers every single play. Everyone wants to be a switch-everything defender, but Brown actually is one. The Syracuse transfer will help douse so many fires, and his cutting and playmaking off the short roll will be a massive asset to Duke's offensive attack. Brown is another elite role player. Don't be surprised if Brown is a staple of Duke's closing lineup. Transfer from: Tennessee What an addition for Mike Rhoades in Happy Valley. Dilione was expected to have a bigger role at Tennessee last season, but Dalton Knecht stole all the headlines. Dilione now lands at Penn State and could be a phenomenal buy-low spot to get his career back on track. Dilione provides a huge jumbo playmaker who can stuff the stat sheet. On paper, the fit next to Ace Baldwin could be very fun if Dilione's jumper is legit. Baldwin is already a terrific on-ball defender and Dilione can grow into one too. This one has a chance to be a Hunter Sallis-like explosion spot for Penn State. Transfer from: Hofstra Carlos was a two-year starter for a very good Hofstra program, and he'll help fill the Judah Mintz void in Syracuse's backcourt. Carlos was one of the top pass-first, initiator point guards in the portal, and this has every opportunity to be a strong match for both sides. Carlos' ability to stretch the floor should free up the paint for JJ Starling to get more traction on his drives. Carlos is very jump-shot reliant (just 22% of his shots last season came at the rim), but the stroke is pure. Transfer from: Iowa State Well would you look at that, another five-star is transferring to Wake Forest after a disappointing first stop. It's up to Steve Forbes, aka the Transfer Portal Whisperer, to unlock the version of Biliew that never came to fruition at Iowa State. Biliew's freshman-year tape wasn't anything to write home about . He looked completely out of sorts and struggled to find any sort of footing for an Iowa State club that wanted to win big right away. Forbes is betting on the pedigree and a new scene. The former five-star recruit has athletic tools galore, and buffing up the frontcourt athleticism was one of the huge objectives for Wake Forest. Biliew doesn't need to be an offensive star right away, but he can have a huge impact on this team as a highly-active defensive whiz who can douse fires. If Wake Forest wants to win the ACC, it has to get through Duke. Who is the best bet to guard Cooper Flagg? Biliew. Transfer from: Arkansas DePaul has added so much shooting on the perimeter, but it needs someone to break down the defense and get into the paint. Insert Blocker. The Arkansas transfer is the most natural point guard on this roster and he punctured opposing defenses at will last season. He should lead this team in free throw attempts while offering nasty perimeter defense. The former prized recruit has a runway to a major role at DePaul and the roster construction is set up to best maximize his skills and keep the paint clear for his drives. This could end up being a diamond in the rough for DePaul. Transfer from: High Point Learn the name. This one has a chance to be a gem. Miles was one of the top pick-and-roll, bucket-getters in the country last season at High Point, and Porter Moser has a proven hit rate of getting plenty out of transfer-up guards from the lower levels. Miles was efficient in every area. He shot over 65% at the rim, 36% from 3-point range and 50% on his pull-up jumpers. Miles is also a terrific decision-maker. Transfer from: UMass The well-traveled Cross has turned into a heckuva player. He's a good bet to shoot around 35% from 3-point range on over two attempts per game. He's a great cutter, rebounder and playmaker. Cross finds mismatches and knows what to do with 'em. SMU dropped a bag to land Cross (who had a ton of interest from good teams galore), and the fifth-year senior will be worth it. Transfer from: Northern Iowa Born gets the first crack at replacing Colorado State legend Isaiah Stevens. Born isn't the distributor that Stevens was, but he can score that thing. The Northern Iowa transfer is on the doorstep of eclipsing 1,500 career points. Colorado State coach Niko Medved should be able to utilize the lefty sharpshooter in creative ways in the Rams' Princeton-style offense. Born will be one of the Mountain West's best scorers. Transfer from: Ohio State Dayton needed a post-up hub and found it in Key, an Ohio State transfer who was a bucket on the block. Key eats up one-on-one coverage and rapidly improved at finding open shooters when the double-team came his way. Key, a low-post beast, teaming up with Nate Santos, a stretch 4 deadeye, should be a fabulous match for a Dayton squad that intends to chase an A-10 crown. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Title: S&P 500's era of hot stock market returns is over, Goldman Sachs says

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/28/2024 7:51:55 AM PDT by SeekAndFind For the last 15 years, all you've needed to do to achieve double-digit returns on your money was park it in an S&P 500 index fund, reinvest dividends, and forget about it. That happy ride may be over, according to a new note from Goldman Sachs that has Wall Street abuzz.The big picture: The S&P is on track to return only about 3% a year in the coming decade, Goldman's portfolio strategy group estimates. Compare that to 13% average annual returns over the last ten years.Goldman's forecast implies the S&P — the benchmark index tracked by many of the world's most popular investment vehicles — is more likely than not to have lower returns than U.S. Treasury securities (72% odds) and could even deliver returns lower than inflation (33% odds) through 2034.State of play: The forecast incorporates some of the standard variables portfolio strategists look at to project future returns — price-to-earnings-ratios and interest rates, primarily. But much of the subpar projection is rooted in the extraordinary concentration of the recent stock market runup.Stocks of a handful of fast-growing, highly profitable tech giants that are investing heavily in artificial intelligence — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — increasingly are the S&P.The index may be meant to contain 500 stocks, but those plus Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, and a couple of others have accounted for around a third of the total market-cap weighted index in recent months.Flashback: The Goldman team notes that in past episodes in which the market became highly concentrated, the megafirms that drove gains weren't able to continue achieving the outsized growth in sales and profit margins that would have propelled further gains.In the 1960 and early 1970s, the "Nifty Fifty" were large cap superstar companies, including names like IBM, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox. The 1970s ended up being a lost decade for stock market returns.The late 1990s tech boom sent shares of Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco Systems, and Intel to the moon, but the 2000s were also a deflating time of weak returns.What they're saying: "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," write David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and four colleagues."The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index," they write. "As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

Probably time to invest in SP500. 2 posted on 10/28/2024 7:56:13 AM PDT by MeanWestTexan (Sometimes There Is No Lesser Of Two Evils) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind HERE's the COMMENT MADE BY THE OXFORD INCOME GROUP REGARDING GOLDMAN SACH's PREDICTION: To put that into perspective, the S&P 500 Index has produced an average annual return of about 10.3% since its 1957 inception. If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read. I just buy Buffet, a few high dividend stocks, a few market ETFs, Bonds and relax. If Bonds stop returning money above the rate of inflation I’ll look at real estate. Writing about stocks is a moneymaker, and it has no risk.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind “And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth.” ************* No question about that. Favorable policies that promote business expansion and individual wealth creation can serve to lubricate economic growth. And there’s a good chance of that happening if Trump gets elected. That said, the market is at a high valuation level right now and investors need to be mindful that returns are determined by the price you pay for something. 7 posted on 10/28/2024 8:14:42 AM PDT by Starboard [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SaxxonWoods “I just buy Buffet, a few high dividend stocks, a few market ETFs, Bonds and relax.” ************ I like your strategy. Holding some income producing assets can provide a “cushion” during market declines, and are icing on the cake when the market is rising. 8 posted on 10/28/2024 8:21:18 AM PDT by Starboard [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind That’s because the $trillion dollar federal reserve magic money printing is coming to an end. The spigot is being shut off and no longer debasing the currency. This will cause inflation to go way down and restore the value of the dollar.

You can do that with Vanguard dividend index funds which have done reasonably well compared to the S&P500. I complement that with QQQ and other growth index funds. A key point of this article seems to be that growth has been driven by a subset of companies invested in AI. I would counter that there will always be some version of that happening. Always problems needing to be solved. Dem control provides a caustic environment but stock performance has continued despite dem efforts to destroy the economy. Stock performance has done surprisingly well under dem Presidents. But all bets are off if the dems secure overwhelming control of both branches of Congress. In the end no one can predict the future and the market involves lots of risk and is not for everyone. 12 posted on 10/28/2024 8:49:17 AM PDT by plain talk [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: MeanWestTexan Sounds like an echo of what I just said to the walls of my study.

I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

But much of the subpar projection is rooted in the extraordinary concentration of the recent stock market runup.Stocks of a handful of fast-growing, highly profitable tech giants that are investing heavily in artificial intelligence — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — increasingly are the S&P.The index may be meant to contain 500 stocks, but those plus Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, and a couple of others have accounted for around a third of the total market-cap weighted index in recent months.Flashback: The Goldman team notes that in past episodes in which the market became highly concentrated, the megafirms that drove gains weren't able to continue achieving the outsized growth in sales and profit margins that would have propelled further gains.In the 1960 and early 1970s, the "Nifty Fifty" were large cap superstar companies, including names like IBM, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox. The 1970s ended up being a lost decade for stock market returns.The late 1990s tech boom sent shares of Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco Systems, and Intel to the moon, but the 2000s were also a deflating time of weak returns.What they're saying: "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," write David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and four colleagues."The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index," they write. "As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade.

"As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks.
