ByTrefis Team, Contributor. As generative AI transforms various industries, one of the most essential – yet frequently overlooked – elements driving this change is memory. Memory manufacturer Micron (NASDAQ:MU) is central to this evolution, supplying the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM necessary to keep extensive AI models operating at both speed and scale. As AI workloads become increasingly complex, memory is becoming vital for hyperscalers and cloud service providers. While GPUs and accelerators capture attention, memory is the discreet backbone that dictates the speed and efficiency of these systems. The stock price of Micron reflects this rising demand, having surged roughly 85% year-to-date in 2025. Nonetheless, is the stock still worthy of consideration at present valuations? Regardless of its appeal, investing in a single stock carries significant risk. The Trefis High-Quality Portfolio has been designed to lessen stock-specific risk while providing upside potential. The figures from Micron’s results speak for themselves. For the quarter ending in August, Micron’s revenue reached $11.32 billion, an increase of 46% year-over-year, while adjusted net income skyrocketed by 157% to $3.47 billion ($3.03 per diluted share). Remarkably, sales in the cloud memory segment more than tripled to $4.5 billion. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra informed analysts that the demand for Micron’s DRAM and NAND offerings was stronger than previously anticipated, enhancing the company’s outlook. Robust DRAM shipments across all end markets, strong pricing due to constrained supply and low inventory levels, along with slower transitions to newer process nodes limiting total output, are all factors contributing to growth. Micron anticipates a favorable demand-supply balance for DRAM in 2026, which will support ongoing profitability. For Q1 2026, Micron projects revenue of $12.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, marking an increase of approximately 61% year-over-year at the midpoint. HBM is an ultra-fast, low-latency memory primarily crafted for AI accelerators and GPUs to swiftly process vast model data, while DRAM provides larger-capacity, general-purpose memory supporting AI workloads by storing large volumes of data, albeit at slower transfer speeds than HBM. Micron serves as a primary memory and storage partner for Nvidia’s Blackwell GB200 and GB300 platforms, supplying both HBM3E and LPDDR5X solutions, and is also a key supplier for AMD’s Instinct MI350 GPUs. Nvidia’s latest systems incorporate 33% more memory per node compared to previous generations, as AI models increasingly adopt a multimodal approach – integrating text, video, and speech – heightening the demand for memory. Refer to our note on how Micron Stock Surges 2x To $300 To underscore the magnitude of investment in AI, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) have suggested that they could collectively commit $364 billion to capital expenditures in their respective current fiscal years. Earlier in September, Oracle revealed it has entered into contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars to offer cloud computing services to OpenAI and other large clients. While these infrastructure agreements will necessitate computing power – either GPUs or custom ASICs, as well as server and networking equipment, memory will also be vital, and Micron stands to gain significantly from this expansion. With the ascent of AI adoption throughout the economy, Micron is poised for sustained growth. Indications suggest that the most compute-intensive phase of AI training may start to plateau, with the industry pivoting toward inference – the application of trained models to fresh data in real-time and at massive scale. Inference is less demanding per task but takes place continuously across millions of users and applications. HBM is critical for enabling AI inference at scale, thanks to its bandwidth and power efficiency benefits, complementing high-performance GPUs primarily utilized for training. This trend undeniably favors specialized, power-efficient suppliers like Micron. However, supply may struggle to keep up. Manufacturing HBM is more complex than producing standard DRAM, and supply levels remain tight. Creating HBM is wafer-intensive—it necessitates around three times more wafers than standard DRAM to yield the same volume of bits due to its lower bit density and complex 3D stacking, resulting in a natural bottleneck. While Micron has been increasing its HBM production capabilities, its output for 2025 has already been sold out, with strong demand expected for 2026. The company allocated $13.8 billion for capital expenditures in FY’25 and plans to further boost spending in 2026, chiefly to enhance DRAM capacity for AI workloads. For Q1 2026 alone, Micron aims to invest $4.5 billion, with the majority of capex focused on DRAM. This figure serves as a baseline for what investors can anticipate each quarter, indicating that total capital expenditures for the year will likely exceed $18 billion. Despite this notable rally, Micron stock is valued at approximately 10 times estimated earnings for 2026. Projected growth appears robust: anticipated revenues are expected to increase by 42% in 2026, based on consensus forecasts. Nevertheless, the memory market has historically been cyclical. DRAM and NAND are susceptible to variations in supply and demand, along with price volatility. At this point, it seems that HBM acts as a partially secular growth factor, given the relentless investment by major tech firms over the last three years. However, HBM currently represents only a small fraction of total sales, meaning the company is not completely shielded from traditional market cycles. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, boasts a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap — and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. What is the reason for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a less tumultuous experience, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Opendoor Hits Pause After Massive Rally—Here’s Why

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ: OPEN) has experienced an exhilarating journey this year. The stock has skyrocketed by 345% year-to-date, only to fall by 21% over the past week, serving as a strong reminder to investors that growth stocks seldom move in a linear fashion. Opendoor’s significant surge is indicative of robust growth in its key iBuying sector. In 2024, the company handled over $12 billion in home transactions, a rise from roughly $7 billion in 2023, as it ventured into new markets and enhanced its pricing algorithms. Revenue has consistently increased, anticipating an estimated $4.05 billion in 2025, while operational advancements have modestly decreased average holding times for homes, from 45 days in 2023 to around 38 days in 2024. If you are looking for an upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has notably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—achieving returns of over 91% since its inception. Additionally, see – Can Uber Stock Grow $2x? The 21% decline last week seems primarily linked to profit-taking following the substantial year-to-date gains, along with immediate concerns regarding the overall housing market. Increasing mortgage rates and affordability challenges could temporarily reduce transaction volumes, causing investors to pause and reevaluate. Despite the recent downturn, Opendoor continues to be a key player in the tech-oriented real estate sector. The company is still operating at a loss—projected to be about $234 million in 2025—but is progressively enhancing its unit economics. Its combination of technology, market expansion, and transaction volume positions it for potential profitable scaling as housing market conditions normalize. The recent decline could represent a purchasing opportunity for long-term investors who believe in Opendoor’s business model. Its revenue growth, enhanced operational efficiency, and market share increases indicate that while volatility may persist, the long-term narrative of digitizing the home-buying process remains strong. In summary, Opendoor is a stock suited for those willing to navigate the ups and downs, supported by genuine growth metrics rather than mere hype. Investors must be ready for considerable volatility and the possibility of significant losses if market conditions worsen or if the company does not successfully implement its ambitious growth objectives. Although the 2x upside potential appears mathematically plausible based on forecasted revenues, it necessitates impeccable execution in a rapidly changing and competitive market landscape. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is that?Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with decreased risk compared to the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Hello, as of the time we were writing our daily news report, we did not yet have a definitive picture of whether the postponed meeting between Mitsotakis and Erdogan would take place, but generally speaking, there’s a Greek proverb about the …ship that’s late. Still, from what a government source said late last night, it doesn’t look good. So we know for certain that indeed the scheduled meeting yesterday evening at 9 (Greek time) was postponed for a real reason. Trump scheduled his meeting with the Arab countries at roughly the same time Mitsotakis was supposed to meet Erdogan (with half an hour’s difference), so of course the Turk wouldn’t ditch that meeting for the Greek Prime Minister. In the end, however, the American President’s meeting with the Arab leaders was delayed by about an hour and a half, which meant both Erdogan and Trump slotted in other meetings in the meantime. But we also know just as well that if Erdogan couldn’t “find”… half an hour today in his schedule for this meeting, it simply means the Turk never wanted it to happen in the first place. Not good, but of course not …the end of the world if the Turk doesn’t want to meet the Greek. And in that sense, the opposition’s reaction, just half an hour after the postponement was announced and before they even knew that the meeting was definitively off, is beyond words. Or rather, it’s a disgrace for the country that only a few minutes later Greek parties attack the Greek Prime Minister because the Turk canceled on him. Honestly, I don’t believe public opinion would have expected such an “instant” reaction from the opposition (from PASOK to Velopoulos) in order to applaud them — given one small detail: let’s not forget, we’re talking about a Greek and a Turk.
