Ethereum has quietly been one of the most rewarding bets in crypto. A $1,000 investment made just five years ago in 2020 would now be worth around $11,145, an 11x jump despite wild swings along the way. But with ETH trading around $4,327 this September, investors are asking the real question: is Ethereum still worth buying after such explosive gains, or is the big money already made?

Despite GST 2.0's reforms aiming to boost consumption and corporate earnings, FIIs continue selling Indian stocks, driven by Trump's tariff concerns and global uncertainties. A significant FII exodus, reaching ₹1.4 lakh crore in 2025, persists despite domestic investor support. High valuations and the lure of cheaper markets further fuel the foreign investor skepticism.

Title: Serious U.S. Dollar Fed Warning Issued As Bitcoin Mounts $24 Trillion Gold Price Challenge

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has surged this year, topping $124,000 per bitcoin in August as a growing crisis at the Federal Reserve takes a surprising turn. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has doubled since this time last year—with some now predicting bitcoin is on the brink of a $84 trillion shock—with the massive $4 trillion rally causing some of the world’s biggest celebrities to jump on the crypto bandwagon. Now, as the new crypto gold rush forges what could be the new “Rockefellers or Rothschilds,” Goldman Sachs analysts have warned the U.S. dollar’s global reserve-currency status could be eaten away by gold—just as bitcoin comes for its safe-haven asset crown. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “A scenario where Fed independence is damaged would likely lead to higher inflation, lower stock and long-dated bond prices, and an erosion of the dollar’s reserve-currency status,” Goldman analysts including Samantha Dart wrote in a note to clients seen by Bloomberg. “In contrast, gold is a store of value that doesn’t rely on institutional trust.” Trump has been ramping up his war of words against the Federal Reserve this year, attacking Fed chair Jerome Powell as economists warn of a looming dollar disaster. Trump has threatened to fire Powell and tried to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook, sparking fears over the future of the Fed’s independence from the White House. Dart predicted the gold price could surge to $5,000 an ounce if U.S. president Donald Trump’s war on the Fed causes global investors to lose confidence in bonds, stocks, and the dollar, with only a small shift from the massive Treasuries market into bullion enough to trigger outsized gains. “As a result, gold remains our highest-conviction long recommendation in the commodities space," Dart wrote, adding, “we estimate that if 1% of the privately owned U.S. Treasury market were to flow into gold, the gold price would rise to nearly $5,000/[troy ounce], assuming everything else constant." Gold’s rally this year, climbing from $2,500 an ounce 12 months ago to $3,600 today and giving gold a $24 trillion market capitalization, has come alongside a bitcoin price boom that’s sent bitcoin, sometimes called digital gold, to record highs. “[Bitcoin] sits at the intersection of gold and equities—an emerging store of value that thrives when liquidity rotates into risk,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments following the latest U.S. jobs report coming in below expectations, setting up the Federal Reserve to cut rates later this month as U.S. president Donald Trump has called for. “With $7.2 trillion in money market funds likely to move as yields fall, bitcoin offers the ultimate hybrid profile: digital gold for safety, and asymmetric upside as a risk-on asset. Seasonality also strengthens the setup, with the fourth quarter historically bitcoin’s strongest quarter—the asset has only seen two negative Octobers in its entire history— suggesting that as liquidity returns, buying pressure could accelerate into year-end.” Technical analysis comparing bitcoin to gold by Coindesk shows the bitcoin price could be headed for “a potential breakout by late in the fourth quarter or early next year.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Meanwhile, the World Gold Council is developing a digitalized form of gold as fears grow that bitcoin could replace it as the world's safe-haven asset. "We are trying to standardise that digital layer of gold, such that the various financial products used in other markets can be used in the gold market going forward,” David Tait, a former banker and chief executive of the World Gold Council, an industry body representing gold miners, told the Financial Times. “My goal is that many asset managers around the world will suddenly look at it differently." Fears that bitcoin could overtake gold among investors seeking exposure to a scarce, non-governmental or corporate asset have been heightened by the rapid rise of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which now hold almost as much in assets under management (AUM) as gold ETFs despite spot bitcoin ETFs only being launched at the beginning of 2024. "How long before AUM in 'digital gold’ ETFs surpasses physical? Bitcoin ETF assets are closing in on gold ETF assets," financial markets research company Bespoke’s account posted to X, pointing to data that showed they are now worth $150 billion and $180 billion, respectively.

Title: Broadcom: AVGO Stock’s Path To $600
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/broadcom-avgo-stocks-path-to-600/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T10:26:13Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom's stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) is climbing, buoyed by impressive quarterly earnings and a new customer win for its custom AI chips. Adding to the optimism, the company expects revenue growth to speed up next year. It's no surprise, then, that the stock has more than doubled in the past twelve months. But what could fuel another 100% gain to levels past $600 from here? We’ll explore the key factors that could push the stock to new heights in the analysis that follows. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? Broadcom’s growth is anchored by its custom AI chip partnerships with top hyperscalers, namely Google (for its TPU) and Meta. In a significant development on September 4, 2025, the company announced it has secured a fourth major, unnamed customer for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs), reportedly worth $10 billion. This diversifies its revenue and solidifies its role as a key enabler for large-scale AI infrastructure. While the initial AI boom focused on training, the market is now shifting to inference, where Broadcom holds a strategic advantage. As AI applications are deployed at scale, the demand for high-performance, power-efficient inference chips and networking skyrockets. Broadcom's expertise in specialized networking and processing is critical for these workloads, positioning it to capture this massive market segment. Broadcom maintains its competitive edge through relentless product innovation. It is now shipping its Tomahawk 6 and Tomahawk Ultra networking chips, which significantly outperform their predecessor and are essential for building out large AI clusters. Furthermore, its leadership in co-packaged silicon photonics is a key technology for next-generation data centers, enabling the faster, more efficient data transfer required for advanced AI. Notably, the Tomahawk Ultra can connect up to 1,024 accelerators in a single rack, significantly more than NVIDIA’s NVLink Switch, which only supports up to 72 GPUs. Beyond hardware, the acquisition of VMware has transformed Broadcom into a major infrastructure software company. Broadcom is successfully transitioning VMware customers to subscription models and streamlining the portfolio. This strategy is already boosting recurring revenue and is expected to generate substantial, stable cash flow, significantly improving the company’s overall profit margins. For perspective, VMware, which is part of Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, saw its revenue surge 43% y-o-y to $6.8 billion in Q3 fiscal 2025 (fiscal period ends in October). For Broadcom's stock to double in value, it relies on a powerful combination of substantial earnings growth and a sustained, premium valuation from investors. The pathway is built on two core pillars: The foundation for growth is a strong top-line forecast. We project Broadcom’s revenue could grow from around $60 billion in the last twelve months to more than $105 billion by 2028, driven primarily by its AI and VMware segments. However, the key is Broadcom's exceptional profitability. With adjusted net income margins around 50%, revenue growth has a magnified impact on the bottom line. This means earnings are positioned to grow significantly faster than sales. For example, if revenue increases by 75% over the next few years, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) could nearly double from around $6.29 now to $12 in 2028. Earnings growth alone isn't enough; the stock must also maintain its high valuation multiple. Broadcom has been trading at a premium valuation of over 50 times trailing adjusted earnings for several reasons: If investors continue to assign a premium multiple of around 50x to the stock, an EPS of $12 would support a stock price of around $600. Furthermore, the multiple could expand even further if Broadcom demonstrates sustained AI revenue growth above 40%, captures more market share, and secures new large-scale customers. Despite the strong growth outlook, several risks could impact Broadcom's performance and valuation. Broadcom's AI revenue is highly dependent on a small number of hyperscale customers. While profitable, this concentration creates a significant risk; a change in spending plans or a strategic shift from even one major customer could disproportionately impact Broadcom's revenue. Any broader slowdown in the rapid pace of AI infrastructure investment would also directly threaten the company's primary growth engine. The market for AI chips and networking solutions is intensely competitive. Broadcom faces pressure from established rivals like Marvell and NVIDIA, as well as the risk of its own hyperscale customers developing more of their in-house silicon solutions. This competition could compress the high profit margins that currently justify Broadcom's premium valuation. Broadcom's stock has historically shown higher volatility during broad market downturns compared to the S&P 500. It experienced steeper declines during both the COVID-19 correction and the 2022 inflation shock. This indicates a heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic uncertainty, and a future economic slowdown or market disruption could lead to a significant drop in its stock price. Over the next few years, Broadcom's stock could double to over $600. The path to this 2x return is straightforward: the company must achieve the forecasted revenue and earnings growth while convincing the market that its premium valuation is sustainable. However, investors considering this opportunity should also weigh the risks. The stock has experienced drops of up to 50% in the past, and they must be prepared for similar volatility. Despite this, for those with an investment horizon of three years or more, Broadcom's stock has a strong potential to double from its current level. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
