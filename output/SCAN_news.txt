On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced its decision to keep the policy rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range. In his speech, Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned that former U.S. President Donald Trump’s initial policies, such as import tariffs, have contributed to slower economic growth and may have had a temporary impact on inflation. Policymakers anticipate two rate cuts in 2025, with economic growth projected at 1.7% and inflation at 2.7% for the year. Additionally, the Fed plans to slow the pace of balance sheet reduction by adjusting the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities by April.

While the Fed has multiple things to consider in its risk matrix, the Fed is charged with the twin goals of maintaining full employment and low prices. In the wake of heightened global uncertainty and increased business complexities stemming from President Donald Trump’s significant policy changes, the Fed held the rates steady. This was fully anticipated because “uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased”. But “the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.” In this disconcerting overarching environment, some analysts fear the dreaded specter of stagflation, which could be the worst of both worlds. The US Fed held the rates steady for a second straight meeting because of decelerating growth and persistently sticky inflation. Accordingly, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted on March 19, 2025, to keep the benchmark federal funds rate in a range of 4.25%-4.5%. The Fed announced a further scaling back of its “quantitative tightening” program in which it is slowly reducing the bonds it holds on its balance sheet. Governor Christopher Waller, who supported steady rates, dissented from the balance sheet decision. Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that tariff impacts are not amenable to prescient forecasts. Hence, there was a need for greater clarity on the impact of those policies on the economy before acting.

The dots suggest 50bps worth of rate cuts this year, but what was noteworthy is that all FOMC members felt increasing price pressures were a real risk. In a way, the risk of stagflation - slow growth and elevated inflation - is what the Fed acknowledged. Stocks, including domestic equities, have rallied largely, as slow growth would mean more rate cuts, but that expectation is not on solid footing because of the tariff-related uncertainty, which Powell also flagged clearly. That said, the broader benchmarks - NSE 500, small-caps, and mid-caps have broken above their respective falling channels and have generated bullish reversal patterns in what has historically been a bullish period, seasonally speaking.” Adani Enterprises forms joint venture company Praneetha Ecocables Ltd for metal products and cables manufacturing in Ahmedabad.

Additionally, the forecasts for both overall PCE inflation and core PCE inflation have been increased to 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively, up from 2.5%. These weakened macro projections suggest a more cautious economic outlook, which could influence monetary policy decisions moving forward. The market is reacting, with futures indicating a 62.1% probability that the Fed will resume rate cuts in the upcoming June meeting, reflecting a slight increase from the previous 57%. This shift signals trader sentiment that the Fed may need to take more accommodative steps to support the economy amid lower growth expectations and rising inflation concerns. The implications of these developments could lead to increased volatility in financial markets as investors recalibrate their strategies in response to the Fed’s evolving outlook.” Marksans Pharma announced that its manufacturing facility located at Plot A-1, Phase 1-A, Verna Industrial Estate, Verna, Goa has been approved by Australian TGA for manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations in Solid Dosage Forms of Tablets and hard Capsules for Australian markets.

This comes amid stagflation risks surged by US President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes, which escalated a global trade war. On other hand they expect Inflation to bounce back a little this year from a current rate of 2.5 % to 2.7 %, above the central bank’s 2 % target. By keeping rates unchanged, the Fed is balancing the need to combat inflation versus concerns about growth. This framework signals the Fed’s determination to achieve price stability as well as the flexibility it wishes to have to respond to future developments in the economy. HCL Tech (+1.63%), Wipro (+1.60%), TCS (+1.59%), Infosys (+1.43%) Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company Ltd (“KMAMC” / “Kotak Mutual Fund”) today announced the launch of the “Choti SIP” facility, available for all eligible schemes of Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund. SEBI and AMFI recently introduced the Choti SIP (Small Ticket SIP), offering an opportunity to bring more Indians into the wealth creation journey. This initiative enables new investors to invest via SIP with a minimum amount of Rs. 250. The rationale behind “Choti SIP” (small Systematic Investment Plan) is to make mutual fund investments more accessible to a wider audience, particularly first-time investors, by lowering the entry barrier. The investor must not have previously invested in mutual funds (SIP or Lumpsum) at the industry level. The investor must invest in the Growth Option and commit to a minimum of 60 instalments on a monthly basis. The payment of instalments should be made through NACH or UPI auto-pay only. Nilesh Shah, Managing Director, KMAMC, said, “Only about 5.4 crore unique investors of India’s population are mutual fund investors—leaving a massive, untapped opportunity for penetration and bringing the Indian saver closer to financial freedom. Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) have been an excellent way to bring new investors and kick-start their mutual fund journey. With the launch of Choti SIP, a new investor can begin their wealth creation journey with a minimum amount of Rs. 250. We can call it ‘Choti Rakam – Bada Kadam’.” PTC India has received the amount of ₹254 crores from ONGC Green Ltd. (OGL) as part of the adjustments to bid price as per Share Purchase Agreement.

Turkish Lira depreciates, potential risk for Jubilant Just the facts The Turkish Lira has depreciated 5% today with 8.5% depreciation YTD vs the USD. We note JUBI had acquire DP Eurasia in early 2024. DP Eurasia operates in in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia and contributed 31% of group system sales in 3QFY25. We note Jubilant Foodworks’ debt is Rs12.3bn as of Sep’24, of which we estimate about 80% is payable from Turkish cashflow. Analyst opinion We believe the depreciation of the Lira would lead to additional interest cost burden for JUBI in repayment of debt taken to acquire DP Eurasia. We believe the 5% Turkish Lira today could have a 2-2.5% impact on FY25 consolidated PAT estimates. The YTD Turkish Lira depreciation of 8.5% could have c.3.5-4% impact (including today’s impact) on FY25 consolidated PAT. This depreciation in Turkish Lira could also impact dividend payments by DP Eurasia.

At the outset, growth projections have been lowered and inflation has been falling, and therefore rate cuts by the Fed remain a continued possibility, despite the 1% reduction done last year. However, Mr Powel’s conundrum would be the same as everyone else:- the impact of President Trump’s unpredictable tariff moves. Tariffs are widely expected to adversely impact inflation and slow down the economy, but assessment of the impact of the same remains to be seen. US 10 yr rates have also gone down by ~20 bps over the last 1-2 mths. Majority of the market is expecting no rate changes in today’s policy by the Fed, however there’s still a possibility that the data driven Fed may cut rates acknowledging the slowing economic conditions and inflation trajectory.” Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company (EARC) has announced that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has approved its proposal to appoint Mythili Balasubramanian as the Interim Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately, till September 30th, 2025.

U.S. stocks rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged as widely expected, and the central bank and investors continue to gauge how President Donald Trump’s tariff policies affect the economy and inflation. The central bank kept its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%-4.50% range, and indicated that two quarter-point interest-rate cuts were likely later this year, the same median forecast as three months ago. The Fed also forecast slower economic growth and higher inflation. Policymakers disagreed about the path forward, pointing to uncertainty among members about how to handle the effects of Trump’s plans. - Reuters Gold soared to a record high on Thursday, as the Federal Reserve hinted at a possible easing of interest rates by half a percentage point by year-end, which further fostered bullion’s appeal amid ongoing geopolitical and economic woes.

We present a series of charts under six sections: Growth/consumption, Investments, Financial Markets, Global Macros, Inflation/Employment, and External Sector. We wrap this up with a monthly tracker. ■ Barring a few outliers, we do not see signs of a meaningful growth/consumption recovery. Some data points like tractors and Port Cargo are improving, but major concurrent indicators like loan growth and auto sales continue to be weak. ■ Financial markets are mixed. Pressure on the rupee and forex is easing, with reserves stabilizing, the rupee weakness paused (at least for now), and the DXY having significantly corrected from the peak. Domestic liquidity however remains weak despite aggressive measures from the RBI – we see this as seasonal, and expect a recovery from Apr-25. ■ Our outlook is unchanged. We see an economic recovery in FY26 led by consumption – this will be enabled by a recovery in white collar employment and acceleration in retail lending. The investment cycle should moderate more toward normal levels, keeping pace with nominal GDP growth. We see the liquidity situation improving rapidly, leading to lower interest rates and better deposit growth. Interesting read of the week – Tokenization of private assets John Crabb discusses the possibilities of tokenization of private asset classes in Institutional Investor (link). This, he argues, will allow greater retail access to private markets, including alternate assets like art through fractionalization. Of course, this will need regulation changes from the SEC. Our view: giving retail investors access to illiquid private assets carries several unknown risks. The broader issue that resonates with India is that the options for domestic investors are now limited to the two ends of the spectrum – low-risk debt assets or equities/gold/real estate. There is a need for more products with intermediate risks that bridge this gap, as we discussed in our report on household savings in Dec-24 (link). Market view The market is showing signs of stability. As we mentioned last week (link), much of the valuation froth has subsided and most indices, including SMIDs, are trading below LTA P/Es. FPI selling has also abated. The sustainability of this rally will be determined by how well FY26 earnings forecasts hold up during the Apr-25 earning season. We believe that the Nifty EPSg forecast of 13.6% has little downside risk to it, fueled by a discretionary consumption recovery. In the short term, BFSI should outperform as liquidity easing and investors bottom-fish. In the medium term, however, we prefer consumer discretionary, healthcare and real estate. Capital markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday barred former TV anchor Hemant Ghai and his family members from the securities markets for five years for violating regulatory norms. Apart from the ban, Sebi has directed Hemant Ghai and his wife Jaya Ghai to disgorge the unlawful gains worth Rs 6.16 crore, along with 12 per cent interest per annum to be calculated from March 31, 2020, till the date of the interim order. It has also slapped a penalty of Rs 50 lakh each on Hemant Ghai and Jaya Ghai, Rs 30 lakh on MAS Consultancy Service, and Rs 5 lakh on financial services company Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFSL). The regulator had concluded that Hemant Ghai used his position as a TV anchor to influence stock prices, while his family members executed trades in advance to profit from the recommendations. “...Hemant Ghai had a huge following on social media and was closely followed on CNBC. The recommendations made by him influenced the investment decisions made by his viewers and impacted the price and volume of the recommended scrips. “However, he unfairly used this privilege to his own advantage,” Sebi’s whole-time member Ashwani Bhatia said in the order. In the final order, the regulator said, “A majority of trades and profits in the accounts of Jaya Ghai and Shyam Mohini Ghai stemmed from trades synchronised with stock recommendations made on CNBC by Hemant Ghai, husband and son, respectively, of the individuals in whose accounts the trades were executed”. Also, Sebi pointed out that Hemant has exercised operational control over these accounts, with his email, phone number, and bank credentials linked to them. - PTI Zinc futures outlook positive with resistance at ₹282, potential rally to ₹293; trade strategy suggests long positions. bl.portfolio Star Track Mutual Fund Ratings: A guide to achieving better returns in mutual funds Get intraday support, resistance levels, and trade recommendations for Nifty Futures and popular stocks with Day Trading Guide.
