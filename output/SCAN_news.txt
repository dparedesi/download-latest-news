Title: AMZN Stock Set For A Major Upswing?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a history of delivering impressive, rapid returns, with the stock achieving over 30% gains in less than two months on 13 separate occasions, notably in 2010 and 2020. If these historical patterns persist, upcoming catalysts could propel AMZN stock to extraordinary new highs, offering significant benefits to shareholders. Several high-growth areas are poised to drive Amazon's stock higher: That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AMZN, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. It undoubtedly helps if the financial fundamentals are solid. For insights on AMZN, visit Buy or Sell AMZN Stock. Below are some key metrics to note. *LTM: Last Twelve Months When considering risk, it’s useful to assess Amazon’s performance during challenging market conditions. It experienced a nearly 94% decline during the Dot-Com Bubble, which is substantial. The Global Financial Crisis affected it by approximately 65%, and the Inflation Shock of 2022 also had a severe impact, resulting in a decline of over 56%. Even less extreme events, such as the 2018 correction and the COVID-19 selloff, caused drops of around 34% and 23%, respectively. Look at – How Low Can Amazon Stock Really Go – for more details. Therefore, despite the favorable indicators, Amazon's past indicates that it can incur significant losses when the market declines. However, risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decline even amid favorable market conditions – consider situations such as earnings announcements, business updates, and outlook revisions. To observe how the stock has bounced back from sharp downturns historically, refer to the AMZN Dip Buyer Analyses. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
