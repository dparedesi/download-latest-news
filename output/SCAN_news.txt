Title: PagerDuty Falls to ~$1B Market Cap on $500M ARR. Just 2x ARR. Profitable Isn’t Enough. You Have to Grow.

by Jason Lemkin | 5 Interesting Things, Blog Posts, Scale PagerDuty just reported earnings, and the numbers tell a sobering story. The Captain Obvious lesson and reminder: Growth Remains King. Even if you are profitable. You just have to grow. And for now at least — PagerDuty just isn’t growing anymore. Here’s where they are today: And yet the stock is down 75%+ from its 2021 highs. Down nearly 50% from its IPO price of $38.25 back in 2019. Profitable isn’t enough. You have to grow. PagerDuty has built something real. Almost $500M in ARR. Over 15,000 paying customers. One-third of the Fortune 500. Customers like Cisco, Zoom, Fox, Shopify, and the NYSE. A 28.5% non-GAAP operating margin. Nearly $550M in cash on the balance sheet. 83%+ gross margins. This is a real business. A profitable business. A business that serves mission-critical use cases — when systems go down at 2am, PagerDuty is the one waking up the right engineer. And the market values it at 2x ARR. Meanwhile, companies still growing 30%+ trade at 10-15x ARR or more or higher. That’s a 5-7x difference in multiple. The lesson: A dollar of ARR growing 30%+ is worth 5-7x more than a dollar of ARR growing 4%. PagerDuty was once a rocketship. At IPO in 2019, they had 139% NRR — truly elite expansion. In 2022, it was still 124-126%. Customers were landing and expanding aggressively. Today? 100% NRR. That single metric tells the whole story. At 100% NRR: Here’s what the metrics trajectory looks like: When your NRR drops from 130%+ to 100%, your growth engine fundamentally breaks. You go from a flywheel to a treadmill. PagerDuty has had roughly 15,000-16,000 paid customers for three years. Essentially flat. Yes, they’ve grown the number of $100K+ customers from 825 to 867. That’s good! But it’s only 5% growth. And the overall customer base isn’t expanding. When your customer count goes flat, it means one of two things: Either way, it signals that finding new customers has gotten very, very hard. Here’s what founders sometimes miss: Profitability is necessary but not sufficient. PagerDuty made all the “right” moves for the 2022-2024 efficiency era: The market shrugged. Why? Because investors aren’t just buying today’s profits — they’re buying future cash flows. And if your ARR is only growing 4%, your future cash flows are capped. The valuation math: The premium multiples go to companies that can compound. 20%+ growth with strong unit economics gets 8-12x ARR. 30%+ gets you 12-18x. 40%+ and you’re looking at 20x+. PagerDuty’s 4% growth puts them in a different category entirely. In July 2025, Reuters reported that PagerDuty is exploring a sale with Qatalyst Partners. This is actually the second time they’ve explored selling — a similar effort in late 2023 didn’t produce an acceptable offer. This tells you everything about where the board’s head is at: The good news? At 2-3x ARR, PagerDuty is actually cheap for what it is. A strategic buyer who could cut costs further, or bundle it with other products, might pay 3-4x+ ARR. That’s a 30-50% premium from here. But for a company that once traded at 15-20x ARR? That’s a painful outcome for long-term shareholders. Here’s what makes PagerDuty’s situation even harder: the competitive landscape has fundamentally shifted against them. Attack from Above: The Platform Giants Are Bundling The biggest threat isn’t another startup — it’s the observability platforms bundling incident management into their offerings. In June 2024, Datadog launched Datadog On-Call, bringing paging and incident management directly into their observability platform. Their pitch is devastating for PagerDuty: why switch between tools when you can have monitoring AND on-call in one platform with shared context? As one analyst noted, Datadog’s On-Call “could directly challenge PagerDuty and Atlassian Opsgenie” by reducing context switching for IT ops teams. ServiceNow is another threat — they generate more than 20x PagerDuty’s revenue and are expected to grow at 21% CAGR. For large enterprises already in the ServiceNow ecosystem for ITSM, adding incident management is a checkbox, not a new vendor decision. Cisco acquired Splunk. Atlassian has OpsGenie. The platform consolidation trend is real, and standalone point solutions like PagerDuty are caught in the squeeze. Attack from Below: Hungry Startups Eating Their Lunch Meanwhile, a new wave of Slack-native incident management startups has emerged: These startups are purpose-built for modern engineering teams. They’re Slack-native (where engineers actually live), more affordable, and laser-focused on the incident response workflow. As one industry survey noted, “PagerDuty and OpsGenie remain the most-used solutions, but young startups like incident.io, Rootly, and FireHydrant are challenging them.” The startups explicitly position against PagerDuty’s complexity and cost. Rootly’s marketing literally says “Migrate from PagerDuty faster than you can write fair pricing.” The Market Has Changed When PagerDuty went public in 2019, they were the clear category leader with 139% NRR. The “incident management” category was theirs. But the market fragmented: PagerDuty tried to expand into AIOps, automation, and business operations to grow the TAM. But as one analyst observed, they “operate in a crowded market filled with bigger competitors like Cisco’s Splunk and ServiceNow.” The result? A category leader that’s being squeezed from above by bundlers and from below by insurgents — while the core market matures. PagerDuty pioneered on-call incident management. They defined the category. And they won it. But here’s the problem: Categories have natural sizes. The “core” incident management market isn’t infinite. Most companies that need sophisticated on-call rotation and alerting already have a solution. PagerDuty got most of the big ones. They tried to expand the TAM with: But these adjacencies haven’t moved the needle enough. The $36B TAM they cite in investor decks isn’t converting to $36B of real demand for PagerDuty specifically. When you dominate a category but the category stops growing, you have three options: 1. NRR is destiny. When NRR drops below 110%, alarm bells should go off. Below 100%, you’re in serious trouble. Monitor this metric religiously. 2. Customer count growth matters. Flat customer counts for 3 years isn’t a plateau — it’s a warning sign that your market may be saturated or your GTM motion is broken. 3. Profitability buys you time, not valuation. Getting to profitability is essential for survival. But don’t expect the market to reward efficiency alone. You still need growth. 4. Category size is a ceiling. If you’re dominating a $500M category, you’re going to be a ~$500M ARR company. Expanding the category is possible but brutally hard. 5. The “rule of 40” isn’t a multiple accelerator at low growth. 4% growth + 28% margins = 32, which is below 40. But even if it were above 40, a 4% grower trades very differently than a 30% grower with similar efficiency. PagerDuty built a great product. They serve real customers with real pain. They’re profitable and have a fortress balance sheet. And the market values them at 2-3x ARR because growth has stalled. This is the new reality of B2B and SaaS. Profitability is table stakes now. Efficiency is expected. What commands premium multiples is durable growth. If you can’t grow, you can still build a great business. But you won’t build a great stock. And you may end up selling for far less than you once dreamed. Profitable is not enough. You have to grow. Digging into PagerDuty’s Q3 FY26 investor presentation reveals a few more fascinating data points: 1. The Quarter-by-Quarter NRR Collapse is Stark The presentation shows the sequential decline in painful detail: Five straight quarters of decline. That’s not noise — that’s a trend. And it’s not bottoming out; it’s hitting the floor. 2. They Slashed Sales & Marketing from 53% to 30% of Revenue This is the real story behind the margin expansion. In FY20, PagerDuty spent 53% of revenue on sales and marketing. Today? Just 30%. That’s 23 percentage points cut from GTM investment. Yes, it helped margins. But it also helps explain why growth collapsed. You can’t cut your way to growth. 3. R&D Spend Dropped from 26% to 16% Similarly, R&D went from 26% of revenue in FY20 to just 16% today. When you’re being attacked by nimble startups and platform giants, cutting R&D by 10 points feels dangerous. PagerDuty is leaner, but is it still innovating fast enough? 4. They Claim a $50B TAM with Only ~1% Penetration The investor deck cites 87 million potential users across developers (30M), infrastructure ops (23M), customer service (28M), and SecOps (6M) — and claims only ~1% penetration. If true, that’s massive upside. But if you’re only penetrating 1% of a $50B market after 15 years and you’re growing 5%… something doesn’t add up. Either the TAM is overstated or the go-to-market isn’t working. 5. They’ve Tried to Buy Growth — Rundeck (2020), Catalytic (2022), Jeli (2023) The innovation timeline reveals a string of acquisitions: Rundeck for automation in 2020, Catalytic for no-code workflows in 2022, and Jeli for post-incident learning in 2023. These were bets on expanding beyond core incident management. But three years later, growth is still stalling. Acquisitions alone can’t fix a slowing core business — they have to be integrated and monetized. The jury is still out.

Title: Advisors Are Watching These Tax Law Changes in 2026

Time Published: 2025-11-30T13:00:00Z

New tax laws including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act present novel risks and opportunities when filing next year’s tax returns. Jeff Benjamin Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside The holiday season is full of traditions: travel, turkey and occasionally too much eggnog. But for advisors, there’s another (arguably less fun) annual ritual: year-end tax management. Even with about a month left in the calendar year, financial advisors say there are plenty of ways clients can and should prepare for the end of 2025 and the start of 2026. From new guidelines and tax laws related to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law in July, to standard tax-loss harvesting strategies, advisors say there is a lot to focus on during the final weeks of the year. “There are some new limitations … going into effect in 2026, which should be considered carefully before yearend,” said Kathy Buchs, Senior Tax Advisor at MAI Capital Management. The One Big Beautiful Bill, which comprehensively reshaped tax legislation and government spending, “created some additional complexities surrounding itemized deductions for 2025 and 2026,” Buchs said. For example, the law reduced deductible charitable contributions by 0.5% of adjusted gross income and reduced the charitable deduction of high-income taxpayers to 35 cents of tax benefit per dollar donated from 37 cents. “Because of these limitations, which go into effect in 2026, many clients are choosing to accelerate their charitable contributions into 2025 to fully benefit from their charitable giving,” Buchs said. “Many of them are also utilizing donor-advised funds to preserve flexibility for future grant-making.” Donor-advised funds act like a personal tax-advantaged investment account dedicated to supporting qualified charities. Patrick Sabol, Senior Lead Planner at Facet, describes charitable contributions as one of the most effective ways to reduce your tax liability. “You can do this by donating cash or appreciated securities directly to your charity of choice or potentially by using a Donor-Advised Fund,” he added. Sabol said one area that can sometimes be overlooked when focusing on more sophisticated strategies is simply maxing out contributions to pre-tax 401(k) and Health Savings Account plans. While charitable deductions will be capped starting next year at a 35% rate, taxpayers are getting some new relief in the area of state and local tax deductions, commonly referred to as SALT. In 2024, the SALT deduction was capped at $10,000, but that has been increased to $40,000 for the tax years 2025 through 2029. The full $40,000 deduction starts phasing out at modified adjusted gross incomes of $500,000 for joint filers, and the SALT deduction drops back to $10,000 when adjusted gross income reaches $600,000, according to John Patterson, Wealth Management Advisor at OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. “When it comes to year-end planning, there are several key dos and don’ts to keep in mind,” Patterson said. “Any charitable gifts should be finalized before December 31, and if your income has changed significantly this year, review your withholding or make estimated payments now to prevent penalties or surprises at tax time.” Other tax deductions introduced in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act include up to $12,500 for qualified overtime pay, up to $6,000 for those 65 and older even if they are taking the standard deduction, and up to $10,000 for interest paid on auto loans for qualified vehicles purchased in 2025. Gabriel Shahin, founder and chief executive of Falcon Wealth, said tax-loss harvesting is among the areas he never overlooks this time of year. “Those losses should be used to offset your ordinary income, not just your capital gains,” he said. “Selling gains to offset losses defeats the whole point of tax-loss harvesting.” Shahin said one mistake he sometimes sees is investors ignoring their taxable brokerage accounts. “That’s where you’re getting hit with taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains,” he explained. “With strategic withdrawals and coordinated Roth contributions, you can shift money into tax-free growth instead of bleeding taxes every year for no reason.” Lance Elrod, co-owner of Next Step Financial Transitions, said tax-loss harvesting should be a focus throughout the year, but always revisited at yearend. “In years like 2025, when there has been strong market performance, especially in certain sectors like tech and international stocks, it’s worth revisiting your overall allocation to make sure you haven’t drifted too far away from where you want your allocation to be,” he said. Feeling Crypto. With a growing focus on cryptocurrency investing, Elrod said that can also be a good place to find tax management opportunities. “The crypto space has had a rough two-month stretch and if you purchased any cryptocurrencies recently, you are likely at a loss,” he said. “Since cryptocurrencies are seen as property in the US, you do not have to worry about the wash-sale rule like you would for other investments.” In essence, Elrod explained, “if you feel strongly about your crypto position, you can sell today to capture the loss for tax purposes and repurchase the same position five minutes later and not have to worry about the sale being disallowed for tax purposes.” Make It a Roth. Virtually across the board, advisors say consideration should be given to Roth conversions. “Failing to factor in potential tax-bracket shifts may also cause you to miss valuable opportunities for Roth conversions,” said Patterson of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. “Consider Roth conversions to lock in future tax-free growth, but carefully manage conversion amounts to avoid tax-bracket creep,” he added. Sabol of Facet said a Roth conversion is not necessarily a tax minimization strategy in the short term, but it can be a major year-end opportunity that is often overlooked. “Towards the end of the year, we can better estimate what tax bracket we will end up in,” he added. “This is a great time to maximize the lower brackets and fill them up with a conversion if available.” Shahin of Falcon Wealth described Roth conversions as one of the best tools for people in their 70s. “You’re essentially prepaying taxes at today’s lower rates to avoid massive required minimum distributions later when rates go up,” he said. “With tax brackets scheduled to increase in 2026 and SALT relief expiring, real tax planning becomes essential, because you want to shrink that pre-tax balance now, not when your RMDs force the issue.” The company, which is still new to the category, sees the case for buffer and defined-outcome ETFs growing as more people near retirement. The CFP Board presented four possible scenarios on how AI will impact wealth managers in the year 2030. The way advisors communicate retirement outcomes can dramatically improve client optimism. PE will continue to dominate, but medium-sized sellers may fill in the gaps. Client risk aversion shifts constantly, and advisors must navigate those changes while technology becomes more prominent in investment management. Financial advisors learn to love the turnkey solutions with customizable options. The most significant benefits went to savers with bigger balances and higher contribution rates. Crypto’s exclusion further highlights the complete 180 Paul Atkins’s SEC has done on multiple issues from the previous administration. Thin margins are one reason, but the shutdowns don’t necessarily spell the end of automated advice. The recordkeeper said third-party fintech platforms used by advisors to access clients’ 401(k)s create security risks. Outside of some high-net-worth clients’ portfolios, tokenized assets are not yet the norm among advisors. © 2025 The Daily Upside
