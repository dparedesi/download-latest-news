Microsoft (MSFT) stock rose sharply Thursday morning, a day after the tech giant blew past Wall Street’s expectations in its fiscal third-quarter earnings report. The stock was up about 9% in mid-morning trading. It’s now up about 3% so far this year, having fully recovered from April’s trade war-induced bloodbath in tech stocks. Microsoft racked up $70.1 billion in revenue, up 13%, and $25.8 billion in net income, up 18%, fueled by relentless demand for cloud and AI. Earnings came in at $3.46 per share, easily topping consensus estimates of $3.22. Microsoft’s quarter drew gushing praise from analysts both on and off the earnings call, with Wedbush calling it “an Aaron Judge-like performance” (referring to the New York Yankees slugger). Azure beat both the Street and internal targets, with AI workloads accounting for nearly half the cloud platform’s growth. The company reaffirmed its $80 billion FY25 capital expenditures forecast and said infrastructure investments will continue to rise in FY26 — putting to rest speculation about data center cutbacks. Microsoft’s cloud engine kept roaring in Q3, with Azure and other cloud services surging 33% year-over-year, powering a 21% increase in the all-important Intelligent Cloud segment, which hit $26.8 billion. Server product revenue rose 22% as demand for AI infrastructure stayed hot. The Productivity and Business Processes segment brought in $29.9 billion, up 10% from last year, driven by steady growth in Microsoft 365 and Dynamics. Microsoft 365 Commercial revenue rose 11%, with its cloud-based suite climbing 12%, while consumer revenue grew 10%. Dynamics 365 jumped 16%, lifting Dynamics overall by 11%. On an earnings call, executives offered a confident and detailed account of accelerating enterprise demand. CFO Amy Hood emphasized that while most of the quarter’s upside came from non-AI services, digital-native companies are increasingly building everything — AI or not — in Azure. The result: a seamless pipeline converting Microsoft’s massive capital expenditures into revenue faster than skeptics expected. Wedbush raised its price target on the stock 8.4%, from $475 to $515, noting that chatter around potential data center pullbacks is now “put to rest.” As the line between AI and non-AI workloads continues to blur — and AI demand proves strong even amid an uncertain macro picture — Microsoft looks to be increasingly positioning itself as the core infrastructure provider of the AI era. In other words, hyperscaling has arrived — and it seems here to stay. —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

Title: What’s Happening With LLY Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/04/02: In this photo illustration, the Eli Lilly and Company logo is seen displayed on ... More a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Eli Lilly’s (NYSE: LLY) first-quarter performance was mixed, with revenue meeting expectations but earnings falling short. The company reported adjusted earnings of $3.34 per share versus the projected $3.46, while revenue reached $12.7 billion, aligning with consensus estimates. Although Eli Lilly experienced lower price realization, the strong volume growth for its key drugs contributed positively to top-line performance. However, following a cancer deal with Scorpion Therapeutics in Q1, Eli Lilly lowered its full-year earnings outlook. Moreover, CVS announced its decision to stop covering Zepbound while simultaneously reaching a coverage agreement with Novo Nordisk for Wegovy. This news concerned investors, causing the stock to decline after the results announcement. Now, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Eli Lilly’s revenue reached $12.7 billion in Q1, representing solid 45% year-over-year growth, driven by strong demand for its obesity drug Zepbound, which generated $2.3 billion in sales (a 4.5x year-over-year increase). Other key performers included Mounjaro, with sales up 113% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, and Verzenio, which saw a 10% increase to $1.2 billion. Notably, both Zepbound and Mounjaro sales exceeded consensus estimates of $2.2 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. The company also achieved a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin, reaching 83.5% in Q1. However, increased income taxes and losses from investments in equity securities partially offset the benefits of higher revenues and margin expansion. As a result, earnings grew only 29% to $3.34 per share, compared to $2.58 in the prior-year quarter. Looking forward, Eli Lilly maintains its revenue guidance of $58-61 billion and gross margin projection of 41.5-43.5%, but has lowered its adjusted earnings forecast to $20.78-$22.28 per share, down from the previous range of $22.50-$24.00. LLY has delivered impressive returns of 15% year-to-date (as of April 30), outperforming the S&P 500’s 5% decline during the same period. This investor optimism stems from massive demand for the company’s obesity treatments and positive outcomes from late-stage clinical trials for its daily obesity pill. In fact, the stock has consistently outperformed the broader market for four consecutive years, generating returns of 66% in 2021, 34% in 2022, 61% in 2023, and 33% in 2024. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile, and it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment surrounding tariffs and trade wars, could LLY continue to outperform the market? From a valuation perspective, we believe LLY stock has significant growth potential. At its current level of under $800, LLY trades at 58 times trailing adjusted earnings of $13.76 per share, below the stock’s two-year average P/E ratio of 76x. This higher valuation multiple appears justified given the strong sales growth and robust outlook for the company’s obesity drugs in the coming years. Notably, the $992 average analyst price target reflects over 15% upside potential. We believe investors could use the current dip—resulting from the earnings miss, downward revision to guidance, and CVS dropping Zepbound from its coverage—as an opportunity to acquire LLY stock for robust long-term gains. The company continues to have solid growth potential in the obesity treatment market, and these dips should be viewed as opportunities to enter the stock. Concerns about CVS dropping Zepbound seem overblown, with the impact expected to be limited to small employers. Importantly, Zepbound is the preferred treatment among U.S. physicians compared to Wegovy. While LLY stock looks like it can see higher levels, it is helpful to see how Eli Lilly peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: M&A: Meta’s Four Critical Acquisitions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/04/29/ma-metas-four-critical-acquisitions/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - APRIL 26: In this photo illustration, the logo of Meta Platforms, Inc. is ... More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market performance and candlestick chart visible in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and trading activity, on April 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) If you still think of Meta (NASDAQ:META) as “just the Facebook company,” you’re missing the real story - a story written in billion-dollar deals, aggressive digital land-grabs, and a playbook of strategic domination that would make even the most ruthless CEOs blush. Over the past decade, four critical acquisitions didn’t just help Meta survive - they catapulted it into an empire. As an aside, for more Meta see Zuckerberg vs Musk: Who Lost More Wealth In 2025? Investors tend to be skeptical about acquisitions - but they aren’t all bad, as Meta has shown. When done right, they have a purpose. They help expand, create moats, and in some cases, cripple the competition. Identifying such competitive advantages (or disadvantages) from acquisitions is one of the lenses we apply in High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s break down the four game-changers that made Meta the beast it is today. Imagine buying a scrappy photo-sharing app with few million users and turning it into a massive business. That’s exactly what Meta (then Facebook) did when it scooped up Instagram for what now looks like a "modest" $1 billion in 2012. Fast forward to 2025 and Instagram’s share of Meta’s revenue could exceed 50% in 2025. Yes, you read that right! That would mean nearly $80-90 billion in revenue from Instagram ads. Assuming net margin of 30% (Meta overall has 35%+) and a modest PE multiple of 20x, Instagram alone is worth $500 billion. That’s bigger than most S&P 500 cash rich giants! $19 billion sounded insane at the time. But Meta wasn’t buying WhatsApp for its revenues - it was buying scale, reach and relevance in every corner of the globe. WhatsApp has nearly 3 billion monthly unique users. While it is far from Instagram-level monetization, WhatsApp is positioning itself as Meta’s "super app" for payments, e-commerce, and business messaging. There are estimates of “business messaging” itself having revenue potential of $30-$40 billion. India is home to the largest WhatsApp user base of nearly 500 million. The government of India removed 100 million user cap for WhatsApp Pay at the end of 2024 - opening the digital payment market to more competition, which is currently dominated by Google Pay and PhonPe. When Meta acquired Oculus VR in 2014, people thought Zuckerberg had lost his mind. (VR headsets? Really?) But Oculus wasn’t just a tech toy - it was the first brick in Zuckerberg’s ambitious vision for the "metaverse," a concept Meta has been pouring over $10 billion per year into developing. Oculus, now rebranded as Meta Quest, dominates the consumer VR market - with over 70% unit market share globally. While still a small fraction of Meta’s total revenue, the growth of the VR market is explosive. According to IDC, the global AR/VR headset unit sales could more than triple by 2028. If Instagram was about photos, and WhatsApp about messages, CTRL-Labs was about the future of how we even interact with technology. Meta quietly picked up this brain-computer interface startup for a rumored $500 million to $1 billion, and it could end up being one of its most profound investments. CTRL-Labs’ technology is still in the experimental stage, but it’s part of Meta’s larger vision for the metaverse and augmented reality. Meta has integrated CTRL-Labs into its Reality Labs division, where it’s exploring how brain-computer interfaces could revolutionize VR/AR interaction and eventually lead to neural-driven devices. As Meta continues to invest in CTRL-Labs’ neural interface technology, the integration of this system into VR headsets and AR glasses could redefine user interaction. When people criticize Meta for its massive spending sprees, they miss the forest for the trees. These four deals - Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and CTRL-Labs - aren’t just acquisitions. They’re foundations. Each one secured Meta’s dominance in a critical arena: social media, global communications, virtual reality, and human-machine interaction. Does it make you want to buy and hold on to Meta stock? Well that wouldn’t be the worst idea. But here is the thing - going all-in in a single stock - no matter how good - is a recipe for disaster. Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio is designed to diversify stock-specific while providing exposure to the upside. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Bitcoin Price to Explode as Strategy Drives Hyperbitcoinization. BTC Bull Token to Follow?

Bitcoin is making headlines again, and for all the right reasons. From Saylor’s Strategy to Asia’s Metaplanet, Bitcoin treasuries are proliferating. At the same time, analysts predict new all-time highs could be mere weeks away. And now, BTC Bull token offers a high-octane way to ride the momentum. Bitcoin is once again proving its staying power, not just as a speculative asset, but as a bona fide treasury reserve tool for major firms. More and more companies are creating their own treasuries, with new companies forming explicitly for that purpose. The wider Bitcoin community is electric. Analysts point out that Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a stable store of value, especially amid political uncertainty surrounding U.S. policies. Community sentiment around Bitcoin on sites like CoinMarketCap, Twitter, and Reddit has surged over the past month. While the crypto Fear & Greed index is sitting solidly neutral at 51, that’s mainly because altcoins have lost ground to Bitcoin’s dominance. Some experts are forecasting new all-time highs as early as May. There are many reasons behind the predictions – first-quarter earnings, Trump’s aggressive pro-crypto stance – but one factor in particular is driving discussion. What’s driving the divergence? Bitcoin’s position as an independent asset has never been stronger. Multi-billion-dollar companies are building $BTC treasuries and spending USD to do it. Why? In hopes that $BTC decouples from the broader market and charts its own path upwards, potentially to highs above the previous mark of $104K. The stock market has been mired in uncertainty in the wake of US President Trump’s erratic and abrupt moves. It’s also sent investors scurrying for so-called ‘safe haven’ assets not tied directly to stock market performance. Bitcoin has proved to be the best of the bunch, outperforming everything and lending credence to the apparent decoupling trend. In fact, the old perception of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation may be giving way to Bitcoin as a hedge against even worse. That would be an ironic development, given crypto’s notorious volatility. In any event, the search for a safe haven is bullish for Bitcoin, but the massive capital inflow also means it’s getting harder for smaller investors to really benefit. BTC Bull says yes. Bitcoin Bull ($BTCBULL) provides a unique solution to this challenge. The project is designed to offer leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s gains without the complexities of margin trading or futures contracts. $BTCBULL offers strategic token burns and key airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches critical price points. Each milestone triggers a response by the protocol, designed to tie $BTC and $BTCBULL’s price growth together. The combination of token burns + $BTC and $BTCBULL airdrops gives token holders three ways to earn: Stack BTC Bull’s three ways to earn on top of Bitcoin’s natural price potential, and it’s no wonder that the BTC Bull presale has already passed the $5M mark. Check out our guide on how to buy BTC Bull token, and see why we think the token price can reach $0.00835 from its current price of $0.002485 by the end of the year. Visit the BTC Bull token presale. Bitcoin’s growing perception as a safe haven and institutional reserve asset aligns perfectly with $BTCBULL’s value proposition. With memecoin fervor high and traders continuing to chase gains, projects like Bitcoin Bull are uniquely positioned to capture both mainstream and crypto-native attention.

Title: DJT Stock Soars 57% as Trump Media Expands Into Financial Services
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2025/04/27/djt-stock-soars-57-as-trump-media-expands-into-financial-services/

ByJoel Shulman ByJoel Shulman, Contributor. Trump Media and Technology Soars 57% in 2 weeks with Support from New Deals with Crypto.com and ... More Yorkville America Digital Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) has delivered a stunning stock market performance in recent weeks. Since April 8, DJT shares have rocketed roughly +57%, making it the #1 stock in the Russell 1000 Growth Index over that period and outperforming the second-best performer by about 10 percentage points. The stock jumped from about $16.66 on April 8 to $26.14 by April 25. Such a meteoric rise evokes memories of meme-stock short squeezes — and indeed, DJT’s past rallies have featured that dynamic — but this time a different force is at work. Rather than a flash-in-the-pan frenzy, the surge in DJT appears driven by ambitious growth moves and strategic partnerships, not just a short squeeze. The company is leveraging its Trump-brand loyal following and expanding into financial services in ways that could signal significant long-term opportunity. DJT stock price surged in April 2025, far outpacing the broader market and its peers. DJT’s recent rally has been nothing short of remarkable. In a span of just over two weeks, the stock price climbed nearly 60%, decisively beating not only the broader market but every other name in the large-cap growth index. Historically, such explosive moves in Trump-linked stocks have often been attributed to technical market mechanics — notably short sellers getting squeezed. Last autumn, for example, Trump Media’s stock saw a triple-digit percentage spike largely due to a classic short squeeze as speculators betting against the company found few shares available to buy back. Donald Trump owns roughly 57% of the company’s stock, a stake unlikely to trade anytime soon, which severely limited the float and turbocharged that squeeze. This time around, however, many analysts agree the primary catalyst isn’t a short squeeze. Yes, there are still skeptics shorting DJT — and with Trump’s large insider ownership, any increase in short interest could quickly become precarious for them. But the current buying pressure is coming from concrete business developments and investor optimism about new revenue streams, rather than a sudden rush of shorts covering positions. In other words, the market is rallying behind DJT’s growth story, not just a trading technicality. A major catalyst is the recent announcement that Yorkville America Digital has signed a strategic partnership agreement with Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) and Crypto.com to launch a series of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded products (ETPs) through the Truth.Fi brand. The initial ETPs are expected to focus on cryptocurrencies, bringing together powerful brands and marketing reach to a fast-growing financial sector. According to public statements, TMTG CEO Devin Nunes described the agreement as a major step in diversifying TMTG into financial services and digital assets. Yorkville America Digital CEO Troy Rillo also emphasized that the new products would align with America-First investment themes and anticipated strong demand from investors once the ETFs launch later this year. This strategic partnership leverages the brand power of TMTG, the financial expertise of Yorkville America Digital, and the technological infrastructure of Crypto.com. It marks a decisive step for TMTG, moving beyond media into the lucrative world of financial products with minimal capital outlay and maximum brand leverage. In recent weeks, there has been a flurry of public announcements from Troy Rillo, CEO of Yorkville America Digital, who has announced deals with Crypto.com, SMA partnerships, and other forthcoming ETF offerings. These moves reflect an ambitious and aggressive push into financial services, offering new product lines that could rapidly generate fee-based revenue streams for Trump Media. For investors, these moves into fintech represent a dramatic broadening of Trump Media’s business model. The company best known for Truth Social and Truth+ streaming is now positioning itself to capture a slice of the booming ETF and crypto investment market. The global ETF market exceeds $10 trillion in assets, so even a small foothold could translate into significant revenue for TMTG via management fees or partnerships. One of the strategic aces up TMTG’s sleeve is the Trump brand itself – and the unusually loyal following that comes with it. In the ultra-competitive world of ETFs and crypto offerings, garnering investor attention is half the battle. Millions of supporters of Donald Trump have a cultural or ideological affinity for his ventures, and that could translate into immediate demand for products like Truth.Fi’s “patriotic” investment funds. This unique audience gives Trump Media a critical distribution and marketing advantage that most new entrants could never replicate. Moreover, Truth Social already attracts many crypto enthusiasts (drawn by pro-freedom, anti-establishment sentiments), and TMTG can cross-promote Truth.Fi products to those users at minimal cost. In a world where dozens of crypto ETFs and hundreds of altcoins compete for attention, a high-profile name like “Trump” attached to an investment vehicle provides instant differentiation. Beyond the brand cachet, Trump Media’s approach to entering new markets is notable for its capital efficiency. Rather than building an entire financial services arm from scratch, TMTG is partnering with established players to do the heavy lifting — while it provides the brand and audience. This kind of model can be extremely high-margin. Essentially, every dollar of revenue generated from, say, an ETF fee or a trading spread on Crypto.com, comes with minimal incremental cost for TMTG. The infrastructure and operational expenses are borne by partners, so Trump Media’s share of the economics is almost pure profit. It’s the concept of an “infinite ROI” — leveraging someone else’s investment to generate returns for your company. A classic analogy is Dell’s strategy: Dell would bundle third-party peripherals (like monitors, printers, and accessories made by other companies) with its computers and sell them to customers. Dell didn’t spend a dime on developing those peripherals, yet it earned a margin on each sale — an essentially infinite return on that portion of the transaction. Trump Media is employing a similar playbook. By partnering with Yorkville America Digital and Crypto.com, it can offer financial products under the Truth.Fi brand without bearing the full development cost. Revenues from these products (such as fund management fees or revenue-sharing on trading activity) drop straight to the bottom line for TMTG. Importantly, this strategy also accelerates time-to-market and reduces execution risk. Instead of spending years and tens of millions of dollars building a crypto trading platform or ETF team, TMTG plugged into partners that already have these capabilities. What does all this mean for DJT’s future? In short, substantial potential upside. The company’s core social media business (Truth Social) has yet to prove it can generate massive revenues, but these new financial ventures could open multiple new income streams. If even one of the Truth.Fi ETFs attracts significant assets, it could mean millions in annual fee revenue for TMTG with very little incremental expense. There are virtually endless possibilities for additional financial products (think crypto lending, payments, or co-branded credit cards) that could be introduced leveraging the same partnership-driven model. It’s also worth noting that while this rally isn’t primarily a short squeeze, the ingredients for one are still in place. Donald Trump’s large ownership stake (over half the company) means the effective float of tradable shares is limited, so any surge in demand could send shorts scrambling to cover. By focusing on fundamentals and executing a solid strategy, TMTG could actually set the stage for another short squeeze — rewarding loyal investors even further. With momentum building and a credible growth plan unfolding, DJT is a stock that investors can no longer afford to ignore. Love or hate the politics around it, the company is demonstrating real business initiative — moving aggressively into fintech in a way that monetizes the Trump brand’s unique strengths. The recent 57% surge in the stock’s value is a reflection of that newfound optimism. Could the shares be volatile? Certainly. But the upside scenario — where Truth.Fi and other partnerships add meaningful revenue and earnings — suggests this rally may have more room to run. Moreover, management hints that additional deal announcements are on the way, which could further bolster the bull case. In a market full of growth stocks, DJT has set itself apart at the top of the leaderboard, and it could just be getting started. ------------------------------------ Disclosure Note: past performance is no guarantee of future results.
