Title: OpenAI’s $1T IPO: a Split from Nvidia’s Costly AI Dominance?

Our goal is to help readers make informed decisions. Read more. Key Takeaways OpenAI is reportedly preparing for a landmark initial public offering (IPO) that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, making it one of the largest IPOs in history. The filing could come as early as the second half of 2026, with a potential listing by 2027, as OpenAI looks to expand beyond its private funding base and tap public markets for growth capital. The move follows a corporate restructuring that established the nonprofit OpenAI Foundation and reduced Microsoft’s ownership to around 27%, giving Sam Altman’s company greater strategic and operational independence. This IPO represents more than just a record-breaking valuation; it marks the beginning of OpenAI’s next phase of industrial growth. With rising compute demands and a heavy reliance on Nvidia’s hardware, the company is seeking record amounts of new capital to build its own energy-efficient infrastructure and diversify its chip supply chain. As OpenAI prepares for its public listing, the company is also redefining its financial and business structure to support the next phase of growth. Its restructuring and forthcoming IPO represent the foundation of a long-term strategy: to create the resources, autonomy, and scale needed to lead the next era of intelligent computing in a way that makes sense for investors. In essence, OpenAI’s potential $1 trillion IPO isn’t just about valuation: it’s about taking the steps to make it more market-friendly, enabling the kind of financial scaling that makes sense for a new entrant to the Mag 7, one who wants to dictate the future of artificial intelligence. In recent weeks, OpenAI completed a sweeping corporate restructuring that established the OpenAI Foundation, a nonprofit entity designed to anchor the company’s mission around the safe and ethical development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). The Foundation now holds a 26% equity stake in the for-profit OpenAI Group PBC, a public benefit corporation structured to balance two often competing forces, namely mission oversight and capital flexibility. At the same time, Microsoft’s ownership has been reduced to around 27%, signaling OpenAI’s clear intent to lessen its dependence on a single strategic partner and broaden its governance base. This new hybrid corporate structure provides OpenAI with the flexibility to raise capital from public markets while maintaining its nonprofit influence at the board level. This change invites a key question: how will OpenAI reconcile the commercial pressures of a trillion-dollar enterprise with its foundational commitment to developing AGI safely and responsibly? CEO Sam Altman’s vision for OpenAI will require massive investment, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars, to expand compute capacity and secure reliable renewable energy sources. Looking ahead, OpenAI may also develop its own custom AI chips to reduce dependence on suppliers like Nvidia and strengthen control over its hardware stack. It’s an ambitious step, but one that could be essential to sustaining the race toward AGI. An IPO would provide OpenAI with the capital it needs to accelerate its long-term vision, while also rewarding major early backers, including SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. With revenues projected to reach $20 billion but losses climbing due to the soaring cost of Nvidia hardware, going public is both a strategic necessity and a natural next step. Ultimately, OpenAI aims to build a vertically integrated AI economy—one that unites chips, compute, and energy into a self-sustaining industrial ecosystem capable of powering the next era of intelligent technology. As the IPO comes into view, one of the clearest signals from OpenAI’s next phase is a push to escape the cost and energy bottlenecks tied to its current hardware platform. The strategy centers on both reducing dependency on Nvidia’s GPU monopoly (and its rising costs), as well as improving efficiency in infrastructure built for AGI-scale demands. Nvidia’s GPUs remain the backbone of most AI training operations, including those of OpenAI. However, these GPUs come with steep costs and fast-growing energy demands. Supply-chain tightness and per-unit price increases have amplified these operating expenses, while US power grids strain under the scale of these large AI training clusters. Chinese competitors, such as DeepSeek, appear to be outpacing Nvidia’s GPUs in terms of energy efficiency. This highlights a strategic gap, and if OpenAI wants to scale successfully, it needs to address this gap. In fact, there are reports that the company is already buying up all the RAM it can, some saying it accounts for 40% of the global DRAM demand. Since supply can’t possibly keep up, this has had an unfortunate effect of pushing prices to historical highs: anyone looking to buy RAM right now will have to reckon with a 171% year-on-year increase in the price tag. This October, OpenAI entered into a multi-gigawatt deal with AMD (Instinct MI450 and future generations), on track for a 1 GW deployment in the second half of 2026, and up to 6 GW over time. At the same time, the company is exploring Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and other accelerator platforms to further diversify its compute stack – and, ideally, optimize its energy costs. The shift toward a more varied compute ecosystem could increase OpenAI’s GFLOPS per watt, while reducing its cost per watt and mitigating its supplier risk. Overall, it could position OpenAI as a more resilient infrastructure player, not just an LLM model operator. OpenAI’s IPO may be the culmination of one wave – and the spark of the next. As infrastructure, software, and energy converge, companies moving into publicly traded markets could redefine how investors access the growing AI narrative. AI stocks are surging – and have been for much of the last two years. Nvidia recently reached a whopping $5T market capitalization: a historic milestone not just in the tech sector, but for any company. And it doesn’t look like the growth’s going to stop there. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang claimed the company is looking at a $500B worth of AI chip orders in 2026, which sparked number of analysts to claim that this kind revenue would mean the stock still has a lot of upside to it. CoreWeave, an AI-infrastructure provider, has seen its share prices rise rapidly since its IPO in March, currently trading at $126 – over three times its price at launch. If OpenAI’s IPO unfolds smoothly, it could ignite the next wave of AI investment, positioning the company as the software counterpart to Nvidia’s hardware dominance. Together, they would represent a kind of “completion” of the AI ecosystem that investors have long been anticipating. OpenAI’s public debut would likely act as a catalyst for competition among chipmakers, cloud providers, and energy firms, all racing to deliver the lowest cost per watt for AGI-scale compute. This global reshuffling echoes broader geopolitical dynamics, as nations like Saudi Arabia pursue ambitious AI strategies positioned between U.S. and Chinese interests, leveraging their energy resources to become major players in the next era of artificial intelligence. The core of the AI space may see a shift away from Nvidia – today’s GPU supply’s dominant force – and toward vertically integrated ecosystem players with hardware, compute, and energy in-house. At the very least, that’s what OpenAI envisions. OpenAI’s potential $1 trillion IPO could mark a defining moment in its evolution, from a research pioneer to one of the most successful SaaS, and finally a full-scale industrial powerhouse. Yet the move raises a critical question: can a publicly traded company truly uphold its mission of “safe AGI” when market expectations demand relentless growth? The debate over ethical AI is intensifying across industries, from corporations pursuing AGI to governments deploying AI for surveillance, as seen in ICE’s use of AI to monitor social media activity. As OpenAI channels public capital into more efficient hardware and energy systems, it faces the complex challenge of balancing innovation with ethical responsibility. If successful, the company could not only lessen its dependence on Nvidia but also redefine what true AI leadership means, measured not just by model intelligence but by efficiency, autonomy, and the ability to balance moral restraint with profit.

Title: Bitcoin’s Last Support Before $100K Breaks as 'Mag 7' Skew Flips, Oracle CDS Surges

Bitcoin BTC$101,389.92 has fallen below a key support level that had been holding back a slide toward $100,000, amid weakening momentum in tech stocks. The leading cryptocurrency fell below $106,000 during Asian trading hours, penetrating the level that had offered support multiple times in recent weeks, according to CoinDesk data. Major altcoins such as ether ETH$3,320.00, XRP$2.2350 and solana SOL$157.70, with SOL sliding to $157, the lowest since Aug. 3. Ether also fell to its lowest since August, with a bear cross of key moving averages pointing to strengthening of downside momentum and XRP hit a three-week low. BTC's breakdown shifts focus to the $100,000-$101,000 area, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research. A violation there could open the door to a deeper test near $94,000, or even a full retracement toward $85,000, the maximum pain zone that also aligns with strong on-chain support, Thielen said in a note to clients. "While such a move would be extreme, downside risk remains contained as long as bitcoin holds above its prevailing downtrend line," he added. BTC's dour price action follows dwindling odds of rapid Fed rate cuts and signs of bullish turnaround in the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies. Furthermore, there are signs of overexuberance in the so-called “Magnificent 7” stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla — which is typically seen at major market tops. "The put-call skew in the Mag7 complex inverted for the first time since December of last year (i.e. implied volatility of calls traded over puts). This phenomenon has only happened a handful of times. The move implies investors are overwhelmingly positioned for continued upside," analyst Neil Sethi said on X, quoting Goldman Sachs. "Historically, such low skew readings have tended to coincide with short-term consolidation or reversals as optimism peaks," Sethi added. At the same time, the credit default swap (CDS) tied to Oracle, which measures the cost of insuring against a potential default, has surged following the company’s massive third-quarter AI investment disclosures – reaching levels not seen outside periods of significant macro stress. This, according to some analysts, represents investor anxiety regarding the booming AI spending. AI optimism has been one of the major drivers of the bull market in both stocks and wider risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, since 2023. All things considered, bulls might be better off being cautious rather than overly exuberant.

Title: Top investing tips for both AI bulls and bears

Disney pulled all of its channels, including ESPN and ABC, from YouTube TV… and its stock went up. Is there no justice in the world? Rundown But first, there's two sides to every story. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings In my years covering markets, I can't recall a time when there's been more polarizing views on the future of stocks. Sure, there's always chatter when indexes are near record highs about what could send it all crashing down. But it feels different now. The arguments are more multi-faceted, and go beyond the traditional "market-wide valuations are too high" takes. Whether it's concerns over AI capex spending, or cries of unprecedented mega-cap tech weightings in indexes, it seems like the bear case has more meat on the bone right now. On the bullish side of the ledger, investors are happy to lean into the narrative that AI spending will eventually lead to transformational profit growth, pushing stocks even higher. They also see Fed rate cuts as rocket fuel for the entire market, since they've historically served as such, especially for economically sensitive sectors. As a card-carrying (but possibly converted) member of the "not a bubble" camp, the huge sell-off in Meta last week got my attention. It showed that investors are ready to start questioning huge AI spending, even if the company's more diversified tech peers didn't absorb the same share-price hit. But we see both sides of the coin here at First Trade, and have compiled investing recommendations specifically for bulls and bears. For bulls If you're a member of this faction, it's likely you see Fed rate cuts as a godsend, because they'll stimulate economic activity. You also probably feel pretty good about inflation, despite it staying persistently above the Fed's target. Well, you're in luck. Bank of America recently recommended the following sector ETFs that are due for a catch-up if the economy booms in the first quarter of 2026: If you're looking to stick with the AI wave, UBS says these three under-the-radar names are poised for outperformance: For bears If you're fearful of an AI-driven meltdown, fret not, BofA has you covered from this angle as well. The firm says these are the two best places to invest for upside protected from US tech exposure: One additional way to continue outperforming during a tech-driven downturn is through the purchase of momentum stocks. The most popular fund for this is iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM). Jason Browne, the founder of Alexis Investment Partners, told BI this past week that the strategy is ideal for when one area of the market — like the tech sector — enters a lengthy rough patch. With US economic data on ice for the foreseeable future, uncertainty reigns supreme in the market. But now you're armed with some trades to deploy, regardless of where you line up. "If you come at the king, you best not miss." — Omar Little from "The Wire" Let's just say I learned this the hard way, and am currently eating crow. Last week, ahead of Amazon's earnings, First Trade wrote about the drastic underperformance of the company's stock over the past five years, relative to the Mag 7 and S&P 500. Well, Andy Jassy must've used it as bulletin-board material, because Amazon promptly crushed earnings and sent its stock spiking 10% (pictured above). The main reason was the stellar performance of AWS, which is also one of the main areas of AI investment. In one fell swoop, Amazon dispatched lingering worries about a core business and assuaged concerns over huge AI spending. The stock still has a long way to go to catch up with peers, but last week was a massive step in the right direction. This chart from Bank of America supports one of the recommendations from the Market Musings section above: buy Chinese stocks if you're afraid of a US tech sell-off. The light blue line — which plots Chinese stocks versus government bonds — is close to a multi-decade low, suggesting immense catch-up potential. Compare that to the dark blue line, which offers the same ratio for US stocks versus sovereign bonds. It's at multi-decade highs, implying limited relative upside. In this section, a weekly feature on Mondays, we manage a hypothetical portfolio. Current stocks: Amazon, JPMorgan, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla Now that's more like it! The First Trade index absolutely crushed it over the last week, and a big part of that was the new addition of Nvidia. Not to mention Amazon spiking 10% on Friday after blockbuster earnings. Those two stocks largely carried our basket of stocks to market-beating performance. What we have here is a perfect example of the electric upside offered by the tech stalwarts that make up the Magnificent 7. These stocks are largely responsible for the stock market's ongoing record-breaking rally, given their massive weightings, and the First Trade index got the same boost as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. When all was said and done, the First Trade index ended the week 6% higher, handily beating the S&P 500's 1% return. Also, after trailing the S&P 500 last week, First Trade is now outperforming it by more than double since this project started. Can we keep the roll going and do even better this week?
