Title: AVGO Stock AI Jackpot: $51B Shareholder Returns
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/avgo-stock-ai-jackpot-51b-shareholder-returns/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:40:46Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has returned an impressive $51 billion to its investors through direct cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-focused strategy has delivered extraordinary results in 2025, with the stock posting a remarkable 50% year-to-date return, dramatically outperforming the broader market and establishing AVGO as one of the year’s most compelling semiconductor investments despite recent volatility. See – What’s Behind The Surge In Broadcom’s Stock? – for more details. Broadcom's commitment to consistent income generation continues through its steady quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, maintaining an annualized dividend of $2.36 that yields approximately 0.68%, with the company successfully sustaining 13 consecutive years of dividend increases since becoming a public company. The semiconductor giant's robust capital allocation was significantly amplified in April 2025 when the board authorized a massive $10 billion share repurchase program running through December 31, 2025, reflecting management's confidence in the company's strong cash flow generation and its dominant position in AI infrastructure and mission-critical software. Broadcom’s exceptional financial performance has been underpinned by robust revenue growth, with Q3 2025 revenues reaching $16 billion and generating an impressive free cash flow of $7 billion (44% of revenue), while Q4 guidance of $17.4 billion represents a 24% year-over-year increase driven by accelerating demand for AI semiconductors and infrastructure software solutions. Let’s examine some statistics and evaluate how this payout capability compares to the market’s leading capital-return powerhouses. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd largest return to shareholders in history. Why should you care? This is because dividends and share buybacks signify direct and tangible returns of capital to investors. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s financial well-being and its capacity to generate sustainable cash flows. Furthermore, there are numerous other stocks with similar characteristics. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by the total capital returned to investors via dividends and stock repurchases. For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you observe here? The overall capital returned to investors as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a quicker pace, in a more predictable manner, compared to others, yet they have delivered a significantly lower percentage of their market valuation to stockholders. That’s the downside to substantial capital returns. While they are appealing, one must reflect on the question: Am I forfeiting growth and robust fundamentals? Keeping that in perspective, let’s analyze some figures for AVGO. (see Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for further details) Nonetheless, AVGO isn’t immune to significant declines. It experienced a drop of nearly 48% during the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 35% in the 2021 inflation shock, and around 27% in the 2018 correction. Even with robust fundamentals, it’s apparent that the stock can endure substantial setbacks when the market shifts. Quality companies still suffer when investor sentiment changes dramatically. However, the risk isn't restricted to considerable market declines. Stocks can decrease even when markets are favorable – consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. To understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp downturns in the past, read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The Modern Case for Old Money: Why Physical Gold and Silver Are Essential Investments in 2025
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/the-modern-case-for-old-money-why-physical-gold-and-silver-are-essential-investments-in-2025/
Time Published: 2025-10-11T10:09:00Z
Full Content:
The alarm clock reads 3:47 AM when Margaret checks her phone for the third time tonight. The headlines are relentless: inflation stubbornly above 4%, geopolitical tensions escalating, and her retirement account balance fluctuating wildly with each market session. At 58, she’s watching decades of careful savings slowly erode, not from market crashes, but from something far more insidious—the silent theft of currency debasement. Margaret’s story is the same across millions of American households in 2025. While the stock market reaches new nominal highs, the purchasing power of the dollar continues its relentless decline. A gallon of milk that cost $3.50 five years ago now costs over $5.00. The house she bought for $200,000 in 2010 is now “worth” $400,000, but the dollars she would receive are worth significantly less than the dollars she originally spent. This is the reality of living in a fiat currency system where central banks can create money at will, and governments can spend without meaningful constraints. However, throughout this monetary chaos, two assets have maintained their purchasing power for over 5,000 years: gold and silver. These precious metals represent more than mere investments—they are sound money, the ultimate hedge against the systematic debasement of paper currencies. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore why buying physical gold and silver has become not just prudent, but essential for wealth preservation in 2025. We will examine the fundamental differences between owning physical metals versus paper proxies, provide a step-by-step guide for secure purchasing, and explain why working with a trusted dealer like Miles Franklin Precious Metals can make the difference between success and costly mistakes in your precious metals journey. The concept of currency debasement is as old as money itself, but the modern version operates with unprecedented scale and sophistication. When the Federal Reserve creates new dollars through quantitative easing or when Congress authorizes massive spending programs, they are effectively diluting the value of every existing dollar in circulation. This process transfers wealth from savers to debtors, from the prudent to the profligate, and from the middle class to those who receive the newly created money first. Since the abandonment of the gold standard in 1971, the U.S. dollar has lost over 85% of its purchasing power [1]. What could be purchased for $1 in 1971 now requires approximately $6.50 in today’s debased currency. This represents the largest wealth transfer in human history, conducted not through taxation or confiscation, but through the subtle manipulation of the monetary system itself. The acceleration of this process in recent years has been breathtaking. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expanded from less than $1 trillion in 2008 to over $9 trillion at its peak in 2021 [2]. While some of this expansion has been reversed, the precedent has been established: when faced with economic challenges, central banks will create money rather than allow natural market corrections to occur. Inflation, the visible manifestation of currency debasement, has returned with a vengeance in 2025. Despite official statistics suggesting inflation is “under control,” anyone who purchases food, energy, or housing knows the reality is far different. The Consumer Price Index, heavily manipulated through hedonic adjustments and substitution effects, significantly understates the true rate of price increases experienced by ordinary Americans. This environment creates an urgent need for inflation hedges—assets that maintain or increase their value as the purchasing power of currency declines. While stocks, bonds, and real estate can provide some protection, they all exist within the same financial system that creates the problem. Only physical gold and silver offer complete independence from the monetary system that is systematically destroying the value of paper assets. Gold has demonstrated its effectiveness as an inflation hedge throughout history. During the inflationary 1970s, gold rose from $35 per ounce to over $800, providing investors with returns that far exceeded the rate of currency debasement. In the current environment, with gold trading above $3,950 per ounce, the metal continues to fulfill its historical role as the ultimate store of value. The decision between gold and silver investment represents one of the most important choices facing precious metals investors. While both metals serve as monetary assets and inflation hedges, they possess distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different investment objectives and risk tolerances. Gold serves as the ultimate monetary metal, recognized and accepted worldwide as a store of value. Central banks hold gold as their primary reserve asset, with 43% of central banks planning to increase their gold reserves in 2025 [3]. This institutional demand provides a floor under gold prices and ensures continued recognition of gold’s monetary role. The investment case for gold rests on its unparalleled track record as a wealth preservation tool. Gold does not corrode, tarnish, or decay. It cannot be created or destroyed through human action. These physical properties, combined with its historical role as money, make gold the ultimate insurance policy against monetary system failure. Silver offers a more complex investment proposition, serving dual roles as both a monetary metal and an essential industrial commodity. The industrial demand for silver has exploded in recent years, driven by the green energy transition, electric vehicle production, and advanced electronics manufacturing. Solar panels alone consume over 100 million ounces of silver annually, and this demand is projected to double by 2030 [4]. The gold-to-silver ratio, currently trading around 81:1, provides insight into silver’s relative value. Historically, this ratio has averaged approximately 16:1, suggesting that silver may be significantly undervalued relative to gold. When this ratio contracts during precious metals bull markets, silver typically outperforms gold by substantial margins. Silver’s lower price per ounce makes it accessible to investors with smaller budgets, allowing for more flexible purchasing strategies. A single ounce of silver costs less than $50, compared to nearly $4,000 for an ounce of gold. This affordability enables investors to make regular, small purchases through dollar-cost averaging strategies. However, silver’s industrial demand also creates additional volatility. Economic recessions can reduce industrial consumption, putting downward pressure on silver prices even as monetary demand increases. Conversely, supply disruptions or technological breakthroughs can create explosive upward price movements that far exceed gold’s performance. For most investors, a balanced approach incorporating both metals provides optimal diversification. A typical allocation might include 70-80% gold for stability and wealth preservation, with 20-30% silver for growth potential and industrial exposure. This combination captures the benefits of both metals while managing the unique risks associated with each. The distinction between physical vs. paper gold represents perhaps the most critical decision facing precious metals investors. While paper alternatives like ETFs, futures contracts, and mining stocks offer convenience and liquidity, they introduce counterparty risks and systemic vulnerabilities that can prove devastating during the very crises that precious metals are meant to protect against. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) like GLD and SLV provide easy exposure to precious metals prices through traditional brokerage accounts. However, these funds hold metal on behalf of shareholders, creating a layer of intermediation between the investor and the actual asset. During periods of extreme market stress, ETF shares may trade at significant discounts to their underlying metal value, and redemption mechanisms may fail to function properly. More concerning is the practice of fractional reserve precious metals, where multiple claims exist against the same physical metal. The London Bullion Market Association estimates that paper claims against physical gold exceed actual metal availability by ratios of 100:1 or higher [5]. In a crisis scenario where multiple investors simultaneously demand physical delivery, the system would collapse, leaving paper holders with worthless claims. Futures contracts and other derivatives create even greater risks, as they are settled primarily in cash rather than physical metal. These instruments serve the financial system’s need for price discovery and speculation but provide no protection against monetary system failure. During the 2008 financial crisis, numerous commodity funds collapsed despite rising underlying asset prices, demonstrating the dangers of derivative-based exposure. Physical bullion ownership eliminates these counterparty risks entirely. When you hold physical gold or silver, you possess direct ownership of a tangible asset that exists independently of the financial system. No bank failure, brokerage collapse, or government decree can eliminate your ownership of physical metal stored securely under your control. The peace of mind that comes with physical ownership cannot be quantified in financial terms. During the 2008 financial crisis, investors with physical precious metals slept soundly while those holding paper proxies worried about the solvency of their counterparties. This psychological benefit alone justifies the additional costs and complexities associated with physical ownership. Storage and insurance costs represent the primary disadvantages of physical ownership, typically ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% annually depending on the storage method chosen. However, these costs pale in comparison to the potential losses from counterparty failure or the inability to access your metals during a crisis. The famous phrase “if you don’t hold it, you don’t own it” has become a rallying cry among precious metals investors for good reason. History is littered with examples of paper claims becoming worthless while physical assets retained their value. The choice between physical and paper precious metals is ultimately a choice between true ownership and convenient exposure—a choice that may determine your financial survival during the next monetary crisis. Purchasing physical precious metals requires careful planning and attention to detail. Unlike buying stocks or bonds through a brokerage account, acquiring physical gold and silver involves considerations of authenticity, storage, insurance, and dealer selection that can significantly impact your investment success. The precious metals industry includes dealers ranging from highly reputable, long-established firms to fly-by-night operations that prey on inexperienced investors. The difference between working with a trusted dealer and falling victim to a scam can mean the difference between successful wealth preservation and devastating financial loss. Miles Franklin Precious Metals exemplifies the gold standard in precious metals dealing. Founded in 1989 by David and Andy Schectman, this family-owned business has built an impeccable reputation over more than three decades in the industry. With over $12 billion in precious metals sales and an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau with zero complaints on record, Miles Franklin has earned the trust of investors nationwide [6]. What sets Miles Franklin apart from competitors is their commitment to education and personalized service. Rather than employing high-pressure sales tactics, their experienced brokers take time to understand each client’s unique situation and investment objectives. This consultative approach ensures that investors make informed decisions aligned with their long-term financial goals. The company’s extensive product selection includes investment-grade gold and silver bullion, numismatic coins, and specialty items from major mints worldwide. Their relationships with primary distributors ensure competitive pricing and reliable product availability, even during periods of high demand when other dealers may experience shortages. “In an industry where trust is paramount, partnering with a dealer like Miles Franklin Precious Metals ensures you are getting authentic products at fair prices, with expert guidance to support your precious metals journey.” The choice between coins and bars represents a fundamental decision that affects liquidity, recognizability, premiums, and storage considerations. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each format enables investors to make informed decisions based on their specific needs and circumstances. Government-minted coins like American Gold Eagles, Canadian Gold Maples, and Austrian Philharmonics offer several advantages for precious metals investors. These coins are produced by sovereign mints with guaranteed purity and weight, making them instantly recognizable and highly liquid worldwide. The government backing provides additional assurance of authenticity and quality. The premium over spot price for government coins typically ranges from 3% to 8% for gold and 15% to 25% for silver, depending on market conditions and product availability. While these premiums represent additional upfront costs, they often provide better resale value and easier liquidation compared to generic products. Privately minted bars and rounds offer lower premiums, typically 1% to 3% over spot price for gold and 5% to 15% for silver. These products maximize the amount of precious metal acquired for each dollar invested, making them attractive for investors focused purely on metal accumulation rather than numismatic value. However, private mint products may face greater scrutiny during resale, as buyers must verify the reputation and authenticity of lesser-known manufacturers. Some private mint products also carry lower liquidity, particularly in smaller markets or during periods of market stress. Size considerations affect both premiums and practicality. Larger bars typically carry lower premiums per ounce but may be more difficult to sell in smaller quantities. One-ounce coins and bars provide optimal flexibility for most investors, allowing for partial liquidation without breaking larger positions. The purchasing process with a full-service dealer like Miles Franklin begins with a consultation to determine your investment objectives, budget, and timeline. Experienced brokers can explain the advantages and disadvantages of different products, helping you make informed decisions based on current market conditions and your specific needs. Pricing transparency is crucial in precious metals transactions. Reputable dealers provide real-time pricing based on current spot prices plus clearly disclosed premiums. Miles Franklin’s brokers explain all costs upfront, including any shipping, insurance, or handling fees, ensuring no surprises at the time of purchase. Payment methods vary among dealers, with most accepting wire transfers, checks, and credit cards. Wire transfers typically offer the best pricing, as they eliminate credit card processing fees that may be passed on to customers. Some dealers offer price protection programs that lock in pricing for a specified period, allowing time for payment processing without market risk. Delivery and insurance are handled professionally by established dealers. Products are shipped via insured, signature-required delivery services, with full insurance coverage from the dealer’s vault to your doorstep. Tracking information is provided, and most dealers maintain insurance coverage until successful delivery is confirmed. Secure storage represents one of the most important aspects of physical precious metals ownership. The storage method you choose affects not only the safety of your investment but also its liquidity and your peace of mind. Home storage offers maximum privacy and immediate access to your metals but requires significant security measures. A high-quality safe, preferably fireproof and waterproof, represents the minimum security requirement. The safe should be bolted to the structure and concealed from casual observation. Home insurance policies may require additional coverage for precious metals, and some insurers impose limits on coverage amounts. Bank safe deposit boxes provide professional security at reasonable cost, typically $50 to $200 annually depending on box size and location. However, access is limited to banking hours, and some experts question whether safe deposit box contents are fully protected during banking crises or government emergencies. Professional vault storage offers the highest level of security and insurance coverage. Established dealers like Miles Franklin can facilitate secure, audited storage solutions through partnerships with premier vault facilities across North America and internationally. These facilities provide segregated storage, regular audits, and comprehensive insurance coverage, ensuring your metals are protected against theft, damage, and loss. The choice of storage method depends on factors including the size of your holdings, your comfort level with home security, and your need for regular access. Many investors employ a combination of storage methods, keeping a small amount at home for immediate access while storing the majority in professional facilities for maximum security. The proliferation of sophisticated counterfeiting techniques has made the ability to spot fake gold coins and silver bars an essential skill for precious metals investors. While purchasing from reputable dealers like Miles Franklin virtually eliminates the risk of receiving counterfeit products, understanding basic authentication methods provides additional confidence and protection. The magnet test represents the simplest method for detecting fake precious metals. Gold and silver are not magnetic, so any attraction to a strong magnet indicates the presence of ferrous metals. However, this test is not foolproof, as sophisticated counterfeits may use non-magnetic base metals like copper or tungsten. Weight and dimension verification provides more reliable authentication. Genuine precious metals coins and bars have precise specifications for weight, diameter, and thickness. A digital scale accurate to 0.1 grams and a set of calipers can verify these specifications against published standards. Significant deviations indicate potential counterfeits. The ping test utilizes the unique acoustic properties of precious metals. When struck gently, genuine gold and silver produce a clear, sustained ringing sound, while base metals create a dull thud. This test requires practice and experience to interpret accurately but can be effective for detecting obvious fakes. Professional testing equipment like electronic gold testers and acid test kits provide more definitive results but require training and experience to use safely and accurately. These tools are typically used by dealers and coin shops rather than individual investors. Visual inspection can reveal obvious counterfeits through examination of details like mint marks, edge lettering, and surface quality. Genuine government coins exhibit sharp, clear details and consistent quality, while counterfeits often show blurred features, incorrect fonts, or poor surface finish. The most effective protection against counterfeit precious metals is purchasing exclusively from highly reputable, long-established dealers. Companies like Miles Franklin Precious Metals, with over 30 years in business and an impeccable reputation, have rigorous authentication procedures and relationships with primary distributors that virtually eliminate the risk of counterfeit products reaching customers. When purchasing from secondary markets, private parties, or online auctions, the risk of encountering counterfeits increases dramatically. The potential savings from these sources rarely justify the risks involved, particularly for inexperienced investors who may lack the knowledge and equipment necessary for proper authentication. The gold price prediction for 2025 from major financial institutions reflects unprecedented bullish sentiment among professional analysts and institutional investors. Goldman Sachs has set a target of $4,000 per ounce by mid-2026, with potential upside to $4,300 by year-end [7]. UBS has raised its forecast to $3,800 by end-2025, while JPMorgan projects an average of $3,675 in the fourth quarter of 2025, climbing toward $4,000 by mid-2026 [8]. These forecasts represent more than mere speculation—they reflect fundamental changes in the global monetary system that are driving unprecedented demand for precious metals. Central bank gold purchases have reached historic levels, with 43% of central banks planning to increase their reserves in 2025, up from just 29% in the previous year [9]. This institutional demand provides a powerful floor under gold prices and signals growing concerns about currency stability among monetary authorities worldwide. Geopolitical tensions continue to escalate, creating additional safe-haven demand for precious metals. The ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, combined with rising tensions between major powers, have investors seeking assets that exist outside the traditional financial system. Gold and silver provide this independence, maintaining their value regardless of political developments or sanctions regimes. Monetary policy uncertainty adds another layer of support for precious metals prices. Despite efforts to combat inflation through interest rate increases, central banks face the impossible task of maintaining price stability while supporting heavily indebted governments and financial systems. This policy contradiction virtually guarantees continued currency debasement and inflation, driving demand for real assets like gold and silver. The silver price forecast appears even more bullish, with some analysts predicting the metal could reach $50 per ounce in 2025, challenging its previous all-time high [10]. Silver’s unique position as both a monetary metal and essential industrial commodity creates multiple demand drivers that could propel prices significantly higher. Industrial demand for silver continues to accelerate, driven by the green energy transition and technological advancement. Solar panel production alone consumes over 100 million ounces annually, while electric vehicle manufacturing, 5G infrastructure, and advanced electronics create additional industrial consumption. This demand is largely inelastic, meaning it continues regardless of price levels. Supply constraints add urgency to the silver investment thesis. Unlike gold, which is primarily mined for monetary purposes, silver is largely produced as a byproduct of base metal mining. This means silver supply cannot easily respond to price increases, creating the potential for explosive price movements when demand exceeds available supply. The gold-to-silver ratio, currently around 81:1, suggests significant upside potential for silver relative to gold. Historical analysis shows this ratio typically contracts to 40:1 or lower during precious metals bull markets, implying silver could outperform gold by 100% or more if historical patterns repeat. These fundamental drivers create a compelling case for precious metals ownership in 2025 and beyond. While short-term price movements remain unpredictable, the long-term trajectory appears clearly upward, driven by monetary debasement, geopolitical uncertainty, and structural supply-demand imbalances that show no signs of resolution. The ability to hold physical precious metals within tax-advantaged retirement accounts represents one of the most powerful wealth preservation strategies available to American investors. A Precious Metals IRA allows individuals to diversify their retirement savings beyond traditional stocks and bonds while maintaining the tax benefits associated with qualified retirement plans. The Internal Revenue Service permits IRA ownership of specific precious metals products that meet minimum fineness requirements. For gold, the minimum fineness is 99.5%, while silver must be 99.9% pure. Approved products include American Gold and Silver Eagles, Canadian Gold and Silver Maples, Austrian Gold Philharmonics, and various bars produced by approved refiners. Self-directed IRAs provide the vehicle for precious metals ownership within retirement accounts. Unlike traditional IRAs that limit investment options to stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, self-directed IRAs allow investment in alternative assets including real estate, private businesses, and precious metals. This flexibility enables sophisticated investors to create truly diversified retirement portfolios. The process of establishing a Precious Metals IRA involves several steps, beginning with the selection of a qualified custodian who specializes in alternative asset IRAs. The custodian handles all administrative requirements, including IRS reporting, while working with approved depositories to store the physical metals in segregated accounts. Miles Franklin Precious Metals has developed expertise in facilitating Precious Metals IRAs, working with qualified custodians and depositories to streamline the process for their clients. Their experienced team can guide investors through the setup process, explain the various options available, and ensure compliance with all IRS requirements. Funding options for Precious Metals IRAs include direct contributions, transfers from existing IRAs, and rollovers from employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s. Each method has specific rules and timelines that must be followed to avoid tax penalties. Professional guidance from experienced dealers like Miles Franklin can help navigate these requirements successfully. The storage requirement for IRA precious metals mandates that all metals be held by an approved depository rather than in personal possession. This requirement ensures proper segregation and insurance while maintaining the tax-advantaged status of the account. Approved depositories provide regular statements and audit reports, giving investors confidence in the security and authenticity of their holdings. Distribution options from Precious Metals IRAs include taking physical delivery of the metals or selling them and receiving cash distributions. The choice depends on individual circumstances and market conditions at the time of distribution. Required minimum distributions beginning at age 73 can be satisfied through either method. The combination of tax advantages and precious metals ownership makes Precious Metals IRAs particularly attractive for investors concerned about currency debasement and monetary system stability. By holding physical gold and silver within retirement accounts, investors can protect their retirement savings from both market volatility and currency devaluation while maintaining tax-deferred growth potential. The case for owning physical gold and silver in 2025 extends far beyond simple investment returns or portfolio diversification. These precious metals represent a fundamental choice between participating in a monetary system designed to transfer wealth from savers to debtors, or taking control of your financial destiny through ownership of real, tangible assets that have preserved wealth for millennia. The evidence supporting precious metals ownership has never been more compelling. Central banks worldwide are accumulating gold at historic rates, recognizing what individual investors are beginning to understand: fiat currencies are failing, and real assets provide the only reliable protection against monetary debasement. The forecasts from major financial institutions, predicting gold prices above $4,000 and silver approaching $50, reflect not speculation but recognition of fundamental economic realities. The distinction between physical ownership and paper proxies cannot be overstated. In a world where financial institutions hold multiple claims against the same assets, where government policies can freeze accounts and confiscate wealth, and where systemic risks threaten the entire financial system, physical precious metals provide independence and security that no paper asset can match. The process of acquiring physical gold and silver need not be complicated or intimidating. Working with established, reputable dealers like Miles Franklin Precious Metals ensures that your precious metals journey begins on solid ground. Their three decades of experience, impeccable reputation, and commitment to client education provide the foundation for successful precious metals investing. The time for action is now, while precious metals remain available at reasonable premiums and before the next monetary crisis makes acquisition difficult or impossible. Every day of delay represents another day of exposure to currency debasement, another day of watching your purchasing power erode, another day of depending on a financial system that serves its creators rather than its participants. Don’t wait for the next crisis to unfold. Protect your wealth and take a step towards financial sovereignty today. Contact the experienced brokers at Miles Franklin Precious Metals for a private consultation and learn how easy it is to add the timeless security of gold and silver to your portfolio. The choice is yours: continue participating in a monetary system designed to impoverish savers, or take control of your financial future through ownership of humanity’s oldest and most reliable forms of money. The precious metals are waiting. The question is whether you will act before it’s too late. [1] U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2025).
