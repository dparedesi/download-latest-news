While cryptocurrencies retreated from their recent peaks, Anthony Scaramucci‚Äôs alternative investment company, SkyBridge Capital, supercharged Avalanche‚Äôs (AVAX) fundamentals. According to the latest press release, SkyBridge plans to tokenize hedge funds worth $300 million on the Avalanche network. Under this initiative, SkyBridge‚Äôs Legion Strategies Ltd. and Digital Macro Masfer Fund Ltd. will tokenize on AVAX‚Äôs network through leading financial service providers Apex Group and Tokeny. Commenting on the move, SkyBridge‚Äôs CEO and founder, Anthony Scaramucci, stated: Tokenizing our funds on Avalanche, supported by the technology and operational infrastructure of Tokeny and Apex Group, represents a significant step forward in modernizing the alternative investment landscape. We look forward to bringing our hedge funds into the digital, on-chain era, improving transparency, liquidity, and accessibility for our investors. The news renewed sentiments around AVAX‚Äôs potential amidst the ongoing broad market bloodbath. Digital assets trade in the red as Bitcoin falls below $114,000. Nevertheless, analysts remain bullish, perceiving the current correction as a healthy one after BTC‚Äôs surge to all-time highs of around $124,000. With large-cap altcoins in the traders‚Äô radar after the recent Ethereum rally, this article checks AVAX‚Äôs potential comeback once market sentiments improve. The real-world assets (RWAs) sector is experiencing significant growth momentum as DeFi and TradFi converge. Hedge fund tokenization will enrich Avalance‚Äôs ecosystem, as it already hosts tokenized credit, stocks, private equity, venture, and MMFs. Avalanche already hosts tokenized MMFs, private equity, credit, stocks, venture & now hedge funds. Tokenization on Avalanche is bridging TradFi and DeFi with new distribution channels and programmable products. üî∫ This is where capital connects. https://t.co/vEZbo1c4ft ‚Äî Avalancheüî∫ (@avax) August 19, 2025 SkyBridge decision sets AVAX for impressive performance in the coming sessions. The price chart supports a bullish case, pointing to a potential AVAX recovery to $32. That would mean an over 45% gain from the altcoin‚Äôs current price. Financial institutions are never random when venturing into crypto. Avalanche‚Äôs EVM compatibility, near-instant finality, and scalability likely attracted SkyBridge. The $300 million initiative unlocks the AVAX platform for large-scale tokenization. According to Tokeny co-founder Danie Coheur: SkyBridge‚Äôs tokenization on Avalanche proves that with the right technology, trusted operators, and regulatory clarity, tokenization at scale is not just possible, it‚Äôs happening. While the tokenization updates strengthen Avalanche‚Äôs fundamentals, broad market weakness weighs on AVAX‚Äôs performance. The alt hovers at $22 after losing around 1.80% in the past 24 hours. AVAX remained relatively calm as markets crashed ahead of Powell‚Äôs anticipated speech. Meanwhile, Avalanche looks poised to lead the next leg up, fueled by institutional interest, especially if SkyBridge succeeds in its plans. Such a narrative aligns with the bullish chart pattern. The Elliot Wave analysis shows that AVAX is finalizing a wave two correction. This setup phase often precedes a massive wave three rally. The structure highlights possibilities of recoveries to the $32 ceiling. That would be an approximately 45% surge from AVAX‚Äôs market price. However, improved broader market sentiments remain vital to support the upside. Failure to overcome the obstacle between $26 and $27 will likely delay the projected AVAX recovery.

Title: These Dirt Cheap Dividends Pay 4x-9x The Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/08/17/these-dirt-cheap-dividends-pay-4x-9x-the-market/
Time Published: 2025-08-17T12:15:00Z
Full Content:
ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The market-at-large is expensive by historical metrics. So let‚Äôs look past the pricey, low-yielding ETFs in favor of cheap dividends. That‚Äôs right, good ol‚Äô value investing bargains. With high yields too! We‚Äôre talking about divvies of 5%, 8% and even 11% that we‚Äôll discuss in a moment. The spring market dip sure was brief, wasn‚Äôt it? The S&P 500 sank into near-bear territory in roughly a month, then snapped back just as quick. In doing so, Mr. and Ms. Market took valuations to high levels. The S&P 500‚Äôs forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.1 remains in rarefied air, last reached during the COVID rebound, and before that, the dot-com bubble. Which is fine. We‚Äôll leave the 22 P/Es to the vanilla investors while we focus on bargains with respect to two ‚Äúcash is king‚Äù metrics: Let‚Äôs start with Virginia-based electric utility AES Corp. (AES, 5.5% yield), which we recently discussed as a low-beta name. This means AES, being a safe, stodgy utility, is more insulated from market pullbacks than run-of-the-mill dividends. AES also has upside potential. Its renewable energy-selling business gives it growth potential that many utility stocks don‚Äôt have. It‚Äôs also cheap. AES trades at a cheap 5 times cash-flow estimates, as well as a 0.6 PEG that implies it‚Äôs also cheap compared to its growth estimates. (Remember: A PEG under 1.0 signals that a stock is inexpensive.) The stock yields more than 5%, to boot, which is better than the already generous utility sector. Edison International (EIX, 5.9%) is another utility company‚Äîthis one more typical of the sector. It‚Äôs the parent of regulated utility Southern California Edison (SCE), which serves more than 15 million customers and generates much of its electricity from renewable sources including solar, wind, and hydro. It does, however, have a second business‚ÄîTrio (formerly Edison Energy), a global energy advisory firm that serves large commercial, industrial and institutional organizations. Unlike other utilities, however, EIX is a bit more ‚Äúexciting.‚Äù It spent years in court fighting litigation over wildfire damage and ended up having to pay multiple billion-dollar-plus settlements. And the legal drama has returned in 2025. Shares have lost more than a quarter of their value, with most of that coming in January amid Los Angeles County wildfires, including the massive Eaton Fire, which prompted multiple suits against SCE over allegations that the company had ‚Äúviolated public safety and utility codes and was negligent in its handling of power safety shut-offs.‚Äù SCE is also being investigated in connection with the Hurst Fire. If, for a minute, we closed our eyes and ignored all that, there‚Äôs a lot to like about Edison. It‚Äôs expected to generate decent top-line growth and a significant snap-back in profits over the next couple years. The big drop in shares has launched EIX‚Äôs yield to nearly 6%. It trades at just 3 times cash-flow estimates. And its PEG, which at fractionally under 1 suggests the stock is only mildly underpriced, is substantially down from the nearly 3 it traded at when I evaluated the stock a couple years ago. But we can‚Äôt ignore the fire liabilities‚Äîthey‚Äôre why EIX‚Äôs valuations are so low. That makes Edison a much bigger high-risk, high-reward gamble than the average utility. Amcor (AMCR, 5.2% yield) is technically a cyclical stock, but it acts defensively. That‚Äôs because, as a packaging specialist, it‚Äôs in the business of‚Äîwell, other business‚Äôs business. It makes everything from high-barrier paperboard trays for beef and meats to glass dressing bottles to overwrap for home and personal care. And its applications go far beyond the grocery store: Amcor‚Äôs products are used in garden and outdoor products, agriculture, pet care, healthcare, even building and construction. So Amcor is simultaneously a play on the broader economy and all the businesses it supports, but it also fills a vital need across a diversified set of companies. AMCR stands out for a few reasons: Kodiak Gas Services (KGS, 5.2% yield) is an energy services firm that provides natural gas compression services, mostly in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. Its compression units are critical to upstream and midstream natural gas firms, so it‚Äôs able to secure multiyear, fixed-revenue contracts. There‚Äôs nothing novel about the business model, though. Like other energy services firms, if natural gas/liquefied natural gas (LNG) is in demand, Kodiak will be in demand, so the fact that global LNG demand is expected to grow over the next few years bodes well for KGS. That‚Äôs in large part because Kodiak is extremely well-positioned to capture that growth. In late 2023, KGS announced it would acquire CSI Compressco LP to create the industry‚Äôs largest compression fleet. Kodiak‚Äôs fleet is young, too (read: less maintenance and replacement costs). There‚Äôs not much stock history to examine, however. Kodiak is a relatively new issue that went public just a few months before the CSI announcement. But the company has started a dividend and raised it twice since then, including a nearly 10% improvement announced in April 2025. Meanwhile, its yield has wafted up to over 5% amid energy‚Äôs weakness this year‚Äîand left shares relatively cheap. KGS trades at roughly 6 times cash flow estimates and a low PEG of 0.13. Atlas Energy Solutions (AESI, 8.4% yield) is another Permian Basin energy equipment and services firm, this one providing transportation and logistics, storage solutions, and contract labor services to oil and natural gas E&P firms, as well as other oilfield services companies. Its most important offering is mesh frac sand used in hydraulic fracturing (fracking). I had been keeping tabs on it because of its unorthodox streak of dividend hikes, but that streak stopped earlier this year. It‚Äôs not ideal. Nor is the fact that AESI shares have been hammered to the tune of 45% this year. Again, energy services haven‚Äôt had a great 2025, but Atlas has been downright miserable amid slower-than-expected U.S. completion activity and droopy frac-sand prices. If there‚Äôs any silver lining to that, it‚Äôs that AESI shares now trade at just 5.7 times estimates for cash flows, as well as an attractive PEG of 0.75. The dividend at least appears to be safe, too. While things look bad from an adjusted earnings perspective ($1.00 in dividends annually vs. forecasts for just 25 cents this year), Atlas has more than enough FCF to cover the payout. Example: Last quarter, it generated $48.9 million in adjusted FCF while paying out $30.9 million. Those cash flows are substantial because AESI is a low-cost operator‚Äîcrucial for survival in this industry. But like any energy services provider, Atlas needs commodity prices to cooperate. It‚Äôs unusual for a blue-chip stock like United Parcel Service (UPS, 7.5%) to yield north of 7%, but it‚Äôs also rare for a blue-chip stock like UPS to have its shares hemorrhage so much without a recession or broader bear market. Lower-margin e-commerce volumes, higher costs because of its unionized workforce, and a weak freight environment hampered the company in 2024. Then in early 2025, it spooked investors with a weak 2025 forecast and announced that‚Äîin hopes of shifting away from those lower-margin volumes‚Äîit would drastically reduce its business with Amazon (AMZN), which accounted for roughly 10%-12% of annual UPS revenues. The April tariff announcement also hit shares hard. The result? UPS shares have lost nearly half of their value in just two years. The upshot? UPS trades at roughly 8 times cash-flow estimates and has never offered a better yield in its 26 years of trading. Is UPS a dividend trap? Perhaps. The company pulled its full-year revenue and profit forecasts in April, and didn‚Äôt bring them back in its late July report. Meanwhile, Wall Street is expecting a roughly 15% drop in adjusted earnings, to $6.61 per share. That specific number matters: UPS has a target dividend payout ratio of approximately 50% of prior-year adjusted EPS. It currently pays $6.56 across four quarterly dividends. (That‚Äôs 99%!) CEO Carol Tom√© continued to signal commitment to the dividend in the earnings call‚Äî‚ÄúUPS is rock-solid strong and so is our dividend. The UPS dividend is backed by solid free cash flow and a strong investment-grade balance sheet,‚Äù she said‚Äîbut if the delivery giant continues to struggle, simple numbers might force management‚Äôs hand. Western Union (WU, 11.3% yield), somehow, is still in business. Payment apps like PayPal, Venmo and Zelle have been taking business from the ‚ÄúOG‚Äù of money transfer. WU boasts a big yield but for the wrong reason‚Äîits divvie looks big because shares are (deservedly) way down! WU, to its credit, has launched an initiative called ‚ÄúEvolve 2025‚Äù in which it‚Äôs rolling out new products, improvements and an operational efficiency program. It‚Äôs also expanding its digital wallet offerings in Mexico and Singapore. And its latest move, announced just a couple days ago, is the $500 million acquisition of Miami-based International Money Express (IMXI), aka Intermex, which serves some 6 million customers who send money from the United States, Canada, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany to more than 60 countries. But c‚Äômon man‚Äîthis dog is dead. The business trades for 4x cash flow and a sub-5 forward P/E, but who cares? Not me. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.
