Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Title: Is Fidelity Canadian High Quality ETF (FCCQ) the Best Canadian ETF to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Canadian ETFs to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Fidelity Canadian High Quality ETF (TSX:FCCQ) stands against other best Canadian ETFs to buy. After a slow start in 2024, the Canadian stock market saw a strong third quarter, fueled by domestic rate cuts and a recovery in global markets. Year-over-year headline inflation has cooled to align with the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2%. As a result, policymakers have implemented four consecutive rate cuts, with an additional 50 basis point reduction anticipated in December. With the central bank expected to keep cutting interest rates to support the economy, stock market strategists are cautiously optimistic that the rally will continue. In this context, Brent Joyce, chief investment strategist at BMO, shared the following: “The environment is very attractive for equities. It’s been this trifecta of better global growth, interest-rate-sensitive companies themselves, and the interest rate sensitivity of dividends. These were headwinds for the two years that rates were going up, [but they] have flipped into tailwinds for the Canadian stock market now that rates are falling.” While most stocks are influenced by global factors, many companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange are also cyclically driven, meaning their performance is closely tied to the economy and the business cycle. Given the strong connection between the US and Canadian economies, stable growth in the US has provided a boost to Canadian equities. On that front, Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis Research, advises clients to allocate 5% of their equity portfolio to Canadian stocks, making it the second-largest weighting after the 69% recommended for US stocks. The S&P/TSX Composite Index is on track to have its best year since 2009, having set new records 42 times this year and risen 21.09% year-to-date, closely following the S&P 500’s 27.58% gain. Hayes highlighted the broad rally and noted that the market is largely driven by energy and financial stocks, which offer the highest trailing and forward earnings yields, contrasting with the tech sector’s lower yields. On the other hand, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump rattled the markets earlier in November with a proposal to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, aimed at addressing drug trafficking and border issues, along with a 10% tariff on imports from China. This decision had an immediate impact on Canada’s energy sector, which experienced a 2.2% decline amid concerns that rising US crude production would meet domestic demand. At the same time, the Canadian dollar dropped to its lowest level against the US dollar since May 2020, sparking worries about potential inflationary pressures on imports. While the future remains uncertain, the Canadian ETF industry, which began with the world’s first ETF launched in Canada in 1990, has shown notable resilience over the past 30+ years, and continued growth is expected in the years to come. Despite the market volatility this year, Canadian ETFs have managed to navigate the challenges effectively and are well-positioned for another strong year. With only a couple of weeks remaining in the year, the industry is on track to surpass the previous annual record of $58 billion set in 2021. Moreover, following recent data from IFIC showing Canadian ETF sales reached their third-best month ever in October, a new report from research firm ETFGI highlights additional gains in November, along with impressive year-to-date figures. The firm reported net inflows of US$7.5 billion in November, slightly down from the C$8.2 billion reported in IFIC’s October report, but still a strong performance that contributes to the 29th consecutive month of net inflows.

Despite a subdued market along with 100% OFS, Vishal Mega Mart listing was in line with market expectation. I believe retail investors missed this opportunity wherein they had shown less interest in bidding. 33.33% premium over the issue price of ₹78 Listing is justified as we believe it was all because of reasonable valuations when compared to its listed peers and high focus towards catering to India’s growing middle- and lower-middle-income demographics which is strategically focused on underpenetrated markets.

The U.S. Federal Reserve’s final policy meeting of 2024, expected to deliver a 25 basis point rate cut, will have implications beyond U.S. borders, particularly for emerging markets like India. The timing of this decision coincides with the leadership transition to President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. with likelihood of change in guard at US treasury also and for India a newly appointed Governor at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Key Highlights 1. FOMC Decision and Projections - The Fed’s anticipated rate cut signals its continued pivot to a more accommodative stance, aimed at stabilizing the U.S. economy amidst easing inflation and rising geopolitical uncertainties. - Projections for 2025 will guide global markets in understanding the Fed’s long-term strategy, particularly with respect to managing growth and inflation. Geopolitical Context The Fed’s decisions are occurring against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical risks, including ongoing Middle Eastern tensions and a shift in U.S. presidential leadership. These factors may weigh heavily on the Fed’s forward guidance. Jerome Powell’s Outlook - Powell’s commentary will likely focus on the transition of monetary policy amidst evolving global risks. - Markets will scrutinize his assessment of recent inflation moderation, persistent geopolitical risks, and U.S. labor market dynamics. - His views on the Fed’s pivot from tightening to easing in 2024 will set the tone for future monetary policy under new leadership. Impact on the Indian Economy 1. Capital Flows and Currency Volatility - A Fed rate cut generally leads to a weakening of the U.S. dollar, potentially boosting capital inflows into emerging markets like India. - The rupee may benefit from reduced capital outflows, stabilizing against the dollar after recent volatility. 2. Trade and Export Dynamics - A weaker dollar could improve the competitiveness of Indian exports, particularly in sectors like IT services and pharmaceuticals, which benefit from a favorable exchange rate. - However, subdued global growth, as indicated by the Fed’s projections, could dampen overall demand for Indian exports. 3. Inflationary Pressures - Increased foreign inflows and a stable rupee could help ease imported inflation, particularly in oil and commodities, which are crucial for India’s economy. - A softer dollar may lead to lower crude oil prices, easing fiscal and current account pressures. 4. RBI Policy Response - The new RBI Governor is likely to align India’s monetary policy with global trends. - A Fed rate cut may prompt the RBI to maintain or even accelerate its accommodative stance to support domestic growth amidst declining inflation. - India’s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) could consider a rate cut in early 2025 to maintain policy parity and stimulate domestic demand. Broader Implications for India 1. Stock Markets - Indian equity markets could see a boost as foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) look for higher returns in emerging markets amidst a softening U.S. dollar. - Rate-sensitive sectors such as banking, real estate, and infrastructure could particularly benefit from lower borrowing costs. 2. Geopolitical Sensitivity Geopolitical risks, including those influencing crude oil prices, remain a wildcard. Any escalation could offset the benefits of a weaker dollar. 3. Policy Continuity Under New RBI Leadership The incoming RBI Governor will need to strike a balance between supporting growth, anchoring inflation expectations, and managing global financial spillovers from the Fed’s easing cycle. Conclusion The Fed’s decision to cut rates will provide some relief to the Indian economy by improving liquidity conditions and stabilizing the rupee. However, the new RBI Governor will need to carefully navigate domestic and global headwinds, particularly with a focus on growth revival, fiscal discipline, and managing external shocks. Markets will closely watch how India aligns its monetary policy with evolving global dynamics in 2025.months “Moog Motion Controls Pvt Ltd (MMCPL), a subsidiary of Moog Inc, USA, was awarded a contract for supply of “Servo Hydraulic Actuator Loading System and Pneumatic Pressurisation System” on 27th November, 2021 for Rs. 10.94 crore against competitive bidding by following all the required commercial procedures,” it said.

Vishal Mega Mart IPO Vishal Mega Mart’s IPO saw a strong debut on the stock market with a 3.33% listing gain, opening at ₹104 compared to its issue price of ₹78.

The company’s position as a leading offline retailer, consistent financial performance, and reasonable valuation resonated well with investors. However, given that this was a complete offer for sale (OFS), there are no direct benefits to the company, making it a play purely on market sentiment and its growth story in the retail sector.

The company’s recent shift to profitability, coupled with the growing adoption of digital payments, boosted market confidence. However, sustaining this momentum would depend on its ability to maintain profitability and carve out a niche in the competitive fintech sector. Investors are recommended to book profits given the high listing gains, while those wanting to hold should set a stop loss at around ₹400. Sai Life Sciences IPO Sai Life Sciences, a player in the small-molecule drug development and manufacturing space, saw a moderate 18.40% listing gain, debuting at ₹650 compared to its issue price of ₹549.

While the company’s positive financial performance and rising profitability are encouraging, the limited direct benefits from the IPO proceeds may lead to cautious investor sentiment in the long term. It is advisable to book profits at this level, but for those wishing to hold, a stop loss at around ₹585.

Title: Why Intel's Foundry May Be Set For A Comeback
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/16/why-intels-foundry-may-be-set-for-a-comeback/
Time Published: 2024-12-16T11:00:00Z

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 14: The Intel logo is seen outside a pop-up store on Oxford Street ... [+] on November 14, 2024 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Intel stock has declined by over 55% this year and trades at just about $21 per share. While part of the sell-off has come due to Intel’s market share losses in the CPU space and the broader industry pivot toward AI-focused GPU chips for data centers, the bigger issue for Intel has been its foundry business. Intel has invested about $25 billion into the business in each of the last two years and results have been hard to come by. The foundry reported a $7 billion operating loss on $18.9 billion in revenue. That being said, a turnaround is well within sight, in our view. Intel’s next-gen 18A fabrication process technology is almost ready to roll out, and the company also appears to be a key beneficiary of regulatory support under the Trump administration given its strategic importance to U.S. technological independence. See why you should consider selling Nvidia and buying Intel stock. The Latest 18A Process Node Intel is betting big on its 18A process, which it considers its most advanced yet, to turn around its foundry business. The process produces chips with technologies including RibbonFET gate-all-around transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, which are expected to boost performance and power efficiency. The chips using this process will be based on a 1.8-nanometer node size, putting Intel slightly ahead of TSMC’s N2 process which operates at a 2 nm node and is expected to arrive in the second half of 2025. While TSMC claims that its N2 process will outperform Intel’s 18A in some crucial areas, such as SRAM density (enabling it to store more data in a smaller physical area), Intel’s 18A’s backside power delivery gives it a competitive edge​ with reduced power loss and better thermal performance. Good news on the new chip’s progress, or bad news if delays occur, could increase volatility in the stock. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Intel announced in early August that it had reached critical milestones with chips made using the 18A process, noting that the chip had powered on, booted operating systems, and was operational within Intel. The company expects external customers to tape out (move from design to foundry for manufacturing) their first 18A designs in 2025, with large-scale production to begin thereafter. Intel has secured big contracts with this technology, including with the U.S. Department of Defense for the RAMP-C program, which seeks to bring leading-edge semiconductor technology domestically. Other high-profile customers include Amazon and Microsoft, which intend to design custom chips, including AI accelerators. Also see, Do Custom AI Chips Make Marvell Stock A Buy? Although there have been rumors suggesting that chipmaker Broadcom, which has been testing out Intel’s 18A process, was disappointed with the yields of the new process, this was refuted by Intel’s ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger. Intel says that its process shows defect density figures of 0.4 defects per square centimeter for now, which is only slightly worse than TSMC’s benchmarks of 0.33 defects on its legacy N7 and N5 nodes at comparable stages of development - roughly a year before entering high volume production. Given that the standard for this stage of development is typically below 0.5 defects per square centimeter, it means that Intel could be well within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be adequate for generating usable yields. Intel Foundry’s Rising Geopolitical RolePresident-elect Donald Trump’s emphasis on boosting U.S. manufacturing could work in Intel’s favor, given its sizable domestic fabrication footprint. There’s a possibility that Intel could see considerable regulatory support aimed at boosting domestic chip production. For example, the new administration could look at imposing tariffs that make it more expensive for foreign fabrication companies to produce and export chips to the U.S. A stronger emphasis on domestic production, either through tariffs or via other policies, could drive more business to Intel. Intel’s foundry division - which produces chips for third-party customers - could also see stronger demand, particularly as companies look to rely on U.S. suppliers to avoid potential duties. Semiconductors are also critical for national security - an area that Trump has consistently emphasized - and Intel’s domestic manufacturing footprint is likely to be crucial as it helps to secure U.S. technological independence. Intel could also see a higher number of contracts awarded to it from the government, being the only American semiconductor player that both designs and fabricates leading-edge logic chips in the U.S. Intel won a $3 billion government contract to expand chip production for the U.S. military a few months ago, and there’s a possibility that this could scale up further under Trump, who boosted military spending over his last term. Intel’s huge fab capacity and its newest process nodes could help domestic semiconductor designs better secure their supply chains as well. Take Nvidia for example. The GPU titan relies almost exclusively on Taiwan’s TSMC to produce its cutting-edge AI chips. TSMC is based in Taiwan, making production vulnerable to geopolitical tensions with China. Intel, with its U.S.-based manufacturing, would mitigate that risk to a large extent. The decrease in INTC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, and 95% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could INTC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? Foundry Assets Provide A Backstop To Intel’s Valuation The semiconductor foundry business is risky given that management must make massive capital investment decisions based on predictions about future technologies several years before the demand for those technologies materializes. While Intel has seen major missteps with its current investment cycle, there’s probably a pretty limited downside for the stock at the moment. Intel’s stock currently trades at less than 1x its book value - essentially the net value of its assets after subtracting liabilities. This means the market is pricing Intel at just the value of its tangible assets while completely discounting its technological know-how in chip manufacturing and design, its increasing importance to national security, and its future potential. This creates an opportunity for investors who see potential beyond the company’s sizable balance sheet. Intel stock also trades at just about 21x its estimated 2025 earnings, which are depressed by its heavy foundry spending and recent market share losses. Earnings are projected at about $1 per share next year, down from close to $2 in 2022 and about $5 in 2021. As demand picks up, we could see a reversal in both earnings as well as Intel’s valuation multiple. Intel’s new co-CEOs say that the company’s Intel’s foundry business is in the process of being shifted to be a subsidiary, indicating that it could operate independently from the chip-design segment. The executives also indicated that the possibility of separating the foundry business from the rest of the company was an option in the future. This could also help to eventually unlock some value. We value Intel stock at about $27 per share, 30% ahead of the current market price. See our analysis of Intel’s valuation : Expensive or Cheap?
