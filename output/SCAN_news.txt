Full Content:
Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of the common sexually transmitted disease, trichomoniasis, which affects more than a hundred million people worldwide. Metronidazole and tinidazole, agents belonging to the 5-nitroheterocyclic class of antimicrobials, are most often used to treat infection, but increased resistance has been reported and adverse effects of these drugs can be significant. Consequently, an urgent need exists for the development of novel drug entities against trichomoniasis. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Murine models of vaginal T. vaginalis infection are unreliable for unknown reasons. Meanwhile, murine infections with the related bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, tend to be more robust, although susceptibility to different antimicrobials might differ from T. vaginalis. Here, we explored the utility of T. foetus infection as a surrogate model for drug development against T. vaginalis. Four different T. foetus strains caused robust vaginal infection in young mice, while none of four diverse T. vaginalis strains did. Comparison of drug susceptibility profiles revealed that T. foetus and T. vaginalis were similarly susceptible to a range of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. By comparison, proteasome inhibitors were 10- to 15-fold less active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis, although one of the proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, had low micromolar activity or better against multiple strains of both trichomonads. Different strains of T. foetus were used to demonstrate the utility of the murine vaginal infection models for in vivo efficacy testing, including for bortezomib and a gold(I) compound. The differences in susceptibility to proteasome inhibitors may be partially explained by differences in the proteasome subunit sequences between the two trichomonads, although the functional relevance of the proteasome was similar in both organisms. These findings indicate that T. foetus can serve as a reliable surrogate model for T. vaginalis in vitro and in murine infections in vivo, but caution must be exercised for specific drug classes with targets, such as the proteasome, that may display genetic divergence between the trichomonads.

Trichomoniasis, caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common, non-viral sexually transmitted disease in the world with a global incidence of ~156 million, and a global prevalence of 5.4% [1]. The parasite can infect different genitourinary tissues, including the urethra, vagina, and cervix of women, and the prostate and urethra of men [2]. Infected women can experience a broad range of symptoms, including abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, and itching, vulvar or vaginal erythema, and colpitis macularis (“strawberry cervix”) [3]. Many women remain infected for extended periods [3]. Infection in men can lead to mild to moderate urethral discharge and urethral inflammation, but symptoms tend to be less severe than in women [1, 4]. The global prevalence of T. vaginalis infection is almost 10 times lower in men compared to women [1], which may reflect a lack of testing due to milder infection symptoms or could be related to an abbreviated course of infection. Nonetheless, lack of symptoms does not protect an individual from the complications associated with infection. For example, T. vaginalis infection can increase susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by 50% [5]. Furthermore, a positive correlation between HIV infection and trichomoniasis symptom severity was found in men [6]. In women, infection has also been linked to an increased risk of cervical cancer, low infant birth weight, preterm birth, and stillbirths [7, 8]. In men, a decrease in sperm viability and motility has been observed with the risk to decrease fertility [9]. To avoid potential complications, it is important to treat infection upon diagnosis, particularly since infection can last for months to years [10]. Metronidazole and tinidazole are two antimicrobials currently FDA-approved for the treatment of trichomoniasis [11]. They belong to the class of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs. Metronidazole, first developed in 1959, is the primary drug for trichomoniasis treatment worldwide [12]. Tinidazole, a structural derivative of metronidazole, was FDA-approved for trichomoniasis treatment in 2004 [11]. Both are prodrugs that must be reduced to a free radical inside microbial cells before they can covalently bind to multiple protein and nucleic acid targets. Adduct formation leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and many vital protein functions, eventually killing the organism. Both drugs primarily target anaerobic microorganisms, including T. vaginalis, as these organisms possess enzymatic pathways with low enough redox potential to donate electrons to the drug molecules [12]. For metronidazole, cure rates range from 86–97% [13–15]. Despite its general effectiveness, an estimated 2–10% of all clinical trichomoniasis cases are caused by strains that display resistance to metronidazole and other 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [16–18]. Beyond loss of efficacy due to resistance, metronidazole can have significant adverse effects that compromise its use and effectiveness. Thus, a large percentage of women treated with the drug have reported nausea, vomiting, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, headache, vaginal irritation, and yeast infections [19, 20]. Currently no other drug classes are FDA-approved to treat trichomoniasis. With the threat of growing resistance, and significant adverse effects, development of alternative antimicrobials in other drug classes remains urgent for treatment of trichomoniasis. Library screens of approved FDA drugs and drug candidates have been done to identify new activities against T. vaginalis but have not resulted in promising candidates [21]. De novo drug design against unexploited targets is currently the most realistic strategy for development of new antitrichomonal agents. One such strategy is exemplified by proteasome inhibitors [22]. The proteasome is an enzymatic complex present in all eukaryotic and some prokaryotic cells, whose function is to degrade and recycle proteins that are misfolded or not needed [23]. The enzyme complex consists of a barrel-like structure, consisting of two pairs of rings with seven α-subunits and seven β-subunits. Peptide substrates are fed through the center of the barrel where they are cleaved into smaller fragments. Three of the 14 proteasome subunits are catalytically active: β1 (caspase-like), β2 (trypsin-like), and β5 (chymotrypsin-like). Each cleaves the substrate at its preferred site via hydrolysis [24]. Proteasome inhibitors were first developed as anti-inflammatory agents and as novel agents for cancer treatment [25]. For example, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, was FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. More recently, proteasome inhibitors have also been found to be effective against Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan responsible for malaria [26]. Importantly, several new proteasome inhibitors were shown to be highly selective for the parasite over human cells [27]. T. vaginalis also possess a proteasome that can be targeted for the development of new agents against the parasite, since several proteasome inhibitors were active against the parasite in vitro and have selectivity over human cells [22]. Critical for antimicrobial drug development is the demonstration of in vivo efficacy. Ideally, animal models of infection can be used that employ the very same pathogens that infect humans. In the case of trichomoniasis, several reports have shown that mice can be infected vaginally with T. vaginalis [28–30], but infections tend to be tenuous and unreliable for poorly understood reasons. As an alternative, mouse infection models with surrogate trichomonad pathogens can be used if it can be shown that those infections are robust, and the pathogens respond to antimicrobial candidates in similar ways to the human target pathogen. For example, vaginal infection of mice with the bovine pathogen, Tritrichomonas foetus, have been shown to cause sustained infection [28]. T. foetus is a protozoan parasite that causes tritrichomoniasis in cattle, a similar disease to human trichomoniasis. The parasite is closely related to T. vaginalis, being in the same phylum [31]. Despite its promise, the broader utility of this model for drug development against T. vaginalis remains to be established. Therefore, the aims of this study were to establish infectious characteristics in mice, similarities in in vitro drug responses, structural target similarities of a set of T. foetus strains in relation to T. vaginalis and establish the overall utility and limits of the murine T. foetus model as a basis for current and future drug development against T. vaginalis. T. foetus strains 003 (ATCC 30003), 166 (ATCC 30166), 232 (ATCC 30232), 924 (ATCC 30924), and T. vaginalis strain G3 (ATCC PRA-98) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). T. vaginalis strains R88, MSA1172, S520 and S1489 were kindly provided by Dr. William Secor (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GA). T. foetus strain D1 and T. vaginalis strain F1623 were described in prior studies [32, 33]. Trichomonads were grown in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium, supplemented with 10% horse serum (Omega), 0.74% ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and adjusted to pH 6.2. Cultures were grown axenically at 37°C under anaerobic conditions. The following 5-nitro heterocyclic were purchased commercially (molecular masses in parentheses): Metronidazole (171 Da; Sigma-Aldrich), ronidazole (200 Da; APExBIO), tinidazole (247 Da; TCI America), nitazoxanide (307 Da; AdipoGen), and nithiamide (187 Da; MedChemExpress). The following gold(I) compounds (CPD), whose naming follows our prior usage [34], were also purchased: Auranofin (679 Da; Enzo Life Sciences), (Tri-n-ethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (351 Da, CPD4; Sigma-Aldrich), (Tri-n-methylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (309 Da, CPD10; Sigma-Aldrich) and myochrysine (390 Da; Sigma-Aldrich). The following gold(I) compounds were synthesized and characterized as described previously [34]: (Tri-n-propylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD11), (Triisopropylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (357 Da, CPD12), Bis(triethylphosphine)gold(I) chloride (433 Da, CPD14), and Bis(tri-n-propylphosphine)gold (I) chloride (517 Da, CPD15). The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (384 Da), ixazomib (361 Da) and carfilzomib (720 Da) were obtained from MedChemExpress. The benzimidazole compounds lansoprazole (369 Da), omeprazole (345 Da), albendazole (281 Da) and fenbendazole (299 Da) were also obtained from MedChemExpress. Pantoprazole (383 Da) was purchased from APExBIO and disulfiram (297 Da) from TCI America. BALB/cJ mice (obtained from The Jackson Laboratory) were bred in-house. Female mice were used within one week of weaning at 3–6 weeks of age. Groups of mice were housed in single plastic cages with free access to feed and water. The study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number: S00205). Mice were handled with care, only by research staff fully trained in animal handling, at all times to minimize distress. Mouse health was monitored daily, as well as each time a sample was taken. Vaginal trichomonad infections in mice cause no pain, distress, or suffering, obviating any need for humane endpoints. Experimental endpoints were based solely on the infectious dynamics relative to the study objectives of assessing drug effects on infectious load. All animals were euthanized on the last day of sample collection by controlled CO2 inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation. Infections were performed with different strains of either T. vaginalis or T. foetus as indicated under the specific experiments in the figures. Trichomonads were cultured overnight, centrifuged, and resuspended at a density of 2 x 108 trophozoites/mL. For all in vitro and in vivo experiments, numbers of viable trophozoites were determined under a phase-contrast microscope. Viability was >95% as assessed by observation of the characteristic parasite motility. Five μL of the parasite suspension (containing 106 trophozoites) were slowly administered intravaginally to mice with a 20 μL micropipette. Mice were held briefly upside-down after agent administration to minimize leakage. In select experiments (as indicated in the figure legends), mice were pretreated one day before infection with one of following pretreatment regimens: a) 5 μL intravaginal administration of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate (Sigma-Aldrich); b) 100 μL intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mg/mL ammonium iron (III) citrate; c) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich); or d) 100 μL i.p. injection of 4 mg/mL 17β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 μL i.p. injection of 1 mg/ml dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich). The ammonium iron (III) citrate solution for intravaginal administration was made in PBS containing 1% hypromellose, while all formulation for i.p. injections were prepared in PBS. Control mice received no pretreatment. For drug efficacy tests in vivo, suspensions of bortezomib or gold (I) CPD4 were prepared at 10 mg/mL (= 1% w/v) in 0.2% hypromellose in PBS. Hypromellose solution without drugs was used as a control. Five μL of the drug suspensions (containing 0.05 mg of drug) were administered intravaginally as outlined above for the parasite inoculations. A total of five doses were administered: One dose on day 1 after infection, two doses each on days 2 and 3 after infection with 6–8 h between treatments on those days. Infectious load was determined 3–4 days after infection for all experiments except for a time course study with T. foetus strain 232, where mice were sampled on days 1, 3, 6, and 9. For assessment of infection, mice were lavaged intravaginally by slowly dispensing 30 μL of TYM medium into the vagina, taking it up again, and repeating the process two more times. The washes were diluted to 120 μL in TYM medium, and 10 μL of the diluted washes were placed into a hemocytometer for counting of motile trophozoites under a phase-contrast microscope. Infectious load is expressed as total number of trophozoites per mouse. For washes without countable trophozoites, the remaining volume was cultured in 2 mL of TYM medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for five days at 37°C, and regularly monitored for cell growth. Drug stocks were prepared as 10 mM solutions in DMSO. A 75 μM working stock was prepared in PBS and 1:3 serial dilutions were made in TYM medium in 96-well plates (post-dilution volume 40 μL/well). Parasite cultures were grown overnight in a 15 mL tube, centrifuged and resuspended to a density of 7 x 105–2 x 106 trophozoites/mL. Ten μL of this suspension were added into each well (final culture volume 50 μL/well), resulting in a final number of 7,000–20,000 trophozoites per well and final drug concentrations from 20 μM to 1 nM. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroPack; Mitsubishi Gas Chemical). Viable cell numbers were determined with a luciferase-based ATP assay (Promega) [35]. Luminescence was measured with the SpectraMax M2e plate reader, using the SoftMax Pro program (version 7.0.3). To assay the minimum lethal concentration (MLC), drugs were added to 96-well plates, and serially 2-fold diluted in TYM medium. Parasites were added to each well at a density of 7 x 105/mL (T. foetus D1) or 106 trophozoites/mL (T. vaginalis R88), resulting in a final number of 28,000 or 40,000 trophozoites per well, respectively. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions. Cultures (200 μL) were then transferred to medium-filled 15 mL tubes (representing a 1:75 dilution of the overnight culture to ensure adequate dilution of the drugs in those cultures) and kept at 37°C for a maximum of five days for observation of any cell growth indicative of survivors of the initial drug exposure. For sequence analysis of proteasome subunits, the genome and proteome sequences of the following parasite strains were used: T. foetus CC09-1 (GenBank AIF54491–504), T. vaginalis G3 (BioProject PRJNA938429, PRJNA16084) and P. falciparum NF54 (BioProject PRJNA422809), along with that of humans (BioProject PRJNA807723) and mice (BioProject PRJNA169). A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA software (version 11.0.13). Support values were calculated by bootstrapping with 100 replications. Protein sequences were aligned with the MUSCLE algorithm and an unrooted tree was constructed using the Le Gascuel model, with gamma distribution and invariant sites. Gaps were partially deleted, so that sites with missing data were only removed when necessary. Proteasome subunit designation followed the findings in [36]. For immunoblotting, T. foetus D1 and T. vaginalis F1623 cultures were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.3 μM or 3 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Lysates were made with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), supplemented with Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad), transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was incubated with a primary rabbit anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, Cat No. 10201-2-AP) at a 1:10,000 dilution overnight and a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat No. 7074S) at a 1:20,000 dilution for 30 minutes. Proteins were detected with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). For labeling of catalytically active proteasome subunits with an activity-based probe, total cell lysates of T. foetus D1 or T. vaginalis F1623 were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with 0.1–10 μM of bortezomib, or with DMSO as a control. Afterwards, 2 μM of the fluorescent proteasome probe, MV151 (R&D Systems, Cat No. I-190) [37] was added and lysates were further incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel, and bands were visualized by fluorescent imaging with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 530 nm. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 10.0.0). For compound activity screening, luminescence values were normalized against drug-free controls and plotted against the log drug concentration in each well to create a concentration-response curve for each drug. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), or concentration of drug needed to inhibit trophozoite growth and viability by 50%, and negative log10 of the IC50 (pIC50) were calculated. The assay sensitivity for pIC50 was set at 4.7, equivalent to the highest drug concentration tested in the assays. Each experiment was independently repeated three times per compound and per trichomonad strain. For in vitro data comparisons, parametric tests (ANOVA, t-tests) were used. For comparison of multiple groups, a one-way ANOVA was performed, and if a significant difference was found, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was applied to specific pairs. For in vivo data comparisons, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Previous studies had suggested that murine vaginal infections with T. vaginalis are characterized by low infectivity and/or short-lived infections, even with various manipulations of the host designed to increase susceptibility [28]. It is possible that marginal infectivity is related to the particular strains of T. vaginalis used for the infections, so we tested a range of four diverse strains of T. vaginalis for their ability to cause vaginal infection in young female mice. Three to four days after intravaginal inoculation, vaginal washes showed no detectable trophozoite counts for any of the tested strains (Fig 1A). Cultures of the washes for up to 5 days were uniformly negative, underlining that none of the T. vaginalis strains led to even low-level infection (Fig 1A). Furthermore, systemic (i.p.) or topical (vaginal) administration of iron, which improves T. vaginalis growth in culture [38], or systemic administration of estrogen alone or estrogen plus dexamethasone, which have been suggested to improve susceptibility of mice to T. vaginalis infection [28, 39], did not promote infectivity (Fig 1B). These experiments suggest that T. vaginalis could not infect mice under any of our current conditions, regardless of particular strains or conditioning regimens. Young (3–4 weeks) female BALB/cJ mice were intravaginally inoculated with the indicated strains of T. vaginalis (A, B) or T. foetus (C, D). In the experiments in panel B, mice were pretreated by vaginal instillation (topical) of iron or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of iron, estrogen, or estrogen and dexamethasone (dex) before infection, at dosages detailed in the Methods. Vaginal lavages were taken on day 3 or 4 of infection (A-C) or on the indicated days (D), and motile trophozoites were counted in a hemocytometer. Data points represent counts from individual mice, dashed lines indicate the detection threshold of the assays, and red diamonds show geometric means. For select samples without countable trophozoites, lavages were cultured in trichomonad growth medium with antibiotics (blue symbols). Positive cultures are indicated by solid blue dots, while negative cultures (no growth) are depicted by open blue dots.

Positive cultures are indicated by solid blue dots, while negative cultures (no growth) are depicted by open blue dots. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g001 As an alternative to T. vaginalis, we explored the related trichomonad, T. foetus, which was originally derived from cows and has been used for mouse infections [22, 28, 40]. Four different T. foetus strains were obtained and tested for their vaginal infectivity in young female mice. All four strains were able to cause infection without any pre-treatment with infectivity close to 100% (i.e., the percentage of mice with trophozoites detectable by direct counting or culture over total number of inoculated mice) (Fig 1C). To examine the time course of infection, we selected the T. foetus strain 232, which had the highest infectivity and/or highest trophozoite loads, and sampled mice every 2–3 days. All mice remained infected throughout the 9 days of the experiment, indicating a lack of spontaneous clearance during that period (Fig 1D). These findings demonstrate that T. foetus constitutes a more reliable murine model of vaginal trichomonad infection than T. vaginalis. To explore potential reasons for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis and T. foetus, we examined two parasite characteristics that may plausibly be involved: maximal growth rate and tolerance to different pH environments. The T. vaginalis strains had significantly slower growth rates in culture with longer doubling times compared to the T. foetus strains despite optimal growth conditions and media (Fig 2A). Furthermore, T. vaginalis growth was inhibited by even modestly alkaline pH in vitro, while T. foetus was able to grow mostly unhindered under these conditions (Fig 2B). These data indicate that the intrinsic properties of the two trichomonad species exhibit significant differences in regard to growth and pH tolerance. Trophozoites of the indicated strains were cultured in vitro in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium. (A) Cell numbers were counted before and after a 24-hour time incubation period and doubling times were calculated. Data are mean ± SE; *p<0.05 (unpaired t-test for all T. vaginalis strains vs. all T. foetus strains). (B) Media were adjusted to the indicated pH and trophozoites were grown in each medium for 24 hours and counted. Data are mean ± SE. Trophozoites of the indicated strains were cultured in vitro in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium. (A) Cell numbers were counted before and after a 24-hour time incubation period and doubling times were calculated. Data are mean ± SE; *p<0.05 (unpaired t-test for all T. vaginalis strains vs. all T. foetus strains). (B) Media were adjusted to the indicated pH and trophozoites were grown in each medium for 24 hours and counted. Data are mean ± SE. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g002 To test whether the differential pH sensitivity of the trichomonad strains might be responsible for their differential infectivity in vivo, we measured the vaginal pH in 3–6 week old mice before and after treatment with estrogen alone or with estrogen and dexamethasone [28]. Mean vaginal pH was 6.21 ± 0.04 in the untreated group (mean ± SE, n = 7 mice), 6.49 ± 0.09 for the estrogen-treated group (n = 7), and 6.71 ± 0.05 for the mice treated with estrogen and dexamethasone (n = 9). A Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test showed significance between the estrogen and dexamethasone versus the no treatment group. However, these data show that the vaginal pH was below 7.0 in all groups, thereby excluding differential pH tolerance as a possible explanation for the differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. vaginalis vs T. foetus. To compare susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs between the two trichomonad species, we screened different strains against four major drug classes that are clinically used in trichomoniasis or have been shown to have significant in vitro activity against T. vaginalis: 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs [41], gold(I) compounds [34], proteasome inhibitors [22], and benzimidazoles [21]. The most consistently active compounds were 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds and gold(I) compounds (S1 Table). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors had excellent activity against the T. vaginalis strains but were significantly less potent against the T. foetus strains (S1 Table). The benzimidazoles and another compound with reported in vitro activity against T. vaginalis, disulfiram [21], had only minimal or no activity against either T. foetus or T. vaginalis (S1 Table). Comparison of specific drugs within the three major drug classes with the greatest potencies revealed that all tested drugs were less active in T. foetus, although differences were observed between the drug classes (Fig 3). 5-Nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) drugs displayed, on average, a ~3-fold lower activity (mean ΔpIC50 = 0.47–0.48) in the T. foetus strains compared to the T. vaginalis strains, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig 3). By comparison, the tested proteasome inhibitors were ~14-fold less active (mean ΔpIC50 = 1.15) against T. foetus relative to T. vaginalis, which was statistically significant (Fig 3). Activity (pIC50) of the indicated compounds from each of the indicated three drug classes against multiple strains of T. foetus and T. vaginalis was determined by 24 h growth and survival assay (the detailed data are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents the mean pIC50 of four (T. foetus) or three (T. vaginalis) different strains for the drugs listed below each graph. ΔpIC50 was calculated for each drug class by subtracting the mean T. foetus pIC50s from the mean T. vaginalis pIC50s. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01). Activity (pIC50) of the indicated compounds from each of the indicated three drug classes against multiple strains of T. foetus and T. vaginalis was determined by 24 h growth and survival assay (the detailed data are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents the mean pIC50 of four (T. foetus) or three (T. vaginalis) different strains for the drugs listed below each graph. ΔpIC50 was calculated for each drug class by subtracting the mean T. foetus pIC50s from the mean T. vaginalis pIC50s. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*p <0.01). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g003 Pairwise comparisons of strains were conducted to discover whether any individual T. foetus strain had similar drug susceptibility profiles to any of the T. vaginalis strains. Strong positive correlations were seen among the different T. foetus strains for all three major drug classes (Fig 4A, Table 1). In contrast, only modest average correlations were observed between strains of T. foetus vs. T. vaginalis (Table 1), which particularly affected the proteasome inhibitors and gold(I) compounds (Fig 4B). This might be partially explained by the only modest average correlations of drug susceptibilities among the different T. vaginalis strains (Table 1). In particular, the T. vaginalis strain S1489 displayed a very different drug susceptibility profile than the other T. vaginalis strains (Fig 4C, Table 1), thereby markedly skewing the correlation data for both T. vaginalis and T. foetus (Table 1). The graphs show correlations of the pIC50 values for individual drugs between the indicated pairs of trichomonad strains (the detailed data on drug activities used for these analyses are provided in S1 Table). Each point represents one drug and is color-coded by drug class. Plots are shown with a linear regression line (black) and line of identity (dotted red). The graphs show correlations of the pIC50 values for individual drugs between the indicated pairs of trichomonad strains (the detailed data on drug activities used for these analyses are provided in S1 Table).

Plots are shown with a linear regression line (black) and line of identity (dotted red). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.g004 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.t001 Together, these data indicate that T. foetus is generally less susceptible than T. vaginalis to all tested drugs, but this difference is particularly prominent and significant for the class of proteasome inhibitors. To further characterize antimicrobial drug activity in the two trichomonad species, we determined MLCs by culturing cells for 24 hours in the presence of titrated drug concentrations, diluting the cultures 75-fold (to minimize the impact of residual drugs), and testing for survivors by outgrowth over the ensuing 5 days. The MLCs for metronidazole as a representative 5-nitroheterocyclic compound, and auranofin as a representative gold(I) compound, were very similar for T. foetus or T. vaginalis, reflecting the trends of the respective IC50 findings (Table 2). MLCs were generally 3- to 10-fold higher than IC50, consistent with the notion that complete parasite killing requires higher drug concentrations than growth inhibition by 50%. In contrast, MLC values could not be determined for the two tested proteasome inhibitors, even when tests were done with >100-fold higher drug concentrations than IC50 (Table 2). Even higher drug concentrations could not be tested in the MLC assays due to toxicity of the solvent DMSO. These results confirm that the antimicrobial activities of 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds are not significantly different between the two trichomonad species. The data also show that the tested proteasome inhibitors are unlikely to be trichomonacidal for either T. foetus or T. vaginalis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.t002 To determine the utility of the new T. foetus vaginal infection models for drug efficacy testing, and to evaluate whether selected drugs are efficacious in vivo, we tested two representative compounds with excellent in vitro activity, the gold(I) compound, CPD4, and the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, using two different T. foetus strains. Mice infected with T. foetus 232 were topically treated five times over three days with CPD4 and the infectious load was determined on day 4 (Fig 5A). None of the CPD4-treated mice had countable trophozoites, while ~70% of control mice were infected with an average of ~103 trophozoites per mouse (Fig 5B). Similarly, mice infected with the T. foetus strain D1 and treated with bortezomib showed no countable trophozoites, while all of the control mice had detectable infection (Fig 5C). These results demonstrate that the murine vaginal infection models are not only effective with different T. foetus strains, but are suitable for efficacy testing of new drug candidates against trichomonads. The results also reinforce the fact that CPD4 and bortezomib can clear T. foetus infection in an in vivo model. (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection. (B/C) Mice were infected with the indicated T. foetus strains and treated intravaginally with 0.05 mg/dose (5 μL of a 10 mg/mL suspension) of either the gold(I) compound CPD4 (B) or bortezomib (C), or were left untreated as controls. After 4 days, trophozoite numbers were determined. Each point represents an individual mouse. Dashed black lines represent the detection threshold. Red lines represent geometric means. Significance was calculated by Mann-Whitney test (*p <0.01). (A) Timeline of infection and treatment. Mice were treated five times over the course of 2.5 days, starting pno day after infection.

This discrepancy raised the question whether the T. foetus proteasome is substantially different from that of T. vaginalis. Analysis of the T. foetus genome identified all 14 proteasome subunits, seven α subunits (α1–7) and seven β subunits (β1–7), as expected for all eukaryotes (Fig 6). Sequence comparison of the subunits showed good homology (50–87% amino acid identity) with T. vaginalis, but much less homology (31–57%) with the human and murine counterparts, or even the protozoan parasite P. falciparum (Fig 6). By comparison, the human and murine proteasome subunits are more closely related to each other than the T. foetus subunits are to T. vaginalis. These findings indicate that structural differences exist between the T. foetus and T. vaginalis proteasome subunits, potentially offering an explanation for the differential activity of the tested proteasome inhibitors against the two trichomonad species.

For both trichomonads, bortezomib caused concentration-dependent increases in the abundance of ubiquitin-labeled proteins (Fig 7A). Furthermore, we used an activity-based probe, MV151 [37] for labeling of the catalytic proteasome subunits of the parasites. For T. foetus, labeling of β1 and β5 was strongly inhibited by bortezomib, while β2 labeling was only minimally affected at the highest concentrations (Fig 7B). By comparison, for T. vaginalis, inhibition was most prominent for the β1 subunit followed by β5 and, to a lesser degree, β2 (Fig 7B). Together, these findings show that bortezomib inhibits the proteasome in both T. foetus and T. vaginalis, most likely by targeting the same catalytic subunits. (A) The depicted trichomonad strains were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated final concentrations of bortezomib or left without inhibitor (0 μM). Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by western blotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (left panels). As expected, multiple proteins of different sizes are labeled with ubiquitin, leading to the apparent “smear” on the blots. Total protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (right panels). (B) Total cell lysates of T. foetus and T. vaginalis were incubated for 1 hour with the indicated concentrations of bortezomib and subsequently labeled for 2 hour with the fluorescent activity-based proteasome probe, MV151. Lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and labeled proteins were visualized by fluorescent imaging. The band labeled with an asterisk corresponds to a non-specific target of MV151 that could not be competed for with any available proteasome inhibitor and is thus unlikely to be a proteasome subunit. Raw images of the blots and gels are shown in S1 Raw images.

Robust infections with the relevant pathogens for a sufficiently long duration are key features of a good model. For trichomoniasis, infection of amenable animals, particularly rodents such as mice, with the causative pathogen, T. vaginalis, would be desirable, but we found here that murine vaginal infections with any of four T. vaginalis strains did not lead to detectable infection. In contrast, different strains of another trichomonad, T. foetus, were found to reliably infect mice for at least one week. These findings indicate that vaginal T. foetus infections provide a robust murine model suitable for in vivo drug testing. The striking difference in infectivity between T. vaginalis and T. foetus is unlikely to be related to particular strains of the respective pathogen, since the findings were consistent for four diverse strains of each species. General characteristics of the two trichomonad species are probably more important. For example, we found a difference in doubling time and pH tolerance between the two trichomonad species. Faster growth rates of T. foetus might promote infectivity by counteracting inevitable vaginal losses, while the slower growth of T. vaginalis may not be sufficient to make up for such losses. Consistent with this notion, highly infectious organisms tend to have faster doubling times due to optimization of codon usage bias and increased copies of rRNA and tRNA [42]. Another potential explanation for differential infectivity could be differences in pH tolerance. The murine vagina, unlike the normally acidic environment of the human vagina, has a pH close to neutral or even slightly alkaline [43]. The ability of T. foetus to grow under alkaline pH conditions may promote vaginal infection, while in vitro growth of T. vaginalis was strongly inhibited by alkaline pH and may thus also be compromised in vivo in mice, although our measurements that the murine vaginal pH ranged from 6.5–7 would not suggest that differential pH tolerance can explain differential murine vaginal infectivity of T. foetus vs T. vaginalis. Other possible explanations are conceivable for differential infectivity. For example, the estrus cycle of mice is characterized by periodic influx of leukocytes [44]. T. foetus may be more resistant to killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes compared to T. vaginalis [28]. While the presence of vaginal leukocytes has no apparent impact on infectivity for T. foetus, it has been shown to have a negative impact on T. vaginalis infection [28]. Furthermore, the vaginal microbiota may be differentially affected by trichomonad infection and may impact the interactions of different trichomonads with the host. For example, T. vaginalis infection reduces vaginal epithelia-associated Lactobacillus species in humans [45]. In cats, T. foetus infection significantly impacts the abundance of a variety of different phyla present in the fecal microbiota [46]. Perhaps the extent and manner of microbial changes and their impact on host susceptibility to infection in mice may be more conducive to vaginal T. foetus infection. Other studies had some success with vaginal infection of mice with T. vaginalis, although rates of infection were generally low and variable [28–30]. Beyond specific mechanistic explanations for this variable infectivity, it is conceivable that differential infectivity may be related to the host ranges of the two trichomonads. T. vaginalis is strictly a human parasite [47], while T. foetus can infect cows, cats, and pigs [48]. The apparently narrow host range of T. vaginalis may indicate a requirement for particular host features that are not present in other species, while the broader host range of T. foetus may indicate that infection depends less on particular host characteristics. It is also important to note that none of the prior work, contrary to our present study, had assessed infection by direct trichomonad counts but relied on cultures of vaginal washes. It is possible that cell numbers were too low for counting but sufficient for obtaining positive cultures, which are likely to be one or two logs more sensitive than counts. It is also possible that different conditioning or pretreatment protocols, such as multiple subcutaneous estradiol injections, or co-infection with lactobacilli could have sensitized mice to vaginal T. vaginalis infection beyond what we employed in the current work [28–30]. Finally, although we tested four different stains, differences in T. vaginalis strains could still matter for murine infectivity, so it remains possible that a heretofore untested strain can, in fact, infect mice robustly. For a microorganism to be a useful surrogate model for drug development against a related but different infectious agent, both must have similar responses to the drugs of interest. We observed such congruency in the drug susceptibility of T. foetus and T. vaginalis to 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs and gold(I) compounds. Both drug classes are thought to act on a broad range of targets [49, 50]. In the case of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs, the prodrug forms are first reductively activated, then form covalent adducts on multiple target molecules, including different proteins as well as nucleic acids [51]. The molecular targets responsible for cytocidal activity of 5-nitroheterocyclic drugs have not been defined, but it is likely that inactivation of multiple targets has synergistic effects that irreversibly damage the target cells [49]. The mechanism of action of gold(I) compounds is not well understood but also involve adduct formation and likely inactivation of multiple targets [50]. The multiplicity of cellular targets for both drug classes can provide an explanation for their similar activities against T. foetus and T. vaginalis, since even differences in the sequence or structure of any particular target are unlikely to interfere with the overall effectiveness of these drugs. It must be noted, however, that while not statistically significant, T. foetus had generally lower pIC50s for each compound of the two drug classes in the in vitro screening assays, which was also observed in prior studies with fewer compounds [22, 40]. Another explanation for differential drug susceptibility could be differential membrane permeability between the two parasites [52], which may allow for increased passive diffusion of small molecules, including potentially the tested antimicrobial drugs whose molecular masses are <800 Da, and thus greater susceptibility of T. vaginalis. Notably, we found little or no activity differences in the MLC assays, perhaps suggesting that the IC50 growth assays and MLC survival assays test slightly different drug properties or are differentially impacted by parasite characteristics not directly related to the drug action. For example, the IC50 assays could be affected by the faster growth rate of T. foetus over T. vaginalis. Drugs such as 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds that form covalent adducts may be consumed during the culture period, so a faster growing organism may deplete drugs more rapidly, thereby requiring apparently higher IC50 values to achieve 50% maximal growth inhibition. By comparison, MLC assays measure the ability of a drug to kill all target organisms, which typically requires higher drug levels, so the impact of drug consumption would be less apparent. Nonetheless, both IC50 and MLC provide valuable information for comparative assessment of the drug impact of T. foetus and T. vaginalis, and clearly show that the drug susceptibility of T. foetus closely resembles T. vaginalis in regard to 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds. Consequently, our demonstration of in vivo efficacy for one of the gold(I) compounds is promising for its ultimate in vivo efficacy against T. vaginalis. Contrary to the 5-nitroheterocyclic and gold(I) compounds, we observed marked differences in the activity of proteasome inhibitors against T. foetus and T. vaginalis. Thus, T. foetus had significantly lower pIC50s for all tested drugs in this class compared to T. vaginalis. The target of these compounds is well defined and involves one or several of the three catalytic subunits of the proteasome [53, 54]. Differences in the sequence or fine structure of the relevant proteasome subunits between the two trichomonad species, which clearly exist based on our phylogenetic analysis, can probably impact the binding of specific inhibitors. In this context, it is important to note that the tested inhibitors were originally developed against the human proteasome [55] but not specifically selected for activity against either T. vaginalis or T. foetus. Screening of large proteasome inhibitor libraries may well identify compounds that are equally active against both trichomonads. It is therefore possible, that inhibitors could be found that are more active against T. foetus than T. vaginalis and even human cells, which could represent a promising starting point for new veterinary drugs against bovine tritrichomoniasis [56]. Nevertheless, based on the phylogenetic and functional analyses, we were able to conclude that no fundamental differences exist in the 20S proteasomes of T. foetus and T. vaginalis. We could also demonstrate that one proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has low micromolar or better activity against both T. foetus and T. vaginalis and can eliminate T. foetus infection in vivo, underlining that drug candidates with adequate activity against T. foetus can be active in vivo even if their relative potency in T. foetus does not closely mimic the findings in T. vaginalis. While this study focused on female mice, it is also important to acknowledge that males are carriers of T. vaginalis and at times may suffer symptoms. Male animal models of T. vaginalis infection via urethral injection and anesthesia have been established in mice [47] and rats [57]. In future studies, it would be of interest to evaluate drug efficacy in these models for potential treatment of male trichomoniasis. In summary, the T. foetus murine infection models described here have excellent utility as surrogate in vivo models for drug development campaigns for new drugs against T. vaginalis, particularly if multiple molecular drug targets are predicted. Caution should be exercised, however, for compounds with singular targets if those targets differ significantly between the two trichomonad species. In such situations, it would be advisable to conduct careful in vitro compound testing beforehand to confirm that drug activity is not significantly different between the two organisms or at last remains sufficiently high in T. foetus that in vivo efficacy testing is not likely to yield false negative results. T. foetus and T. vaginalis cultures were incubated for 24 hours with a range of drug concentrations, ATP content was assayed as a measure of cell growth and viability, and pIC50 values were calculated from the resulting concentration-response curves. Data are shown as mean ± SE of three or more independent experiments. IC50 values were derived from the mean pIC50. The highest tested drug concentration was 20 μM, so lack of growth inhibition at that concentration is listed as IC50 >20 μM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308672.s002 (PDF) BMH was supported in part by the UCSD Graduate Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology.

The Indian stock market witnessed a sharp sell-off on Monday, with the BSE Sensex plummeting 1,272.07 points or 1.49 per cent to close at 84,299.78, while the Nifty 50 tumbled 368.10 points or 1.41 per cent to 25,810.85. The decline marked the worst day for both indices in nearly two months, driven by escalating geopolitical tensions in West Asia the Middle East and profit-booking after recent highs. The market opened on a weak note, with the Sensex starting at 85,208.76, down from its previous close of 85,571.85. Similarly, the Nifty opened lower at 26,061.30, compared to its last close of 26,178.95. The negative trend persisted throughout the trading session, with both indices closing near their day’s lows. The rupee depreciated 11 paise to settle at 83.80 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, taking cues from equity markets that saw a steep fall of over 1 per cent amid volatile crude oil prices and outflow of foreign funds. However, a weak greenback against major currencies supported the local unit, forex traders said, while investors showed muted participation awaiting cues from domestic macroeconomic data to be released this week. At the same time, they said, monetary and fiscal stimulus announced by China triggered withdrawal of foreign funds as investors preferred better-performing Chinese markets.

The strong listing reflects the company’s robust growth, positive financial metrics, and the overwhelming investor response that saw the IPO subscribed 224.05 times. While the listing gain is commendable, investors should remain cautious as the IPO was fully priced, and the company operates in a competitive market with inherent risks. However, Manba Finance’s focus on niche segments positions it for potential growth. Existing investors may hold their shares with a stop loss at around 130, while closely monitoring the company’s performance and market conditions.

Market Performance So Far: The USD/JPY pair has been under scrutiny since Shigeru Ishiba’s election as Japan’s new prime minister, with a drop of over 400 pips reflecting the market’s anticipation of potential policy shifts. Currently, the pair appears to be in a period of consolidation after the sharp decline, with traders focusing on the 144.30 level for signs of bearish price action. The market is still digesting Ishiba’s election and its broader implications, and traders may hesitate to make moves until more concrete policy direction is provided by the new government. Meanwhile, the broader USDX is showing mixed signals, having made a new weekly low on Friday, with traders eyeing this as a potential buying opportunity. The 99.00 level is seen as a critical support zone, and if the dollar index dips to this point, it could trigger a bullish reversal, especially if market sentiment turns in favor of the USD amid perceived risks stemming from Japan’s new foreign policy initiatives. In terms of the EUR/USD, there is a strong chance the pair could drop further from its current area, with a possibility of making one final push higher before retreating. Traders looking at bullish price action around the 1.1100 or 1.1040 zones may find opportunities, but the overall sentiment appears to lean towards a decline in the near term. GBP/USD is showing a similar pattern, with the potential for the pair to either come down from its current area or make one more push higher before reversing. If it does rise, the 1.3500 level becomes a key resistance point, and bearish price action around this zone will likely set the tone for the following week. However, if the pair declines sooner, the 1.3300 level could provide a solid area for a bullish reaction, offering some short-term opportunities for traders seeking to capitalize on volatility. Lastly, gold has continued its downward movement after testing resistance at 2670, with a potential consolidation expected, and bullish price action around the 2590 area could set the stage for a rebound. What’s Happening This Week: As we head into the first week of October, several key economic data points are expected to drive market movements. On Monday, Germany’s Preliminary CPI data is forecasted to come in at 0.1%, following a previous reading of -0.1%, which could influence the EUR/USD pair. On Tuesday, the focus shifts to high-impact U.S. reports, including the ISM Manufacturing PMI, expected at 47.6, and the JOLTS Jobs Opening report, with 7.64 million jobs forecasted. A weaker-than-expected JOLTS report could fuel speculation that the U.S. job market is softening, adding pressure to the dollar. On Wednesday, the ADP Non-Farm Employment Change takes center stage, with a forecast of 124K jobs added, and traders will be watching closely to see whether the actual data meets expectations. A stronger-than-expected ADP figure could reinforce the view that the U.S. labor market remains resilient, while a weaker figure could lead to dollar weakness. On Thursday, the ISM Services PMI is forecasted at 51.6, and any data supporting a strong U.S. services sector will likely reinforce dollar strength. The end of the week brings the most closely watched reports: Friday’s Non-Farm Employment Change and the Unemployment Rate. The Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data is forecasted at 144K, and the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A stronger-than-expected NFP report, combined with a stable unemployment rate, could drive the dollar higher, while a weaker NFP could lead to dollar softness. Markets will likely respond with heightened volatility around Friday’s release, making it an important day for traders in dollar-denominated assets. Welspun Corp announced the receipt of order from the Middle East for supply of Coated LSAW Pipes and Bends for sour service. Shares rise 1.77% on the NSE to ₹753.60. Here is the Live event updates Market is likely to move into a consolidation phase in the near-term. One significant factor that is influencing foreign portfolios is the outperformance of the Chinese stocks which is reflected in the massive surge in the Hang Seng index by around 18 % in September. This surge has been triggered by hopes of revival in the Chinese economy in response to the monetary and fiscal stimulus announced by the Chinese authorities. The cheap valuations of Chinese stocks are keeping the momentum intact. This can prove to be a tactical trade which can sustain for some more time. This means FIIs may continue to sell in India and move some more money to better performing markets. FII selling is unlikely to impact the Indian market significantly since the massive domestic money can easily absorb whatever the FIIs are selling. Investors can use dips to buy quality largecaps which are fairly valued. Crude oil prices recovered from their lows on Friday but prices fell last week amid demand concerns and higher supply from global oil markets. As per market sources, OPEC+ will increase production by 1,80,000 barrels per day each month starting from December. The Libyan dispute has also settled and its exports could resume soon. Also, the Chinese central bank announced a cut in RRR by 50 basis points and undertook stimulus measures to revive the Chinese economy thus supporting crude oil prices at lower levels. Escalating tensions in the Middle-East are also supporting crude oil prices. We expect crude oil prices to remain volatile in today’s session. Crude oil is having support at $67.55-66.90 and resistance at $69.10-69.80. In INR, crude oil has support at Rs5,630-5,570 while resistance is at Rs 5,775-5,840. Gold and silver prices rose for the third straight week in the global market after the U.S. Fed undertook big interest rate cuts in September. The dollar also weakened, which helped push prices higher. However, both metals dropped slightly from their record highs as some investors sold to book profits. Gold is nearing $2,700 per troy ounce, and silver recently hit its highest level in 11 years. Gold and silver are gaining strength because of interest rate cuts by central banks around the world, stimulus efforts from China, and rising global tensions. Gold has support at $2651-2640 while resistance is at $2684-2699. Silver has support at $31.42-31.24 while resistance is at 31.87-32.05. In INR terms, gold has support at Rs 74,750-74,570, while resistance is at Rs 75,190-75,380. Silver has support at Rs90,850-90,150, while resistance at Rs91,990-92,680.

The latest relaxation is part of slew of changes now implemented by SEBI to its existing SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations 2014.

The overall picture is still positive. #Nifty can continue to rise from here in the coming weeks. Supports are there to limit the downside. Any dip from here will be limited as fresh buyers are likely to come into the market at lower levels. Global trends, trading activity of foreign investors and domestic macroeconomic data announcements would dictate terms in the equity market in a holiday-shortened week ahead, analysts said. Equity markets would remain closed on Wednesday for Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti. “Looking ahead, it will be interesting to monitor Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and their flow into India. September saw the highest FII inflows into Indian equities this year. Movements in commodity prices, the US dollar index, and key macroeconomic data from the US will also be pivotal in shaping the market’s direction.

Title: The Secret Frameworks (Mental Models) Behind the Success of 10 Famous Entrepreneurs
URL: https://www.jeffbullas.com/mental-models/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:14:36Z

jeffbullas.com Win At Business And Life In An AI World Topics: If we put all the data we have collected in the past year from our expanding digital universe into books, we would have created 80 quadrillion books. If we stacked them (assuming a thickness of 2.5 cm), it would reach the sun 13,333 times.Or 211 light years into space. But the irony is that with all that information, we are still struggling to find wisdom. Isaac Asimov said this about the mountains of data collected by technology:“The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.” The conundrum. More information and data does not lead to better decisions. So we need to pose questions that matter: One answer is applying “mental models.” A mental model is a simplified, conceptual framework that helps us understand and interpret the world, make decisions, and solve problems. It represents how certain things work, allowing us to predict outcomes based on past experiences, knowledge, or logic. One example of a mental model is applying the compounding effect. This can be used to accumulate wealth and knowledge over a lifetime. Example 1: Compounding effect of a long term approach to investing to build “wealth“—by investing in high-quality businesses or the stock market index that consistently grow earnings, reinvesting profits over decades to create exponential wealth. This was the mental model used by Warren Buffet to make his company the 8th most valuable business in the world at $982 billion. Example 2: Compounding effect of life term learning and “knowledge.” Learning something new every day adds to your knowledge and over a lifetime it can produce enormous benefits to life and business. This is one of Bill Gates key mental models and in an information world, knowledge is wealth. Microsoft is now valued at over $3 Trillion. Mental models help us cut through complexity and distill that into simplicity. They help us make sense of all the noise that overwhelms us and allow us to focus on the key principles that govern situations. And the proof of the “mental model” approach can be found in many successful people that have used that approach—these include Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. If you want to see what their mental models are you can jump to the bottom of this post. Mental models can be applied to every aspect of life. The biggest decisions in life often shape our personal happiness, relationships, and long-term fulfillment. These include choosing a life partner, who you hang out with and where you have your home and how you invest your money. On the “who you hang out with,” I have a simple piece of advice:“If you want to fly like an eagle don’t hang out with turkeys.” I have told my children this many times. I hope they are listening. Here are some key decisions that we all face in life and some mental models that can help guide your thinking around them: Mental models: Mental models: Charlie Munger lived to the age of 99 and died in 2023. He, with Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion and is the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. He published a book titled “Poor Charlie’s Almanac” that was a distillation of all the information he had gathered over his lifetime that was instrumental in building a trillion dollar business. In it he revealed one of his secrets about how he did that. He distilled that information into wisdom using over 90 mental models, some he revealed in that book and others are still to be unearthed. In looking at his life, his mental models and his success it would suggest a strong correlation between age and experience producing wisdom. But he is not alone and there are many famous people that have developed wisdom and mental models from their life experiences to find success. Many top entrepreneurs and famous individuals utilize mental models as key tools for decision-making, problem-solving, and life optimization. Here are a few prominent figures who are known for applying mental models and the specific frameworks they employ in business and life: Sheryl Sandberg is an influential business executive, philanthropist, and as of 2023, her net worth is estimated to be around $1.6 billion, primarily derived from her stock holdings and compensation from her time at Meta, as well as her investments in other ventures. She is best known for her role as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Facebook (now Meta), where she helped grow the platform into one of the largest social media companies in the world. Sandberg is also the author of the bestselling book Lean In, which advocates for women’s empowerment and leadership in the workplace, and founded the Lean In Foundation to support gender equality initiatives. Here are 3 of her mental models and frameworks. The most powerful mental model here for me is the framework of “taking charge” and owning your future rather than one of victimhood. That is expanded on in her best selling book “Lean In.” Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion that is now the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. Invest as early as possible and let compounding make you rich over time. $10,000 invested in the USA sharemarket when you were 30 becomes $237,000 when you’re 60. Going deeper In a recent AFR publication there was a chart that revealed the power of compounding returns using an example of investing in stock markets. It compared the different stock markets total return if you invested $10,000 30 years ago. It displays the power of compounding and how a small change in return can produce a much bigger result from the power of compounding. This powerful visual comparison shows that $30,000 invested in the Australian Stock market 30 years ago vs the same $30,000 invested in the USA stock over the same period. Result Total value of $10,000 over 30 years with all dividends reinvested and no withdrawals. To put that in perspective a relatively small investment of $10,000 in the USA markets when you were 30 became $237,318 at the age of 60 but only worth $135,165 in Australia. That is a $100,000+ difference The other revelation was what a difference it made when there was only a 2% difference. Australia had a 9.1% return and the USA was 11.1%. Ray Dalio is a financial success as the founder of Bridgewater which is one of the worlds largest hedge funds. And his biggest mental model is “radical transparency” within his organization. It is a model that works for him and his business. It may not work for you. But it may. A good mental model will be what makes sense to you and your experience in life. It will be the intersection of your skills, life journey and curiosity. You need to own it. Make it yours. Sometimes I find road testing different ideas is a good first step. Here are some of Ray’s mental models to reflect on. Feedback loops make a lot of sense to me.They can be seen as using information and data to find what works and what doesn’t as quickly as possible. It can be very data driven and objective or more nuanced and subjective. Jeff saw a vision of an online bookstore in 1995. 30 years later he has grown Amazon into a trillion dollar company and with a personal wealth of $211 billion dollars is the second wealthiest person in the world. He plays the long game and one of his prioritized models is long-term thinking. The regret minimization model is something worth looking deeper at. This starts to become more obvious and apparent when you’re older. And many of us live with regret.It is a great question to keep asking yourself. Maybe try putting yourself a bit further into the future and take the time to reflect on your current situation and ask better questions. Charlie Munger was Warren Buffets sidekick at Berkshire Hathaway. The reality was that he was much more than that and it was a synergistic partnership that lasted 58 years. But they both had their own mental models and agreed on others. Charlie died in 2023 and had used 90 plus mental models to help him make wise decisions. The inversion mental model is counterintuitive as it makes you look at the consequences of the opposite of what you want to achieve. Instead of focusing on what would make a project successful, you think about what could cause it to fail, and then work to avoid those pitfalls. Example: Suppose you want to improve customer satisfaction in your business. Instead of asking, “What can we do to make our customers happier?”, you ask, “What are we doing that could be making our customers unhappy?” then take specific actions to eliminate these issues, thereby indirectly improving overall customer satisfaction. I don’t need to introduce Steve Jobs except to say that his birthday on February 24 was on the same date of the year as mine. So we are both Pisces. Let’s leave the comparison there. Finding or creating “Simplicity” in the middle of all the noise and complexity takes time and effort. So…simplicity takes hard work. Winston Churchill said it well. “I would have written you a shorter letter but I didn’t have the time.” To go back to comparisons between Steve and me. I love finding the simplicity in complexity. Let me say: Less is more. The founder of Facebook (now known as Meta) has maybe created the most information in the world by getting people to sign up to his social media platform and making it easy for the world to share their information without creating any of his own. That is “scaling economics” at its smartest. Key takeaway As competitors entered the market Mark quickly realized that he didn’t have to innovate all the time but buy or copy. Instagram and WhatsApp threatened to steal traffic, users and attention from Facebook so he bought them. And to show the middle finger to Elon Musk at Twitter (Now known as X) he copied Twitter and started “Threads”. In just a few months Threads had acquired 100 million users. Innovator’s dilemma solved. Elon is currently the world’s richest person. And Tesla and SpaceX are his biggest contributors to that wealth. And he didn’t get there without some clever thinking and using some powerful mental models that helped him. Long-term vision is one of his superpowers and one of his mental models. Going to colonize Mars is as long term as it gets! It’s not in my vision as I quite like the beach and I have heard that there are no beaches and sand there. But what is interesting is that this mental model is also one of the key mental models of Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos. No more needs to be said. Bill along with Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet spends a lot of time reading. I am not talking about superficial reading (also known as doom scrolling) on Instagram, Facebook or TikTok. As the founder of Microsoft that he started in the 1980’s (that is now worth $3.22 trillion) he has certainly earned the right to give himself the permission to read, and gain knowledge. “Compounding” is not just something reserved for financial wealth. It also applies to knowledge wealth. Taking a long term approach to gaining knowledge and hopefully wisdom is one of Bill Gates approaches and frameworks for life. Take the time to keep feeding your mind with deep knowledge and the compound effect of that will surprise you. Richard Branson had trouble reading as he was dyslexic. But that didn’t stop him succeeding as he had the ability to choose the right people to hire and partner with. I surround myself with people that do the things I hate and I am bad at. That includes cleaners, accountants and tax advisers. So realizing that you are not good at something and choosing people to help you is leaning into the mental model of “People over process” Many of these models can be adapted to our big decisions in our personal life. They can also be applied to business and investing. The challenge is that there are many mental models and that alone will produce complexity and anxiety. Your next task is to create a mental model list and distill them into which ones are relevant for you and make a shorter list. And then start applying them and testing them. Ideas without action are just noise. Share this post: © Jeff Bullas. Privacy Policy

Time Published: 2024-09-27T10:33:12Z

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 27 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO ofRelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis.
