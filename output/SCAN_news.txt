ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Broadcom Inc is a semiconductor giant, making the chips and infrastructure that power the most advanced computing systems in the world. Broadcom’s technology is everywhere, whether it’s the hyperscalers such as Amazon and Alphabet training large AI models or enterprises integrating AI-driven applications. But the more interesting thing is that the company just delivered another blowout quarter, with revenue exploding and AI-related sales skyrocketing. It's also very profitable, with a very high expected adjusted EBITDA margin, which is rare in semiconductors. Despite a premium valuation, Broadcom's future still looks bright with strong cash flow and noteworthy partnerships. Also, as the stock has dropped 16% YTD, this dip might be a buying opportunity before the next leg up and the stock could continue to surprise investors. The question is, how high can Broadcom go? Let's dive in to find out. Broadcom crushed estimates in its first quarter of fiscal 2025. The AI hardware leader beat on earnings-per-share (EPS) of $1.60 by 9 cents and significantly surpassed revenue expectations of $14.92 billion, $330 million ahead of estimates. The 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth of the company is a result of continued heavy investment by data centers and hyperscalers upgrading their AI infrastructure. Infrastructure software revenue clocked in at 47% and Broadcom's semiconductor solutions revenue grew 11% year over year on broad-based demand across its portfolio. Now, let’s talk a bit about AI spending, which is only accelerating, placing Broadcom to ride a long-term tailwind. Tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Apple are shelling out in order to stay at the forefront of the AI race, and Broadcom is benefiting from their activities. The company's Q1 AI-related revenue increased 77% compared to the previous year to $4.1 billion, which is clear evidence of the growing demand for its AI-optimized chips and connectivity solutions. And this is only the beginning. The data center and AI-related hardware and software market are seen as expanding at a ridiculous 40-55% annually toward $1.4 trillion by 2027. As more and more industries increasingly adopt AI usage in their business processes, the demand for AI infrastructure will quickly increase and Broadcom is well set to take a large portion of it. Strong free cash flow momentum: Beyond top-line growth, Broadcom's free cash flow (FCF) increased even faster than revenue, which is evidence of strong cash generation and operational efficiency by Broadcom. The company generated a FCF of $6.0 billion, up 28% YOY. This figure outpaced revenue growth by three percentage points. It also meant a 40% FCF margin, up 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter and validating Broadcom's ability to reinvest in growth, pay down debt and return capital to shareholders. Since Broadcom is executing flawlessly and AI demand is growing rapidly, the company should continue to deliver brilliant results in the quarters ahead. Q2 FY25 looks just as strong as well. Revenue is expected to come in around $14.9 billion, which is a strong 19% YOY increase, a symbol that the demand for its products is not slowing down anytime soon. And with no surprise, the biggest driver is AI. Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue alone is expected to be around $4.4 billion in the quarter due to hyperscalers spending on AI XPUs and connectivity solutions. This is a huge tailwind, and it resonates with the importance of Broadcom's tech in driving the AI revolution. Finally, their profitability with an expected 66% adjusted EBITDA margin is more impressive. That's rare in semis, but such a mix of high-value AI chips and infrastructure software of Broadcom maintains fat margins. Broadcom is pushing the semiconductor innovation boundaries as hyperscalers step it up on AI investments. Its tech has become extremely essential, and the company's Q2 expectations in AI semiconductor revenue are a testament to that. The company is pouring resources into R&D to keep ahead, putting focus on cutting-edge AI XPUs and networking. It is developing a 10,000 teraflops XPU with 2nm 3.5D packaging and scaling AI clusters to 1 million XPUs on Ethernet. On the networking side, it has doubled RAID capacity and is prepping 1.6T bandwidth switches for sampling. These advancements in AI will be game-changers in the AI accelerator industry. Strategically, Broadcom is winning big. Just recently, two more hyperscalers tapped Broadcom for AI XPUs in order to draw on its stature as a key enabler of AI infrastructure. Now the company is making Alphabet’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Microsoft's Maia, Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Meta Platforms' MTIA, and ByteDance's AI ASIC chips, essentially providing the custom silicon for the biggest names in AI. Broadcom's balanced model of high-margin software and AI-driven hardware is shown by this deep integration across most of the major cloud and AI players and the VMware-driven enterprise software growth. If Broadcom continues at this speed, the company might cement itself as one of the most powerful forces in AI infrastructure. Broadcom has done an excellent job of maintaining an earnings consistency track record, having either met or beaten EPS estimates in every quarter over the past few years. Such outperformance speaks to the company's business model's enduring power as well as the ability to drive continued growth. Broadcom Inc Price Chart Investors have taken notice as Broadcom's stock price has surged 53% over the past year and a whopping 931% over the past half-decade. This performance is not simply luck but instead reflects the company's strategic positioning in AI-driven semiconductors and enterprise software. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Chart Looking ahead, Broadcom is set to post robust earnings and revenue growth. The EPS for FY2025 and FY2026 are projected to increase substantially YOY, at $6.62 and $7.86 respectively. Nonetheless, seeing how Broadcom has a track record of exceeding estimates, it can do the same in the future as well. If Broadcom delivers results in line or above the past quarters by the same margin of say 3-5%, then its EPS for FY2025 can touch $6.80-$6.95 and for FY2026 can cross $8.00. This means that the potential of this outperformance will make its valuation even more attractive. Premium price? Not really: Broadcom's forward P/E at 28.7 may seem elevated at first glance compared to traditional value stocks. However, as stated above, premium valuations are justified if a company generates superior growth. Broadcom's earnings trajectory supports its multiple in its case. A deeper look at Broadcom's Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) ratio provides further evidence that it is relatively cheap. The stock is trading at a PEG ratio of 1.31, based on a forward P/E of 28.7 times and a matching EPS growth rate. Broadcom's PEG indicates that the company is attractively priced in view of its strong earnings trajectory and is notably 18.75% lower than the sector median of 1.67. The bottom line is that despite the premium valuation of Broadcom, the stock is still relatively cheap when one takes into consideration its growth rate. With a solid track record of consistent estimate beats and strong EPS and revenue growth, Broadcom has a lot of room to run. In FY2025, EPS is forecasted to be $6.62, rising to $7.86 in FY2026 and higher. This implies a short-term price target of about $205 to $210 (based on FY2025 estimates) given this company's forward P/E of approximately 28.7 times. In the long-term, EPS is expected to rise to $9.12 in FY2027 and $12.74 in FY2028. If it happens, a conservative P/E multiple of about 21 times implies the stock should trade near $280-$290 in 3-4 years. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Trends Bullish case scenario: If Broadcom exceeds estimates, due to AI demand, networking expansion, and software growth, EPS would grow faster than expected. If EPS reaches $7.00 in FY2025 and $8.25 in FY2026, and the market rewards Broadcom with a higher multiple of 32 times P/E, the stock could trade above $235 in the short-term. And if EPS hits $10.50 by FY2027 and $14.00 by FY2028, a 23-25 times P/E multiple would take the stock to $350-$375 within the next few years in the long-term bullish case. Broadcom Price Target Scenarios Broadcom insiders have been selling a notable amount of stock over the past year, which naturally piques some eyebrows. CEO Hock Tan sold $26 million worth of shares at $173 each, one of the biggest sales. It seems concerning, but as it was only 10% of his holdings, it's not necessarily a red flag. In addition, insider selling dropped in the past three months and no insider sales occurred in the past month, perhaps implying that the company's executives hang on to their shares after Broadcom's latest earnings release. Furthermore, Broadcom's 1.3% insider ownership worth $14 billion is still a good thing. It is not a huge stake, but it is a statement that executives and important decision-makers have an interest in the company's long-term success. Institutional investors are stepping in: Although there have not been any insider buys recently, institutional investors are increasingly confident in Broadcom's long-term potential, even as insiders are cashing out. Institutional buying tends to outweigh insider selling, as these funds are taking a long-term, research-backed approach. Broadcom Inc Number of Guru Trades While some gurus are taking profits or rebalancing, trades demonstrate a steady accumulation trend, which implies that large funds see Broadcom as a stock they want to hold or add to at current levels. One of the standout among them is Ken Fisher, the founder of Fisher Investments who currently has 23.9 million shares. Fisher uses tech stocks heavily in bull markets, as they are supposed to lead the rally. According to him, Broadcom is a key pillar of market strength, and his large stake in his firm reflects his confidence that the stock will continue to be this way. Balancing debt repayment with growth potential: Broadcom's insider selling could be deemed a strategic move of offloading shares at premium valuations to repay debt. Broadcom took on a big bet on debt with its $69 billion VMware acquisition and has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.14 which is very low, so it makes sense to lower leverage. That said, the company has enough free cash flow to reinvest in innovation while improving its balance sheet. If Broadcom continues to grow at such a pace, the dilution from insider sales may be minimal and the company may be able to grow past any concerns, making these insider sales a natural part of its financial strategy, not a reason to worry. Broadcom's growth trajectory is still very compelling, but a few risks may counter its bullish outlook. The biggest risk is Broadcom relying on Apple. Beginning with the iPhone 17 in 2H25, Apple's transition to in-house Wi-Fi chips could have a big impact on Broadcom's sales. This revenue stream may decline, provided Apple fully phases out Broadcom's chips over the next three years. Another concern is valuation risk. If growth fails or doesn't merit these superior multiples, Broadcom might face downward pressure. Lastly, profitability concerns remain. While sales are growing, gross margin expansion must be sustained. Investors would shift out of Broadcom if it grows revenue but cannot keep the margin momentum. Broadcom is in a perfect situation to take advantage of the AI boom and enjoy solid top and bottom-line growth. The long-term risk from Apple's move toward in-house chips is a big one, but the stock's AI momentum is more than enough to make up for lost revenue. Valuation too continues to be a point of debate, but the history of beating estimates and AI demand surging make its premium multiple justified. Insider selling might also make investors worry, which is justified and should be kept an eye on, but investors should not finalize their bet on a stock based on it. There are many other watch factors, for instance, maintaining profitability. Broadcom can stay ahead as long as it continues to expand margins with revenue growth. For now, the stock looks well positioned for long-term upside.

Title: How India's market slump impacts small investors

Trump's tariff threats have rattled global markets. But in India, the market slump isn't just about the new US president. Millions of small investors are feeling the squeeze, for other reasons than a trade war. It was FOMO, or Fear of Missing Out, that got Kanishk* to start investing in the stock market. He told DW that as India battled the second wave of COVID-19 in 2021, he started noticing ads on Instagram featuring social media influencers giving money-making tips. "I didn't want to miss out on this — the way people were making money. That, I would say, is the first thing that got me into the market," Kanishk said. He explained how, after initially investing in mutual funds, he gradually moved to trading on the stock market. Like a lot of amateur investors, he had no clue about the fundamentals of investing, he said, but he kept up with the market trends, "especially on Reddit," the US-based social media platform. And in the beginning, "everything was great."

Both Puj, a media professional from Kolkata, the capital of the state of West Bengal, and Shah, who runs a cultural center that teaches art and music in the western city of Ahmedabad, also started trading in the stock market sometime during the pandemic lockdown. "The market was doing so well it felt anyone who was making any money was making it in the markets," Shah said, who added that he bought random stocks, sometimes based on the recommendations of others. "Weirdly, whatever I did, I kept making money." Puj took a more guarded approach. "I knew that the market [was] in a euphoria stage, I was very aware of the bubble that was happening," she said. Then came September 2024 and all three were hit hard when the bubble burst. After months of rallying, the market eventually corrected, followed by a monthslong slump. For most Indians who started trading on the stock markets, the rally after the pandemic slump was a great time. It reflected the $275 billion (€250 billion) economic stimulus package Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government had injected in 2020. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video In lockdown, a lot of people had more time and disposable income, and many were influenced by the idea of making some quick and easy money. "During COVID, people had surplus cash, and a large number of young investors entered the capital markets as retail investors," said Sagun Agrawal, a derivatives trader in the Indian capital markets and a financial literacy advocate for women. "This was positive for the markets as it boosted liquidity and created investable funds for capital formation." Online trading has become more popular thanks to new companies offering low brokerage fees and easy access to credit. One such option is Margin Trading Facility (MTF), which lets traders buy shares by paying only part of the cost upfront. The brokerage covers the rest as a loan, with interest. National Stock Exchange (NSE) data showed that between March 2020 and March 2024, the number of registered investors in India almost tripled to 92 million. India's NIFTY 50 stock market index went from about 8,000 points in March 2020 to record levels of more than 26,000 points in September 2024. For the retail investors caught up in the euphoria, it felt like nothing could go wrong — until it did. In the months since September last year, Indian equities have lost more than $1.2 trillion in value. In February, the NIFTY 50 benchmark index was down 16% from its peak, and on its longest losing streak since 1996. It was the worst performing global market. Small retail investors were among the worst hit. "Many of these [retail] investors were uninformed and chased hyped-up securities, leading to froth in the market. As corrections took place over the last six months, these investors faced major financial setbacks," said Agrawal. Bijoy Peter, a senior partner at Bangalore-based Germinate Investor Services, said one of the reasons for the market correction was the disparity between the soaring valuations of corporate India and their declining earnings. India's GDP growth had also slowed to 5.4% in the July-September 2024 quarter, he said. He also pointed to a lack of government spending in infrastructure and other sectors at the time, as well as other global factors. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) started pulling their money out of India. China started implementing significant stimulus measures in its market, which contributed to money moving there, he said. This movement of money out of India had a huge impact. "When such a large sum moves out, the effect is massive because investors have to sell their holdings. Selling at that magnitude has a huge impact on stock prices," Peter said. "As a result, the market began to fall." Peter added that a lot of positive developments initiated by the government had been overlooked by the market — including an increase in tax limits, measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India to inject liquidity into the banking system, as well as the announcement of increased infrastructure spending. Agrawal also noted that last September, the real sellers were Indian High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs) and high-value investors. They sensed that the market was overvalued and had limited scope for further upside, she said. "The major investors pulled their money out of the market, causing the decline, while smaller investors were left to bear the losses," one trader, who asked not to be named, told DW. While Indian markets have been navigating stormy waters over the last five months, some said the situation was starting to look up with the stock market experiencing significant gains last week. However, investors remained cautious amid US President Donald Trump's threats to impose reciprocal tariffs on India from April 2, calling India "a very big abuser" of tariffs. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video New Delhi has said that it is in negotiations with the US to establish a trade framework addressing levies and market access. Economist Dr. Surjit Bhalla, former executive director for India at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a member of the Economic Advisory Council to the second Modi government, said he was feeling bullish as Trump "has presented India with a unique opportunity for reform." "We've never had a chance like this before, particularly in areas like trade, foreign direct investment, and other key factors that drive GDP growth and profits." "For us, this is a crucial moment to implement much-needed reforms, both in the external sector and domestically, including areas like agriculture," Bhalla said. "This could be India's opportunity to advance to the next stage of reforms." Meanwhile, retail investors such as Kanishk, Shah and Puj, having survived hard times in the past few months, are bracing for the possible impact of Trump's threatened tariffs, while keeping their fingers crossed. Kanishk said he was more cautious now after the slump and was "taking the words of the finance influencer with a pinch of salt." Shah stopped trading about a year ago, sometimes reflecting on whether it was too early. "But seeing how stressed everyone is, I feel I might have dodged a bullet," he said. Puj has reworked her investment strategy altogether, she is staying put and buying only in small quantities when markets are down. Having seen all her investments in the red not too long ago, she said she is wiser now, adding, "Going down is not so fun." *names changed on request Edited by: Keith Walker

Title: Trump hints at 'flexibility' for China even as he plows ahead with global tariff plans

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Markets whipsawed further Friday in response to President Donald Trump’s latest comments on tariffs, with stocks briefly turning higher after he hinted that there may be “flexibility” in his plan to impose blanket tariffs on most U.S. trading partners next month before retreating back into the red. In remarks in the Oval Office, Trump said he was not interested in making exceptions to the broad “fair and reciprocal” duties he’d foreshadowed in February that he now says will be imposed April 2. But he nevertheless offered some daylight. “I don’t change. But the word flexibility is an important word,” Trump said. “Sometimes it’s flexibility. So there’ll be flexibility, but basically it’s reciprocal.” The president singled out China, saying there would be room for “talk” on trade issues with the country while adding he hoped to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the near term. Despite that bit of give, it has become clear that the Trump administration is not backing down on its plan to establish sweeping trade levies, even as those efforts have sharply curbed near-term U.S. growth expectations while putting pressure on global GDP. “Every member of the Trump administration is aligned on finally levelling the playing field for American industries and workers,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to NBC News this week. “President Trump has assembled the best and brightest trade team in modern American history to reignite American Greatness, and they are hard at work following the same playbook — President Trump’s playbook — to deliver for the American people.” Even as stocks have firmly entered correction territory — declining more than 10% from their recent highs — Trump and other administration officials have also not pushed back on the idea that the U.S. economy could be in for a rough patch as a result of its tariff policy. Asked by Fox News host Maria Bartiromo if he was expecting a recession this year, Trump replied, “I hate to predict things like that.” Amid all of the developments around the Trump administration’s economic policy, the S&P 500 stock benchmark was set for its fifth-straight week without gains, finishing at levels last seen in September, while forecasters across the board reduced their outlooks for gross domestic product (GDP), the standard measure for a country or region’s growth. The rest of the world is starting to adjust. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has revised its U.S. GDP forecasts down from 2.4% to 2.2% for 2025 and from 2.1% to 1.6% for 2026. Global GDP was also revised lower, from 3.3% to 3.1% in 2025 and 3.3% to 3.0% in 2026. “Higher trade barriers in several G20 economies and increased geopolitical and policy uncertainty [is] weighing on investment and household spending,” the OECD said. And while the European Union announced this week it was delaying its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to allow for “additional time for discussions with the U.S. administration,” it was not seeking to “diminish the impact of our response,” it said, “in particular as the EU continues to prepare for retaliation of up to EUR 26 billion.” “This approach allows us to deliver a firm, proportionate, robust and well-calibrated response to the U.S. measures, while minimising potential negative impacts on EU producers and consumers,” an E.U. spokesperson said. Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve warned Trump’s tariffs could impose “transitory” price increases on consumers and businesses in the U.S. “Some near-term measures of inflation expectations have recently moved up,” Fed Chair Jay Powell said Wednesday. “We see this in both market- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are mentioning tariffs as a driving factor.” He added that the on-again, off-again tariffs had ramped up overall uncertainty in the economy. Despite an avalanche of threats, Trump has so far only implemented a global 25% tariff on steel and aluminum alongside additional levies on China totaling 20% on top of pre-existing ones. The president has twice suspended 25% duties on most goods coming from Canada and Mexico, while also threatening — but not implementing — 200% duties on Champagne and wine imports from the European Union. But on Friday, Trump suggested the biggest global trade shake-up of all was coming in less than two weeks. On April 2, the U.S. will seek to impose massive trade duties on any and all nations that have imposed duties on U.S. exports — part of a move Trump has said is designed to level an uneven playing field for U.S. goods that contributes to America’s large annual trade deficit. “April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!” he wrote on Truth Social. “For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol’ USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!” In a new note, Gregory Daco, chief economist for the EY-Parthenon consultancy, said that while economic fundamentals “have been and remain disinflationary,” looking ahead, “tariffs, confusion around trade policy and tighter immigration policy mean the risks to inflation are tilted to the upside.” “Not long ago, US exceptionalism dominated the narrative — now, the mood has turned sharply pessimistic. What changed?” Daco said. Private-sector surveys, he said, have turned negative in recent weeks “due to broad based policy uncertainty & tariffs implementation.” “Consumer sentiment has plunged, small business uncertainty is near record highs, purchasing managers are increasingly downbeat, and consumer inflation expectations are surging.” The upshot? There is now “rising stagflation risk” with both price growth and unemployment potentially trending higher, he said.
