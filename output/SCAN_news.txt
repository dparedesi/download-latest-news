Ahead of today’s AGM, expectations are muted, with brokerages suggesting this could finally leave room for a positive surprise if Mukesh Ambani delivers on growth cues across Jio, Retail, and New Energy.

Title: The AI bubble may be about to pop — here’s what MIT’s 95% failure stat means

The AI bubble might be closer to bursting than anyone wants to admit. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The AI market is undeniably booming. The six companies at the top of the world's valuation index, including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Meta, are all deeply invested in AI in some form, and it seems like US stock markets are largely being held afloat by the unbelievable profits raked in by the firms. NVIDIA, the company supplying the world with an estimated 90% of the specialized GPUs required in AI data centers, recently became the first company to hit (and surpass) a $4 trillion market valuation. Microsoft also passed the $4 trillion valuation milestone roughly a week later, and it has invested a massive sum in OpenAI, its ChatGPT LLM, and Windows 11's Copilot AI assistant. Despite all of the promises and hypotheses from major AI players as to what their technology will unleash on the world, for good or for bad, tech trends and major studies have increasingly pointed to the AI boom being one massive bubble that will rival (or surpass) the dot-com era. A new report published by MIT's NANDA initiative — a program designed to help develop a "true internet of AI agents" — suggests that only about 5% of AI pilot programs actually make it beyond the incubation stage (via Fortune). A new report published by MIT's NANDA initiative suggests that only about 5% of AI pilot programs actually make it beyond the incubation stage. MIT's research involves surveys and interviews with hundreds of employees and heads of firms, as well as outside analysis of hundreds of AI pilot programs that may or may not have found success before completely stalling out. What are those other 95% of AI pilot programs doing to fail? MIT's report suggests that it's the enterprise sector and its inability to easily adapt to AI tools that's the issue, rather than a lack of quality in the offered AI models. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. As Fortune points out, resource misallocation is also a cause, with "more than half of generative AI budgets" being spent on marketing tools rather than what makes the most money — using AI to automate and streamline. MIT's paper arrives about a month after a report from Gartner predicted that "at least 30% of generative AI projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025." When nearly every AI pilot winds up a cautionary tale, the most exceptional successes now stand out, not because they cracked some secret algorithm, but because they treated AI like any other high-stakes investment. The 5% that succeed start with a problem worth solving. Successful companies are not after generative AI because it's trendy, but because they are chasing inefficiencies or opportunities with measurable upside. That means setting KPIs (key performance indicators) before a line of code is written and attaching those metrics directly to revenue, cost savings, or reduced risk. They also build for adoption, not just proof-of-concept glory. Good pilots are built to fit in with what already exists with as little friction as possible, and the step from "pilot" to "production" should feel effortless. Finally, they have champions at every level—from engineers who can iterate rapidly to executives who appreciate their strategic value and are willing to protect the project from short‑term budget cutbacks. That cross-functional alignment maintains momentum when early results are messy and is usually the difference between a pilot that scales and one that stalls. In short, the successful 5% aren't just lucky. They are disciplined, purposeful, and relentlessly focused on business outcomes. Following the release of the MIT NANDA paper, tech stocks in the US shed about $1 trillion worth of value over the course of four days. The main culprit? Overevaluation of AI companies that have no problem sucking up billions of dollars in investments, with meager results to show. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — creator of the most popular AI model, ChatGPT — didn't help the situation. Five days earlier, The Verge interviewed Altman and quoted him as saying that AI is in a bubble. When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth. If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Altman's comments arrived following the disastrous rollout of OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5. GPT-5, which Altman hyped to incredible heights, was so bad that it forced OpenAI to resurrect older models, including GPT-4o. The catch? GPT-4o is no longer free, forcing users to pay a monthly subscription to return to what they viewed as the superior AI model. OpenAI's failure to live up to its GPT-5 promises didn't come out of nowhere. A report from 2024 suggested that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic had hit a wall in terms of developing advanced AI models. Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates, predicted in 2023 that this type of plateau seen with GPT-5 would play out at some point. Consumer perception is not only a PR problem; it's a measure of survival. Now, AI is caught up in a hype wave that's half excitement, half suspicion. Each over‑promised rollout (hello there, GPT‑5) erodes public trust. When users feel like they're beta-testing half-baked technology, they're less likely to stick around — and less likely to rave about it within their companies or networks. Gary Marcus, a psychologist, cognitive scientist, and AI researcher who publishes the "Marcus on AI" Substack and newsletter — of which I've been an avid reader for the past 16 months — has also been sounding the AI bubble alarm for several years. A recent entry published August 20 from Marcus highlights the MIT NANDA study, stock market concerns, and the changing temperature surrounding AI firms and their promises. Marcus originally broached the AI bubble subject when OpenAI was still working with GPT-2, positing that the economics of AI simply don't make sense. As Marcus says, "But until recently enthusiasm kept rising and rising, no matter what I said." But then we all saw what happened with GPT-5; Altman spent years promising the moon, and in the end, long overdue, didn’t even come close to delivering. A lot of people took note. Leading figures in the AI world haven't been shy about laying out the destruction that AI will bring to white collar job sectors and even to humanity itself. And there's certainly the potential for this sort of dystopian future to arrive. But as I (and many others) have begun to suspect, these prosthelytizations could be more for the sake of bolstering hype and investments than accurate warnings of the future. AI has the potential to do great things, and I don't imagine it's going anywhere in the near future. But is there an inflating bubble that's threatening now more than ever to pop? Absolutely.

Title: Ethereum Play: BMNR Stock To $100?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/27/ethereum-play-bmnr-stock-to-100/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN: BMNR) has surged 600% year-to-date, holding the world’s largest corporate Ethereum position of 1.7 million ETH valued at $8 billion. This far exceeds other corporate ETH holders, giving the company unmatched leverage to Ethereum price movements. With continued purchases underscoring management’s conviction, traditional metrics like revenue or margins become secondary—this is pure cryptocurrency exposure on a massive scale. But can the stock double again from here? The answer is yes. Below, we outline the potential drivers behind such a move. That said, if you want upside potential with less volatility than an individual stock, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering more than 91% returns since inception. Also see – MongoDB: Up 30% Is MDB Stock Still A Buy? BitMine’s holding of 1.7 million ETH provides interesting opportunities, including strategic initiatives and institutional partnerships, that smaller holders cannot achieve. Ongoing purchases reinforce management’s confidence and bolster its leverage with crypto infrastructure providers. For the stock to double, two factors must align: Ethereum must appreciate in value, and the company must manage its treasury effectively. While the upside is immense, the risks scale equally. For instance, the stock once lost 88% of its value during the 2022 downturn. Ultimately, BitMine delivers unmatched Ethereum exposure through the public markets. But success depends almost entirely on the cryptocurrency’s trajectory, not traditional business fundamentals. Keep in mind, investing in individual stocks—especially those tied to cryptocurrencies—carries substantial risk. For broader exposure, explore the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a strong record of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks have typically offered higher returns with less volatility than the benchmark—delivering a smoother ride, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Will AI Be the Next Dot-Com Bubble?

As AI continues to rake in funds despite questions about long-term profitability, some experts are calling for more diversification. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Is it time for investors to slow their AI roll? Some experts think so. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made headlines last week when he described the AI craze as a bubble. Combined with ChatGPT-5’s botched rollout earlier this month and some signs of sliding among tech stocks, that prompted investors to question whether the AI boom is set to go bust in the near future, like the dot-com bubble of the late ’90s. Still, AI-focused ETFs continue to hit the market, with VettaFi listing 48 in its database, and expert outlooks are mixed. “I think it’s important to be aware of the risk,” said Claire Cantalupo, senior market analyst at InvesTech Research. “It doesn’t necessarily mean AI is going to crash tomorrow.” There are a few things to look for when evaluating a possible bubble, Cantalupo said. One is a paradigm shift: a new technology or innovation leading to a surge in optimism and high valuations, with investors losing their sense of risk and reward. Another is “a universal belief that this time is different.” AI could, and probably will, change the world, she added, but it may also be causing inflated valuations that aren’t sustainable. During the dot-com boom, for example, equipment provider Cisco ranked as a major player, briefly becoming the world’s most valuable company with a market cap topping $500 billion. But it lost 90% of its value in the two years after the bubble burst in 2000. “The unfortunate reality is the top 10 companies in the S&P make up 40% of it by market capitalization,” Cantalupo said. “So investors who think they’re diversified by investing in index funds are actually far more exposed to just a small basket of stocks than they think they are.” Other potential indicators that the AI boom is a bubble include: Artificially Sweet. The S&P 500 continues to climb because of a few tech stocks — Nvidia, Meta and others — with massive AI projects. The projects could lead to too much hype, said Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. Meta, for instance, has reportedly offered huge compensation packages to AI engineers that could lose value if the company’s stock falls. Still, Colello expressed optimism, based in part on continued demand for Nvidia’s products. “Certainly, there will be businesses that fail to live up to lofty valuations and times where AI expands too quickly,” he said. “However, we don’t think these dynamics are plaguing the large AI leaders just yet.” There isn’t an ETF for everything, but the volume of leveraged products coming to market shows a strategy of filling any voids. Cash is king, but income-generating mutual funds and ETFs are increasingly being used for clients, Nasdaq found. The company’s massive asset moves may, in part, reflect institutional investors’ entry into the industry, particularly crypto. Meg Ryan, a lecturer at Harvard with a background in military law, will take over next month as director of the SEC Division of Enforcement. The latest ETFs from F/m Investments and Compoundr help institutional investors avoid taxes on income distributions. Crypto assets are increasingly available as spot ETFs like IBIT, and investors may have a fear of missing out, despite the volatility. ETF volatility plays a large role in the gap between returns for investors and for funds as a whole, Morningstar data show. A set of Vanguard funds subadvised by Wellington will mark the first active stock-picking ETFs in the company’s fleet. Energy demand is rising globally, in part because of AI use, and a handful of ETFs focused on nuclear energy stand to benefit. Cyclical industries can provide some regularity for ETF investors, but not without downsides. The filing marks President Trump’s latest move to bring his spot bitcoin strategy to the ETF market. Will advisors bite? Following revised jobs reports data, Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics head. His successor choice at the BLS may raise red flags. © 2025 The Daily Upside
