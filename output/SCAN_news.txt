Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) stock rose sharply Thursday morning, a day after the tech giant blew past Wall Street’s expectations in its fiscal third-quarter earnings report. The stock was up about 9% in mid-morning trading. It’s now up about 3% so far this year, having fully recovered from April’s trade war-induced bloodbath in tech stocks. Microsoft racked up $70.1 billion in revenue, up 13%, and $25.8 billion in net income, up 18%, fueled by relentless demand for cloud and AI. Earnings came in at $3.46 per share, easily topping consensus estimates of $3.22. Microsoft’s quarter drew gushing praise from analysts both on and off the earnings call, with Wedbush calling it “an Aaron Judge-like performance” (referring to the New York Yankees slugger). Azure beat both the Street and internal targets, with AI workloads accounting for nearly half the cloud platform’s growth. The company reaffirmed its $80 billion FY25 capital expenditures forecast and said infrastructure investments will continue to rise in FY26 — putting to rest speculation about data center cutbacks. Microsoft’s cloud engine kept roaring in Q3, with Azure and other cloud services surging 33% year-over-year, powering a 21% increase in the all-important Intelligent Cloud segment, which hit $26.8 billion. Server product revenue rose 22% as demand for AI infrastructure stayed hot. The Productivity and Business Processes segment brought in $29.9 billion, up 10% from last year, driven by steady growth in Microsoft 365 and Dynamics. Microsoft 365 Commercial revenue rose 11%, with its cloud-based suite climbing 12%, while consumer revenue grew 10%. Dynamics 365 jumped 16%, lifting Dynamics overall by 11%. On an earnings call, executives offered a confident and detailed account of accelerating enterprise demand. CFO Amy Hood emphasized that while most of the quarter’s upside came from non-AI services, digital-native companies are increasingly building everything — AI or not — in Azure. The result: a seamless pipeline converting Microsoft’s massive capital expenditures into revenue faster than skeptics expected. Wedbush raised its price target on the stock 8.4%, from $475 to $515, noting that chatter around potential data center pullbacks is now “put to rest.” As the line between AI and non-AI workloads continues to blur — and AI demand proves strong even amid an uncertain macro picture — Microsoft looks to be increasingly positioning itself as the core infrastructure provider of the AI era. In other words, hyperscaling has arrived — and it seems here to stay. —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

Title: What’s Happening With LLY Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/04/02: In this photo illustration, the Eli Lilly and Company logo is seen displayed on ... More a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Eli Lilly’s (NYSE: LLY) first-quarter performance was mixed, with revenue meeting expectations but earnings falling short. The company reported adjusted earnings of $3.34 per share versus the projected $3.46, while revenue reached $12.7 billion, aligning with consensus estimates. Although Eli Lilly experienced lower price realization, the strong volume growth for its key drugs contributed positively to top-line performance. However, following a cancer deal with Scorpion Therapeutics in Q1, Eli Lilly lowered its full-year earnings outlook. Moreover, CVS announced its decision to stop covering Zepbound while simultaneously reaching a coverage agreement with Novo Nordisk for Wegovy. This news concerned investors, causing the stock to decline after the results announcement. Now, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Eli Lilly’s revenue reached $12.7 billion in Q1, representing solid 45% year-over-year growth, driven by strong demand for its obesity drug Zepbound, which generated $2.3 billion in sales (a 4.5x year-over-year increase). Other key performers included Mounjaro, with sales up 113% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, and Verzenio, which saw a 10% increase to $1.2 billion. Notably, both Zepbound and Mounjaro sales exceeded consensus estimates of $2.2 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. The company also achieved a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin, reaching 83.5% in Q1. However, increased income taxes and losses from investments in equity securities partially offset the benefits of higher revenues and margin expansion. As a result, earnings grew only 29% to $3.34 per share, compared to $2.58 in the prior-year quarter. Looking forward, Eli Lilly maintains its revenue guidance of $58-61 billion and gross margin projection of 41.5-43.5%, but has lowered its adjusted earnings forecast to $20.78-$22.28 per share, down from the previous range of $22.50-$24.00. LLY has delivered impressive returns of 15% year-to-date (as of April 30), outperforming the S&P 500’s 5% decline during the same period. This investor optimism stems from massive demand for the company’s obesity treatments and positive outcomes from late-stage clinical trials for its daily obesity pill. In fact, the stock has consistently outperformed the broader market for four consecutive years, generating returns of 66% in 2021, 34% in 2022, 61% in 2023, and 33% in 2024. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile, and it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment surrounding tariffs and trade wars, could LLY continue to outperform the market? From a valuation perspective, we believe LLY stock has significant growth potential. At its current level of under $800, LLY trades at 58 times trailing adjusted earnings of $13.76 per share, below the stock’s two-year average P/E ratio of 76x. This higher valuation multiple appears justified given the strong sales growth and robust outlook for the company’s obesity drugs in the coming years. Notably, the $992 average analyst price target reflects over 15% upside potential. We believe investors could use the current dip—resulting from the earnings miss, downward revision to guidance, and CVS dropping Zepbound from its coverage—as an opportunity to acquire LLY stock for robust long-term gains. The company continues to have solid growth potential in the obesity treatment market, and these dips should be viewed as opportunities to enter the stock. Concerns about CVS dropping Zepbound seem overblown, with the impact expected to be limited to small employers. Importantly, Zepbound is the preferred treatment among U.S. physicians compared to Wegovy. While LLY stock looks like it can see higher levels, it is helpful to see how Eli Lilly peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: M&A: Meta’s Four Critical Acquisitions

CHONGQING, CHINA - APRIL 26: In this photo illustration, the logo of Meta Platforms, Inc. is ... More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market performance and candlestick chart visible in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and trading activity, on April 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) If you still think of Meta (NASDAQ:META) as “just the Facebook company,” you’re missing the real story - a story written in billion-dollar deals, aggressive digital land-grabs, and a playbook of strategic domination that would make even the most ruthless CEOs blush. Over the past decade, four critical acquisitions didn’t just help Meta survive - they catapulted it into an empire. As an aside, for more Meta see Zuckerberg vs Musk: Who Lost More Wealth In 2025? Investors tend to be skeptical about acquisitions - but they aren’t all bad, as Meta has shown. When done right, they have a purpose. They help expand, create moats, and in some cases, cripple the competition. Identifying such competitive advantages (or disadvantages) from acquisitions is one of the lenses we apply in High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s break down the four game-changers that made Meta the beast it is today. Imagine buying a scrappy photo-sharing app with few million users and turning it into a massive business. That’s exactly what Meta (then Facebook) did when it scooped up Instagram for what now looks like a "modest" $1 billion in 2012. Fast forward to 2025 and Instagram’s share of Meta’s revenue could exceed 50% in 2025. Yes, you read that right! That would mean nearly $80-90 billion in revenue from Instagram ads. Assuming net margin of 30% (Meta overall has 35%+) and a modest PE multiple of 20x, Instagram alone is worth $500 billion. That’s bigger than most S&P 500 cash rich giants! $19 billion sounded insane at the time. But Meta wasn’t buying WhatsApp for its revenues - it was buying scale, reach and relevance in every corner of the globe. WhatsApp has nearly 3 billion monthly unique users. While it is far from Instagram-level monetization, WhatsApp is positioning itself as Meta’s "super app" for payments, e-commerce, and business messaging. There are estimates of “business messaging” itself having revenue potential of $30-$40 billion. India is home to the largest WhatsApp user base of nearly 500 million. The government of India removed 100 million user cap for WhatsApp Pay at the end of 2024 - opening the digital payment market to more competition, which is currently dominated by Google Pay and PhonPe. When Meta acquired Oculus VR in 2014, people thought Zuckerberg had lost his mind. (VR headsets? Really?) But Oculus wasn’t just a tech toy - it was the first brick in Zuckerberg’s ambitious vision for the "metaverse," a concept Meta has been pouring over $10 billion per year into developing. Oculus, now rebranded as Meta Quest, dominates the consumer VR market - with over 70% unit market share globally. While still a small fraction of Meta’s total revenue, the growth of the VR market is explosive. According to IDC, the global AR/VR headset unit sales could more than triple by 2028. If Instagram was about photos, and WhatsApp about messages, CTRL-Labs was about the future of how we even interact with technology. Meta quietly picked up this brain-computer interface startup for a rumored $500 million to $1 billion, and it could end up being one of its most profound investments. CTRL-Labs’ technology is still in the experimental stage, but it’s part of Meta’s larger vision for the metaverse and augmented reality. Meta has integrated CTRL-Labs into its Reality Labs division, where it’s exploring how brain-computer interfaces could revolutionize VR/AR interaction and eventually lead to neural-driven devices. As Meta continues to invest in CTRL-Labs’ neural interface technology, the integration of this system into VR headsets and AR glasses could redefine user interaction. When people criticize Meta for its massive spending sprees, they miss the forest for the trees. These four deals - Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, and CTRL-Labs - aren’t just acquisitions. They’re foundations. Each one secured Meta’s dominance in a critical arena: social media, global communications, virtual reality, and human-machine interaction. Does it make you want to buy and hold on to Meta stock? Well that wouldn’t be the worst idea. But here is the thing - going all-in in a single stock - no matter how good - is a recipe for disaster. Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio is designed to diversify stock-specific while providing exposure to the upside. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
