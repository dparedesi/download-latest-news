We’ve reached a new stage in the AI boom. Big Tech earnings — and the rest of the market — have been bolstered by the AI era. But now, Wall Street is expecting more than just promises. Are these companies set up for success? Or is it a pressure they can’t quite handle? This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello, and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. It's been another busy week here at MarketWatch as we cover the election. While the Newsroom continues to dive into Donald Trump's win and what it means for the economy, we wanted to make sure you didn't miss some other very important numbers, Big Tech's earnings and AI promises. So today we're going to visit with Dan Gallagher, the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street tech columnist. Plus, we'll tell you about other news we're watching this election week, including the Federal Reserve meeting and how all of it will impact your wallet. Last week, Microsoft executives finally answered Wall Street's big question, how much is the company actually making from generative AI? The company expects to surpass 10 billion in annual revenue from AI next quarter. That number might've pushed the stock higher three or six months ago, but after this report, the market had a scary Halloween. Microsoft's stock dropped 6%, pulling the S&P 500 into the red on the last day of October. That ended a five-month winning streak for the market. The problem? Microsoft's forecast was a little shy of Wall Street expectations for cloud growth, which just felt so 2022. And it wasn't just Microsoft. All the Big Tech stocks seemed to move less on their executives' AI promises and more on actual financial performance. So what happened in this round of earnings, and what does it mean for the future? To answer those questions, I brought in Dan Gallagher, who covers tech for the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column. Here's what he told me about what happened with Microsoft. Dan Gallagher: I think especially if you compare to this time last year when AI hype was just driving everything and these companies could raise the CapEx to (inaudible) levels and just blow money out the door, and get rewarded for it because investors saw all upside in the future and they realized obviously, nothing was going to happen that year. ChatGPT had just launched. So I think it's now like we're a year ahead, money is still going out the door in even more obscene amounts, and it's going to keep getting bigger next year. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, that $10 billion figure that Microsoft mentioned pales in comparison to what they're saying they're going to spend on capital expenditures on building out this AI infrastructure. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And to drill on that $10 billion number a little bit, we got to realize that okay, one, that's including a lot of stuff, things like OpenAI. OpenAI sends a lot of their compute to Microsoft. That helps the Azure number some. And especially with Microsoft, I think investors are starting to get a little bit more picky about what they want to see. In particular, there's a lot of questions about, is Copilot generating anything? Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And Copilot is the AI software they're selling, and we've talked about on this program before as the true test of this AI cycle hype. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of hardware sales and cloud computing sales go through, but it's that next lug, the software, is that going to sell? And that's why that's so important, is because Microsoft is out there in front of all these others, and if they can sell the software, it shows that maybe others can as well. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And we don't really know how that's going for them yet. In terms of what Copilot specifically is bringing out, I think there's not so much skepticism on that 10 billion number, but it didn't really answer a lot of the questions that more on Wall Street actually have. There's different demands for AI. There's obviously these AI companies that are using cloud services right now because they need to train their models, a ton of compute there. But at the end of the day, the future of AI is going to be our businesses and consumers paying and paying extra for AI tools and AI services. So, Copilot is really central to that. Jeremy Owens: But it seems like companies now are willing to just put it in front of as many people as possible in their organization to see how they use it. At some point, they're going to have to look and say, "Well, how many people are actually using it?" For a lot of white-collar execs, it's like, "Oh good, we get a meeting transcript." Is that worth 30 bucks a month to the company for everybody to have access to those meeting transcripts? That's a big question moving forward. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And we've seen a term, it's a jargony term, but we call it rationalization. Rationalization is when you have a company that's looking at its spending on things like software and cloud services and thinks, okay, maybe we're spending a little too much here, we need to bring it back, or we need to match our spending with what we're actually using. We saw that with all the cloud services a couple years ago where they had a huge jump of growth in COVID, but after a couple years of that, there was this need to kind of, okay, not everything's being used. We need to bring our budgets in order. So I think we'll probably see those dynamics play out over the medium term with things Copilot. It'll all come down to, is there actual use happening on the ground? It's still too early I think to really see that on a mass scale, and I think one of the things that... It's going to test investors' patience, is that people change their work habits really slowly and reluctantly, even if a new tool comes along that says, "Oh, this is going to make it a lot easier." So I think that's another thing that investors have to factor in, is that to get the take-up, it's going to take time. Jeremy Owens: What Microsoft said about AI did not cause its stock to drop 6%. It really was about the forecast being just a tiny bit soft, and that's very standard. This goes back to where we were before all the AI hype. To me, it was like it's all about the forecast and your actual results, and nothing Microsoft said made me think 6% less of them. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. Microsoft historically, they're not aggressive with their forecasts, so I don't think I recall ever seeing them do what I would call a blowout forecast. Very conservative. I think you have to also factor in, last week's market was just a jittery market overall. I saw a lot of trades last week that seemed extreme up or down based on what the results were. We're not talking about Uber today, but Uber had a really big fall because they missed their gross bookings guide, but they've missed that a lot of times. So I think you have to factor that in a little bit to how the shares traded, but I do think we're definitely past the honeymoon phase of the AI hype and investors want to see more meat on the bone. Jeremy Owens: And we did get some of that meat. Amazon, while they didn't say the exact number, they did say they are on a multi-billion revenue run rate with AI, so a little bit more generic. We have to figure most of that is cloud. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Amazon doesn't have really a strong, what we call a SaaS or an apps business like Office, Excel, all those Microsoft has, so a lot of their stuff is really under the hood stuff that companies are using. I think that's going to be honestly a harder thing for them to break out longer term, how much of that is being used by AI companies for compute versus other companies using AI-generated tools? It'll be interesting to see what they do with that longer term, because Amazon historically doesn't like to give a lot of specific breakouts. Think about all the years they've sold the Kindle reader. They've never made a quarterly disclosure of how many Kindles they sold, even way back when that was their first device and there was an interest in doing it. They just didn't do that. So I think with them, I don't see a line item coming. Jeremy Owens: What I take away from a lot of these reports, Dan, is that investors are now looking at these companies' core businesses again instead of focusing on general AI chatter. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And the funny thing with Amazon was that they got a bounce even though they did the biggest CapEx jump of any of the companies, and it was shocking actually to see the number they spent in the third quarter relative to what expectations were. There was a lot of interesting dynamics with them because in their last quarter, they had teased the fact that, because they're also doing the satellite program, these satellites to compete with Starlink that are going to provide web-based services, and hinted that they were going to start having launch costs work into it. And so there was this growing worry on Wall Street saying, "Well, street estimates for earnings are too high because nobody's factoring in these costs." And Amazon's profit margins are really key to the appeal because they've been going up and up and up the last few years, so I think the fact that their margins came in and stayed strong and their forecast for margins was really strong, which it generally is not, they usually give themselves a huge wiggle room there, that was enough to kind of boost them even past a huge CapEx jump. And even with a kind of fuzzy AI disclosure, it was good enough. Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And you bring up profit margins, the Big Tech's profit margins are driving the S&P 500's profit margins higher. Since the layoffs in late 2022, early '23, the Big Tech private margins have just gotten bigger, and we continue to see evidence of this. And you brought up in one of your articles about the earnings last week about Google, where they brought on, I think, 1700 new employees in the third quarter, which seems like a really big total until you look at Google's history. And they had averaged about 7,000 new employees for the third quarter over the past five years. And then hearing Google also say that 25% of its coding is now being done by AI. This just continues to hit for me that Big Tech is trying to put themselves together in a way that it shows their corporate customers what they can do. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And I think the timing works out well for them in that sense too. They lagged behind. We saw Meta do this big year of efficiency back in late '22, mostly '23, that they fired a lot of people, their revenue per employee went up, the stock really took off, and Google was lagging on that. They just didn't show any sign that they were going to do something that drastic. And so the fact that they have shown now that they're watching their cost, getting the efficiency help, maybe not with as drastic a number as Meta delivered, it's good for them. And then yeah, the timing with the fact that they have these AI tools now at a certain phase of development where they can be used like that is definitely, I think, going to help them. Jeremy Owens: But with Google, it is an advertising business. They actually do have enterprise, so they can make that pitch. Meta is the one, and I still call them Facebook, but Facebook also is a advertising company. Dan Gallagher: Even more so than Google. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah, exactly. People want to talk about their social networks or whatever else they do, but these companies sell ads. That's how they make money. And both their ad businesses are going bonkers good right now. And Zuckerberg talks about the ad business, and obviously AI is helping their ads business, but I still don't understand what the business case is for all the AI spend he's doing. He promised to continue spending money on AI gear, and I just don't see where the money is for Facebook from AI besides better ad tools. Dan Gallagher: I think that's one big part of the appeal with it, especially when you consider that their core advertising business is now getting operating margins of like 50%-plus. Basically, right now, they're still in a phase where they can get away with a certain amount, because they show that they can do a pretty harsh turn. Let's go back to this Metaverse thing, the market brutally punished them when they said, "We're going to change our name and spend all this money to build a metaverse," and nobody understood what it was, and the market rebelled. And I'll give Zuckerberg a little credit here, he saw what happened and made a pretty hard pivot and said, "Okay, well, we're done with that." Not necessarily done, they still have- Jeremy Owens: No, he still doesn't say that. Dan Gallagher: They made a hard pivot in terms of the kind of things they were spending, the employee footprint they had. They made some pretty drastic changes quickly, which I think impressed a lot of investors. So I think they get a fair amount of benefit of the doubt right now. A year from now, if they're still spending this kind of amounts but the margin growth and everything has slowed, do they still get that or do they have more people asking exactly what you're asking, "What's the future upside of this?" It's probably not going to come from $300 glasses. Jeremy Owens: Right. Dan Gallagher: But if people took those up in a wide number and then got comfortable with things like AI and hardware, and started to be open to the fact of spending on services, there's potential there. Meta is not a company that's like, "We're going to be in the glasses business." For them, the glasses are a vehicle to get their technology into consumers' hands. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, can Apple find a generative AI payday, and what does all this mean for NVIDIA? Welcome back. Let's get into Apple earnings and the iPhone's AI debut. I think Wall Street is coming to the realization that AI is not a 2024 story. It's really a late 2025 story at best, at this point, and I think the best example of that is Apple. Apple brought out its Apple Intelligence last week. It actually released the program, which you need either this year's iPhone or last year's iPhone to access. And then they gave their earnings and forecast basically flat iPhone sales for this holiday season. It's basically admitting this is a late 2025 story if it actually does come around, and generative AI is a consumer product that makes consumers want to spend money. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And I think even that's iffy at the moment, just given the fact that so far, AI-enabled devices have not proved big sellers. Consumers are not yet sold on this idea that they need a device with onboard AI capabilities like the iPhone, like the Samsung phone, like these PCs we're seeing. So I think for Apple, it's this Apple Intelligence launch, but not everything is going to be in it. So the stuff they showed off over the summer, that's slowly coming over the next year. So if you're a prospective iPhone buyer and your current device is working fine and you're thinking, well, maybe this AI thing's worth it, you're going to wait. Apple always has this base of fans that are anxious to get the new thing whenever it comes out, but more of them, especially at the price these phones are even without an AI surcharge, these are expensive phones. And historically, the things that have really sparked these super cycles are when there's a big hardware change, when the screen gets bigger, when they started the Pro models and had these much fancier cameras. You've seen things like that spike. And you also have the fact that people hold onto their phones longer, so if you've had a big uptick one year and those people hold on of their phone for let's say three years, four years, then you're going to have a naturally bigger uptick. But we haven't seen a lot of cases where software alone has sparked any kind of super cycle, and that was the "what if" coming into this, like even if Apple Intelligence was amazing, was that going to really drive people to do it? Jeremy Owens: I want to get to my general takeaways, and the first one's really easy and simple. NVIDIA is still fine. All these executives got on their earnings calls and said, "Hey, we're going to keep spending money for all this AI gear," and that was just music to Jensen Huang's ears. Dan Gallagher: Totally. If only Amazon had done their increase with the amount they increased, NVIDIA would be fine. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Dan Gallagher: That was such a huge increase. But yes, they're all spending more. Jeremy Owens: Well, NVIDIA is going to replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, big move. NVIDIA coming into Intel shows the Dow trying to represent what is the market today. Dan Gallagher: The interesting risk with switching NVIDIA for Intel... Obviously Intel is greatly diminished, having a lot of trouble, like its days were numbered. That was clear. But when this conversation first came up earlier this year, I thought, well, there's some risks with NVIDIA, because technically, NVIDIA has multiple businesses because they were historically a video game chip company. Data center business grew up because companies were wanting those chips in their data centers. Well, it's pretty much all AI at the moment. Intel PCs were their dominant business, but it's not as dominant in Intel's model as it is in NVIDIA's. So in a way, NVIDIA is going to be always a little more of a volatile name because at some point when AI spending rationalizes and companies start to say, "Okay, well, we're going to not grow it as much," you're going to see NVIDIA stock may get really volatile, because right now, it just trades on this assumption that the spending's going up in a huge way. But it's going to be interesting to see how the effect plays out, especially in the years ahead as NVIDIA's business reaches like, what's maybe a new normal? How does the stock behave? I think it's going to go through some wild gyrations. Jeremy Owens: On the other side, and this was always something I thought about this technology but I'm just more baked in now that this is an enterprise technology and not really a consumer technology yet. And so that's good for Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which do sell enterprise generative AI products and cloud and software, while Meta and Apple are a little bit more questionable for me moving forward just on how they make money off of this. Dan Gallagher: I think so. But I think of Meta though not necessarily as consumer or enterprise, because remember, most of Meta's money is coming from businesses who are paying to advertise. So as long as they see value, and if generative AI makes Meta an even better advertising tool, they're going to be fine. For Apple, it's really tricky because if Apple's going to get AI into people's hands, it has to happen through their hardware. But the good news for NVIDIA, it doesn't matter what happens with Apple. Jeremy Owens: No, as long as Microsoft, Amazon, and Zuckerberg keep on spending- Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Jeremy Owens: ... they're fine. And so lastly, it feels like we've entered a new cycle in this AI hype era. It seemed like last year, all you had to do was say, "AI," your stock went up. This year, investors wanted numbers, and they've gotten a few more numbers or at least more specifics. And now we've reached this place where even a very specific big AI number for Microsoft did not help because everybody was looking at the traditional businesses. And it seems like a golden era for these Big Tech companies, to me. They've got good finances, they've got good core businesses, and they've still got this promise of AI returns in the future. And so they're sitting here, and I don't know how they go higher from here, but I also don't know how they get cut off at the knees, because they have that magic formula that Wall Street loves. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. So I think we're going to see this next year, is they're going to be fine on their core businesses. I think we're going to enter a phase where everything needs to go right. If you have an earnings report that's pretty strong on the core but the AI stuff isn't impressing, your stock's probably not going to do well, and the vice versa. You need to deliver both, because when you're spending this kind of money, you do need to show return at some point. They're not going broke, any of them, but this is a lot of money going out the door, and the questions are just going to keep growing and growing. Jeremy Owens: So enjoy this time now, Mark and Satya, and all you other executives who had such a good run this earnings season, because next year you're going to have to bring good core performance and AI evidence, and it still may not be enough. We'll see what the AI evidence shows- Dan Gallagher: Just do it all. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah- Dan Gallagher: That's all you got to do- Jeremy Owens: Just do it all for us. Yeah, you're worth trillions of dollars. You got to show up for it. Well, Dan, thank you so much for what you do, and thank you so much for joining us here on On Watch. Dan Gallagher: Well, thanks for having me. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for what we are watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond. Tuesday's election went Republicans' way with Donald Trump winning the presidency and the GOP retaking the Senate. There are a lot of implications here for the economy and the market, from the effects of mass deportations to the likelihood of friendly rules for the cryptocurrency industry. We'll be back to discuss those issues and more in depth next week. The October jobs report came in last Friday and it was disappointing, with only 12,000 new jobs added. While that number was much lower than expected, it really shouldn't have been too surprising. Two hurricanes and a massive strike at Boeing dragged down a month that is typically big for hiring. Despite those underlying factors, the jobs report still reflects a labor market that is not strong. The Federal Reserve has certainly been discussing that jobs report in its meeting, which began yesterday and will run through today. The board is expected to cut another 25 basis points from its core interest rate and Chairman Jerome Powell will face the press today to discuss the decision. And that's it for this episode.

US stock futures surged as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election over Kamala Harris. A call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the the Associated Press on Wednesday morning put him over the top, with Trump now set to have the distinction of being the 45th and the 47th US president. As of 6:00 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each soared around 1.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up around 2.9% on the heels of a winning day for stocks. Futures tied to the 10-year Treasury note (10Y=F), meanwhile, rose 16 basis points to trade around 4.4%. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rallied to a record alongside a surge in the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) as the evening's returns bolstered the "Trump trade." Outside of the presidential election, Republicans have also flipped the Senate. Control of the House of Representatives remains unclear. Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Earlier this week, Harris and Trump made their final pitches to voters. Trump pledged last-minute tariffs and less money for chips while Harris promised to "seek common ground" in her final rally in Philadelphia on Monday. American voters gave Donald Trump a commanding victory, powered in large part by an intense voter focus on inflation that has been evident for years. But Trump's key campaign promise of new tariffs and a “mass deportation” of undocumented immigrants could put new upward pressure on prices, the very issue that appears to have powered him to a win. A note from Capital Economics late Tuesday night crystallized some of the macroeconomic worries. The authors wrote that they expected Trump to push forward on his proposed immigration curbs and tariffs. They said that as a result, “We are minded to reduce our GDP growth forecast ... by roughly 1% and add 1% to our inflation forecast over the same period.” Read here for more about what Trump could mean on the key economic issue of price pressures, as well as taxes.= US stock futures surged as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election over Kamala Harris. A recent call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the Associated Press on Wednesday morning confirmed the victory. After a steady rally in stock futures overnight as Harris' path to victory narrowed, futures tied to the three major averages built on earlier jumps on the news. As of 6:00 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each soared around 1.6% and 2.3%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up around 2.9% on the heels of a winning day for stocks. Meanwhile, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 index (RTY=F) were up more than 6.5%. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) is pushing higher as investors bet on a faster pace of inflation under new Trump tariffs, and a slower pace of interest rate cuts from the Fed. “Overall though we think that a Trump win means higher inflation in the near-term versus the status quo with Harris, but slower growth (potentially shaving up to 0.5 percentage points off of GDP in 2025 and 2026). For FOMC policy, we think the Fed will continue to ease this year, but likely take a pause in the first half of 2025 as it waits to get a better sense of the impact of the new administration's policies on inflation and growth,” TD’s head of global strategy Rich Kelley said. The 10-year yield was up 14 basis points to around 4.26% early on Wednesday. For now, markets are taking this move in yields in stride. But keep in mind this is a market that loves prospects of more rate cuts. If that thesis gets pushed aside under Trump as tariffs spur new inflation, markets could recalibrate to the downside. Global stock markets had a mixed reaction to the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, as the Republican closed in on a second term in the White House. In China, stocks fell sharply on Wednesday, with Shanghai's blue-chip CSI 300 (000300.SS) closing 0.5% lower, and Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng (^HSI) down 2.3%. The Hang Seng China Enterprises (^HSCE) Index fell 2.6%. But Japan's tech-heavy Nikkei 225 (^N225) climbed 2.6%, while the broader Topix (0P00006NXB.T) stock index gained 1.9%. The rally came as the Japanese yen (JPY=X) sank to its lowest since July and the dollar (USD=X) strengthened. Europe's major stock gauges jumped in early trade. London's FTSE 100 (^FTSE) moved up 1.4%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) benchmark rose 1.6% as Frankfurt's DAX (^GDAXI) and Paris's CAC 40 (^FCHI) gained. Tesla (TSLA) shares are surging 13% in premarket trading as Donald Trump looks to be on the verge of winning the presidency again. A win could put Tesla CEO Elon Musk in pole position to shape the EV maker's future, given his strong backing of Trump — or at least, that is how Wall Street sees it early on. Says Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives in a note: For more on Tesla's roadmap under a potential Trump presidency, here is our chat on the topic on a recent episode of my Opening Bid podcast. Donald Trump took the stage in Palm Beach, Fl. in the early morning hours on Wednesday as he neared closer to securing the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidential election. "This is a movement like nobody’s ever seen before," he told the crowd in what sounded like a victory speech. "[This is] forever the day the American people regained control of their country." The Associated Press has not officially called the election. So far, Trump has secured 267 votes compared to Kamala Harris's 224. US stock futures soared as the results of the US presidential election all but confirmed a Donald Trump victory over Kamala Harris. The former president secured North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, three critical swing states, according to the Associated Press (AP). Results from Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Michigan remain unclear. Per the AP, Trump is just 3 electoral college votes short of clinching the win. As of 2:30 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each jumped around 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up over 2.0%. Republicans have won control of the Senate, the Associated Press projected early Wednesday. The GOP flipped a Democratic-held seat in West Virginia, as Republican Jim Justice won the open seat. In Ohio, meanwhile, Bernie Moreno unseated Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Democrats lost a key member of their coalition in the upper chamber (as my colleague Ben Werschkul detailed earlier in the blog). Seven seats hang in the balance, with Republicans looking for more gains. They are eyeing a pickup in Montana, where incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is trailing Republican challenger Tim Sheehy. Races in the key states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona remain too close to call. Democrats currently hold all those seats. Head over to the Yahoo News live blog for more election insights and updates. As US stock futures climbed late Tuesday, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RTY=F) were the star performer, rising as much as 3% to outpace their larger peers as investors bet on the likelihood that Donald Trump will win the presidential election. Companies within the index, which include regional banks and smaller domestic players, are expected to benefit from anticipated policies out of the Trump administration like lower taxes and cutting regulations. Tariffs that a Trump administration would also be expected to enact pushed the dollar higher overnight Tuesday, a benefit for small-cap companies that tend to be more levered to the domestic economy compared to more internationally oriented large-cap stocks. GOP challenger Bernie Moreno has defeated Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, according to the Associated Press. It’s a victory that almost surely means Republicans will take control of the Senate in 2025, but one that also has consequences for the crucial Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee. That committee, which Brown currently leads, has been the scene of closely watched hearings in recent years, with top CEOs like JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Jamie Dimon and Bank of America’s (BAC) Brian Moynihan forced to answer questions from lawmakers on a range of topics. Those hearings will surely continue in 2025 but now likely with a friendly lawmaker kicking off the questioning. The current GOP ranking member on that committee is Sen. Tim Scott. The South Carolinian has tended to be much friendlier to bank concerns, especially around banking regulations. It’s a handover that could have a keen impact on policy, especially if Donald Trump ends up winning back the White House. One top concern over the last year has been the proposed Basel III endgame requirements that would increase the reserve requirements on banks. Scott has often criticized the proposal, including leading a call on the Biden administration to withdraw it entirely. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices jumped to all-time highs late Tuesday as bets on Donald Trump accelerated in prediction markets. The former president has captured 198 electoral college votes compared to Kamala Harris's 112, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Bitcoin prices soared over 8% to trade around $74,200 a token — leaping past its previous record of around $73,750 a coin on March 14. Other crypto-adjacent names moved in tandem with bitcoin. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) moved over 4% higher in after-hours trading while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose over 3%. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies like dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and Ripple (XRP-USD) also jumped on the developments, rising 30% and 5%, respectively. Financial markets might be sniffing out a presidential win. One of the first big moves in markets on election night was a jump in the value of the US dollar (DX=F), which began strengthening around 7:45 p.m. ET. That occurred as the New York Times' prediction needle began to tilt slightly in Donald Trump’s direction, based on rising odds of Trump winning the swing states of Georgia and North Carolina. Other forecasts suggest a similar Trump edge. Here's the logic for a stronger dollar: Trump wants to impose new tariffs on more than $3 trillion worth of imports, which would push up prices and make inflation higher than it would otherwise be. Higher inflation generally means higher interest rates, and higher rates would draw more global investments to US securities because of the higher return. More demand for US assets boosts demand for the dollar, making it more valuable relative to other currencies. Still, this is an early move and does not mean Trump is destined for victory, though Harris is now unlikely to win in a landslide. Key swing states, including the "blue wall" of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, in addition to North Carolina and Georgia, had not yet been called as of 10:25 p.m. ET. The Trump trade is rallying, with the US dollar (DX=F), bitcoin (BTC-USD), and equity futures all pushing higher as Trump secured 178 electoral college votes compared to Harris's 99, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Decision Desk HQ, a private company that projects election results, projected Trump to also win North Carolina, a key swing state. Bitcoin prices extended gains by over 7% to trade above $72,800, while the US dollar rose to its highest level since July. Against other currencies like the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso, the US dollar is up over 1%. Near 9:40 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose about 1.1%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) also jumped over 1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 1.2%. Political betting markets made a limited move toward Donald Trump early in what is expected to be a long election night. As of 9:15 p.m. ET, the odds on Kalshi.com, a political prediction market open to US citizens, stood at 68% in Trump’s favor, projecting he would win about 2 out of 3 hypothetical contests. The odds were similar on Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market, sitting at 72.4% at 9:15 p.m. ET. It was a noticeable — but far from definite — jump on both sites from the odds earlier in the night before the polls closed when both markets showed Trump's odd about 10 percentage points lower. The surge in these markets was most evident a bit after 7:30 p.m. ET. Gains for Trump noticeably leveled off and largely held steady throughout the 8 p.m. hour. Both sites are continuing to accept bets throughout the night, with Kalshi touting that their main market now has over $280 million at stake. Citi analysts detailed “election trades to track," and YF's Rick Newman highlighted seven of them: solar energy, fossil fuels, deregulation, tariffs, inflation, antitrust, and housing. A reminder that while stocks don't care who the president is, and mostly like certainty, the election results will have implications across industries. Read more here. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose 3% in after-hours trading as election results continued to pour in Tuesday night. More results are expected to be announced in the coming hours. Tech billionaire Musk, who serves as the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX and also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has been outspoken about his support of Trump ahead of the election. Trump has even said he would consider a Cabinet position for Musk but that the businessman likely would not be able to serve "with all the things he's got going on." Intelligent Alpha CEO and founder Doug Clinton told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination on Tuesday that "it will be a very interesting night for Elon Musk." "He's obviously made a really big bet on the election going one direction," said Clinton, who is also managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. "I think if it goes against him — if Kamala Harris is elected president — I think it probably is a negative for him." It's possible Tesla could still benefit from a Harris presidency, given she could provide further tax incentives for electric vehicles as part of a continuation of Biden's green energy push. As a result, if Trump loses, Musk could likely "find some way to try to mend fences," Clinton said. "Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world," he said. Tesla shares are up about 1% since the start of the year. The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump could come down to coin-flip odds and may not be known for hours (if not days). But that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of results that could sway markets. Everything from which party will lead key congressional committees to the sway that certain industries like cryptocurrencies will have in Washington, D.C., are also on the ballot. Curious what races Jamie Dimon and crypto executives will be watching most closely? Read on here. A lot of folks on the Street I have chatted up this week are bracing for a big move in markets Wednesday morning, as the belief is that the winner of the election will be known later on tonight. Moreover, either winner would be seen as a surprise for markets (weird how these things are viewed by investors). Take that with a grain of salt, as such groupthink could mean we don't get a big move in markets on Wednesday. Amid the action, I would keep a close eye on bond yields, as markets could very well take their direction from them, based on my conversations. It's a point the Goldman Sachs team made today in a note making the rounds this evening: "The upcoming US elections could drive further upward pressure on global bond yields and indigestion for equities," said Goldman Sachs strategist Andrea Ferrario. Ferrario added, "Rising bond yields might eventually become a speed limit for equities if real yields start to increase (vs. real GDP growth expectations) or if increases in bond yields are too rapid." Futures moved firmly into green figures on Tuesday evening as early results from the US presidential election rolled in while cryptocurrencies surged and the US dollar also gained. Near 8 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) moved roughly 0.5% higher. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 0.7%. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) was also up as much as 4.5% to trade north of $71,000. The dollar was also stronger against most major currency pairs, including the yen and euro. So far, Trump has won Kentucky, West Virginia, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Florida, Tennessee, and Indiana, while Harris has claimed Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, according to the Associated Press. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged more than 20% in after-hours trading on Tuesday as early votes showed Trump clinch Kentucky and Indiana. The stock had a wild session during market hours after trading was halted several times due to volatility. Shares somewhat recovered from steeper losses but still closed down a little over 1%. Shortly after the market close, DJT reported third quarter results that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. The company also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Read more here.
