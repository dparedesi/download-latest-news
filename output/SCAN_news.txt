with Dave Vellante Dive into tech news and cutting-edge insights on current technology topics with Breaking Analysis hosted by Dave Vellante. Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and theCUBE Research communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. The shift to service as software will bring learning curve advantages, software- like marginal economics, and winner- take- most dynamics to all companies across every industry, not just tech vendors. We believe those firms that can more quickly jump on the AI experience curve will see substantially increased benefits relative to their competitors. However, our research suggests that data management We’re on the cusp of a new software- enabled business model that will determine winners and losers in the coming decades. We call this service -as-software. Specifically, we believe enterprises will begin to organize knowledge work in new ways, that harmonize islands of automation into a build-to-order assembly line for knowledge work. Firms that aggressively pursue this opportunity will be on a learning curve that we think will create sustainable competitive advantage, and, importantly, a winner-take-most dynamic. Now, we’re not just talking about technology vendors here. Rather, we believe new technology, operational, and business models will emerge, and apply to all enterprises across every industry. In this breaking analysis, theCUBE Research team presents a new way to think about how businesses will operate in the AI era; with implications for application developers, edge deployments, and security / governance models. With a glimpse toward the path that we think organizations can take to go from where they are today into the future. For the past several decades, Cybersecurity has been an unfair fight. The economics have favored attackers, which have access to sophisticated resources, lower costs, fast innovation cycles and deep knowledge of vulnerabilities. Defenders, by contrast, bear the full burden of securing sprawling networks, fragmented technologies, and human error, all while operating under legal, regulatory, and financial scrutiny. In our view, the Intel–NVIDIA pact further accentuates NVIDIA’s dominance and represents a final handoff of the baton in the race to the next era of computing. Just as Intel had a lock on the market in the 80s and 90s, NVIDIA has now extended its moat deep into the x86 ecosystem (in both PCs and the data center) and expanded its TAM by $500B to $1T by our estimates. The subtext here is that Lip-Bu Tan is taking necessary steps to save Intel. In doing so, he’s hitching the company’s wagon to the future, which is being defined by CUDA, NVIDIA’s software platform. This move by our estimates, increases Intel’s TAM by $100B and breathes new life into the x86 franchise, which was rapidly deteriorating. In our view, Intel foundry remains problematic but will get a boost from the system on chip (SoC) products that this partnership will produce. On balance we see this as a win for both companies, x86 customers and a further boost for AI’s momentum. CrowdStrike used Fal.con 2025 to harden its ongoing value proposition that security is a speed game. But the company extended its messaging emphasizing that platforms which orchestrate fleets of AI agents will set the bar for the future of security. In our view, George Kurtz’s keynote and theCUBE interview (below) mark a goal to create a clean hand-off from “assistive The threat landscape is undergoing a profound transformation. At CrowdStrike’s Fal.Con 2025 event in Las Vegas, Adam Meyers, who heads counter-adversary operations, provided a rare window into how the world’s most capable adversaries are adapting their tactics. His insights underscore a sobering reality in that artificial intelligence has become both a weapon and a defense shield, underscoring the asymmetry between attackers and defenders. We believe CrowdStrike (CRWD) has re-established growth momentum while still working through the financial and reputational overhang of the July 19, 2024 global outage. The company recently delivered net new ARR reacceleration ahead of expectations, showcased strong platform expansion across cloud, identity, and Next-Gen SIEM, and leaned on Falcon Flex as a durable consolidation lever. In our view, the near-term debate centers not only on churn or Flex conversion but more on net new ARR performance, valuation skepticism, and whether identity and SIEM can offset a maturing core endpoint business while fending off intensifying competition. The mainspring of CrowdStrike’s success remains relentless product innovation, increasingly defined by its platform. We believe its unified platform and AI-driven threat defense at scale underpin the company’s premium valuation through customer consolidation, stickiness, and durable ARR growth. We believe the prevailing narrative that Broadcom and NVIDIA are locked in a zero-sum battle for AI data center dominance is misleading. The reality is these companies are playing very different games. NVIDIA has built a vertically integrated compute and software platform that has become the engine of the AI factory era. Broadcom, by contrast, has constructed a durable business model around connectivity, custom silicon, and high-margin software. The strategies overlap but are not mutually exclusive. We believe the real story is how these firms are carving out complementary positions in the most important technology cycle since the dawn of the Internet. We believe the industry’s broad interpretation of Jensen’s Law — i.e. “Jensen’s Law accelerates Moore’s Law” — understates a fundamental economic reality of AI Factories. Jensen Huang’s own language and NVIDIA’s operating model point to a financial law of motion for AI factories: When power is the binding constraint and demand is elastic, perf/watt increases raise monetizable throughput faster than they raise total cost. The result is an extension to existing laws of tech that we’ve come to know. Specifically, Jensen’s invoking of Buy ore to make more (i.e. revenue up) and spend more to save more (i.e. unit cost down) has explicit economic implications that we believe need further examination. In addition, there is a corollary in this new regime in that, under certain conditions, fabric‑driven utilization unlocks are so valuable that high‑speed networking becomes “economically free” (i.e. where utilization gains exceed amortized fabric cost). In this Breaking Analysis we explain in detail what we’re referring to as a new Jensen’s Law. We’ll explore why this phenomenon is so important, review the math behind it, share some concrete examples of where the law is applicable, when the corollary of “the network is free” holds, implications for investors and operators; and where the law is not applicable. We believe the center of gravity in AI infrastructure has shifted from servers to AI factories, where networking is perhaps as critical as compute. Our analysis of an interview with NVIDIA SVP of Networking, Gilad Shainer, indicates NVIDIA’s thesis is straightforward. Specifically, that scale-up fabrics (NVLink/NVLink Fusion) plus scale-out Ethernet purpose-built for AI (Spectrum-X) — and increasingly scale-across for multi–data center topologies (Spectrum-XGS) — deliver superior determinism, efficiency, and time-to-outcomes at giga-scale. At the same time, the market is too large and heterogeneous for any single fabric to dominate; open standards and merchant Ethernet will continue to win broad adoption, and even NVIDIA is embracing open interfaces and ecosystems to complement its proprietary advantages. In our view, NVIDIA is a somewhat rare case where first-mover advantage has paid off. Its early conviction in parallel computing, GPUs, CUDA/NCCL software moats, and the Mellanox acquisition now underpin a defensible systems position across scale-up, scale-out, and (increasingly) scale-across. Cybersecurity is the number one risk facing enterprises today, and yet organizations remain dangerously unprepared. Executives are not blind to the problem — they understand the financial exposure, the reputational stakes, and the business impact of a major breach. They acknowledge gaps in their defenses and recognize the vulnerabilities that could cripple their mission-critical systems. But awareness has not translated into readiness and true business resilience remains elusive for the vast majority of firms. Data strategies are especially important – specifically data governance, data protection, and data quality. These remain essential elements of cyber resilience, but they’re only part of the equation. True business resilience requires confronting a multitude of dimensions — from application security to identity, supply chain integrity, operational continuity, infrastructure defenses and more. The uncomfortable truth is that most firms still lack the cohesive strategy, investment, and execution to protect their most vital assets. Donald Trump’s 180 on Intel is at least directionally correct, certainly more so than calling for the ouster of Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s CEO. But a contemplated investment by the US in Intel, as reported by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, without a significant restructuring of Intel’s entire business, is a recipe for failure in our view. Specifically, we continue to urge Intel’s board to spin out its foundry business. Every day it waits further decreases foundry’s value. Moreover, we call on the U.S. government to use money from the CHIPS Act and its influence on large US chip designers, and TSMC, to secure a position for a US-domiciled company in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. AI is currently running on a one lane, CapEx highway that is capacity constrained. Hyperscalers are the largest contributor to the momentum and as such, investors keep score with cloud growth rates. But this past quarter you had to read the footnotes and the fine print to go beyond the massive investments fueling the wave. Microsoft put up eye-popping Azure growth again, but a big part of that acceleration is Azure serving AI inference — notably ChatGPT — now neatly included in the revised definition of what’s included in Azure. This is great for headlines but not conducive to apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Meanwhile, AWS delivered the largest revenue for cloud infrastructure and sent a clear message that demand exceeds supply. Meaning growth is capped by power and components, not pipeline. That creates a weird optics penalty — AWS showing growth in the high teens on a $120B-plus run rate and it’s deemed “concerning.” But it also telegraphs future upside as capacity goes online and depreciation cycles progress. OpenAI and NVIDIA just dropped news with implications for every model lab, cloud, and enterprise AI customer and vendor. The two companies released gpt-oss-20B and gpt-oss-120B, open-weight reasoning models trained on H100, tuned across NVIDIA’s full stack, and capable of spitting out 1.5 million tokens per second on a single Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack. The weights ship under a permissive license; the inference path spans DGX Cloud, Blackwell servers, and RTX PCs via Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, FlashInfer, Hugging Face, and Microsoft AI Foundry Local. Last November, we argued that Jamie Dimon is sitting on a treasure trove of proprietary data that will never find its way into proprietary LLMs via the Internet. And as such, he was Sam Altman’s biggest competitor because his data is more valuable than the democratized insights from these LLMs. Our premise was and continues to be that foundation model companies are waging an internecine battle chasing artificial general intelligence (Messiah AGI) and the true holy grail is what we called “enterprise AGI;” meaning applying AI to proprietary data inside of enterprises will ultimately prove to be the most valuable endeavor. Today we extend that argument and posit that agents and enterprise digital twins, powered by that proprietary data, will drive the next wave of AI value. By all accounts, Microsoft just delivered one of the most powerful quarters in its history. But this wasn’t just a blowout print, it was a signal that Microsoft is playing a new game. The company’s performance is redefining what hyperscale looks like in the AI era. An objective analysis of the Q4 FY2025 earnings call suggests that Microsoft is firing on all cylinders in cloud, AI, and infrastructure execution, and it’s building for a future measured in gigawatts, not racks. The only potential negatives for investors are: 1) Capital expenditures are expected to be more than $30B in the coming quarter, signalling continued spending ahead of revenue and negatively affecting cash flow; and 2) Gross margin pressure continues in cloud due to the lower margins realized in its Azure / infrastructure business. The stablecoin market is rapidly maturing into one of the most consequential sectors of the digital asset econoour. After years of uncertainty, regulatory friction, and media skepticism, stablecoins are no longer a speculative curiosity, rather they are foundational to the next chapter of programmable finance. Our research suggests that the convergence of policy shifts, institutional adoption, and new economic use cases has thrust stablecoins into the spotlight. In short: crypto’s ChatGPT moment has arrived, and its name is stablecoin. In our view, IBM delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent memory, reinforcing a narrative we’ve tracked for some time – i.e. the pivot from legacy to a modern, AI-driven hybrid cloud company is finally showing up in the numbers. The company beat expectations across revenue, profit, margin, and free cash flow, and perhaps more importantly, demonstrated credible traction While the NASDAQ seems to reach new highs daily, enterprise tech spending remains persistently cautious at the macro amid continued uncertainty. That’s not necessarily bad news but it can be disconcerting to decision makers. Often during transitional cycles, like the one we’re in now, executives don’t want to overrotate on capital allocations that deliver outcomes, which could potentially be achieved much more cost effectively with emerging technologies like AI. We’ve seen similar patterns in previous waves. There was a period of “great softness” in enterprise IT spending when transitioning from mainframes and minis to the PC era, a huge backlash from overly exuberant Y2K and dotcom spending; and a steady deterioration of traditional enterprise tech momentum during the cloud, mobile, SaaS, social, big data era. Each wave is different but two common themes remain: 1/ strong conviction that a new era is here; and 2/ fear of disruption, which sometimes leads to hasty decision making and waste. These countervailing forces seem to be in play today as 87% of enterprises report taking a cautious approach to AI investments. And that caution is showing up in the macro spend environment. Intel’s new CEO has promised to clean up the balance sheet, slim down the company, return to a culture of engineering, sharpen its customer focus, shore up its products, become a world class independent foundry and lead Intel for as long as it takes to achieve success, however that is defined. As our audience knows, unlike most other analysts, we have aggressively emphasized the icebergs ahead for Intel since 2013, culminating in our prediction that Intel would go bankrupt trying to execute on its most previous strategy. While we would have preferred a different approach to Intel’s foundry – i.e. JV with TSM – Lip-Bu Tan at least has what we consider to be a viable go forward plan. The steady state outcome of this new direction, however is far from certain. In last week’s Breaking Analysis we argued that Snowflake was attempting to cross the Rubicon, vaulting from cloud data warehouse innovator into AI leader and intelligent application platform. This week the competitive fire got a fresh accelerant. As usual, Databricks followed up Snowflake Summit and put forth bold claims of its own, emphasizing unified governance, data intelligence, simplified user experiences, transactional capabilities and, of course, open data. Cisco hasn’t enjoyed much organic revenue growth in more than a decade. It just rolled into San Diego claiming this year’s Cisco Live is the “most consequential” event in the company’s history. Hyperbole? Maybe. But after three days on-site comprising Q&A with Chuck Robbins and Jeetu Patel, closed-door roadmap dives, and a flood of product reveals in public, our assessment is that Cisco finally has a credible, end-to-end story for the AI era. Our research indicates that data platform wars have entered an entirely new phase, one where open data is no longer a marketing slogan and governance catalogs are now the new control point. We see this as the first of several structural changes to the software industry. The next price of entry we think will be an emerging layer that we call systems of intelligence, or SOI, which we believe will become a high value piece of real estate in the AI-optimized software stack. In this Breaking Analysis, and just a few days removed from Snowflake Summit 2025, we unpack how Snowflake has moved from steward of its pristine proprietary data platform to orchestrating an ecosystem in a world that enables any compute engine to operate on any open data formats. Last week, we framed the company’s Rubicon moment, meaning the pivot from analytic warehouse to enabler of intelligent data apps. The data industry has arrived at a pivotal juncture that echoes the themes we’ve charted in previous Breaking Analysis episodes, from The Sixth Data Platform through The Yellow Brick Road to Agentic AI; Why Jamie Dimon is Sam Altman’s Biggest Competitor all the way to the Faceoff between Benioff and Nadella. Those analyses have chronicled the steady convergence of analytic data platforms such as Snowflake and Databricks, not only with the hyperscalers’ estates, but increasingly, with the operational applications that run businesses. Our research indicates that this merger is not a side-effect of Gen AI hype, rather it’s a structural shift in how enterprises will create value from data and software over the next several decades. Thirty months into the GenAI awakening, the jury is still out on how much enterprises are benefiting from investments in artificial intelligence. While the vast majority of customers continue to spend on AI, reported returns are no greater than, and frankly lag those, typically associated with historical IT initiatives like ERP, data warehousing and cloud computing. Let’s face it, the multi-hundred billion dollar annual CAPEX outlay from hyperscalers and sovereign nations is fueling the euphoria and essentially supporting blind faith in the AI movement. But ground truth returns from enterprise AI adoption remain opaque. This combined with geopolitical unrest, fluctuating public policy and GDP estimates in the low single digits, have buyers tempering expectations for tech spending relative to January of this year. Dell’s founder-led business is one of the most remarkable and under appreciated stories in tech. Dell Technologies is not particularly sexy, nor does it put forth an earth- shattering vision that bends the mind. Yet it’s a company that has consistently figured out how to ride successive waves without becoming driftwood. And like Hyman Roth of Godfather fame, Michael Dell always seems to make money for his partners. Unlike Roth, Mr. Dell is not a gangster, rather he’s a gentleman that literally wrote the book on how to play nice and win. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of DTW 2025, we examine the question, how will Dell capture the explosive AI opportunity, while transitioning the millions of servers, arrays, and PCs it already has in the field to this new AI era? The Road to ‘Service-as-Software.’ Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff is articulating a bold vision for the next era of enterprise software. In an exclusive interview with theCUBE on April 25, 2025, Benioff outlined how AI-driven agents and a unified data architecture will transform Software as a Service (SaaS) into what we’re calling “Service as Software” – a model where software-based digital agents augment every business process. The Salesforce chief has often quipped that today’s CEOs are “the last generation of executives leading exclusively human workforces,” underscoring his conviction that AI agents (what many call agentic AI) will soon work alongside humans in every enterprise. Our premise is that this “digital labor” revolution could be more disruptive than the cloud and mobile waves of 15 years ago, fundamentally redefining how applications function. Our view is that IBM has crystallized a coherent, differentiated AI thesis based on smaller, domain‑tuned models running on an open, hybrid‑cloud fabric. The goal is to unlock what it claims is the 99 percent of enterprise data still untouched by GenAI. If execution matches the marketing—particularly on integration speed and cost transparency—IBM will change the perception from perennial AI underdog to a primary or even default choice for risk‑averse enterprises seeking tangible ROI. The next two quarters of Watsonx bookings and Granite adoption will tell us whether the strategy is hitting escape velocity, merely clearing the launchpad or needs a reset. Based on this quarter’s earnings reports, it’s clear to us that demand is not the constraint for hyperscale clouds. They are, however running head‑long into the hard limits of physics. Access to megawatts, liquid‑cooled racks, and a GPU supply chain that begins and ends with NVIDIA are now critical paths to tapping what appears to be unlimited demand. AWS, Microsoft, and Google each chalked up record‑setting capital outlays last quarter—collectively dropping around $63 billion in CAPEX—yet even that eye‑popping sum can’t fully satiate the compute‑hungry AI models racing toward trillion‑parameter scale. We believe the real story isn’t simply “AI is expensive”; it’s that power availability, not revenue potential, is now the gating factor on hyperscaler growth. In our view, the winners of the next cycle will be the providers that secure sustainable energy footprints, master GPU allocation, and—critically—translate all that infrastructure into margin‑accretive AI services before the depreciation schedules kick in. Welcome to the ironic era where megawatts equal market share. As RSAC 2025 approaches, key themes are emerging that are set to dominate the world’s largest cybersecurity gathering. Industry dynamics are shifting rapidly – from AI enabling higher velocity threats, an intensified platform consolidation debate, high-profile M&A, rising interest in AI agents (with somewhat tepid adoption in cyber) and shifting security budget priorities. Our research shows that while cybersecurity remains At last week’s AI Agent Builder Summit, hosted by Scott Hebner of theCUBE Research at SiliconANGLE’s Palo Alto Studios, the hype around “agentic AI” – autonomous software agents that can orchestrate complex tasks – was on full display. Demos and keynotes painted a bold vision of AI-driven business processes. But scratch beneath the surface, and a sobering reality emerges: Most enterprises are far from ready to reap the benefits of fully autonomous agents. Much work needs to be done to realize the promise of agentic systems, including organizational alignment to create a true data culture, cleaning up data silos, harmonizing that data, data ownership, data product thinking, getting governance and security right, choosing technology partners, rationalizing your SaaS and on-prem applications portfolio, and of course change management to get all this done. Starting the journey toward an agentic enterprise is an exciting imperative, but in our view will take the better part of a decade to realize. We estimate that Google’s Cloud business will exceed $50B in annual revenue this year with Google Cloud Platform comprising more than 50% of its cloud revenue for the first time ever. Why is it then that Google’s cloud business, a $50B+ entity growing deep into the double digits gets so much criticism? The answer is simple. Google’s cloud, with arguably the best technology in the industry, is 2.5 – 3.5 times smaller than the cloud businesses of AWS and Microsoft. We are in the midst of a fundamental transformation of computing architectures. We’re moving from a world where we create data, store it, retrieve it, harmonize it and present it so that we can make better decisions, to a world that creates content from knowledge using tokens as a new unit of value; and increasingly takes action in real time with or without human intervention, driving unprecedented increases in value. What this means is every part of the computing stack, from silicon, infrastructure, security, middleware, development tools, applications and even services, is changing. As with other waves in computing, consumer adoption leads us up the innovation curve where the value is clear, the volume is high and the velocity is accelerated, leading to lower costs and eventual adoption into and disruption of enterprise applications. Importantly, to do this work on today’s data center infrastructure would be 10X more expensive, trending toward 100X by the end of the decade. As such, virtually everything is going to move to this new model of computing. Automation generally and AI specifically, render today’s cybersecurity stacks ineffective. Previously, stopping 99% of attacks and leaving the 1% for armed human hunters to deal with was, while not ideal, at least feasible. With AI, that all goes away because adversaries can scale phishing and other attacks at unprecedented rates, which overwhelms the ability of humans. This creates a wider gap between exfiltration times, which are shrinking, and mean time to remediation, giving even greater advantage to attackers. As such, the only way to fight AI is with AI. Moreover, the ever expanding number of tools in an organization’s security stack continues to exacerbate the problem. According to Palo Alto Networks, the answer is a complete makeover of your cybersecurity stack where consolidating multiple tools into a single platform and gaining comprehensive access to the right data, simplifies security operations and enables AI to operate in real time. The analyst relations (AR) function is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Once dominated by a handful of large research houses, such as Gartner, IDC and Forrester, the market now features a spectrum of independent analysts and influencers. The fast-paced nature of the tech industry, its speed of change, the relentless competition and ubiquity of technology, make it a challenging sector for Since the Gen AI awakening, we’ve said consistently that NVIDIA and Broadcom are the #1 and #2 AI plays in tech. Since peaking in mid-December of last year, Broadcom shares have been under pressure, off on sympathy with other semiconductor stocks and the general confusion about the economy, tariffs, inflation, jobs, geopolitics, debt, etc. Broadcom’s Q1 results were impressive and assuaged some of these fears. At one point last night after hours the stock was up 15% from its previous close and midday Friday was up around 6-7% despite continued pressure on tech shares. Market transitions such as the one we’re in now often bring confusion and market volatility as the new high growth sectors are not large enough to offset the slowdown in the larger declining markets. NVIDIA doesn’t have this problem because it is at the mainspring of the new wave. Broadcom is facing a similar but different dynamic in that its traditional businesses are ones that are extremely durable. Moreover, we see two relatively new dynamics coming into play for Broadcom: 1) Hyperscalers are coming to Broadcom to enable their custom AI accelerators; and 2) Broadcom’s VMware strategy is working, lifting the company to new software heights. A seismic shift is underway in enterprise software, one that pits two of the most influential leaders in the industry—Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff—against each other in a war of words that highlights the broader transformation unfolding in enterprise applications. Nadella predicts the demise of traditional SaaS applications, arguing that AI-powered agents will take over, fundamentally redefining enterprise software. Benioff, on the other hand, argues that AI will serve as an augmentation layer and rely on his existing platform to supply the digital workforce of the future. Few brands in technology carry the storied pedigree of Intel. For decades, “Intel Inside” was synonymous with progress in computing—an American icon that repeatedly raised the bar for processor performance and innovation. Today, Intel finds itself in a precarious position. Its once-vaunted manufacturing machine has fallen behind TSMC, which dominates advanced process nodes. Meanwhile, Intel’s core CPU design business—a substantial, if bruised, revenue engine—remains overshadowed by the mounting losses and capital burn in its foundry operations. Rumors swirl that Broadcom might step in and scoop up Intel’s design arm. But for those who believe in competition, national security, and the long-term integrity of an American technology brand, that outcome would be deeply misguided. Earnings reports from the big three cloud players disappointed investors this week. All three US hyperscalers fell a bit short of consensus for their cloud revenues in the December quarter and investor reaction has been negative. But squinting through the data, there’s a lot to like about the position of AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. In particular, the IaaS and PaaS revenue alone for the big 3 approached $200B in 2024 and grew 25%. All three cited capacity constraints and, along with Meta, are committing more than $300B in CAPEX spend this year, most of it to support current and future AI demand. As is often the case, when a new wave hits it tends to be overhyped at the beginning of the cycle and underestimated when it hits a steady state. And in between points A and B we often see blips and bumps that represent opportunities for long term investors. Make no mistake. We are entering a technology cycle that is completely new. Massively parallel computing and the Gen AI awakening is creating an entirely different industry focus that has altered customer spending patterns. Moreover, this new computing paradigm has changed competitive dynamics almost overnight. Decisions whether to spend tens of billions or hundreds of billions on CAPEX are being challenged by novel approaches to deploying AI. Geopolitical tensions are higher than at any time in the history of tech. While the pace of change appears to be accelerating, causing consternation and confusion, the reality is that broad technology adoption evolves over long periods of time, creating opportunities, risks, and tectonic shifts in industry structures. At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we collaborate with ETR to dig through the latest data and craft ten predictions for the coming year. This year’s batch follows some annual favorites and some new territory. In this Breaking Analysis we put forth our top ten predictions for enterprise tech in 2025 with our usual data-heavy opinions and prognostications. In just two short years, the entire data and technology industry has undergone a seismic shift. Tech stacks—from top to bottom—are being tuned to harness extreme parallel computing, often called Accelerated Computing. From silicon to infrastructure and throughout the software layer, nowhere is this transformation more pronounced than in the data stack. Over the past seven years, modern cloud-native data platforms set the agenda. Today, however, the rise of open table formats, shifting control points, open-source governance catalogs, and a heightened focus on AI are creating both challenges and opportunities for enterprises and the tech providers who serve them. In this special breaking analysis, we’re pleased to host our fourth annual data predictions power panel with some of our collaborators in the Cube Collective and members of the Data Gang. With us today are five of the top industry analysts focused on data platforms. Sanjeev Mohan of Sanjmo, Tony Bear of DB Insight, recent IDC graduate Carl Olofson, Dave Menninger of ISG and Brad Schimmin with Omdia. We are witnessing the rise of a completely new computing era. Within the next decade, a trillion-dollar-plus data center business is poised for transformation, powered by what we refer to as extreme parallel computing (EPC)—or as some prefer to call it, accelerated computing. While artificial intelligence is the primary accelerant, the effects ripple across the entire technology stack. Nvidia sits in the vanguard of this shift, forging an end-to-end platform that integrates hardware, software, systems engineering, and a massive ecosystem. Our view is that Nvidia has a 10-to-20-year runway to drive this transformation, but the market forces at play are much larger than a single player. This new paradigm is about reimagining compute from the ground up: from the chip level to data center equipment, to distributed computing at scale, data and applications stacks and emerging robotics at the edge. The road to agentic AI will be paved with stepping stones that progressively build on each other. Our research suggests that Agentic AI will not suddenly appear without a strong data foundation built on: 1) cloud-like scalability; 2) a unified metadata model; 3) data mesh organizing principles; 4) harmonized data and business process logic; and an orchestration framework that incorporates governance, security and observability. The time for Intel to shed its foundry business is now. While former CEO Pat Gelsinger made a persuasive case for U.S.-based advanced semiconductor manufacturing, his vision was flawed from the start. Intel’s foundry operation, like IBM’s Microelectronics business a decade ago, is an asset with negative value. Yet, its strategic significance for U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor race cannot be overstated. If financial institutions are deemed too big to fail, then Intel’s foundry represents a similarly critical infrastructure for U.S. national interests. AWS re:Invent 2024 ushered in a transformative chapter for both Amazon Web Services and the broader tech ecosystem. This year’s event marked the debut of Matt Garman as CEO of AWS, stepping into a role that aligns with what John Furrier aptly describes as a “wartime CEO”—a technically adept leader and trusted consigliere. Garman’s keynote set the tone for AWS’s strategic focus: doubling down on core infrastructure capabilities across silicon, compute, storage, and networking, while extending its Graviton playbook to GPUs and potentially large language models (LLMs). The inboxes are overflowing once again with predictions about the future of enterprise tech, as we gear up for 2025. While many of these forecasts are insightful, we’ll sift through them carefully before releasing our own predictions later in January of next year. True to tradition, we aim to set a higher bar for our forecasts by focusing on measurable outcomes—whether it’s tied to a specific number or a clear binary result. Our philosophy remains consistent: a good prediction should be testable, enabling us to look back a year later and determine, with confidence and supporting data, whether it held true. In this Breaking Analysis, we evaluate the 2024 predictions we made alongside ETR’s Erik Bradley. We revisit our January forecasts on topics like the macro IT spending environment, GenAI ROI, security, on-prem AI, technology priorities and more. The ever expanding cloud has become ubiquitous. No longer is the cloud some remote set of services, somewhere up in the sky. Rather, the cloud is seeping into every industry, hybrid on-prem models, edge workloads, telco markets and has its sights on space. The market size is staggering and will surpass $1T in revenue when including infrastructure – IaaS and PaaS – SaaS and professional services. Much AI work is being done today in the public cloud and despite indications that bringing AI to on-prem data will be a growing trend, it’s unlikely that the cloud will stop expanding any time soon. Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware is proceeding almost exactly as we expected when the deal was announced in May of 2022. While much of the media and competitor narrative is focused on the increased license fees Broadcom is imposing and the urgency of migrating off VMware, customer conversations and recent surveys show that while migrations are happening, the real story is that VMware’s more narrow focus and cost discipline are allowing Broadcom to integrate VMWare into its highly successful business model. Specifically, we see two seemingly countervailing trends that are both possible to be true: 1) Customers are actively moving many low value workloads off VMware; and 2) Most mission critical work is staying put, allowing Broadcom to dramatically increase the contribution from its software business and deliver a roadmap for customers that will be more cost effective than migrating. Investors have poured north of $30B into independent foundation model players including OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Mistral and others. OpenAI itself has raised more than $20B. To keep pace, both Meta and xAI will have to spend comparable amounts. In our view, the stampeding herd of LLM investors is blindly focused on the false grail of so-called artificial general intelligence AGI. We believe the greatest value capture exists in what we’re calling enterprise AGI, metaphorically represented by the proprietary data estates and managerial know-how locked inside of firms like JP Morgan Chase, and virtually every enterprise. The tools to curate and harness that collective intelligence will allow these firms to capture the majority of value in the race for AI leadership. Gen AI enthusiasm has lately turned to AI skepticism. Lack of clarity on tangible ROI for mainstream businesses, a narrow list of early winners and relentless vendor marketing around AI has caused cynicism and media backlash. But the reality remains that we have entered a new era in technology innovation that has a high probability of transforming industries, public policy, company leadership and the related fortunes of individuals and organizations. Moreover, 97% of leading Gen AI adopters report that they’re achieving tangible benefits from their deployments. Adoption of Gen AI is relentlessly on the rise and nearly two years in, is poised to begin throwing off enough value that it will heighten a mandate to apply AI to drive business results. As such, we believe that as we exit Q4 into 2025, the demand for AI solutions will continue to occupy the headspace of business technology pros and AI momentum will maintain its accelerated pace. It’s estimated that organizations spend more than $200B annually on security hardware, software and services globally. That’s a big number. But consider that the economic impact of cybercrime ranges from $500B – $2T annually. There’s even an estimate from cybersecurity ventures that says the figure is as high as $9.5T. Each year, it seems the more we spend, the more vulnerable we become, which is especially concerning given the exposure to critical infrastructures. Governments around the world have stepped up their involvement with executive orders, privacy regulations and lots of “finger wagging” at the technology industry and its customers. Frankly some of that is justified. The technology industry does much good but has a subpar record at solving this problem. One premise that we’ve put forth at theCUBE Research is that the industry must find ways to better collaborate and share resources to combat cyber threats. Two firms, IBM and Palo Alto Networks, have joined forces to combine deep expertise, AI and platform approach to better protect organizations from attackers. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the security landscape and unpack the multi-dimensional relationship between IBM and Palo Alto Networks to better understand how industry collaboration can improve cyber defenses and modernize security operations. With us are two senior executives from each firm, Mohamad Ali, SVP and Head of IBM Consulting and BJ Jenkins, the President of Palo Alto Networks. Microsoft’s new financial disclosures include changes to the way it reports Azure metrics. The company said the change was to better align Azure with consumption revenue and by inference, more closely aligning with how AWS, the leader in cloud computing infrastructure, reports its metrics. The accounting change removed certain mature, slower growth revenue streams and consequently raised the growth rates for Azure. It also had the effect of increasing the AI services contribution within Azure. While this was reported and often applauded in the media and financial circles, what wasn’t widely discussed is that while such a change increases growth rates, by definition it reduces the size of the Azure business and its resulting revenue market share. Regardless, in our view, Microsoft is comfortable that the future AI revenue contribution within Azure combined with both higher growth rates and a greater AI contribution will foster greater investor confidence and enthusiasm over time. They’re probably correct. Data from recent surveys shows that the scenarios we’ve been putting forth throughout 2024 continue to be in play. Specifically, we cite three main dynamics affecting the tech spending climate, including: 1) IT budgets continue to be constrained as; 2) GenAI is being funded by stealing from other budget buckets; and 3) The ROI for AI initiatives remains tepid, as expectations for break even continue to be pushed out to the right. Nonetheless, customers remain highly optimistic about the prospects for AI driving productivity improvements. Moreover, the cloud remains a key ingredient in supporting AI workloads. We believe the AI center of gravity for enterprise value creation is shifting from LLMs to SLMs. Where the S not only stands for small but encompasses a system of small, specialized, secure and sovereign models. Moreover, we see LLMs and SLMs evolving to become agentic, hence SAM – i.e. small action models. In our view, it’s the collection of these “S-models,” combined with an emerging data harmonization layer, that will enable systems of agents to work in concert and create high impact business outcomes. These multi-agent systems will completely reshape the software industry generally and more specifically, unleash a new productivity paradigm for organizations globally. Technology generally and big tech specifically are regularly cited by politicians, media and governments around the world as the root of many societal problems today. Accusations like privacy invaders, fake news amplifiers, job destroyers, discriminators and more are commonly lobbed at technology firms with little recognition for the substantial value large tech companies have delivered over the decades. Moreover, many powerful government officials have rewritten the history of effective government oversight and are attempting to apply antitrust law in novel ways that have virtually killed M&A and threaten to stifle American exceptionalism and innovation. For over a decade we’ve been sounding the alarm on Intel. Five years ago, like some on Wall Street, we recommended a strategy to recreate Intel by splitting up its design and manufacturing divisions. Most recently we posited that a miracle would be needed for Intel to achieve its aspirations of becoming a viable number two foundry by 2030. The majority of industry pundits have finally come to the realization that Intel’s current path is unsustainable. However some still feel that splitting Intel’s fabs from its design business doesn’t make sense. We disagree. Oracle Corporation is seeing renewed business momentum powered by a combination of an entrenched database business, years of investment in cloud infrastructure, an integrated application suite and AI technologies that are being infused throughout its product line. This includes its autonomous database, 23ai, Exadata/Exascale, other Oracle infrastructure and its vast applications portfolio. Oracle has a highly differentiated strategy that is hitting on most if not all cylinders. And it appears the best is yet to come. It’s one reason that, year to date, the stock is up 54%, compared to the Nasdaq which is up 19% as of the recording of this recording. Input from theCUBE and data practitioner communities suggests that acceleration in compute performance and the sophistication of the modern data stack (MDS) is outpacing the needs of many traditional analytic workloads. Most analytics workloads today are performed on small data sets and generally can run on a single node, somewhat neutralizing the value of distributed, highly scalable data platforms. As We believe enterprise applications are undergoing a profound change. By next year, highly capable agentic systems will emerge to create new application classes and alter the way organizations think about their backend systems, data platforms and user interfaces. The extent of the transformation, we believe, will be more impactful to the application stack than were the changes brought about by innovations seen during the modern GUI, Web, cloud and mobile eras. Customers and partners are pivoting to address Broadcom’s swift changes to its VMware packaging, pricing and partnership programs. Our data suggests customers and MSPs have moved beyond the emotional shock phase to implementing their options in earnest. Our advice to large VMware customers has been to evaluate your ELA expiration and work backwards from that timeframe. Isolate core workloads that The investor community is realizing that the return on invested capital for the AI buildout is going to take some time. The payback period for enterprise AI investments is not akin to the dopamine rush from completing a great workout. This realization combined with several other macro factors, has caused the big AI names to pullback hard recently. But the The so-called modern data stack is getting a facelift and perhaps a complete body makeover. As the point of control shifts from the DBMS to the governance layer we cite three dynamics that highlight a reshaping of today’s data landscape, including: 1) Key data players are disrupting the established norm as they expand their aspirations; 2) Data platform vendors used Three main pressure points are transforming the modern data landscape: 1) Increased interest in adopting open table formats to allow any compute to operate on any data; 2) The point of control is shifting from the DBMS to the governance layer; and 3) AI is enabling the emergence of a new class of intelligent data apps that promise to radically automate business processes and drive unprecedented levels of productivity. The chaos caused by yesterday’s CrowdStrike content update shows that even the most successful cybersecurity firms with great management, award-winning products and a growing business, are exposed to unexpected events. What’s even more important is that it underscores the fragility of our connected world and the critical infrastructure that makes it run. Virtually every industry, and who knows how many AI continues to lead all enterprise IT sectors by a wide margin in terms of spending momentum. But that momentum has not led to an across the board boost in productivity or meaningful revenue gains for firms. Specifically, the adoption of Gen AI is increasing steadily but the use cases are not yet self-funding. As such, the outlook for IT spending, while slowly improving in the second half of 2024, remains constrained. In this Breaking Analysis we share our thoughts on the emerging trends around agentic AI. We’ll define what it is, how agentic builds on (and is additive to) generative AI, what’s missing to make it real, what the stack components look like and some of the likely players in the space. As customers try to “get AI right,” the need to rationalize siloed data becomes increasingly important. Data practitioners could put all their data eggs into a single platform basket, but that’s proving impractical. As such, firms are moving to an open model where they maintain control of their data and can bring any compute engine to any of their data. While compelling, the capabilities to govern open data across an entire estate remain immature. Regardless, the move toward open table formats is gaining traction and the point of control in the data platform wars is shifting from the database to the governance catalog. Earnings prints from the likes of Dell, Supermicro and more recently HPE have shown the AI server trend is not just benefiting cloud hyperscalers but also firms with large on-premises installed bases. Oracle as well is trading at an all time high citing cloud momentum and recent deals with Google, OpenAI and prior deals with Microsoft. But make no mistake, Snowflake Summit 2024 marks the next chapter in the company’s history with new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy taking center stage, driving even faster product innovation and an ambitious TAM expansion strategy. Snowflake has moved beyond being a friendly and simpler data warehouse to tackling new problems including how to bring AI value to enterprise customers, helping ecosystem partners monetize and providing tools and services to build AI-powered enterprise data apps. Snowflake is at a crossroads. The company, which defined the modern data platform, now faces fresh challenges on four fronts. Specifically, Snowflake must: 1) advance its data cloud vision; 2) transform into an AI leader; 3) become a platform for data apps; and 4) address external market forces that pressure its core values of simplicity, efficiency, and trusted data. In this research we quantify the semiconductor ecosystem which we believe is being led by a transition to AI. Four companies stand out including NVIDIA, TSMC, Broadcom and Qualcomm to make up 45% of a $900B market by 2028. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, ahead of IBM Think and Dell Technologies World, we shine a spotlight on these two firms as leading examples of hybrid AI players that we believe will benefit from the AI wave that is upon us. And of course we’ll share several survey data points from ETR to support our assertions. RSAC 2024 was crowded, buzzy, vibrant and chaotic, underscoring the very nature of the cybersecurity industry. This market has a kind of self-propelling energy with a dynamic that blends tons of money, an ever-present and capable adversary, technical innovation, public policy, geopolitics, and a smashing together of the digital and physical worlds. In this Breaking Analysis we introduce you to Blue Yonder, a builder of digital supply chain management solutions that we believe represents an emerging example of intelligent data applications. Organizations continue to spend more on security with 87% of firms expecting to increase spend on cyber in the next twelve months. But are we safer? It’s estimated that firms on average have between 60-75 security tools installed. While leading vendors logically market the benefits of addressing tools sprawl and complexity through consolidation, the data suggests that more than half the firms are increasing the number of security vendors installed with a very small percentage able to affect vendor consolidation. In another big week we saw the AI battles continue to escalate. Google reorged to better focus on AI, Meta’s Llama 3 was released, TSM is doubling its manufacturing capacity for NVIDIA high end chips, Samsung got a $6.4B tranche of the chips act money, a Microsoft paper describes VASA-1 that turns photos into a kinda creepy talking head, Mistral Enterprises are fighting a dual mandate of operating inside a tight IT budget envelope while at the same time transforming their organization into an AI-first company. Navigating macroeconomic headwinds while driving innovation is an exciting challenge for IT decision makers. To deliver the goods, technology leaders are stealing from other budgets to fund AI, finding quick wins with fairly unspectacular AWS’ AI strategy combines foundation model optionality from partners with its own innovations across a three layered AI stack. In this Breaking Analysis we review takeaways from our AI field trip to NYC. Adobe Summit 2024 put highlighted AI powered digital experiences and personalization at scale. By applying AI, Adobe showed off its ability to bring custom experiences to the masses and do so with trusted, enterprise-grade content. Adobe’s TAM is approaching $300B and the company is demonstrating the ability to monetize AI at scale. We attended both NVIDIA GTC and Broadcom’s investor day this week where the AI platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. When you think of AI leadership, which companies come to mind? NVIDIA, OpenAI, the hyperscalers, Meta, Hugging Face, Anthropic and names like that, right? You don’t typically think of Broadcom do you? You should. Many people question whether the current AI boom will end in the same way that the dotcom bubble burst. It’s understandable as there are many similarities, especially with the exuberance seen this past week in the stock market following NVIDIA’s earnings print. The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, i.e. a capability that allows a globally consistent, real time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and non-relational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. Predictions become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true– ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Recent spending intentions data from more than 1,700 IT decision makers indicates that executives expect technology budgets to grow at 4.3% this year. That’s up from roughly 3.5% in 2023 and is higher than the expectation in October which was 3.8%. But the forecasts for 2024 are backend loaded. Moreover, while some sectors such as energy and regions like APAC With George Gilbert We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with With Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer, Carl Olofson, Dave Menninger and Doug Henschen In the words of famous people like Nobel laureate Neils Bohr and baseball legend Yogi Berra, predictions are very difficult, especially if they’re about the future. In this special Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to host our third annual data predictions power panel with some of our collaborators in Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them The rapid awareness and adoption of AI has increased concerns around security, governance, compliance and business risk. The digital business imperative to improve customer experience combined with a vastly more complex technology environment, comprising multiple clouds, IoT, containers, app integration and the popularity of open source, are driving need for better observability across technology stacks. But fragmented IT environments, lack Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, With George Gilbert We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s With George Gilbert Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to Episode 207 Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by Cisco’s $28B acquisition of Splunk represents a good outcome for Splunk and a strategic growth opportunity for Cisco. Splunk’s painful transition to a cloud and subscription pricing model was largely through the knot hole as seen by its margins and recent P&L performance. But questions remained with respect to its growth prospects and competitiveness in the hot observability space.

For With George Gilbert The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, realtime system. The premise is that increasingly, George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this With George Gilbert and Rob Strechay At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. With George Gilbert Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent With Rob Strechay and Zeus Kerravala The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting.

Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates.

Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration With George Gilbert, Rob Strechay & Andy Thurai The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, With George Gilbert Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data With Rob Strechay & Andy Thurai HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business.

We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley With Andy Thurai, VP & Principal Analyst, Constellation Research The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of AI raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing.

Once hopeful that the security industry would be shielded from macroeconomic conditions, the past year has been painful for many investors with some exceptions – most notably those investors who stuck with Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet. That On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll An AI-powered rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over The financial services industry has always been a leading consumer of tech with big IT budgets.

But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most With Erik Bradley, ETR Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not.

They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2021 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, With Andy Thurai, VP & Principal Analyst, Constellation Research A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities.

AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0.

Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up The following definition is the result of direct and indirect feedback from more than fifty technology experts, practitioners, consultants, analysts and business leaders. The methodology used to develop this definition was to put forth a premise about a new architectural framework called supercloud and iterate the definition with community input over a nine month period. The primary input for this With David Floyer While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger The rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Today we’ll address the following frequently asked questions: 1. In an industry full of hype and buzzwords, why After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. But judging by the attendance and enthusiasm at Despite fears of inflation, supply chain issues, skyrocketing energy and home prices and global instability caused by the Ukraine crisis, CIOs and IT buyers continue to expect overall spending to increase more than 6% in 2022. While this is lower than our 8% prediction made in January of this year, it remains in line with last year’s roughly 6-7% growth Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more.

The When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches.

The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it?

As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it.

Built on rigid infrastructure and managed by specialized gatekeepers, data warehouses of the past were, as one financial customer once told us, “like a snake swallowing a basketball.” Slide from Wikibon’s 2014 Big Data Capital Markets Event: The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every With Erik Bradley The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional In the 2010s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon Despite the more than $100B spent each year fighting cybercrime, when we do an end of year look back and ask, “how did we do” — the answer is invariably the same; worse than last year. Pre-pandemic, the picture was disheartening. But since March of 2020 the situation has only worsened as cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated, better funded and Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy.

We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation.

A mere two months into the job, new CEO Pat Gelsinger wasted no time In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. We believe tech spending will increase 7-8% in 2021 but we don’t expect investments in cloud computing to attenuate as workers head back to the office.

AWS, Azure, Alibaba and Alphabet have the resources, momentum and stamina to outperform all others… indefinitely. Combined, we believe these companies will generate more than $115B in 2021 IaaS and PaaS revenue. That’s a substantial chunk of market opportunity that is growing Following a 4-5% contraction in 2020, we expect a 6-7% increase in 2021 technology spending. Key drivers are: 1) Continued fine-tuning of and investment in digital strategies– e.g. cloud, security, AI, data, and automation; 2) Application modernization initiatives (e.g. containers); 3) Steady remote workforce infrastructure investment; and 4) Pent up demand for data center infrastructure (e.g. servers, storage & networking on-prem). Best of theCUBE on Cloud The next ten years of cloud will differ dramatically from the past decade. The early days of cloud deployed virtualization of standard off-the-shelf components to scale out and build a large distributed system. The coming decade will see a much more data-centric, real time, intelligent, hyper-decentralized cloud that will comprise on-prem, hybrid, cross cloud and Much of the discussion around Intel’s current challenges is focused on manufacturing issues and its ongoing market share skirmish with AMD. Of course that’s understandable. But the core issue Intel faces is it has lost the volume game, forever. When it comes to silicon, volume is king. As such, incoming CEO Pat Gelsinger faces some difficult decisions. On the one In our 2020 Enterprise Technology Predictions post we said that organizations would slow down experimentation this year and begin to operationalize their digital transformation PoCs. We also said that, based on spending data, cyber security companies like Crowdstrike and Okta were poised to rise above the rest in 2020 along with an accelerated pace of cloud migrations. And we said New data suggests that tech spending will be higher than we previously thought for 2021. COVID learnings, a faster than expected vaccine rollout, productivity gains and broad-based cloud leverage, lead us to raise our outlook for next year. We now expect a 3-5% increase in 2021 technology spending, roughly double our previously forecasted growth rate.

Fixing A Flawed Data Warehouse Model Snowflake will not grow into its valuation by simply stealing share from the on-prem data warehouse vendors. Even if it got 100% of the data warehouse business it wouldn’t come close to justifying its market cap. Rather Snowflake must create an entirely new market based on completely changing the way organizations think about monetizing Despite softer tech spending, cloud revenue shows continued momentum into 2021. As we watch an historic election unfold before our eyes, we look back at the early days of this millennium and the memorable presidential race of 2000.

ETR’s Erik Bradley provides data and insights from customer roundtable discussions and Oracle Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer and Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is a radical approach at bringing cloud services on-premises. Our initial take is those substantial customers running mission-critical Oracle applications can cut costs by up to 40% with this offering. This strategy is the most ambitious attempt we’ve seen in the industry to bring a full public cloud experience to organizations’ premises. Global 2000 customers running mission-critical large-scale applications on Oracle Databases should assume that they will migrate to one of Oracle’s new Cloud@Custmer offerings. Wikibon recommends that CxOs begin engaging with Oracle to conduct their TCO/ROI/IRR analyses now.

It presents a richer representation of real things that traditional programming technologies. Users need conventions for core concepts and how they fit together. In our conversations with the Wikibon community, we hear both interest and confusion regarding the notion of digital twins. We believe digital twins will have enormous If you’ve been following IBM’s strategic moves over the past 6 months in data and analytics, it’s hard not to have some concerns. The announcements they’ve been making this year err on the side of excessive caution. What they illustrate is IBM Analytics’ ongoing retrenchment into mainframes, private clouds, and end-to-end data governance. IBM seems to be re-crafting its core Wikibon projects that 3D XPoint will not make it in volume in either the enterprise or consumer markets; it may reside in some specialist application niches. The areas of uniqueness claimed for 3D XPoint will be addressed by DRAM, 3D NAND, and innovative non-volatile combinations of DRAM and 3D NAND. CIOs and CTOs should assume 3D XPoint will NOT be important to the enterprise, and not evaluate it further. The focus should be on deployment of 3D NAND technologies, and expect a rapid cadence of increases in performance, density, form factor, and volume. Hybrid DIMMs with DRAM and 3D NAND should also be evaluated as the technologies mature, as well as UniGrid Architectures. Premise By mid 2018, 3D NAND will become the backbone of almost all deliveries and all vendors of NAND flash, to both the consumer and enterprise markets, with a clear path to increased density, higher performance, and decreasing cost. Consumer NAND announcements are a leading indicator of enterprise NAND capabilities. Toshiba Consumer SSD NAND Announcement The concept of Private Cloud has been in the market since 2008, but the ability of IT organizations to build Private Cloud services that match Public Cloud have been limited. Wikibon forecasts the Private Cloud market revenues from 2015-2026, as well as introducing the enhanced concept of “True” Private Cloud. As more companies transition into digital businesses, it is critical to understand the business and technology trends that will shape Cloud Computing for the next decade. Wikibon examines the critical elements to help companies understand this rapidly evolving landscape and marketplace. Customers are asking how to choose from the rich and growing array of tools in the Hadoop ecosystem. Part of the consideration centers on how to insulate them from fragmentation in the continually evolving Hadoop ecosystem. The incredibly rapid pace of innovation distinguishes the ecosystem but it also has its downsides. The mix and match richness of choice introduces complexity for administrators and developers. At some point it makes sense for customers to consider investing in tools that can hide much of that complexity in data ready for analysis. To be clear, there is no magic product that can hide all these technologies. But when customers take the perspective of simplifying specific end-to-end processes, solutions are available to address the problem. IT leaders can no longer treat stream processors as esoteric functionality employed solely by leading-edge consumer Internet services. They are becoming core functionality that works side-by-side with the more familiar batch processing engines such as Hive, HBase, or Impala. Application developers that need near real-time functionality can start to evaluate stream processors as part of design patterns. However, their analytics functionality is still a bit primitive and most of them need a lot of hardening in order to be resilient enough for mainstream customers.

However, their analytics functionality is still a bit primitive and most of them need a lot of hardening in order to be resilient enough for mainstream customers. Wikibon Research has forecasted Public Cloud revenues from 2015 through 2026; with the expectations that 33% of all IT spending ($500B) will move to Public Cloud services within the next decade. The impact this will have on IT vendors and IT strategy will be significant as more applications focus on mobile and real-time data analytics. In this research paper, Wikibon looks back at the introductory Server SAN research, adjusts the Server SAN definition to include System Drag, and increases the speed of adoption of Server SAN based on very fast adoption from 2012 to 2014. The overall growth of Server SAN is projected to be about a 23% CAGR from 2014 to 2026, with a faster growth from 2014 to 2020 of 38%. The total Server SAN market is projected to grow to over $48 billion by 2026. The traditional enterprise storage market is projected to decline by -16% CAGR, leading to an overall growth in storage spend of 3% CAGR through 2026. Traditional enterprise storage is being squeezed in a vice between a superior, lower cost and more flexible storage model with Enterprise Server SAN, and the migration of IT towards cloud computing and Hyperscale Server SAN deployments. Wikibon strongly recommends that CTOs & CIOs initiate Server SAN pilot projects in 2015, particularly for applications where either low cost or high performance is required. Mainstream IT, LoB execs and application development professionals each provide different yet critical perspectives to Systems of Intelligence. IT exes must be in a position to deliver the right infrastructure (e.g. cloud, on-prem, etc.) with the proper performance and SLA profile to support LoB requirements. Line-of-Business execs must have enough knowledge to specify the real-time needs of applications while application development pros must ensure the right skills are in place to deliver and maintain services to Systems of Intelligence over a full life cycle. The Big Data market continued its maturation in 2014, experiencing both significant growth as measured by vendor revenue and increased adoption of Big Data tools and technologies by large enterprises across vertical markets. In this exclusive report for Wikibon Premium members, Wikibon details Big Data vendor revenue and extends its groundbreaking market forecast through 2020. Converged infrastructure is a trend that has been growing for over 5 years and is rapidly transforming the way that users consume IT. In 2012, Wikibon forecasted (see Converged Infrastructure Takes the Market By Storm) that 2/3 of infrastructure for enterprise applications would be packaged as some form of converged infrastructure by 2017. Now there are billions of dollars of Hortonworks plans to go public in 2015 and its S-1 filing, revealed to the world yesterday, says a lot about the state of the Hadoop market generally and, obviously, Hortonworks specifically.

Converged Infrastructure Moving to Early Majority The growth of converged infrastructure solutions is impossible to miss in conversations across the marketplace (see videos from the recent VMworld conference). Customers, however, are not looking to buy “convergence”; rather, IT is in desperate need for solutions While VMware is still dominant in the x86 server virtualization market, there are clear signs that the hypervisor is being commoditized and that competing solutions are closing the functionality gap. Over half of respondents to Wikibon’s survey last year were running multiple hypervisors. Wikibon is digging deeper into customer adoption including both multi-hypervisor environments and what is driving customers to Web Giant Targets the Cloud Google has spent the last 14 years building one of the largest networks and most scalable architectures in the world.

Last week at the Open Compute Summit Winter 2013 event, Facebook shared insight into its IT infrastructure. While hyperscale companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are quite different from the typical enterprise, it is Wikibon’s belief that those companies are driving key changes to how infrastructure is consumed that will filter down to the service provider and enterprise worlds in the Providing effective business analytics tools and technologies to the enterprise is a top priority of CIOs and for good reason. Effective business analytics – from basic reporting to advanced data mining and predictive analytics — allows data analysts and business users alike to extract insights from corporate data that, when translated into action, deliver higher levels of efficiency and profitability to the enterprise. Underlying every business analytics practice is data. Traditionally, this meant structured data created and stored by enterprises themselves, such as customer data housed in CRM applications, operational data stored in ERP systems or financial data tallied in accounting databases. But the volume and type of data now available to enterprises — and the need to analyze it in near-real time for maximum business value — is growing rapidly thanks to the popularity of social media and networking services like Facebook and Twitter, data-generating sensor equipped and networked devices, both machine- and human-generated online transactions, and other sources of unstructured and semi-structured data. We call this Big Data.

Title: How LLY Stock Delivered $47 Billion To Shareholders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/15/how-lly-stock-delivered-47-billion-to-shareholders/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T13:40:48Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In the last decade, Eli Lilly stock (NYSE: LLY) has returned $47 billion to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-centric approach has delivered solid results in 2025, with the stock posting 9% year-to-date returns, despite experiencing some volatility from its peak of $937 earlier in the year, while demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of increased competition in the diabetes and obesity treatment markets. Eli Lilly's commitment to rewarding shareholders reached new heights with the board's approval of a massive $15 billion share repurchase program in December 2024, replacing the completed $5 billion buyback and representing one of the largest capital return initiatives in pharmaceutical industry history. The diabetes and obesity treatment leader further reinforced its shareholder-first philosophy by announcing a 15% dividend increase for the seventh consecutive year, raising the quarterly dividend from $1.30 to $1.50 per share, bringing the annual dividend to $6.00 and yielding approximately 0.74% at current levels. Eli Lilly’s exceptional financial performance has been driven by the blockbuster success of its GLP-1 medications Mounjaro and Zepbound, with 2024 revenues reaching $45.04 billion (up 32% year-over-year) and earnings of $10.59 billion (up 102%), providing the robust cash generation that enables both aggressive share buybacks and consistent dividend growth while maintaining substantial R&D investments for pipeline advancement. These two drugs alone accounted for $11.5 billion in total sales last year, and in the first half of 2025, this figure has surged 115% y-o-y to $14.5 billion. Let’s look at some numbers and compare how this payout power stacks up against the market's biggest capital-return machines. Interestingly, LLY stock ranks 58th in history in total shareholder returns. Why does this matter? Because dividends and buybacks represent direct returns to shareholders and reflect management’s confidence in future cash generation. Many companies follow this strategy. Below is a list of the top 10 companies by total capital returned through dividends and repurchases. While that’s one perspective, Trefis High Quality Portfolio considers many more factors to help reduce company-specific risk while maintaining growth exposure. For the complete list, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking. Key takeaway: Total shareholder returns as a percentage of market cap often appear inversely related to growth potential. Companies like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding faster and more predictably but have returned smaller proportions of their value to shareholders. That’s the trade-off: attractive capital returns can sometimes come at the cost of growth. Keeping that in mind, let’s examine Eli Lilly’s fundamentals. (See Buy or Sell Eli Lilly Stock for more.) That’s a solid snapshot, but a complete investment evaluation requires a broader view. That’s exactly what the Trefis High Quality Portfolio delivers—balancing lower risk with upside exposure. Still, Lilly isn’t immune to volatility. It dropped 51% during the Global Financial Crisis and 43% in the Dot-Com bubble. Even during more recent events—the 2018 correction, inflation shock, and Covid pandemic—it declined between 18% and 22%. So, while fundamentals remain strong, the stock can still see notable drawdowns during market downturns. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio of 30 stocks has consistently outperformed major benchmarks such as the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000. Why? Collectively, HQ stocks have offered higher returns with lower volatility—a smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: AVGO Stock AI Jackpot: $51B Shareholder Returns
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/avgo-stock-ai-jackpot-51b-shareholder-returns/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:40:46Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has returned an impressive $51 billion to its investors through direct cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-focused strategy has delivered extraordinary results in 2025, with the stock posting a remarkable 50% year-to-date return, dramatically outperforming the broader market and establishing AVGO as one of the year’s most compelling semiconductor investments despite recent volatility. See – What’s Behind The Surge In Broadcom’s Stock? – for more details. Broadcom's commitment to consistent income generation continues through its steady quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, maintaining an annualized dividend of $2.36 that yields approximately 0.68%, with the company successfully sustaining 13 consecutive years of dividend increases since becoming a public company. The semiconductor giant's robust capital allocation was significantly amplified in April 2025 when the board authorized a massive $10 billion share repurchase program running through December 31, 2025, reflecting management's confidence in the company's strong cash flow generation and its dominant position in AI infrastructure and mission-critical software. Broadcom’s exceptional financial performance has been underpinned by robust revenue growth, with Q3 2025 revenues reaching $16 billion and generating an impressive free cash flow of $7 billion (44% of revenue), while Q4 guidance of $17.4 billion represents a 24% year-over-year increase driven by accelerating demand for AI semiconductors and infrastructure software solutions. Let’s examine some statistics and evaluate how this payout capability compares to the market’s leading capital-return powerhouses. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd largest return to shareholders in history. Why should you care? This is because dividends and share buybacks signify direct and tangible returns of capital to investors. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s financial well-being and its capacity to generate sustainable cash flows. Furthermore, there are numerous other stocks with similar characteristics. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by the total capital returned to investors via dividends and stock repurchases. For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you observe here? The overall capital returned to investors as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a quicker pace, in a more predictable manner, compared to others, yet they have delivered a significantly lower percentage of their market valuation to stockholders. That’s the downside to substantial capital returns. While they are appealing, one must reflect on the question: Am I forfeiting growth and robust fundamentals? Keeping that in perspective, let’s analyze some figures for AVGO. (see Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for further details) Nonetheless, AVGO isn’t immune to significant declines. It experienced a drop of nearly 48% during the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 35% in the 2021 inflation shock, and around 27% in the 2018 correction. Even with robust fundamentals, it’s apparent that the stock can endure substantial setbacks when the market shifts. Quality companies still suffer when investor sentiment changes dramatically. However, the risk isn't restricted to considerable market declines. Stocks can decrease even when markets are favorable – consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. To understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp downturns in the past, read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
