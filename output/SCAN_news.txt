Investing Small-cap stocks have been out of favor for years and might offer the best risk-reward after a huge three-year run for the major indices. With the Russell 2000 up almost 6% in 2026 in just two weeks, many across Wall Street see more gains for the index. With the prospect of an improving U.S. economy in 2026, that should provide a strong tailwind for small-cap and small-cap value stocks. Sending You to Google News in 3 © scyther5 / Getty Images In 2026, the seemingly forgotten Russell 2000 has emerged as the leading equity index, already up 5.6% compared with the S&P 500’s 1.2% gain. That’s because it is uniquely leveraged to a domestic-driven economic rebound, easing financial conditions, and renewed risk appetite for small-cap stocks. Valuation saturation and global exposure trap the large-cap benchmarks. Meanwhile, small-cap companies benefit disproportionately from falling interest rates, improved access to credit, and rising mergers-and-acquisitions activity. These all lower their cost of capital and unlock growth. The index is also more sensitive to U.S. fiscal policy, infrastructure spending, and reshoring trends, allowing earnings growth to accelerate faster than that of multinational mega-caps facing currency and geopolitical headwinds. After years of underperformance, relative valuations in the Russell 2000 entered 2026 at historically attractive levels, setting the stage for multiple expansion as investors rotate toward cyclical growth and away from overcrowded large-cap trades. We have to admit that the surge of the Russell 2000 in 2026 came as somewhat of a surprise to us here at 24/7 Wall St. Yet, the reality is that after three years of double-digit gains for the S&P 500, many of the top stocks, including most of the Magnificent 7, are starting to underperform the index. In fact, only two of the Magnificent 7 outperformed the S&P 500 in 2025: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). We screened our 24/7 Wall St. Russell 2000 research database for stocks with solid upside potential and dependable high-yield dividends.

Title: What’s Going On With Bitcoin And The Stock Market? Analyst Breaks It Down

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin (BTC) and the stock market have experienced sharp price swings and declines since 2025. Because of this volatility, a crypto analyst has warned that the market correction could intensify further in 2026. In a detailed analysis, he outlines a bearish scenario for Bitcoin, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency could soon face another price crash amid persistent downward pressure in the broader stock market. Market analyst Doctor Profit has raised concerns about the direction of the crypto and traditional markets, warning that both Bitcoin and stocks are currently in a severe bear market. In a technical breakdown on X this Monday, the expert highlighted three major bearish setups forming simultaneously in Bitcoin. He highlighted a massive Bearish Divergence on the weekly and monthly charts, a clear bearish flag signaling a potential drop toward $70,000, and a possible Head and Shoulder pattern that could still play out. While he acknowledged that Bitcoin could still experience short-term price increases and briefly rise toward the $97,000-$107,000 range due to strong liquidity, he said that the ultimate target remains $70,000. Doctor Profit emphasized that Bitcoin’s potential decline to $70,000 could go two ways. It could either break out of the bearish flag to that downside target or complete the Head and Shoulders pattern before reaching $70,000. He stated that he will not add new short positions at current prices but plans to increase them aggressively from $115,000 to $125,000 if Bitcoin moves into the $97,000 to $107,000 range. The analyst painted a similarly grim picture for the stock market. He said he was “ultra-bearish” on both Bitcoin and the financial system. He also noted that the banks are stressed and that forced liquidations in precious metals like Silver are creating ripples across the broader market. Additionally, Doctor Profit noted that insider activity shows clear signs of panic among investors, with record levels of selling since August 2025. Because of this, the analyst believes that the market is heading for a 2008-style crash. Consequently, he has concluded that the current market conditions are too extreme. On the bright side, Doctor Profit said that although he maintains short positions on stocks and Bitcoin, he remains bullish on Gold and Silver. He explained that any upside to the $97,000-$107,000 range will prompt him to increase his short exposure and roll spot profits for BTC from $85,000 into these positions. Toward the end of his analysis, Doctor Profit discussed upcoming events that could influence Bitcoin and the broader financial markets this week. He stated that the US CPI inflation forecast of 2.7% will be released this Tuesday. Other than this, the rest of the week is expected to have few market-moving events. Doctor Profit has also highlighted January 15 as an important date because US lawmakers will vote on the CLARITY Act. He explained that if the bill passes, it will move closer to becoming law, setting clear rules and oversight for the crypto market.

Title: 3 Dividend Stocks With High Yields and a Triple-Digit Upside Potential

Investing Verizon (VZ) trades at under 9x earnings with a 6.82% dividend yield despite generating $26.2B in pre-tax income. Hormel Foods (HRL) offers a 5% yield and has raised dividends for 59 consecutive years. HP (HPQ) trades below 7x forward earnings with a 5.59% yield and a sub-37% payout ratio. Sending You to Google News in 3 © CHIEW / Shutterstock.com You don’t have to settle for a moderate yield with moderate upside if you like dividend stocks. Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL), and HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) offer both a high yield and upside potential in the coming years and can greatly outperform the broader market. You can still buy stocks with a lower yield, but it’s worth keeping in mind that even a 4% yield is outclassed by Treasuries that yield over 4.8% while being risk-free. At the same time, the market is littered with cash-rich companies that are going through a tough period. I argue these dividend stocks are bound to inevitably bounce back once the storm passes. You’ll be able to snag the dividend payouts plus the massive upside once that happens. Let’s take a look. Verizon is one of the most mispriced cash cows on the stock market today. It is one of the largest telecommunications businesses and has more than proved itself in the past few years. Telecom companies are usually debt-laden and were considered more on the discretionary side. However, Verizon managed to generate positive cash flow despite exceptional interest rates, increase its dividends, and keep its customer base steady. In fact, customers have shown that their internet subscription is actually essential to them. They’re unlikely to go offline no matter how tough the economic situation is, and that makes Verizon a solid safe haven to buy into for a high and dependable yield. VZ stock carries a 6.82% dividend yield today and trades at less than 9 times earnings. Sure, it has over $170 billion of total debt on its balance sheet, but pre-tax income of $26.2 billion over the past year is more than enough to service that debt and pay growing dividends. Once interest rates look less scary, I expect VZ stock to make a full recovery and beyond, likely reaching $80. Hormel Foods has taken a beating over the past five years and is down 48.2% over that period. This company makes a variety of branded food products. While inflation initially helped it, the momentum has gone downhill since 2021. Regardless, I now believe it is too cheap to ignore. HRL stock now comes with a dividend yield of over 5%. Better yet, dividends have been raised for 59 years consecutively. The payout ratio still leaves room for more modest increases. I expect this cash cow business to do a lot better. EPS is expected to continue growing above a 6% clip in both FY 2026 and FY 2027, along with revenue growth above 2%. You may argue that the 16 times forward earnings premium is thus fair value for the stock, but I’d disagree. Such a low valuation would only be fair if HRL stock came with a lower yield and a more fickle cash flow. I see the forward PE ratio climbing above 25x in the coming years as interest rates drop, allowing the yield to be appreciated more by the Street. HP Inc. makes personal computers, printers, laptops, etc. It is not to be confused with HPE, which makes servers and storage. HPQ stock is down over 34% in the past year, and I believe it’s worth buying into the weakness now. The company has solid, stable cash flow, with computer and printing businesses still being very lucrative and reliable. Component prices are explosive, but this isn’t a one-sided affair that many doom-and-gloom analysts expect will kill HP Inc. Instead, it could turn HPQ much hotter. Customers are willing to cover the cost of rising components. Plus, the company has strong links to enterprise clients who keep orders steady year after year. As a result, EPS is expected to stay flat in FY 2026 and grow at a 4% clip in FY 2027, along with a modest sales increase below a 2% growth rate. These aren’t sexy figures, but they show a lot of resilience that most other companies do not have in the electronics sector. You get a forward dividend yield of 5.59%. The real kicker is that the payout ratio is less than 37%. Management has been increasing the dividend at over 10% annually on average over the past 5 months. The business itself doesn’t need to grow at a flashy pace before Wall Street starts paying more due to how much income it can churn out. HPQ trades at less than 7 times forward earnings.
