Title: The Modern Case for Old Money: Why Physical Gold and Silver Are Essential Investments in 2025
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/the-modern-case-for-old-money-why-physical-gold-and-silver-are-essential-investments-in-2025/
Time Published: 2025-10-11T10:09:00Z
Full Content:
The alarm clock reads 3:47 AM when Margaret checks her phone for the third time tonight. The headlines are relentless: inflation stubbornly above 4%, geopolitical tensions escalating, and her retirement account balance fluctuating wildly with each market session. At 58, she’s watching decades of careful savings slowly erode, not from market crashes, but from something far more insidious—the silent theft of currency debasement. Margaret’s story is the same across millions of American households in 2025. While the stock market reaches new nominal highs, the purchasing power of the dollar continues its relentless decline. A gallon of milk that cost $3.50 five years ago now costs over $5.00. The house she bought for $200,000 in 2010 is now “worth” $400,000, but the dollars she would receive are worth significantly less than the dollars she originally spent. This is the reality of living in a fiat currency system where central banks can create money at will, and governments can spend without meaningful constraints. However, throughout this monetary chaos, two assets have maintained their purchasing power for over 5,000 years: gold and silver. These precious metals represent more than mere investments—they are sound money, the ultimate hedge against the systematic debasement of paper currencies. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore why buying physical gold and silver has become not just prudent, but essential for wealth preservation in 2025. We will examine the fundamental differences between owning physical metals versus paper proxies, provide a step-by-step guide for secure purchasing, and explain why working with a trusted dealer like Miles Franklin Precious Metals can make the difference between success and costly mistakes in your precious metals journey. The concept of currency debasement is as old as money itself, but the modern version operates with unprecedented scale and sophistication. When the Federal Reserve creates new dollars through quantitative easing or when Congress authorizes massive spending programs, they are effectively diluting the value of every existing dollar in circulation. This process transfers wealth from savers to debtors, from the prudent to the profligate, and from the middle class to those who receive the newly created money first. Since the abandonment of the gold standard in 1971, the U.S. dollar has lost over 85% of its purchasing power [1]. What could be purchased for $1 in 1971 now requires approximately $6.50 in today’s debased currency. This represents the largest wealth transfer in human history, conducted not through taxation or confiscation, but through the subtle manipulation of the monetary system itself. The acceleration of this process in recent years has been breathtaking. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expanded from less than $1 trillion in 2008 to over $9 trillion at its peak in 2021 [2]. While some of this expansion has been reversed, the precedent has been established: when faced with economic challenges, central banks will create money rather than allow natural market corrections to occur. Inflation, the visible manifestation of currency debasement, has returned with a vengeance in 2025. Despite official statistics suggesting inflation is “under control,” anyone who purchases food, energy, or housing knows the reality is far different. The Consumer Price Index, heavily manipulated through hedonic adjustments and substitution effects, significantly understates the true rate of price increases experienced by ordinary Americans. This environment creates an urgent need for inflation hedges—assets that maintain or increase their value as the purchasing power of currency declines. While stocks, bonds, and real estate can provide some protection, they all exist within the same financial system that creates the problem. Only physical gold and silver offer complete independence from the monetary system that is systematically destroying the value of paper assets. Gold has demonstrated its effectiveness as an inflation hedge throughout history. During the inflationary 1970s, gold rose from $35 per ounce to over $800, providing investors with returns that far exceeded the rate of currency debasement. In the current environment, with gold trading above $3,950 per ounce, the metal continues to fulfill its historical role as the ultimate store of value. The decision between gold and silver investment represents one of the most important choices facing precious metals investors. While both metals serve as monetary assets and inflation hedges, they possess distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different investment objectives and risk tolerances. Gold serves as the ultimate monetary metal, recognized and accepted worldwide as a store of value. Central banks hold gold as their primary reserve asset, with 43% of central banks planning to increase their gold reserves in 2025 [3]. This institutional demand provides a floor under gold prices and ensures continued recognition of gold’s monetary role. The investment case for gold rests on its unparalleled track record as a wealth preservation tool. Gold does not corrode, tarnish, or decay. It cannot be created or destroyed through human action. These physical properties, combined with its historical role as money, make gold the ultimate insurance policy against monetary system failure. Silver offers a more complex investment proposition, serving dual roles as both a monetary metal and an essential industrial commodity. The industrial demand for silver has exploded in recent years, driven by the green energy transition, electric vehicle production, and advanced electronics manufacturing. Solar panels alone consume over 100 million ounces of silver annually, and this demand is projected to double by 2030 [4]. The gold-to-silver ratio, currently trading around 81:1, provides insight into silver’s relative value. Historically, this ratio has averaged approximately 16:1, suggesting that silver may be significantly undervalued relative to gold. When this ratio contracts during precious metals bull markets, silver typically outperforms gold by substantial margins. Silver’s lower price per ounce makes it accessible to investors with smaller budgets, allowing for more flexible purchasing strategies. A single ounce of silver costs less than $50, compared to nearly $4,000 for an ounce of gold. This affordability enables investors to make regular, small purchases through dollar-cost averaging strategies. However, silver’s industrial demand also creates additional volatility. Economic recessions can reduce industrial consumption, putting downward pressure on silver prices even as monetary demand increases. Conversely, supply disruptions or technological breakthroughs can create explosive upward price movements that far exceed gold’s performance. For most investors, a balanced approach incorporating both metals provides optimal diversification. A typical allocation might include 70-80% gold for stability and wealth preservation, with 20-30% silver for growth potential and industrial exposure. This combination captures the benefits of both metals while managing the unique risks associated with each. The distinction between physical vs. paper gold represents perhaps the most critical decision facing precious metals investors. While paper alternatives like ETFs, futures contracts, and mining stocks offer convenience and liquidity, they introduce counterparty risks and systemic vulnerabilities that can prove devastating during the very crises that precious metals are meant to protect against. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) like GLD and SLV provide easy exposure to precious metals prices through traditional brokerage accounts. However, these funds hold metal on behalf of shareholders, creating a layer of intermediation between the investor and the actual asset. During periods of extreme market stress, ETF shares may trade at significant discounts to their underlying metal value, and redemption mechanisms may fail to function properly. More concerning is the practice of fractional reserve precious metals, where multiple claims exist against the same physical metal. The London Bullion Market Association estimates that paper claims against physical gold exceed actual metal availability by ratios of 100:1 or higher [5]. In a crisis scenario where multiple investors simultaneously demand physical delivery, the system would collapse, leaving paper holders with worthless claims. Futures contracts and other derivatives create even greater risks, as they are settled primarily in cash rather than physical metal. These instruments serve the financial system’s need for price discovery and speculation but provide no protection against monetary system failure. During the 2008 financial crisis, numerous commodity funds collapsed despite rising underlying asset prices, demonstrating the dangers of derivative-based exposure. Physical bullion ownership eliminates these counterparty risks entirely. When you hold physical gold or silver, you possess direct ownership of a tangible asset that exists independently of the financial system. No bank failure, brokerage collapse, or government decree can eliminate your ownership of physical metal stored securely under your control. The peace of mind that comes with physical ownership cannot be quantified in financial terms. During the 2008 financial crisis, investors with physical precious metals slept soundly while those holding paper proxies worried about the solvency of their counterparties. This psychological benefit alone justifies the additional costs and complexities associated with physical ownership. Storage and insurance costs represent the primary disadvantages of physical ownership, typically ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% annually depending on the storage method chosen. However, these costs pale in comparison to the potential losses from counterparty failure or the inability to access your metals during a crisis. The famous phrase “if you don’t hold it, you don’t own it” has become a rallying cry among precious metals investors for good reason. History is littered with examples of paper claims becoming worthless while physical assets retained their value. The choice between physical and paper precious metals is ultimately a choice between true ownership and convenient exposure—a choice that may determine your financial survival during the next monetary crisis. Purchasing physical precious metals requires careful planning and attention to detail. Unlike buying stocks or bonds through a brokerage account, acquiring physical gold and silver involves considerations of authenticity, storage, insurance, and dealer selection that can significantly impact your investment success. The precious metals industry includes dealers ranging from highly reputable, long-established firms to fly-by-night operations that prey on inexperienced investors. The difference between working with a trusted dealer and falling victim to a scam can mean the difference between successful wealth preservation and devastating financial loss. Miles Franklin Precious Metals exemplifies the gold standard in precious metals dealing. Founded in 1989 by David and Andy Schectman, this family-owned business has built an impeccable reputation over more than three decades in the industry. With over $12 billion in precious metals sales and an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau with zero complaints on record, Miles Franklin has earned the trust of investors nationwide [6]. What sets Miles Franklin apart from competitors is their commitment to education and personalized service. Rather than employing high-pressure sales tactics, their experienced brokers take time to understand each client’s unique situation and investment objectives. This consultative approach ensures that investors make informed decisions aligned with their long-term financial goals. The company’s extensive product selection includes investment-grade gold and silver bullion, numismatic coins, and specialty items from major mints worldwide. Their relationships with primary distributors ensure competitive pricing and reliable product availability, even during periods of high demand when other dealers may experience shortages. “In an industry where trust is paramount, partnering with a dealer like Miles Franklin Precious Metals ensures you are getting authentic products at fair prices, with expert guidance to support your precious metals journey.” The choice between coins and bars represents a fundamental decision that affects liquidity, recognizability, premiums, and storage considerations. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each format enables investors to make informed decisions based on their specific needs and circumstances. Government-minted coins like American Gold Eagles, Canadian Gold Maples, and Austrian Philharmonics offer several advantages for precious metals investors. These coins are produced by sovereign mints with guaranteed purity and weight, making them instantly recognizable and highly liquid worldwide. The government backing provides additional assurance of authenticity and quality. The premium over spot price for government coins typically ranges from 3% to 8% for gold and 15% to 25% for silver, depending on market conditions and product availability. While these premiums represent additional upfront costs, they often provide better resale value and easier liquidation compared to generic products. Privately minted bars and rounds offer lower premiums, typically 1% to 3% over spot price for gold and 5% to 15% for silver. These products maximize the amount of precious metal acquired for each dollar invested, making them attractive for investors focused purely on metal accumulation rather than numismatic value. However, private mint products may face greater scrutiny during resale, as buyers must verify the reputation and authenticity of lesser-known manufacturers. Some private mint products also carry lower liquidity, particularly in smaller markets or during periods of market stress. Size considerations affect both premiums and practicality. Larger bars typically carry lower premiums per ounce but may be more difficult to sell in smaller quantities. One-ounce coins and bars provide optimal flexibility for most investors, allowing for partial liquidation without breaking larger positions. The purchasing process with a full-service dealer like Miles Franklin begins with a consultation to determine your investment objectives, budget, and timeline. Experienced brokers can explain the advantages and disadvantages of different products, helping you make informed decisions based on current market conditions and your specific needs. Pricing transparency is crucial in precious metals transactions. Reputable dealers provide real-time pricing based on current spot prices plus clearly disclosed premiums. Miles Franklin’s brokers explain all costs upfront, including any shipping, insurance, or handling fees, ensuring no surprises at the time of purchase. Payment methods vary among dealers, with most accepting wire transfers, checks, and credit cards. Wire transfers typically offer the best pricing, as they eliminate credit card processing fees that may be passed on to customers. Some dealers offer price protection programs that lock in pricing for a specified period, allowing time for payment processing without market risk. Delivery and insurance are handled professionally by established dealers. Products are shipped via insured, signature-required delivery services, with full insurance coverage from the dealer’s vault to your doorstep. Tracking information is provided, and most dealers maintain insurance coverage until successful delivery is confirmed. Secure storage represents one of the most important aspects of physical precious metals ownership. The storage method you choose affects not only the safety of your investment but also its liquidity and your peace of mind. Home storage offers maximum privacy and immediate access to your metals but requires significant security measures. A high-quality safe, preferably fireproof and waterproof, represents the minimum security requirement. The safe should be bolted to the structure and concealed from casual observation. Home insurance policies may require additional coverage for precious metals, and some insurers impose limits on coverage amounts. Bank safe deposit boxes provide professional security at reasonable cost, typically $50 to $200 annually depending on box size and location. However, access is limited to banking hours, and some experts question whether safe deposit box contents are fully protected during banking crises or government emergencies. Professional vault storage offers the highest level of security and insurance coverage. Established dealers like Miles Franklin can facilitate secure, audited storage solutions through partnerships with premier vault facilities across North America and internationally. These facilities provide segregated storage, regular audits, and comprehensive insurance coverage, ensuring your metals are protected against theft, damage, and loss. The choice of storage method depends on factors including the size of your holdings, your comfort level with home security, and your need for regular access. Many investors employ a combination of storage methods, keeping a small amount at home for immediate access while storing the majority in professional facilities for maximum security. The proliferation of sophisticated counterfeiting techniques has made the ability to spot fake gold coins and silver bars an essential skill for precious metals investors. While purchasing from reputable dealers like Miles Franklin virtually eliminates the risk of receiving counterfeit products, understanding basic authentication methods provides additional confidence and protection. The magnet test represents the simplest method for detecting fake precious metals. Gold and silver are not magnetic, so any attraction to a strong magnet indicates the presence of ferrous metals. However, this test is not foolproof, as sophisticated counterfeits may use non-magnetic base metals like copper or tungsten. Weight and dimension verification provides more reliable authentication. Genuine precious metals coins and bars have precise specifications for weight, diameter, and thickness. A digital scale accurate to 0.1 grams and a set of calipers can verify these specifications against published standards. Significant deviations indicate potential counterfeits. The ping test utilizes the unique acoustic properties of precious metals. When struck gently, genuine gold and silver produce a clear, sustained ringing sound, while base metals create a dull thud. This test requires practice and experience to interpret accurately but can be effective for detecting obvious fakes. Professional testing equipment like electronic gold testers and acid test kits provide more definitive results but require training and experience to use safely and accurately. These tools are typically used by dealers and coin shops rather than individual investors. Visual inspection can reveal obvious counterfeits through examination of details like mint marks, edge lettering, and surface quality. Genuine government coins exhibit sharp, clear details and consistent quality, while counterfeits often show blurred features, incorrect fonts, or poor surface finish. The most effective protection against counterfeit precious metals is purchasing exclusively from highly reputable, long-established dealers. Companies like Miles Franklin Precious Metals, with over 30 years in business and an impeccable reputation, have rigorous authentication procedures and relationships with primary distributors that virtually eliminate the risk of counterfeit products reaching customers. When purchasing from secondary markets, private parties, or online auctions, the risk of encountering counterfeits increases dramatically. The potential savings from these sources rarely justify the risks involved, particularly for inexperienced investors who may lack the knowledge and equipment necessary for proper authentication. The gold price prediction for 2025 from major financial institutions reflects unprecedented bullish sentiment among professional analysts and institutional investors. Goldman Sachs has set a target of $4,000 per ounce by mid-2026, with potential upside to $4,300 by year-end [7]. UBS has raised its forecast to $3,800 by end-2025, while JPMorgan projects an average of $3,675 in the fourth quarter of 2025, climbing toward $4,000 by mid-2026 [8]. These forecasts represent more than mere speculation—they reflect fundamental changes in the global monetary system that are driving unprecedented demand for precious metals. Central bank gold purchases have reached historic levels, with 43% of central banks planning to increase their reserves in 2025, up from just 29% in the previous year [9]. This institutional demand provides a powerful floor under gold prices and signals growing concerns about currency stability among monetary authorities worldwide. Geopolitical tensions continue to escalate, creating additional safe-haven demand for precious metals. The ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, combined with rising tensions between major powers, have investors seeking assets that exist outside the traditional financial system. Gold and silver provide this independence, maintaining their value regardless of political developments or sanctions regimes. Monetary policy uncertainty adds another layer of support for precious metals prices. Despite efforts to combat inflation through interest rate increases, central banks face the impossible task of maintaining price stability while supporting heavily indebted governments and financial systems. This policy contradiction virtually guarantees continued currency debasement and inflation, driving demand for real assets like gold and silver. The silver price forecast appears even more bullish, with some analysts predicting the metal could reach $50 per ounce in 2025, challenging its previous all-time high [10]. Silver’s unique position as both a monetary metal and essential industrial commodity creates multiple demand drivers that could propel prices significantly higher. Industrial demand for silver continues to accelerate, driven by the green energy transition and technological advancement. Solar panel production alone consumes over 100 million ounces annually, while electric vehicle manufacturing, 5G infrastructure, and advanced electronics create additional industrial consumption. This demand is largely inelastic, meaning it continues regardless of price levels. Supply constraints add urgency to the silver investment thesis. Unlike gold, which is primarily mined for monetary purposes, silver is largely produced as a byproduct of base metal mining. This means silver supply cannot easily respond to price increases, creating the potential for explosive price movements when demand exceeds available supply. The gold-to-silver ratio, currently around 81:1, suggests significant upside potential for silver relative to gold. Historical analysis shows this ratio typically contracts to 40:1 or lower during precious metals bull markets, implying silver could outperform gold by 100% or more if historical patterns repeat. These fundamental drivers create a compelling case for precious metals ownership in 2025 and beyond. While short-term price movements remain unpredictable, the long-term trajectory appears clearly upward, driven by monetary debasement, geopolitical uncertainty, and structural supply-demand imbalances that show no signs of resolution. The ability to hold physical precious metals within tax-advantaged retirement accounts represents one of the most powerful wealth preservation strategies available to American investors. A Precious Metals IRA allows individuals to diversify their retirement savings beyond traditional stocks and bonds while maintaining the tax benefits associated with qualified retirement plans. The Internal Revenue Service permits IRA ownership of specific precious metals products that meet minimum fineness requirements. For gold, the minimum fineness is 99.5%, while silver must be 99.9% pure. Approved products include American Gold and Silver Eagles, Canadian Gold and Silver Maples, Austrian Gold Philharmonics, and various bars produced by approved refiners. Self-directed IRAs provide the vehicle for precious metals ownership within retirement accounts. Unlike traditional IRAs that limit investment options to stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, self-directed IRAs allow investment in alternative assets including real estate, private businesses, and precious metals. This flexibility enables sophisticated investors to create truly diversified retirement portfolios. The process of establishing a Precious Metals IRA involves several steps, beginning with the selection of a qualified custodian who specializes in alternative asset IRAs. The custodian handles all administrative requirements, including IRS reporting, while working with approved depositories to store the physical metals in segregated accounts. Miles Franklin Precious Metals has developed expertise in facilitating Precious Metals IRAs, working with qualified custodians and depositories to streamline the process for their clients. Their experienced team can guide investors through the setup process, explain the various options available, and ensure compliance with all IRS requirements. Funding options for Precious Metals IRAs include direct contributions, transfers from existing IRAs, and rollovers from employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s. Each method has specific rules and timelines that must be followed to avoid tax penalties. Professional guidance from experienced dealers like Miles Franklin can help navigate these requirements successfully. The storage requirement for IRA precious metals mandates that all metals be held by an approved depository rather than in personal possession. This requirement ensures proper segregation and insurance while maintaining the tax-advantaged status of the account. Approved depositories provide regular statements and audit reports, giving investors confidence in the security and authenticity of their holdings. Distribution options from Precious Metals IRAs include taking physical delivery of the metals or selling them and receiving cash distributions. The choice depends on individual circumstances and market conditions at the time of distribution. Required minimum distributions beginning at age 73 can be satisfied through either method. The combination of tax advantages and precious metals ownership makes Precious Metals IRAs particularly attractive for investors concerned about currency debasement and monetary system stability. By holding physical gold and silver within retirement accounts, investors can protect their retirement savings from both market volatility and currency devaluation while maintaining tax-deferred growth potential. The case for owning physical gold and silver in 2025 extends far beyond simple investment returns or portfolio diversification. These precious metals represent a fundamental choice between participating in a monetary system designed to transfer wealth from savers to debtors, or taking control of your financial destiny through ownership of real, tangible assets that have preserved wealth for millennia. The evidence supporting precious metals ownership has never been more compelling. Central banks worldwide are accumulating gold at historic rates, recognizing what individual investors are beginning to understand: fiat currencies are failing, and real assets provide the only reliable protection against monetary debasement. The forecasts from major financial institutions, predicting gold prices above $4,000 and silver approaching $50, reflect not speculation but recognition of fundamental economic realities. The distinction between physical ownership and paper proxies cannot be overstated. In a world where financial institutions hold multiple claims against the same assets, where government policies can freeze accounts and confiscate wealth, and where systemic risks threaten the entire financial system, physical precious metals provide independence and security that no paper asset can match. The process of acquiring physical gold and silver need not be complicated or intimidating. Working with established, reputable dealers like Miles Franklin Precious Metals ensures that your precious metals journey begins on solid ground. Their three decades of experience, impeccable reputation, and commitment to client education provide the foundation for successful precious metals investing. The time for action is now, while precious metals remain available at reasonable premiums and before the next monetary crisis makes acquisition difficult or impossible. Every day of delay represents another day of exposure to currency debasement, another day of watching your purchasing power erode, another day of depending on a financial system that serves its creators rather than its participants. Don’t wait for the next crisis to unfold. Protect your wealth and take a step towards financial sovereignty today. Contact the experienced brokers at Miles Franklin Precious Metals for a private consultation and learn how easy it is to add the timeless security of gold and silver to your portfolio. The choice is yours: continue participating in a monetary system designed to impoverish savers, or take control of your financial future through ownership of humanity’s oldest and most reliable forms of money. The precious metals are waiting. The question is whether you will act before it’s too late. [1] U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2025).

Title: Palladium Is Mooning: Here’s Why The Rally Will Continue
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/10/10/palladium-is-mooning-heres-why-the-rally-will-continue/

ByClem Chambers, Senior Contributor. For most people, palladium is a fairly obscure commodity investment. However, it currently surging – and not without good reason. Palladium and platinum have long been suppressed in price because they’re key materials in catalytic converters, and the internal combustion engine has been viewed as outdated and destined for the scrap heap. But that narrative has changed. The U.S. has made a 180-degree turn on energy policy, setting a new course of energy maximalism. In this new model, the internal combustion engine doesn’t disappear – it continues to play a role. You might ask why. The answer is AI. Artificial intelligence is expected to consume massive amounts of electricity. When you hear Elon Musk predict that AI will use “all the energy in the solar system,” and Jeff Bezos discuss launching server farms into space, it’s not hard to imagine a future in which power demand soars. In that world, keeping traditional engines running while AI systems compete for energy could actually make sense. In this scenario, platinum and palladium are crucial for mitigating the environmental impact of continued fossil fuel use. However, there is a problem: only about 200 tonnes of new platinum and palladium are mined each year, compared with roughly 3,200 tonnes of gold and 25,000 tonnes of silver. PGMs are rare are found primarily in the U.S., South Africa, and – awkwardly – Russia. Add retail FOMO around precious metals to the mix, and you get a perfect setup for explosive repricing. So, let’s look at the chart of gold v palladium: Historically, palladium has traded at parity with gold and has even been twice its current price in recent years. Today, it’s significantly lagging gold. A move back to parity seems plausible – and it could go much higher. That makes palladium potentially more compelling than platinum, which would also perform well if it returned to a 1:1 ratio with gold, as it once did. In the short term, the ongoing precious metals bull market could drive platinum higher. But over the long term, the realities of energy demand and the need for environmental remediation are likely to push both palladium and platinum to new heights. Right now, this is the chart of palladium: Anyone familiar with technical analysis will recognize the classic ballistic curve of a booming asset taking shape in palladium’s chart. The upside potential in this setup is significant. I wrote a similar piece months ago when palladium was trading well below 1,000. I’ve been proven right so far, and I believe we’re still in the early stages of this rally. Yes, I bought a lot back then – and yes I’m still holding. For those who prefer stocks over commodity ETFs, Sibanye Stillwater SBSW is a good option. I hold that as well. The so-called AI bubble is shaping up to be many times larger than the dot-com boom, and the commodities that power it will likely undergo a dramatic repricing.

Title: AMD Stock To $450?

Time Published: 2025-10-09T12:24:21Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) made headlines by landing a major deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, to supply tens of thousands of its GPU chips for 6 gigawatts of computing capacity over the next five years. The deal represents one of the largest chip orders ever placed in the AI sector and underscores how OpenAI is looking to diversify its hardware supply chain beyond industry standard Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which holds over 75% of the AI compute market. AMD stock has surged by close to 40% since the deal was announced, and currently trades at about $235 per share. Is OpenAI’s next bet Intel Stock? Could AMD stock reach $450 in the next few years? It probably can. AMD stock trades at about 70x trailing adjusted earnings and roughly 60x projected 2025 earnings. Is this pricey? Not exactly. Especially when you consider AMD's steadily expanding earnings base, the accelerating demand for AI compute, and the multi-year growth runway now unlocked by its OpenAI contract. Also, for perspective, Nvidia’s market cap exceeds $4.5 trillion - more than 12 times AMD’s valuation - illustrating just how large the addressable market remains. As AMD begins to execute on this massive contract, it’s not unreasonable to see its multiple hold up - or even expand - as revenue visibility improves. In the scenario below, we use AMD's revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $450-plus stock price in the coming years. AMD stock has jumped meaningfully recently, but there is significant risk in relying on a single stock. On the other hand, there is a value to a broader, diversified approach we take with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you buy one stock you like or build a portfolio designed to win across cycles? Our numbers show that High Quality Portfolio has turned stock-picking uncertainty into market-beating consistency. This portfolio is incorporated in the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management - a Boston area wealth manager and Trefis partner - whose asset allocation framework yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. AMD-OpenAI Deal Will Drive Revenue Surge AMD’s revenues have risen considerably from $6.7 billion in 2019 to about $26 billion in 2024, an annual growth of over 31%, and the momentum can hold up. Consensus projects a close to 28% growth for 2025. However, with the OpenAI deal, there is a real likelihood for AMD to grow its sales at a higher pace in the next few years, led by growth in accelerated computing space and its new GPUs. Although AMD’s OpenAI deal won’t boost revenue immediately, it will have a considerable impact in the coming years. The first real sales impact starts in the second half of 2026, when MI450 and Helios systems begin deployment. The major revenue ramp is likely to come in 2027, as the large-scale installations could generate tens of billions in annual AI data center revenue. Over the next few years, AMD expects the partnership — along with related follow-on deals - to contribute over $100 billion in cumulative sales over four years. Considering this, it’s probably reasonable to assume sales will grow by about 33% from an estimated $33 billion in FY’25 to around $43 billion by FY’26. Sales could grow by about 50% over 2027 and 2028. This could translate into revenue of approximately $96 billion by FY'28. OpenAI’s endorsement is more than a sales win, it’s also a validation for AMD's chips. Being chosen by the leading AI software player gives AMD credibility that could attract other hyperscalers and enterprise customers. This could help to further boost demand and sales. Moreover, the AI workload mix is shifting from training to inference - using trained models for real-world applications. Inference favors efficiency and cost-effectiveness over brute-force performance, areas where AMD’s architectures can shine. This is in contrast with the training phase, where Nvidia's cutting edge chips were far ahead of the pack. (See How Inference Changes The AI Landscape) Higher-End Products Can Drive Margins Combine this robust revenue growth with the fact that AMD's adjusted net margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory - they grew from levels of about 11% in FY'19 to over 21% in FY'24 as the company sees better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Margins could potentially trend still higher to levels of about 25%, as AMD sees higher economies of scale, improving its fixed cost absorption. Now combining 25% adjusted net margins, with about $96 billion in revenue, would translate into earnings of about $24 billion. That's a roughly 4.4x increase in adjusted net income from levels seen in 2024. An $800 Billion Market Cap Now, if earnings grow 4.4x, the price-to-earnings multiple would theoretically shrink by a similar factor, from about 70x to roughly 16x, assuming the stock price stayed flat. But that’s exactly what AMD investors are betting will not happen. As earnings expand sharply over the next few years, a more likely scenario is that AMD's P/E stabilizes closer to say 35x, reflecting stronger growth visibility and improving profitability. Under those assumptions, AMD’s market capitalization could rise to around $840 billion. There is, however, a small caveat to this upside story for shareholders - dilution. As part of the OpenAI agreement, AMD issued warrants allowing OpenAI to purchase up to 160 million shares, or roughly 10% of the company, contingent on performance milestones such as the initial gigawatt rollout and certain share price targets. If OpenAI chooses to exercise and sell those shares — possibly to help fund its chip purchases — the move could dilute existing shareholders. That said, dilution doesn’t necessarily negate value creation. If AMD’s overall valuation expands meaningfully on the back of this partnership, the deal remains net accretive. Even assuming a 10% additional share count, a stock price of roughly $450 appears plausible upside within the next few years. So what about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? While our above example illustrates a roughly three year time frame, in practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes three years or four, as long as AMD is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: AMD, Marvell, Intel: Which Is The Next Multi-Trillion Chip Stock

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) made news by entering into a significant agreement with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, to provide tens of thousands of its GPU chips for 6 gigawatts of computing power over the forthcoming five years. The initial gigawatt comprising AMD’s next-generation Instinct MI450 chips will be delivered in the latter half of 2026. This contract signifies one of the largest individual chip acquisitions ever made in the AI industry and highlights OpenAI's efforts to diversify its hardware supply chain beyond the industry leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which commands over 75% of the AI computing market. This strategic shift could represent a pivotal moment, not only for AMD but also for the ongoing expansion of the AI computing sector, opening avenues for emerging leaders in the AI semiconductor arena. The next phase of the AI computing race will no longer be about just training large language models – it’s increasingly about inference, or putting AI to work in the real world. Training is akin to teaching an AI model everything they know, while inference is when that knowledge is applied – answering questions, generating text, or running chatbots millions of times a day. As AI applications scale to hundreds of millions of users, the demand for inference capacity is set to explode. Running these workloads efficiently has become the new bottleneck, forcing companies to rethink how and where they deploy compute. Nvidia has dominated training with its H100 and A100 GPUs, but inference could shift the equation. Once models are trained, they must run continuously across billions of devices, making energy efficiency, latency, and hardware availability crucial factors. Nvidia Stock 2x To $350? That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like NVDA, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. As AI matures, more of the value creation could shift from training toward inference. Morgan Stanley projects roughly $3 trillion will be invested into the AI build out over the next three years – and it is likely that a significant portion will flow toward inference. To put this in perspective: Nvidia’s market cap is currently around $4.5 trillion, fueled largely by its dominance in training. But inference could actually be the bigger market. In the coming years, inference could easily surpass training in total revenue and total GPU units shipped, opening a new frontier in the AI chip race. This could favor companies that offer cheaper, more energy-efficient, and readily available chips, not just the most powerful ones. This shift opens the field to a broader range of players. So who are the potential winners here? Nvidia is likely to remain a leading player even as the AI market shifts. The company’s deeply entrenched software ecosystem – including CUDA, TensorRT, and cuDNN – are likely to have locked in many early customers. It is also adapting its product line, focusing on powerful new chip architectures for inference and optimized inference software to meet growing workloads from video generation to large-scale real-time AI applications. Combined with its strong partnerships across hyperscalers, AI startups, and enterprise customers, the company is likely to remain an AI leader, although it’s very likely that its share of the AI compute market will trend lower. AMD has considerably lagged Nvidia in the early stage of the AI build out, but it could emerge as a key challenger to Nvidia in inference. The OpenAI partnership further validates AMD’s position as a serious inference player and signals that the company is steadily carving out a place as a preferred provider for scalable, efficient AI compute solutions. AMD chips are increasingly competitive in performance while offering cost and memory advantages. Not all organizations need or can afford Nvidia’s top-tier GPUs. Many are likely to opt for older Nvidia chips or cost-effective alternatives like AMD’s MI series, which offer solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. Intel might seem like a wildcard in the AI chip race, but it has a credible shot at the inference market. Its broad portfolio – including CPUs, Gaudi Habana accelerators, and an extensive datacenter ecosystem – positions Intel to deliver energy-efficient, high-volume inference solutions. Intel’s fabs could benefit as AI inference drives demand for high volumes of lower- to mid-tier chips, which Intel may be more well-positioned to produce for other companies. While its Intel’s process technology lags the likes of TSMC at the cutting edge for top-tier GPUs, it is probably more than capable of fabricating efficient, cost-effective inference chips. See: OpenAI’s Next Bet: Intel Stock? ASIC, or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, are increasingly gaining attention in the AI space. Unlike versatile, general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are engineered for a single task, making them far more cost- and energy-efficient for large-scale inference workloads. The crypto industry offers a clear precedent: Bitcoin mining initially relied on GPUs, but rapidly shifted to ASICs once scale and efficiency became paramount. related How Marvell Stock Surges To $140 A similar evolution could play out in AI inference. Two companies positioned to capitalize on this trend are Marvell, which has a market capitalization of roughly $1.5 trillion, and Broadcom, both with proven expertise in designing custom silicon for hyperscalers. Broadcom, in particular, has emerged as a standout, securing a $10 billion deal with OpenAI. Up 500%, What’s Happening With AVGO Stock? U.S. Big Tech such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are all designing AI chips. Amazon has leaned into training-focused chips, Meta started with inference and is expanding to training, while Google supports both through its TPU (tensor processing unit) lineup. For these hyperscalers, the motivation is not necessarily to beat Nvidia in the market but to lower costs, gain supply control, and improve bargaining power within their massive cloud ecosystems. Over time, that means less incremental demand for Nvidia’s GPUs. Over Q2, Nvidia said that just two of its customers made up roughly 39% of total revenue — likely these big U.S. tech firms — making it vulnerable if they shift workloads to in-house silicon or lower-cost suppliers. Chinese Internet Giants In China, companies like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Huawei are stepping up their AI chip efforts. Recent reports suggested that Alibaba plans to launch a new inference chip for its cloud division. The strategy is twofold: to power inference at scale using its own tech stack, and to secure a steady supply of semiconductors amid U.S. export restrictions. For now, Nvidia’s GPUs are still expected to form the backbone of Alibaba’s AI training workloads, but inference is likely to become the longer-term growth driver for the company. related Alibaba’s AI Chip A Big Deal? Beyond semiconductors, growing AI inference workloads will drive demand for supporting infrastructure. Fast, reliable, and intelligent networking will be critical to handle billions of requests daily. Companies like Arista Networks and Cisco are well-positioned to benefit, as ultra-low-latency, high-bandwidth interconnects become essential for moving massive datasets between servers, GPUs, and cloud nodes in real time. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Archer Aviation (NYSE: ACHR) isn’t merely another aviation stock—it’s positioning itself at the heart of what could be the most revolutionary shift in urban transportation since the automobile. With six Midnight aircraft currently in production and three in final assembly at facilities in California and Georgia, the company is carefully working towards a commercial launch as the market starts to understand the significance of this opportunity. The figures reveal an early narrative: a $6 billion order book where each Midnight air taxi is valued at $5 million, alongside stock performance that has provided nearly 300% gains over the past year. However, here’s the reality—this $6 billion backlog is relatively insignificant compared to what we might be looking at in the long run. Consider the last time you found yourself stuck in traffic, watching time slip away, aware that you had an important appointment. Now visualize stepping out of your building, using your phone, and within minutes rising above the gridlock—no traffic signals, no congestion, simply a direct path to your destination. This isn’t futuristic fantasy any longer. The deep-seated human desire to overcome the limitations of ground transportation is real, and eVTOL (Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing) technology finally makes it available. When individuals experience their first air taxi ride, they don’t merely encounter a new transportation method—they perceive liberation from the frustrations characteristic of modern commuting. Before we dive into the specifics, if you’re looking for an upside with less volatility than holding a single stock like ACHR, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. What’s the reason? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it has been a smoother ride, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, see – What’s Behind The Surge In Broadcom’s Stock? Multiple factors are coming together to create a perfect scenario for massive growth: Let’s crunch the numbers on what substantial adoption entails. If Archer scales up to producing 2,000 units per year—feasible in a mature market serving major global cities—that signifies $10 billion in yearly revenue. With a 30% cash profit margin, you’re looking at $3 billion in annual profits. Using a reasonable 30x earnings multiple, this scenario values the company at $90 billion. That’s 10 times larger than the current $9 billion market cap. This isn’t about replacing every car journey—it’s about seizing the premium mobility market in high-density urban areas where time savings warrant higher costs. Consider business travelers, airport connections, emergency services, and ultimately, everyday commuters who prioritize time over cost. Fast-forward a decade, and we could potentially witness millions of air taxi rides globally. Just as Uber revolutionized ground transportation by making it accessible and convenient, eVTOL services could fundamentally alter how people navigate cities. The total addressable market stretches far beyond current transportation spending. By eliminating commute times, productivity and lifestyle enhancements unlock value that individuals are willing to pay premium prices for access. Business districts, airports, suburban-to-urban connections, and intercity travel all represent significant revenue opportunities. Of course, this transformation isn’t assured. Several factors could greatly impede growth: Keep in mind, investing in an individual stock without thorough analysis can carry risks. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for investors. What’s the reason? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks allowed for responsiveness to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Archer Aviation stands at a pivotal juncture where technological capability, market demand, and regulatory frameworks are converging. The company's current valuation reflects early-stage execution risks, but the potential upside is truly remarkable. We aren’t just discussing a new product—we might be witnessing the emergence of an entirely new category of human mobility. For investors willing to accept the inherent risks of pioneering technology, Archer offers a rare opportunity to engage in what could develop into one of the most significant growth narratives of the coming decade. The question is not whether urban air mobility will materialize—it’s whether Archer can execute effectively enough to capture a substantial share of what promises to be a multi-trillion-dollar market opportunity.
