A small percentage of species in the fungal kingdom can cause devastating infections in humans, with Candida albicans reigning as a leading cause of systemic disease. One of the key virulence phenotypes for pathogenic fungi is the ability to survive at host body temperature; however, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate thermal adaptation in fungi remains incomplete. In this study, we expand the largest functional genomics resource in C. albicans, reaching 71.3% coverage of the entire genome, and perform screens under six different temperatures to identify genes important for temperature-dependent fitness. We describe the function of genes involved in translation (GAR1), splicing (C1_11680C or YSF3), and cell cycle progression (C6_00110C or RHT1) in enabling fungal survival at both low and high temperatures. Through experimental evolution, we also show that C. albicans can rapidly overcome deleterious mutations and adapt to extreme temperature environments. Overall, our study highlights the transformative potential of genome-wide functional genomics to uncover critical vulnerabilities in pathogenic fungi.

Among the estimated 5 million fungal species, only a few hundred can cause infections in humans [2]. One of the major barriers restricting fungal species from becoming human pathogens is the ability to grow at human physiological temperature [3]. However, climate change has been implicated in enabling thermal adaptation in fungi, facilitating geographical spread of endemic fungal diseases, and expanding the human fungal pathogen repertoire [4,5]. For example, higher global temperatures have been suggested to promote the spread of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus deuterogattii, which is more thermotolerant than other species in the same Cryptococcus gattii species complex [6,7]. Another emerging fungal pathogen, Candida auris, first identified from an ear infection in 2009 in Japan, is now a significant public health concern causing nosocomial outbreaks in hospitals globally [8,9]. Importantly, the global emergence of C. auris as a human pathogen is hypothesized to stem from adaptations driven by climate change, allowing it to transition from historically environmental niches to human hosts [10]. Thus, understanding how fungi adapt to extreme temperatures is critical to understand how these species spread and cause disease in human hosts. Deviation from optimal growth temperatures at times induces a temperature shock that disrupts protein homeostasis, challenges cellular physiological state, and jeopardizes fungal survival [11]. In response to temperature upshifts, fungal cells employ a conserved heat shock response, involving reprogramming of gene expression to repress protein biosynthesis and up-regulating cytoprotective heat shock protein-encoding genes. Two of the key players in that response are heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1), which are conserved from yeasts to humans. In the commensal fungal pathogen Candida albicans, the Hsf1-Hsp90 autoregulatory circuit governs the cellular transcriptional response to heat stress [12]. Upon transient heat shock, C. albicans cells rapidly up-regulate over 12% of the genome in an Hsp90-dependent manner with gene functions enriched in the unfolded protein response, proteasome/ubiquitination, oxidative stress response, cell cycle, biofilm formation, and pathogenesis [13]. Hsp90 orchestrates this transcriptional response by modulating chromatin nucleosome positioning enabling transcriptional regulation by Hsf1 [13]. Additional cellular stress response pathways are implicated in tolerance to extreme temperatures as well. In the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, calcineurin, a conserved calcium-calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine-specific phosphatase modulates heat stress to enable cell survival, and the cold stress response is regulated by the phosphatase Gpp2, a target of the Hog pathway [14–17]. Furthermore, biofilms, or surface-associated communities, have been shown to enhance fungal tolerance to both heat and cold stresses [18]. Due to the pleiotropic effects of these temperature shock defense mechanisms, heat/cold stress adaptation is often accompanied by broader physiological changes, leading to alterations in the cell cycle, transcription, translation, and metabolic processes, which can enhance the potential for fungal pathogenesis [4,11]. With the growing threat of fungal pathogens to human health, the antifungal arsenal remains limited, consisting of only three major classes of antifungal drugs (polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins) targeting essential functions [19]. Unfortunately, each of these antifungal classes is limited by significant host toxicity issues, limited spectrum of activity, and/or the frequent development of resistance [20]. Moreover, heat stress has been shown to induce aneuploidy formation in all major fungal pathogens, including C. albicans, to enable antifungal drug tolerance and resistance [21]. Amid the threat of climate change, fungal pathogens are primed to gain the upper hand in the ongoing antifungal arms race, highlighting the urgency in understanding fungal thermal adaptation. In C. albicans, genetic mutant libraries have enabled large-scale functional genomic screens to identify and characterize genes that govern fungal survival, virulence, and pathogenesis [22–27]. One of the largest functional genomic resources in C. albicans is the Gene Replacement and Conditional Expression (GRACE) collection consisting of heterozygous deletion mutants, where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele is regulated by a doxycycline (DOX)-repressible promoter [23]. Upon its original release, this collection consisted of mutants representing 2,326 genes or ~37% of the 6,198 genes in the C. albicans genome [23]. Genomic coverage increased to 48% with the release of an expanded set of mutants representing 866 genes (GRACEv2) [25]. However, despite the instrumental role this collection has made in furthering our understanding of C. albicans biology [27], over half of the genome has yet to be investigated to identify genes required for important biological traits, including growth at extreme temperatures. Here, we introduce the expansion of GRACE mutants, bringing the cumulative coverage of the GRACE library to 71.3% of the C. albicans genome. Screening of the expanded GRACE library at multiple temperatures identified hundreds of genes that are important for fitness, many of which were selectively required for growth at extreme temperatures. Through the integration of phenotypic clustering, structural similarity analyses, and experimental evolution, we described the function of genes involved in translation (GAR1), splicing (C1_11680C or YSF3), and cell cycle progression (C6_00110C or RHT1). Furthermore, through experimental evolution, we showed that C. albicans can rapidly overcome deleterious mutations via diverse mechanisms in response to high temperature. Overall, this work significantly expands a critical functional genomics resource in C. albicans and characterizes the function of unknown genes with temperature-dependent importance for fitness in this human fungal pathogen. Despite the clinical importance of C. albicans, our understanding of this fungal pathogen remains incomplete due to a lack of comprehensive mutant collections to interrogate gene function. Thus, we first sought to expand the GRACE collection to improve genome coverage. Specifically, C. albicans heterozygous deletion mutants marked with strain-specific molecular barcodes [23] were transformed with a DNA construct consisting of a nourseothricin (NAT)-resistance marker, a DOX-repressible promoter, and homologous sequences to drive homologous recombination immediately upstream of the start codon of the target gene of the remaining allele (Fig 1A). Through this approach, we generated 1,240 novel GRACE strains (GRACEv3) representing 1,228 genes absent from the previous two iterations, expanding genome coverage of this collection from ~48% to ~71% (Fig 1B). For those strains present in the GRACE collection, genes were grouped into broad categories based on manual curation of their annotation status from the Candida Genome Database (CGD) in the gene ontology category of “biological process” [28]. Specifically, genes were determined to have been annotated (i) directly with experimental characterization in C. albicans, (ii) indirectly with conservation in sequence and/or protein domains to other fungal species, or (iii) unannotated based on evidence codes denoting the type of experiments or prediction data presented to support functional annotations. Construction of GRACEv1 and v2 libraries was guided by orthologous gene functions covering all major biological processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Thus, unannotated genes only make up 11.6% and 15.4% of genes in these two iterations [23,25] (Figs 1B and S1A). In contrast, the construction of GRACEv3 library was not guided by gene functions in S. cerevisiae, resulting in the inclusion of 375 genes (30.6%) lacking functional annotations (Figs 1B and S1A). The remaining ~50% of unannotated genes in the C. albicans genome will benefit from continued efforts of library expansion. A) Schematic of GRACE mutant construction.

To do so, the arrayed GRACEv3 library was grown in liquid culture with a high concentration (100 μg/mL) of DOX before transferring onto solid medium containing 100 μg/mL DOX in technical duplicate to ensure maximum transcriptional repression. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. Colony images were scored independently by two researchers from 0 to 4, with 4 representing no growth and 0 representing growth comparable to wild type [25] (Figs 1C and S1B). Given the importance of thermotolerance for the success of C. albicans as a human fungal pathogen, we also screened the entire GRACE collection (v1, v2, and v3) for growth at elevated temperature (39 °C) using an analogous approach. Screening results for the GRACEv3 collection at 30 °C were compiled alongside previous results from the v1 and v2 collections [25] and compared to those obtained at 39 °C. This revealed 793 and 887 genes that were important for C. albicans fitness at 30 and 39 °C, respectively, with 734 genes that were important at both temperatures (essentiality score >1, Figs 1C and S1C). To further interrogate the role of temperature in C. albicans fitness, we arrayed 947 strains that showed moderate to severe growth defects (average score > 1 in the presence of DOX) in our initial screen (Fig 1C). To avoid preselection for genes important for fitness during adaptation to DOX suppression, mutants were grown overnight in liquid culture in the absence or presence of 0.5 µg/mL DOX at 30 °C. Mutants were then spotted onto agar plates in the presence and absence of 100 µg/mL DOX and incubated at six different temperatures (16, 22, 30, 37, 39, and 40.5 °C). At the respective timepoints, plates were imaged, and growth of mutants was scored independently by three individuals and averaged to obtain a final growth score for each mutant (S1D Fig and S1 Data). Compared to the 887 strains that were annotated with an essentiality score >1 at 39 °C in the initial screen, 648 strains scored >1 at 39 °C in the secondary screen, suggesting lower DOX pretreatment enabled a more fine-tuned assessment of genes important for fitness at different temperatures (S1 Data). Mutants were then organized by hierarchical clustering of growth scores across screened temperatures to identify clusters of genes with minimal to moderate importance for growth (cluster 4), as well as temperature-independent (cluster 1), heat-sensitive (clusters 2 and 6), cold-sensitive (cluster 3), and extreme temperature-sensitive (cluster 5) phenotypes (Fig 1D). To identify functional enrichment within each cluster, gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using the 947 genes screened as the background (Fig 1E). As expected, mutants displaying temperature-independent essentiality (cluster 1) were enriched for core biological processes like ‘translation’ and ‘protein metabolic process’, which are indispensable for survival. Cold tolerance genes (cluster 3) showed significant enrichment of various RNA metabolism and regulatory-related processes. Additionally, the GO term “filamentation in response to pH” was enriched in cluster 5, which consisted of genes essential for survival at both low and high temperatures. Finally, genes grouped together based on essentiality at extreme high temperatures (cluster 6) were enriched for functions related to cell cycle, filamentation, and stress response, biological processes previously shown to be important for thermotolerance [13,29]. Overall, this highlights that genes involved in similar biological processes often cluster together based on growth phenotypes at different temperatures. The findings from our functional genomic screen revealed a distinct set of genes required for growth, particularly at elevated temperature, many of which were uncharacterized or poorly characterized based on S. cerevisiae orthologs. One of these genes from cluster 6 was the putative H/ACA snoRNP pseudouridylation complex protein, Gar1. Pseudouridylation is the most abundant RNA modification in noncoding RNAs in all living organisms and plays essential roles in transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) functions [30]. To verify the importance of GAR1 for C. albicans growth at elevated temperature, we performed spot dilution assays with the tetO-GAR1/Δ strain in the absence and presence of DOX and observed a severe growth defect at all temperatures tested upon DOX-mediated transcriptional repression, particularly at 22 and 40.5 °C (Figs 2A and S2A). To confirm the importance of GAR1 for C. albicans fitness, a homozygous deletion mutant was constructed and assessed for growth at different temperatures. Similar to the GRACE strain, spot dilution assay confirmed the importance of this gene for C. albicans fitness, particularly at 40.5 °C where no growth was observed for the deletion mutant. Complementation of the deletion mutant with two wild-type alleles (GAR1A/A) resulted in growth phenotypes similar to wild type (Fig 2B). A) Strains were grown overnight in YPD with or without 0.05 µg/mL DOX and spotted in 10-fold dilutions starting from an OD600 of 0.8 onto YPD with or without 100 µg/mL DOX.

D) Overnight cultures were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.1 in SD medium and grown at 30 °C for 4 h.

A l-homopropargylglycine (HPG) alkyne methionine analog was added, and cells were fixed. An azide fluorophore was added, and cells were imaged on the GFP channel to detect translation activity. Wild-type cells without HPG were used as no-signal control. Scale bar represents 10 µm.

The data underlying Fig 2C, 2D and 2G can be found in S1 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003409.g002 In S. cerevisiae, the box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex converts uridine into pseudouridine in rRNAs and consists of four core proteins (Cbf5, Nop10, Nhp2, and Gar1), one RNA-binding protein (Naf1), and one chaperone (Shq1) [31–33]. Spot dilution assays confirmed the importance of the C. albicans core genes for growth at all temperatures. In contrast, the chaperone SHQ1 had the least impact on fitness across all temperatures compared to other genes of the box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex (S2A and S3 Figs). These observations suggest Gar1 may be partially dispensable for complex function under optimal conditions, but becomes absolutely required at extreme temperatures. The box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex is important for rRNA pseudouridylation modifications and maturation in S. cerevisiae [33,34]. To investigate the role of Gar1 in C. albicans, we quantified the presence of precursor internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) by qRT-PCR. During rRNA maturation, ITS1 and ITS2 are cleaved from precursor rRNAs to form mature 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs [35]. Deletion of GAR1 resulted in significant increases in ITS1 and ITS2 relative to wild-type and complemented strains (Fig 2C), similar to what was observed upon depletion of the core H/ACA ribonucleoprotein CBF5 (S2A and S2B Fig), supporting a role of Gar1 in rRNA maturation (Fig 2C). Defects in rRNA maturation ultimately result in impaired translation [36]. Hence, we performed a fluorescence-based assay to monitor translation activity in the presence or absence of GAR1 [37]. An alkynylated methionine analog, l-homopropargylglycine (HPG), was used to label newly synthesized proteins, and a click reaction of the alkyne with a fluorescent azide provided a fluorescent readout of the translation activity. Treatment of wild-type cells with the translation inhibitor anisomycin or deletion of GAR1 reduced the fluorescent signal compared to wild type or the complemented control. Wild-type cells treated with the non-translation inhibitor fluconazole did not show reduced fluorescent signal, confirming the reduction in fluorescence intensity was not simply due to reduced cell growth (Fig 2D). To further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying Gar1’s role in temperature-dependent essentiality, we devised a selection strategy to identify mutants with a restored ability to grow at elevated temperature. To this end, we plated 108 gar1Δ/Δ cells on agar plates, incubated the cells at 42 °C for 14 days, and successfully isolated one bypass mutant (ByM1) that was able to grow at 40.5 °C (Figs 2B and S4A) and partially restored ITS1 and ITS2 to wild-type-like levels (Fig 2C). Whole genome sequencing analysis of the evolved mutant showed no aneuploidy or copy number variation in comparison to the reference SC5314 genome or compared to the gar1 mutant from which it was derived (Fig 2E). Variant calling identified a mutation in KRR1 in the LOH region (cyan) on Chr1 at position 109, resulting in an amino acid substitution at position 37 from glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K). KRR1 encodes a nucleolar protein functioning in the 90S pre-ribosome facilitating pre-rRNA cleavage during rRNA maturation [38]. To confirm this substitution was sufficient for the restored growth observed at elevated temperature, we replaced both KRR1 alleles in the gar1 mutant with those identified in ByM1 (Krr1E37K) and confirmed this strain was able to grow at high temperature (Fig 2F). To confirm this substitution was necessary for the growth at elevated temperatures, we replaced both KRR1 alleles in ByM1 with those from the parental gar1 mutant (Krr1K37E), which resulted in a loss of growth at 40.5 °C (Fig 2F). Finally, we evaluated whether the temperature-dependent essentiality of GAR1 plays a role in virulence using the wax moth Galleria mellonella model at both 28 and 39 °C [27]. This invertebrate model has successfully been used to study C. albicans pathogenesis and highlight those genes important for C. albicans virulence in a temperature-dependent manner [27,39]. We infected larvae by proleg injection with wild-type, gar1Δ/Δ, or complemented strains and incubated the G. mellonella at 28 or 39 °C. Deletion of GAR1 significantly attenuated virulence at both temperatures compared to wild-type and the complemented strain with a greater significance at 39 °C, confirming the importance of Gar1 in C. albicans pathogenesis in vivo, especially at human febrile temperature (Fig 2G). Overall, these experiments support the role of Gar1 in thermal tolerance and highlight the increased dependency on translation and rRNA processing at elevated temperature for C. albicans. While the ability of C. albicans to survive within the human host requires it to thrive at physiological and febrile temperatures, this organism also causes a significant number of chronic mucocutaneous infections on the skin, nails, and other mucous membranes, and can survive on different environmental surfaces [40,41]. This requires C. albicans to grow at temperatures below 37 °C. Thus, to investigate which genes are specifically important for growth at lower temperature (cluster 3), we focused on the uncharacterized gene C1_11680C lacking functional annotation on CGD [28]. Using spot dilution assays on YPD agar plates with and without DOX, we confirmed transcriptional repression of C1_11680C impaired fitness at all temperatures, with a more severe growth defect observed at temperatures below 37 °C (Figs 3A and S2A). While we were unable to identify a potential homolog based on DNA sequence comparisons with S. cerevisiae, BLASTp searches against S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe genomes predicted C1_11680c as a splicing factor (Ysf3) belonging to the SF3b subcomplex of the U2 snRNP [42–45]. Template modeling (TM) of the predicted C. albicans C1_11680c structure with S. cerevisiae Ysf3 and S. pombe Sap10 by AlphaFold [46] yielded TM-align [47] scores above 0.7, supporting C1_11680c as Ysf3 in C. albicans (Fig 3B). A) Spotting assay performed as described in Fig 2A.

Spot dilution assays confirmed that across all temperatures depletion of RDS3 and RSE1 had little to no impact on fitness, whereas depletion of HSH49 and HSH155 caused severe growth defects, with HSH155 being essential (S2A and S5A Figs). Interestingly, depletion of CUS1 resulted in similar growth phenotype across all temperatures tested to depletion of YSF3 (S5A Fig). This highlights the differential dependency of various splicing genes in fitness across different temperatures. To test the hypothesis that C1_11680C encodes Ysf3 and is important for C. albicans splicing, we examined the splicing efficiency of the ACT1 transcript upon depletion of YSF3. We also included the tetO-PRP19/Δ strain, as PRP19 is known to be important for splicing of ACT1 in C. albicans [49]. To avoid potential off-target effects by DOX, 20 µg/mL was used, which was sufficient to deplete YSF3 transcript levels in the tetO-YSF3/Δ GRACE strain (S5C Fig) [50]. ACT1 was efficiently spliced in the wild-type control in the absence or presence of DOX, suggesting DOX has no impact on splicing efficiency of the ACT1 transcript (Fig 3C). In the tetO-YSF3/Δ and tetO-PRP19/Δ strains, we observed an accumulation of unspliced ACT1 in the presence of DOX at both 22 and 37 °C, supporting that Ysf3 is important for splicing in C. albicans (Fig 3C). While it has been previously reported that high temperatures reduce splicing efficiency in C. albicans leading to enhanced intron retention (IR) [49], the link between low temperature (temperatures below 30 °C) and splicing efficiency has yet to be investigated. To explore the impact of low temperature on global IR and assess the importance of Ysf3 for global pre-mRNA splicing, we employed 150 bp paired-end RNA-Seq on polyadenylated RNA to map splicing of all intron-containing genes using the tetO-YSF3/Δ GRACE strain and the wild-type control in the presence and absence of 20 µg/mL DOX at both 22 and 37 °C. Principal component analysis of gene expression profiles showed that biological replicates behaved similarly and clustered together (Fig 3D). Furthermore, a significant reduction of YSF3 RNA expression upon DOX treatment led to altered gene expression profiles and the formation of distinct clusters at the two tested temperatures (Fig 3D and S2 Data). Confirming the RT-PCR results (Fig 3C), we detected increased intronic reads for ACT1 when YSF3 was depleted by DOX (S6A Fig). To assess the degree of pre-mRNA splicing globally, we performed a junction-read based analysis to estimate the fraction of IR in all 8 conditions (Fig 3E). This revealed that most introns are well spliced in wild type and the tetO-YSF3/Δ strain in the absence of DOX (median IR fraction for WT: 0.02 (22 °C)/0.04 (37 °C); for tetO-YSF3/Δ without DOX: 0.02 (22 °C)/0.05 (37 °C)) (S3 Data). A modest, but significant increase in IR was seen at 37 °C in wild type and the tetO-YSF3/Δ GRACE strain without DOX, as reported previously (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.0001****, Figs 3E and S6B) [49]. However, depletion of YSF3 at both temperatures increased IR substantially to median IR fractions of 0.43 and 0.39 at 22 °C and 37 °C, respectively (Fig 3E). IR differences upon depletion of YSF3 were similar and well correlated between all intron-containing genes at both temperatures; however, slightly more pronounced at 22 °C than at 37 °C (Fig 3F and S4 Data). According to the function of S. cerevisiae Ysf3 within the SF3b complex, we hypothesized that C. albicans Ysf3 could be involved in recognizing branchpoint sequence (BPS) and influence splicing of introns with diverse cis-regulatory features as the U2 snRNP [45,48]. To assess this, we analyzed the impact of YSF3 depletion on the accumulation of introns with diverse features, such as intron length, BPS to 3′ splice site (SS) distance, SS consensus, polypyrimidine tract length, and composition and intronic GC-content (S6C and S6D Fig and S4 Data). All features could be extracted from the annotated intronic sequence (Methods). To analyze C. albicans BPSs, we scored intronic 7-nt (nucleotide) motifs according to their similarity to the 7-nt BPS found in S. cerevisiae and also reported for C. albicans [51,52]. For most introns, a single motif close to the intron end (3′ SS) was detected, consistent with the evolutionarily conserved distance of BPS and 3′ SS [52]. For introns with multiple high-scoring 7-nt motifs, the motif was chosen that had the closest match to the typically observed distance of 15−74 nts (median 24 nts) to the 3′ SS and the higher score. As reported previously, the consensus BPS is 5′-UACUAAC-3′ and can be found in >80% of introns (S3 Data) [51,52]. Consistent with our hypothesis, IR and IR differences were increased for introns with non-consensus BPSs and for BPSs that are more distal or proximal to the 3′ SS than the typical branchpoint at both temperatures (Figs 3G and S6D). Interestingly, variation in other intronic features, such as intron length, and 5′ SS sequence also correlated with variation in IR difference (Figs 3G and S6C and S6D). This analysis suggests C. albicans Ysf3 is an important splicing factor, including for those introns that are short and/or exhibit nonconsensus cis-regulatory elements. Given the high prevalence of unspliced mRNAs upon YSF3 depletion, the incompletely processed mRNAs could produce incomplete and possibly toxic, truncated or misfolded proteins that could impact growth. Combining mRNA expression and IR estimates for all intron-containing genes passing our minimal read depth cutoffs for splicing and expression quantification, we estimated that the pool of unspliced, adenylated, and possibly translated cytoplasmic mRNAs increased 6-fold (from 4.1% to 23.9% at 22 °C) and 4-fold (from 5.2% to 20.3% at 37 °C) upon YSF3 depletion (Figs 3H and 6E and S5 Data). This could lead to an increase of prematurely terminated translation products that could be cleared by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) or require increased proteasome capacity [53,54]. Although we did not see evidence for increased expression of NMD components, genes associated with proteasomal function were increased in their expression relative to all expressed genes and enriched in the group of upregulated genes (Figs 3I, 3J, and S6F and S6 Data). Among downregulated genes, genes involved in filamentous growth and cellular responses to the environment were enriched, consistent with the previously established link between splicing and filamentation [49] (S6G Fig). Interestingly, depletion of YSF3 significantly reduced filamentation in YPD supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum at 37 °C compared to wild-type controls (S5B and S5C Fig). This phenotype was similar to what was observed upon depletion of EFG1, a transcription factor known to be required for filamentation. Overall, we conclude that CaYsf3 is important for splicing of most intron-containing genes with particular importance for short introns and/or nonconsensus cis-regulatory elements. Uncharacterized Candida clade-specific genes essential for growth can enable discovery of new biology relevant to developing antifungal treatments. Hence, we turned to a Candida clade-specific gene C6_00110C that was identified as important for growth at elevated temperature (cluster 6). As observed by spot dilution assays, transcriptional repression of C6_00110C with DOX abrogated growth only at 40.5 °C (Fig 4A). To confirm the temperature-specific essentiality phenotype, we generated a homozygous deletion mutant of C6_00110C, as well as a complemented strain. When examining the growth phenotype of these mutants, we confirmed that deletion of C6_00110C resulted in little to no growth at temperatures at or above 37 °C (Fig 4B). Thus, we named the gene Required for Heat Tolerance 1 (RHT1). BLASTp analysis, conserved domain searches, and co-expression data [55] failed to predict a function for Rht1 and AlphaFold prediction yielded a structure with low model confidence scores for the majority of the amino acids in the protein sequence (pLDDT < 70) (Fig 4C), leaving the function of this Candida-specific protein elusive. Thus, we turned to our bypass mutant selection strategy to uncover the function of this elusive gene and plated 108 rht1Δ/Δ cells on YPD agar plates and incubated at 42 °C for 5 days. Through this approach, we evolved 10 independent bypass mutants (ByMs) with a restored ability to grow at 42 °C in the absence of RHT1 (Fig 4D). Interestingly, when these ByMs were passaged at 30 °C, colonies with restored high-temperature sensitivity (ByMRs) were readily isolated (S4B Fig). ByMRs were successfully isolated for nine out of the 10 ByMs (Figs 4D and S4B). A) Spotting assay was performed as described in Fig 2A except plates were incubated for 2 days.

When examining the genomic changes of the ByMs, we observed significant chromosomal copy number changes for all ByMs. In particular, we detected trisomy of Chr1, Chr2, Chr4 and Chr5 for ByMs 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9; trisomy of Chr1, Chr2, and Chr4 for ByM3; segmental monosomy of Chr7 and ChrR for ByM4; and trisomy of Chr1 and Chr5 as well as segmental trisomy of Chr2 for ByM5 (Fig 4E). When analyzing chromosome copy numbers for ByMRs including 1R, 2R, 3R, 6R, 7R, 8R, and 9R, all strains shared the concurrent loss of Chr1 and Chr2 trisomies, despite differences in Chr3, Chr4, and Chr7 trisomies (Fig 4E). ByM4R and ByM5R gained segmental and full length Chr7 and ChrR trisomies, respectively (Fig 4E). While aneuploidies were detected for ByM10, variant-calling identified a heterozygous mutation in IML3. Iml3 was recently characterized as a C. albicans kinetochore component and is required for heat tolerance [27]. The identified mutation resulted in a substitution of leucine (L) to serine (S) at the amino acid position 67 (Fig 4F). Substitution of S back to L at position 67 in ByM10 abrogated growth at high temperature, whereas both heterozygous and homozygous substitution of L to S at position 67 in the rht1Δ/Δ background restored growth at 40.5 °C, confirming the mutation in Iml3 was both necessary and sufficient for bypassing high-temperature essentiality in rht1Δ/Δ (Fig 4F). Overall, the ploidy changes and mutation in a kinetochore gene observed in rht1Δ/Δ mutants grown at elevated temperature suggests Rht1 may be involved in chromosome segregation and/or genome stability. Given a potential role for Rht1 in genome stability, we examined whether this gene was important for cell cycle progression. Interestingly, the rht1Δ/Δ strain produced both yeast and filaments under non-filament-inducing conditions with the filaments resembling wild-type cells treated with cell cycle inhibitors hydroxyurea (HU) or nocodazole (NOC), suggesting a defect in cell cycle progression in the absence of RHT1 (Fig 5A). Furthermore in a dose-response assay, deletion of RHT1 resulted in a higher sensitivity to G1/S phase inhibitors HU and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) [56,57] and the G2/M phase inhibitor NOC [58], supporting the potential role of Rht1 in cell cycle progression (Fig 5B). Higher temperature further exacerbated sensitivity of the rht1Δ/Δ mutant to all three drugs (Fig 5B), reinforcing the greater requirement of cell cycle-related genes at high temperature. While the complemented strain fully restored tolerance to all three drugs, ByM1 and ByM10 only partially restored tolerance to HU and MMS (Fig 5B). A) Candida albicans strains were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in YPD and grown at 30 °C for 4 h. Cells treated with 25 mM hydroxyurea (HU) or 50 µM nocodazole (NOC) were used as controls. Scale bar represents 20 µm. B) Dose-response assays were performed with 2-fold titrations of hydroxyurea, nocodazole, and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) at 30 and 35 °C. OD600 was measured after 48 h, values were normalized relative to wild type without drug (see color scale bar).

(BFDR threshold = 0, average spectral counts ≥ 20, fold change relative to Eno1 ≥ 50). Protein-labeled nodes are colored based on protein function annotations.

The data underlying Fig 5B, 5D, and 5E can be found in S1 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003409.g005 Identification of protein interaction partners can provide further insights into gene function. Hence, we performed affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) of a C-terminally GFP-tagged Rht1 strain to define the protein’s interactome using Eno1-GFP as a control for background [25,27]. The homozygous tagged protein was expressed and fully rescued the rht1Δ/Δ high-temperature essentiality phenotype, confirming functionality of Rht1-GFP (S7A and S7B Fig). AP-MS identified 62 high-confidence protein interactors (Bayesian False Discovery Rate [BFDR] = 0, average spectral counts ≥20, and fold change relative to Eno1 ≥50; S7 Data). Consistent with our genetic evidence, the majority of the interactors were found to function in chromatin remodeling, DNA replication and repair, cell cycle progression, transcription, and transcription regulation (Fig 5C). A total of 29 genes encoding Rht1-interacting proteins were included in the secondary fitness screen across six different temperatures. Twelve genes were found in cluster 1 (genes important for fitness across all temperatures) and 15 genes were found in clusters 2 or 6 (genes important for fitness at elevated temperatures), including six genes encoding proteins of the Remodels the Structure of Chromatin (RSC) complex (S7C Fig). Interestingly, five of the six RSC complex members are located on Chr1 or Chr2, chromosomes that increased in copy number upon growth of the rht1 mutant at elevated temperature. The specificity of Rht1 to the Candida clade, its requirement for growth at high temperatures, and its implication in genome stability motivated assessment of its role in virulence and antifungal susceptibility. To determine the role of Rht1 in C. albicans virulence, we turned to the G. mellonella model of C. albicans infection. While injection of the wax moths with the wild-type and complemented strains resulted in profound lethality, the rht1Δ/Δ strain had significantly attenuated virulence only at 39 °C, confirming that Rht1 is required for C. albicans pathogenesis at febrile temperature (Fig 5D). Genome stability modulates fluconazole susceptibility in C. albicans [59], and therefore, we wanted to investigate whether Rht1 was important for azole activity. Dose-response assays with fluconazole showed that loss of Rht1 rendered fluconazole cidal only at 35 °C (Fig 5E). Similarly, when we performed an ETEST strip assay and disc diffusion assay by spotting 50 µg of fluconazole onto a disc placed on a lawn of C. albicans, we confirmed that Rht1 is important for azole activity at 35 °C, as the deletion mutant grew in the absence of fluconazole at 35 °C and showed enhanced clearance around the fluconazole strip or disc relative to wild type (Fig 5F and 5G). The zone of clearance remained after 5 days of incubation at 35 °C (S8A and S8B Fig). Interestingly, growth around the fluconazole disc was restored in ByM10 at 35 °C but not in ByM1 (Fig 5G), suggesting aneuploidy could not fully mask the requirement of Rht1 in fluconazole susceptibility, but the substitution in Iml3 could. Since its original release in 2003, two subsequent expansions of the GRACE library, including the set of 1,235 genes introduced in this study, have increased the total coverage to 4,492 genes [23,25], representing the largest mutant library in C. albicans. Screens of subsets of the GRACE library have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of C. albicans biology and pathogenesis mechanisms including gene essentiality [23,25], fitness in different environmental conditions [27], morphogenesis [22,24,49,60,61], adhesion [62], macrophage interactions [63], and antifungal susceptibility [64,65]. With our expanded GRACE collection, we sought to identify genes required for fitness in diverse temperatures in C. albicans by screening the collection of mutants at both low and high temperatures. Our functional genomic screen identified dozens of genes with important roles in governing C. albicans fitness in a temperature-dependent manner, including GAR1, YSF3, and RHT1. Gar1 plays an important function in pseudouridylation in S. cerevisiae. In C. albicans, deletion of GAR1 caused a severe growth defect across all temperatures tested and completely abrogated growth at 40.5 °C, indicating that GAR1 is important for fungal survival. Interestingly, the nonsynonymous mutation in KRR1 was able to compensate for the fitness defect of the gar1Δ/Δ strain. Krr1 functions in protein and RNA binding via two KH domains for ribosome assembly [66]. The nonsynonymous mutation in the evolved mutant is located in the first KH domain, which lacks the typical GXXG RNA-binding motif [67]. The mutation could either directly or indirectly prime Cbf5 for its catalytic activity in the absence of Gar1. Supporting this hypothesis, Krr1 was shown to physically interact with Cbf5 in multiple studies in S. cerevisiae [38,66,68–70]. In S. cerevisiae, a point mutation in the conserved XLD motif of CBF5 abolishes its pseudouridine synthase activity and eliminates rRNA pseudouridylation, but the mutant remains viable [71]. Thus, whether Gar1 and Krr1 impact temperature-dependent growth via rRNA pseudouridylation in C. albicans remains to be elucidated. Initially thought to be an obligate human commensal fungal pathogen, C. albicans has been found to persist in the environment [72–74], expanding its thermal adaptation range. In this study, we showed that genes in cluster 3 are enriched in RNA metabolic processes and rRNA processes, and they are important for tolerance to temperatures lower than the host temperature of 37 °C. C1_11680C grouped with cluster 3 in the secondary screen, and spot dilution assays confirmed that C1_11680C depletion resulted in no growth at 16 °C and severe growth defects at all other temperatures. Functional characterization of C1_11680C revealed that the gene likely encodes Ysf3, a component of the SF3b complex required for splicing. RNA-sequencing analyses at 22 and 37 °C showed that depletion of YSF3 reduced the efficiency of pre-mRNA splicing, likely increasing the translation of truncated proteins. The effect was slightly stronger at the lower temperature, correlating with a more pronounced growth phenotype at this condition. The high protein structure similarity of C. albicans Ysf3 to S. cerevisiae Ysf3 coupled with the reduced splicing efficiency upon YSF3 depletion suggests that Ysf3 has an important role for splicing in C. albicans. However, future studies are needed to experimentally confirm its function as part of the Sf3b complex and its possible involvement in BP recognition. Among the 30.6% of genes without functional annotation in the GRACEv3 collection is C6_00110C (RHT1), which we identified as a gene required for C. albicans fitness at high temperature. Compared with the gar1Δ/Δ strain, the rht1Δ/Δ strain exhibited an astonishing capacity to evolve bypass mutants, overcoming the fitness defect of the strain at elevated temperatures. Nine out of the 10 bypass mutants were driven by aneuploidy, and seven shared Chr1 and Chr2 trisomies. Interestingly, all seven bypass mutants lost Chr1 and Chr2 trisomies when passaged at a lower temperature, suggesting Chr1 and Chr2 trisomy may contribute to the bypass mechanism. The dynamic ploidy changes observed at different temperatures in rht1Δ/Δ mutants suggest that Rht1 may play a role in maintaining genome stability; however, the temperature-dependent effects of Rht1 on genome stability remain to be elucidated. Among the 62 high-confidence Rht1 interactors, 10 proteins function in the RSC chromatin remodeling complex and 8 are encoded by genes located on Chr1 and Chr2 [75]. It is possible that in rht1Δ/Δ mutants, upregulation of RSC complex genes on Chr1 and Chr2 could enhance chromatin remodeling activities. Supporting this hypothesis, experimental evolution for high temperature survival identified mutations in the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex that enables thermal adaptation in S. cerevisiae [76]. However, additional experiments are warranted to confirm this model. The evolvability of bypass mutants in the rht1 background highlights that C. albicans is able to employ diverse mechanisms in mitigating environmentally contingent detrimental mutations. Such phenomena have also been described in C. albicans when examining the ability of this species to evolve resistance to the azoles [59]. Aneuploidy formation, in particular, isochromosome formation on the left arm of chromosome 5, drives fluconazole resistance [59,77,78]. Chromosome 5 contains ERG11 and TAC1, encoding the fluconazole target and a transcription factor regulating drug efflux pumps [79]. Interestingly, the aneuploidy identified in ByM1 failed to restore azole susceptibility despite the increased copy number of Chr5. In contrast, the evolved mutation in IML3 identified in ByM10 largely restored fungal viability in the presence of fluconazole, suggesting Rht1 likely exerts pleiotropic functions that regulate fitness at elevated temperature and azole exposure. Identification of Rht1 as a novel Candida clade-specific gene required for heat tolerance and virulence highlights the power of functional genomic screens to advance our understanding of C. albicans biology and the importance of continuous expansion efforts to reach whole-genome coverage. Despite our functional characterizations of Rht1, the exact molecular mechanism underlying its role in cell cycle progression and genome stability remains elusive. Interestingly, the functionally relevant kinetochore protein Iml3, implicated by bypass mutant selection, was not present in the Rht1 interactome elucidated by AP-MS. Similarly, close examination of the Iml3 interactome failed to identify Rht1 [27], suggesting a lack of physical interaction between the two proteins. Additional experiments are warranted to pinpoint Rht1’s functional link with the C. albicans kinetochore. Overall, our work characterized genes required for fitness in diverse temperature environments for the major fungal pathogen C. albicans. While connections between temperature and antifungal resistance have been described in the literature [80], more examples continue to be unveiled. In the recently discovered fungal pathogen Rhodsporidiobolus fluvialis, human body temperature elevates mutation rates and drives pan-drug resistance against all three classes of antifungal drugs [81,82]. In Cryptococcus deneoformans, heat stress enhances transposon mobility, which may enable adaptation during infection [83,84]. Thus, it is crucial to continue to probe the mechanisms by which thermal tolerance enables antifungal resistance to disarm fungal threats. Strains used in this study are listed in S1 Table. Plasmids used in this study are listed in S2 Table. Strains were frozen in 25% glycerol at −80 °C for long-term storage. Active cultures were maintained on solid yeast extract peptone (YPD; 1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose, and 2% agar) at 4 °C for no longer than 1 month. Liquid cultures were grown in YPD at 30 °C, unless otherwise indicated. To select for NAT-resistant mutants, NAT (Jena Bioscience, 96736-11-7) was solubilized in water and supplemented into YPD agar plates (150–250 μg/mL). Prototrophic colonies were selected on SD plates (0.674% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids with ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and 2% agar). Temperature-dependent fitness screens were performed using minimal medium plates (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and without ammonium sulfate, with 2% glucose, 0.1% glutamic acid (MSG), 0.002% histidine, and 2% agar). DOX (Bio Basic, DB0889) stock was prepared at a concentration of 50 mg/mL in H2O, filter-sterilized, and added to the media at the indicated concentration. All genes in the C. albicans genome were analyzed for GO annotations by biological functions on CGD website [28]. Genes with GO terms assigned with codes IC (inferred by curator), IDA (inferred by direct assay), IEP (inferred from expression pattern), IGI (inferred from genetic interaction) in C. albicans, IMP (inferred from mutant phenotype), IPI (inferred from physical interaction), and TAS (traceable author statement) were categorized in the “experimentally characterized” group. Genes with GO terms assigned based on evidence in S. cerevisiae with codes IEA (inferred from electronic annotation), IGI, ISA (inferred from sequence alignment), ISM (inferred from sequence model), ISO (inferred from sequence orthology), and ISS (inferred from sequence or structural similarity) were categorized in the “putative based on S. cerevisiae ortholog” group. Genes with GO terms assigned based on evidence in S. pombe with code IEA were categorized in the ‘putative based on S. pombe ortholog’ group. Genes with GO terms assigned based on evidence in other fungal species with codes IEA, ISA, ISO, and ISS were categorized in the ‘putative based on other fungal species’ group. Genes with GO terms assigned based on conserved protein domains with codes IEA were categorized in the “putative based on conserved protein domains” group. Genes with GO terms assigned codes ISA based on nonfungal species, ISM, and NAS (nontraceable author statement) were categorized in the ‘other’ group. Genes with no GO terms assigned were categorized in the “no data available” group.

C. albicans GRACE strains in the GRACEv3 library were screened for growth at 30 °C, as previously described [25]. Briefly, GRACE strains were pinned into 96-well plates (Sarstedt) containing liquid YPD medium and grown overnight at 30 °C. The next day, cells were transferred into liquid YPD medium in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX in technical duplicates and grown at 30 °C overnight. Approximately 2 μL of cultures were then transferred onto minimal media agar plates in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX using a metal replicator and grown for 2 days 30 °C. The plates were imaged on a ChemiDoc, and growth fitness was scored independently by two people, using the scoring system outlined in Fig 1C. The entire GRACE library was screened for growth fitness at 39 °C following the same screening pipeline except that cells were grown on minimal media agar plates in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX at 39 °C (S1B Fig). C. albicans GRACE strains with a fitness score above 1 in the presence of DOX from the growth screens at 30 and 39 °C were prioritized for a secondary screen at six temperatures (S1D Fig). 947 strains were arrayed and pinned into 96-well plates (Sarstedt) containing liquid minimal medium in the absence and presence of 0.5 µg/mL DOX and grown overnight at 30 °C. The next day, 5 µL of mixed cells were diluted in 95 µL H2O and then 5 µL diluted cells were inoculated onto minimal media agar plates in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX using a multi-channel pipettor and grown for 10 days at 16 °C, 4 days at 22 °C, 2 days at 30 °C, 2 days at 37 °C, 3 days at 39 °C, and 4 days at 40.5 °C. The plates were imaged on a ChemiDoc, and growth was scored independently by three people, using the scoring system outlined in Fig 1C. Four biological replicates were performed for growth screens at 16 and 22 °C, and three biological replicates were performed for growth screens at 30, 37, 39, and 40.5 °C. Genes represented by the 947 strains screened at the six distinct temperatures were clustered based on fitness scores in six temperatures by Euclidean distance (k = 6). GO enrichment analysis was performed using CGD for genes in each cluster against the background of 947 genes screened. P-value was adjusted by false discovery rate (FDR), and only terms with p-adjusted values greater than 0.05 were plotted. Count represents the total number of genes assigned to a given GO term. Blast analyses were performed for C1_11680C and C6_00110C DNA and protein sequences using NCBI (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) [89], FungiDB (https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app/workspace/blast/new) [90], and SGD (https://www.yeastgenome.org/blast-sgd) [91] blast tools. AlphaFold [46] predicted structures were obtained from UniProt31 Website (https://www.uniprot.org/). Similarity between pairs of protein structures was assessed through TM-Align (https://zhanggroup.org/TM-align/) [47]. Wild-type and GRACE strains were grown in YPD in the absence and presence of 0.05 µg/mL DOX overnight at 30 °C. Aliquots of each overnight culture (1 mL) were washed once in H2O and diluted to an OD600 of 0.8. Cells were 10-fold serially diluted four times in H2O in a 96-well plate and 3 µL of cells from each dilution were spotted on YPD agar in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX. Cells from YPD overnight were spotted on YPD agar and cells from YPD supplemented with 0.05 µg/mL DOX overnight were spotted on YPD agar supplemented with 100 µg/mL DOX. YPD agar plates for box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex and SF3b complex GRACE strains were grown for 5 days at 30 °C. YPD agar plates for the tetO-RHT1/Δ GRACE strain were grown for 2 days at 30 °C. Spot dilution assays were performed the same way for wild type, deletion mutant, complemented strains, and bypass mutants without DOX. To evolve bypass mutants, single colonies were cultured in 3 mL YPD under shaking conditions at 30 °C for 48 h and 24 h for CaLC10712 and CaLC10720, respectively. Cells were washed once in H2O and 108 cells were plated on YPD agar media and incubated at 42 °C for 2 weeks and 5 days, respectively. Colonies were propagated on YPD agar and grown at 30 °C to isolate single colonies. A single colony was used to validate bypass phenotype, isolate genomic DNA extraction, and archive in 25% glycerol for −80 °C storage. For rht1Δ/Δ bypass mutants, lineages with restored high temperature sensitivity were obtained from the YPD agar plate during isolation for single colonies (S4 Fig). To confirm DOX-dependent transcriptional repression, wild-type and GRACE strains were grown in YPD in the absence and presence of 0.05 µg/mL DOX overnight at 30 °C, shaking. The next day, the cultures were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in 10 mL YPD in the absence and presence of 100 µg/mL DOX and grown for 4 h at 30 °C. GRACE mutants for essential genes were sub-cultured to an OD600 between 0.3 and 0.4 in 10 mL YPD in the presence of 100 µg/mL DOX for 4 h at 30 °C. To confirm DOX-dependent transcriptional repression for YSF3 and EFG1 GRACE strains used in the filamentation assay, cells were grown as above except on the second day, cells were sub-cultured in YPD in the absence and presence of 20 µg/mL DOX. For ITS1 and ITS2 quantification, overnight cultures of wild-type, gar1Δ/Δ, GAR1A/A, and gar1Δ/Δ ByM1 strains were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in 10 mL YPD and grown for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted, washed once with cold H2O, flash frozen, and stored at −80°C. Cells were lysed by bead beating four times for 30 s, with one minute on ice between. RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN Rneasy kit and Dnase-treated using the Invitrogen DNA-free DNA removal kit. cDNA synthesis was performed using the iScript cDNA synthesis Kit (Biorad). Standard curve was performed for each pair of primers using wild-type samples to determine the optimal cDNA dilutions for qRT-PCR. cDNAs were diluted 80-fold for expression analysis and 800-fold for ITS1 and ITS2 level quantification. qRT-PCR was performed in technical triplicate with a 10 µL reaction volume in a 384-well plate, using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the BioRad CFX-384 Real Time System. The following cycling conditions were used: 95 °C for 3 min, then 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s, for 40 cycles. The melt curve was completed with the following cycle conditions: 95 °C for 10 s and 65 °C for 10 s with an increase of 0.5 °C per cycle up to 95 °C. The primers used to monitor expression are listed in S8 Data. The fluorescent translation assay was performed with the Click-iT HPG Alexa Fluor 488 Protein Synthesis Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher C10428), as previously described [37]. Overnights of SC5314, CaLC10712, and CaLC10713 were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 into 5 mL synthetic defined (SD) medium without amino acids, without ammonium sulfate supplemented with 2% glucose, monosodium glutamate, and uridine and grown at 30 °C, shaking, for 4 h. For positive and negative controls, 1 mL aliquots of SC5314 cells were spun down, and the pellet was resuspended in SD with 100 µM anisomycin or 4 µg/mL fluconazole, and the cultures were incubated under shaking conditions at 30 °C for 10 min. One milliliter aliquots of each sample and drug-treated SC5314 cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 mL of SD with l-HPG at 1:1,000 dilution. SC5314 cells resuspended in SD without HPG were used as the no-HPG control. All samples were incubated at 30 °C, shaking, for 30 min. Cells were spun down, supernatant removed, and pellets washed once with 1× PBS before being resuspended in 500 µL PBS. Cells were fixed by adding 500 µL 70% ethanol in 1× PBS and rocking for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then pelleted and washed twice with 3% BSA in PBS. Pellets were resuspended with 500 µL of the reaction cocktail containing the azide fluorophore (prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol) and incubated for 30 min, shaking in the dark. The samples were washed once with the rinse buffer, pelleted, and resuspended in 20 µL of 1× PBS. Cells were imaged by differential interference contrast microscopy and the EGFP channel on a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 at the same exposure time and analyzed using a CytoFlex flow cytometer (Backman Coulter) to quantify fluorescence intensity. A total of 20,000 events were documented and median fluorescein isothiocyanate value was determined using the CytExpert software. Drug susceptibility was measured using a modified broth microdilution protocol in 96-well plates (Sarstedt) format, as previously described [92]. Drugs fluconazole, HU, NOC, and MMS were tested in liquid YPD. Cultures were grown in 2-fold dilutions of drug for 48 h as indicated. To assess cidality, 5 µL of mixed cultures were pipetted onto YPD agar following OD600 measurements, and the agar plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Data were displayed quantitatively as heat maps using Java TreeView software (version 1.1.6r4). Reported results are representative of two independent experiments, each performed in technical duplicate. Genomic DNA was isolated using the phenol-chloroform extraction method as previously described [78]. Libraries were prepared using NEB Ultra II FS DNA Kit and sequenced with Illumina Novaseq X Plus PE150bp to obtain 50–1,000× coverage. Sequencing data were processed as previously described, with minor modifications [77,93]. For genomes with 1,000× coverage, quality control and trimming were performed using fastp (v0.23.4) [94] with minimum qualified phred quality of 20, a 40% limit on unqualified bases, a mean quality requirement of 20, a cut window size of 5, both front and tail cutting, and with correction enabled. For genomes with 50–100× coverage, adaptor sequences and low-quality reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v0.39 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36 TORPHRED33) [95]. Trimmed reads were aligned to the C. albicans reference genome (SC5314_version_A21-s02-m09-r10) [28] using BWA-MEM (v.0.7.17) [96] with default parameters. Aligned reads were sorted, duplicate reads were marked, and the resulting BAM file was indexed with Samtools (v.1.17) [97] and picard (RRID:SCR_006525, v.2.26.3). The quality of trimmed FASTQ and BAM files was assessed with FastQC (v.0.12.1) [98] and Qualimap (v.2.2.1) [99]. Chromosome copy number changes were visualized using the Yeast Mapping Analysis Pipeline (YMAP v.1.0) [100]. Aligned BAM files were uploaded to YMAP and mapped to the reference genome C. albicans SC5314 (A21-S02-m09-r10) with GC-content bias correction for read-depth. Read depth along the x axis indicating chromosome position (Chr1–ChrR) was plotted as the log2 ration that was converted to 0–4 as the y axis indicating chromosome copy number [100]. Haplotypes are color-coded with gray, magenta, and cyan indicating heterozygous AB, homozygous B, and homozygous A, respectively. Variant calling and filtering were performed for bypass mutants that failed to revert with Mutect2 and FilterMutectCalls within the GATK package (v.4.6.1.0) [101]. Pairwise variant calling was run for each bypass mutant and its parental strain with the bypass mutant as “tumor” and the parental strain as “normal” using the reference genome C. albicans SC5314 (A21-S02-m09-r10). The resulting VCF files were further filtered using bcftools (v.1.21) [97]. Specifically, the parental strain was removed from the VCF file and variant calls were filtered for a quality status of “PASS“ and exclusion of calls in repeat regions as marked in (SC5314 v.A21-s02-m09-r10_features.gff) and 5,000 bp subtelomeric regions. Hard filtering was performed with the following parameters: minimum of 5 supporting reads, at least one supporting read in both forward and reverse direction, minimum alternate allele frequency of 0.2. Identified variants were compared among bypass mutants and only unique calls were kept. Variants were annotated with SnpEff (v.4.3t; database built from SC5314 v.A21-s02-m09-r10, with alternate yeast nuclear codon table) [102], formatted using bcftools [97], and verified in IGV [103,104]. Verified variants were compiled into S3 Table. A Galleria mellonella larvae model of infection was performed to test C. albicans temperature-dependent virulence as previously described [27]. Briefly, wild type (SC5314), deletion mutants, and complemented strains were grown overnight shaking in YPD at 30 °C. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer to prepare inoculum of 1 × 108 cells per mL. Trypan blue was added to all inoculum stocks to a final concentration of 0.04% as a visual indicator of proper injection in the larvae. Larvae were screened using a weight filter of 230–300 mg and lack of dark spots indicative of injury and visible signs of pupation. Twenty larvae per group were injected in the last left proleg with 1 × 106 cells in a 10 μL volume using a 500 μL gas-tight 1750 series syringe (Hamilton, Ref: CAL81230) with the PB600 repeating syringe dispenser attachment (Hamilton, 83700) for each strain. A group injected with PBS without cells were used as control. Larvae were incubated in petri dishes by treatment group at indicated temperatures and monitored for 144 h for mortality as defined by lack of response to physical touch. Mortality was first checked at 12 h postinfection, then every 4 h between 12 and 24 h postinfection, every 6 h between 24 and 60 h postinfection, and finally every 12 h thereafter until the endpoint of 144 h. Larvae and pupae were euthanized by freezing at −20 °C. Overnight cultures of wild-type, tetO-YSF3/Δ, and tetO-PRP19/Δ strains in YPD in the absence and presence of 0.05 µg/mL DOX were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 and 0.4 in 10 mL YPD in the absence and presence of 20 µg/mL DOX and grown for approximately 3 h at 22 or 37 °C. RNA was extracted, Dnase-treated, and reverse transcribed as described above with the iScript cDNA synthesis Kit (Biorad), which uses a blend of oligo (dT) and random primers to avoid 5′ and 3′ bias. ACT1 splicing assay was performed as previously described [49]. Briefly, 1 µL of cDNA product was mixed with 0.1 μL of each ACT1 primer at 100 μM (oLC9781 and oLC10309), 2.5 μL of the supplied 10× reaction buffer, 2 μL of the supplied 2.5 mM dNTP mix, 0.25 μL of TAKARA ExTaq DNA polymerase, and 19 μL of ddH2O and subjected to a 30-cycle PCR reaction of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel at 100 V for 60 min, and the SYBR Safe-stained gels were imaged on a ChemiDoc. Illumina Stranded mRNA Ligation Kit was used to prepare libraries for wild-type and tetO-YSF3/Δ RNAs. Libraries were sequenced with Illumina Novaseq X Plus PE150bp to obtain >50 million reads per sample. Following quality control by FastQC/0.11.9 [98] using the following command: fastqc -o QC_$OUTNAME $R1 $R2 # “$OUTNAME”_R1t.fastq.gz “$OUTNAME”_R2t.fastq.gz, detected Nextera adapter sequences were trimmed off of the paired-end 150 bp reads using cutadapt/2.10 [105] with the following flags and settings: --cores=0 -b CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT -B CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT -e 0.1 -O 10 -m 16 –output=”$OUTNAME”_R1t.fastq.gz –paired-output= ”$OUTNAME”_R2t.fastq.gz $R1 $R2. Another FastQC quality control was performed after trimming. HISAT2/2.2.1 [106] was used to map the trimmed reads to the Candida albicans SC5314 genome version A22 with the following specifications: hisat2 –summary-file “$OUTNAME”_A22_summary.txt –max-intronlen 2000 -x $GENOME2 –rna-strandness FR -1 $R1 -2 $R2 -S “$OUTNAME”_A22.sam –novel-splicesite-outfile “$OUTNAME”_novelSS.txt. Unmapped reads were removed, and the generated output of the mapped reads was converted into tdf and bedgraph files using SAMtools/1.16/1 [107], BEDtools/2.30.0 [108] and IGVtools [104] for IGV visualization and further analyses. Read counts per gene for differential gene expression analysis were obtained using a custom bash script involving SAMtools/1.9, BEDTools/2.27.1 and a custom R script, as described in Lash and colleagues [49]. Specifically, the resulting bam files from mapping were split into first and second reads with SAMtools view -h -b -f 0x40 $BAM > r1.bam/ 0x80 $BAM > r2.bam. Following intersection with the genome annotation by bedtools intersect, reads overlapping with annotated features were counted using awk and bash commands. Resulting files contained reads per gene, as well as total mapped reads (including intergenic regions). Differential gene expression analysis was performed with custom R scripts using the DESeq2 package [109] from Bioconductor. DESeqDataSetFromMatrix was used to create the DESeqDataSet object to run DeSeq, comparing every condition with each other (S2 Data). Principal component analysis was performed by using vst and plotPCA functions. To create custom colors and shapes based on condition, ggplot2 [110] was used for better visualization of the PCA plot. For the analysis towards Figs 3H and S6E, intron-containing gene expression values were adjusted to consider exclusively the CDS for gene expression and excluding reads covering introns that are expected to differ strongly in counts due to decreased pre-mRNA splicing upon YSF3 depletion. First, the reads per intron were calculated using the same approach as for obtaining reads per gene, except for using the intron annotation for bedtools intersect. The obtained intron counts, as well as the total gene counts were normalized for library size by dividing by the number of total mapped reads for each sample. Following normalization, the average counts were calculated between replicates of the same condition. Next, the normalized, averaged number of reads per intron was subtracted from the number of reads per (intron-containing) gene to obtain ‘reads per exon’, to get a measure for expression of transcripts that could actually be subject to translation. Combined exon length was calculated by subtracting the intron length from gene length. Then, reads per kilobase (RPK) values were calculated by dividing number of reads per exon by the exon length in kilobases. To obtain spliced and unspliced intron-containing gene expression, RPK values were multiplied by the respective IR fraction for that gene and condition (S5 Data). Genes with multiple introns were excluded from this analysis. For splicing and IR quantification, the intron annotation used contained annotated introns from CGD, including 5′UTR introns. Analysis was carried out as in Lash and colleagues [49] using custom bash and R scripts. Specifically, bam files were split into forward and reverse reads again using samtools view -h -b -f 0x40 $BAM > r1.bam/0x80 $BAM > r2.bam. Afterwards, reads were overlapped with the annotated introns maintaining strand information using bedtools intersect. A minimum overlap of three bases was required to consider a read overlapping. The block count shows the number of continuous aligned segments in a read. Reads with a block count of 1, indicating alignment without gaps, were considered unspliced and were further categorized into intronic or unspliced, depending on the start and end position of the read; If the block count is > 1, indicating a gap in the aligned read and thus an exon-exon junction, it was classified as spliced. Split reads were further divided into spliced (exactly matching annotated intron) or alternatively spliced (no perfect match). For each intron, reads for each of the categories were counted. For each intron, IR fraction was calculated by dividing the number of unspliced reads by the sum of the number of unspliced and 2 × the number of spliced reads (S3 and S4 Data). We introduced factor 2 for “spliced” junction reads to account for the aspect that one unspliced transcript can give rise to two “unspliced” reads, but a spliced transcript can only yield one “spliced” read. A minimal read cutoff of 20 was required for further analysis. IR difference was calculated as the difference between the fraction of IR of each induced (+ DOX) and uninduced (− DOX) sample. To computationally identify likely BPSs in C. albicans introns we made use of previously annotated 7-nt branchpoint motifs in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans [52,111]. First, we calculated the frequency, position weight, and logOdds matrix from the frequency of nucleotides at each position within the 7-nt motif and the average nucleotide frequency across S. cerevisiae introns using a custom R script and the Biostrings package. Using the S. cerevisiae LogOdds matrix we calculated a branchpoint score for each 7-nt running window across C. albicans introns by summing up LogOdds matrix entries at the respective motif position (column) and base identity (row). To select likely BPSs we required a score above 4. Three introns did not have a score above 4, filtering for a score greater than 0 yielded a likely branchpoint for all three introns. Overall, 333 introns showed the consensus BPS of 5′ UACUAAC 3′ and 76 introns showed slight variations of that motif (non-consensus BPSs) (S3 Data). Seventy-nine introns had more than one possible branchpoint, whereas we considered the BPSs matching the median distance between BPS and 3′ SS best as the primary branchpoint for our analysis. The median distance between BPS and 3′ SS is 24 nts and matches previous estimates [51]; the distance includes the 7-nt BPS. Introns were categorized by their BP motif (consensus/non-consensus) and into four ranges of BPS to 3′ SS distance using quantile to ensure equal distribution of the data. Intron lengths were obtained through the start and end intron coordinates. As intron lengths underlie a bimodal distribution (S6C Fig), we determined a cutoff between short and long introns by analyzing the distribution of intron lengths in our dataset using kernel density estimation (density() function in R). The density plot revealed two prominent peaks, corresponding to two major intron length modes. We used the findpeaks() function (pracma package) to identify these peaks and then determined the local minimum (valley) in the density curve between them. This valley was used as a threshold to classify introns into “short” (≤valley position) and “long” (>valley position). The first 6 nucleotides of an intron were considered for the 5′SS analysis and the last 3 intronic nucleotides to call 3′SS sequences. The conserved 5′SS motif consists of the sequence GUAUGU (GTATGT in the DNA sequ“nce),”and we defined the 3′SS consensus as the most conserved TAG motif, while also including CAG and AAG, which are common 3′SSs in C. albicans as well [51]. We found that all introns for which we measured IR by RNA-seq had a consensus 3′SS, with TAG being the most abundant comprising 298 introns (73%), AAG was found in 58 introns (14%) and 50 introns had a CAG 3′SS (12%). There was some variation within the 5′ SS, while most of them (336 introns) had the full consensus sequence, which is almost 83%, and 62 introns had only the strongly conserved first three nucleotides GTA of the motif, which in combination makes up almost all introns (398/98%). Thus, we categorized the SSs into consensus or variable 5′ SS (S4 Data). When plotting the Δ IR fraction (IR difference) for the categories intron length, BP motif, SS motif and BP–3′SS distance, we verified that the observed effects are consistent when all other variables are kept constant (optimal motifs/distance). Similar analysis for GC-content, polypyrimidine tract length and CU-fraction within the polypyrimidine tract did not produce significant differences in IR upon Ysf3 depletion. As in Lash and colleagues [49] GO term enrichment was performed using the combined GO annotations from CGD (https://geneontology.org/, version from 08/10/2023, gaf-version: 2; and version from 17/01/2024, gaf-version: 2.2) and GO annotations from S. cerevisiae orthologs (https://geneontology.org/, version from 18/01/2024, gaf-version: 2.2). S. cerevisiae orthologous genes were matched according to the information on CGD. GO term annotations were extended to all parents of individual GO terms using the “get_parent_nodes” function from the GOfuncR package. Occurrences of GO terms were counted in each gene group of interest (up- or down-regulated genes upon YSF3 depletion at 22 or 37 °C, respectively) and compared to their frequency in the gene background. For GO term enrichment among groups of differentially expressed genes we distinguished between upregulated genes (log2-fold change of differential expression > 0.5 and adjusted P-value < 0.00001, 592 genes at 22 °C and 239 genes at 37 °C) and downregulated genes (log2-fold change of differential expression >0.5 and adjusted P-value <0.00001, 616 genes at 22 °C and 342 genes at 37 °C). In this case, the gene background was formed by all genes that were quantified as expressed in the RNA-seq data. To assess the significance of GO term enrichment, we performed the Fisher’s Exact Test and multiple testing correction (Bonferroni correction). A P-value cutoff of <0.01 was used to call positively enriched GO terms for “Biological Process.” Enriched GO terms for “Biological Process,” “Molecular Function,” and “Cellular Component” across up- and down-regulated genes are listed in S6 Data. To determine the impact of YSF3 on morphogenesis, CaSS1, YSF3, and EFG1 GRACE strains were grown in YPD in the presence and absence of 0.05 µg/mL DOX overnight at 30 °C, shaking, and sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in YPD supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum in the presence and absence of 20 µg/mL DOX at 37 °C, shaking, for 6 h. Cells were then imaged on a Zeiss Axio Imager MI. To determine the impact of RHT1 on morphogenesis, overnight cultures of SC5314, CaLC10720, and CaLC10721 were grown in YPD at 30 °C, shaking, and sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in YPD. SC5314 cells treated with 25 mM HU and 50 µM NOC were used as controls. Cultures were grown at 30 °C for 4 h before imaging on a Zeiss Axio Imager MI. Immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged Rht1 was performed to assess RHT1-GFP expression, as previously described [112]. Briefly, overnight cultures were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in 50 mL YPD and grown for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted and washed in 1 mL of F300 buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.2, 300 mM KOAc, and 10% glycerol) and stored at −80 °C. To prepare whole cell lysate, each pellet was resuspended in 1 mL F300 and disrupted by bead-beating (2 min on; 1 min rest on ice) for three cycles. Crude lysates were mixed with a half-volume of F300 supplemented with 0.06% IGPAL-CA630 and sonicated (20 s × 4) at 30% amplitude using a 3-mm diameter probe. Sonicated lysates were treated with ~30 U Benzonase (Millipore) for 20 min after the addition of MgCl2 to the final centration of 2 mM and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. Total protein (~6 mg) in supernatant was incubated with 20 µL of anti-GFP magnetic beads (GTMA-20; Chromotek) for 90 min on a revolving rotator. Bead-bound proteins were captured using a magnetic rack and washed with F300 + 0.02% IGEPAL-CA630 × 3 before boiling in 30 µL 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. All eluted proteins were resolved on 10% precast SDS-gels and blots probed with HRP-conjugated anti-GFP antibody (118144600012; Roche; 1:3,000) followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (170-65169; Bio-Rad; 1:5,000). All F300 buffers were supplemented immediately prior to use with 1× PhosSTOP (Roche) and 1× Complete inhibitor cocktails (Roche) to inhibit phosphatase and proteinase activity. AP-MS experiments were performed as previously described [27]. Briefly, Rht1-GFP (CaLC10748) and Eno1-GFP (CaLC4449) strains were grown overnight at 30 °C in YPD. Stationary phase cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 in 1 L YPD and grown to an OD600 between 0.6 and 0.8. Cells were harvested at 3,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold water, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen bath. For protein extraction, samples were diluted 1:1 by weight in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 5mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40, 1× ROCHE protease inhibitor cocktail tablet [Roche Diagnostics, Mississauga, ON, Canada]) and vortexed with glass beads (0.5 mm) for 4 × 1 min. Lysates were collected by stacked transfer for 5 min at 100g with a 18-gauge needle and clarified by centrifugation at 16,110g for 20 min in 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. To affinity purify the GFP-interacting proteins, we used 25 µL of GFP-TRAP_M magnetic beads (ChromoTek, Martinsried, Germany) for each 1 L culture. Beads were equilibrated three times with 1 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40, 1× ROCHE protease inhibitors [Roche Diagnostics, Mississauga, ON, Canada]). The protein extract was then added to the resin and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were magnetized then washed with 1 mL of lysis buffer and then 1 mL of wash buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 2 mM CaCl2). The dried beads were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, and incubated with 0.5 μg trypsin (Sigma, T7575) with rotation at 37 °C overnight (~15 h). The samples were digested on-bead with 0.75 μg trypsin (0.2 μg/μL in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 37 °C overnight with rotation. Magnetization and digestion were repeated once more with a shorter incubation of 3–4 h without rotation. Formic acid was added to a final concentration of 2% and stored at −40 °C until used for MS. AP-MS samples and controls were analyzed by MS in two biological replicates. 1/16th of each sample was acquired in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) via LC–MS/MS. Samples were loaded onto Evotip Pure cartridges and eluted from the Performance EV1109 column (8 cm × 150 µm with 1.5 µm beads), heated at 40 °C, with the 60SPD gradient on an Evosep One. The column was coupled to the timsTOF Pro 2 using a 20 µm diameter emitter tip (Bruker 1811107). Peptides were eluted from the column with an acetonitrile gradient generated by an Eksigent ekspert nanoLC 425 and analyzed on a TripleTOF 6600 instrument (AB SCIEX, Concord, Ontario, Canada). The total DDA protocol is 22 min. The MS1 scan had a mass range of 100–1,700 Da in PASEF mode. TIMS settings were accumulation and ramp time of 100 ms (with 4 PASEF ramps and active exclusion at 0.4 min), and within the mobility range (1/K0) of 0.85–1.3 V·s/cm2. This was at a cycle time of 0.53 s. The target intensity was set to 17,500 and the intensity threshold set to 1,750. 1+ ions are excluded from fragmentation using a polygonal filter. The auto calibration was off. MS data generated were stored, searched, and analyzed using the ProHits laboratory information management system (LIMS) platform and searched using MSFragger v4.1 [113] against the C. albicans UniProt database (UP000000559) acquired from NCBI, supplemented with common contaminants, decoy entries were added. Acetylated protein N-term and oxidated methionine were set as variable modifications. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm on either side. Fragment mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm. Enzymatic cleavage was set to trypsin with 2 missed cleavages. MSBooster and Percolator were turned on. Percolator required a minimum probability of 0.5 and did not remove redundant peptides. The target-decoy competition method was used to assign q-values and PEPs. For ProteinProphet, the maximum peptide mass difference was set to 30 ppm. When generating the final report, the protein FDR filter was set to 0.01. FDR was estimated by using both filtered PSM and protein lists. Razor peptides were used for protein FDR scoring. All other parameters were default. Results were analyzed with SAINTexpress (v3.3) [114] with Eno1-GFP samples as negative controls. A total spectral count greater than or equal to 20 and a BFDR value equal to 0 were required for proteins to be classified as significant interaction partners (S7 Data).

Cytoscape [115] was used to visualize high-confidence protein interactors identified by AP-MS. E-test strip assay and disc diffusion assays were performed to test fluconazole tolerance for C. albicans strains, as previously described [116]. Wild type, rht1Δ/Δ mutant, complemented strain, ByM1, ByM1R, and ByM10s were grown in liquid YPD at 30 °C overnight, washed once with sterile H2O, and diluted to a cell density of 108 cells/mL. About 100 µL cells were spread on YPD agar using a sterile cotton swab. Fluconazole E-test strip (bioMérieux) or a 0.5 cm precut filter disc was placed at the center of the YPD agar plates. A volume of 5 µL of 10 mg/mL fluconazole stock was spotted on the filter disc. Plates were incubated upside down at 30 or 35 °C and imaged on a ChemiDoc after 3 days.

Plates were incubated at indicated temperatures and imaged after 2 days. B) Detection of GFP-tagged Rht1 by IP-western blot. Wild-type and a GFP-tagged Iml3 strains were used as negative and positive controls. Strains were sub-cultured to an OD600 of 0.2 in YPD and grown at 30 °C for 4 h. Total proteins were extracted. GFP-tagged proteins were purified using anti-GFP magnetic beads, separated on SDS-gel, and blotted for detection of GFP signal with anti-GFP antibody. The Rht1-GFP strain was repeated twice. Full-length Rht1-GFP and Iml3-GFP are predicted to be 57.5and 58.3 kDa in size, respectively. C) Secondary screen results of GRACE strains for Rht1-interacting proteins were analyzed.

October 17, 2025 08:45 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and Kraig Labs 24/7 Market News and Kraig Labs DENVER, Oct. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and information, reports that, as the fashion industry confronts mounting pressure to overhaul its wasteful practices, Circular Fashion is emerging as both an ethical mandate and a massive economic opportunity. Kraig Biocraft Laboratories (OTCQB: KBLB), the undisputed global leader in the development and commercialization of spider silk, is positioning to be at the forefront of this transformation, offering a scalable, biodegradable alternative to petroleum-based fabrics that could reshape the $1.5 trillion global apparel industry. The Circular Economy’s Billion-Dollar Fashion Upside Circular fashion, a model that emphasizes durability, recyclability, and closed-loop systems, aims to eliminate the staggering 92 million tons of textile waste discarded globally each year. Analysts project the circular fashion market could grow to over $200 billion by 2030, driven by consumer demand, ESG mandates, and regulatory changes. Governments and major fashion houses alike are accelerating toward sustainability targets: Kraig Labs: Bioengineered Spider Silk for the Circular Age Kraig Labs’ recombinant spider silk, produced through proprietary silkworm-based biotechnology, offers a powerful solution for this new era. Unlike synthetic fibers derived from fossil fuels, spider silk is both biodegradable and renewable, while delivering extraordinary strength, elasticity, and breathability. The Kraig Labs spider silk platform will enable luxury and performance brands to meet sustainability mandates without sacrificing quality or performance and support an entirely new circular materials economy. By utilizing traditional silk production infrastructure and replacing the silk protein with engineered spider silk protein, Kraig Labs is able to offer a scalable and economically viable supply chain. This puts the company in a unique position to help apparel brands replace unsustainable materials like polyester, nylon, and conventional silk. Economic Impact: Premium Pricing Meets ESG Demand With the luxury fashion market expected to surpass $330 billion by 2030, and sustainable fashion already outpacing industry growth at large, spider silk could capture a significant slice of this fast-expanding segment: Circular fashion principles also open the door for take-back programs, rental models, and closed-loop recycling, where biodegradable spider silk garments could fully decompose or be re-engineered into new fibers, further boosting the sustainability narrative and lifecycle economics. KBLB: A Biomaterial Solution Whose Time Has Come Kraig Labs (OTCQB: KBLB) has already demonstrated success with its spider silk fibers, developed through years of R&D and protected by an extensive IP portfolio. As the company begins ramping up commercial-scale production, the timing aligns with fashion’s urgent pivot to circularity and transparency. Key catalysts include: As fashion shifts away from fast-disposable goods toward long-lasting, sustainable, and recyclable materials, Kraig Labs’ spider silk is emerging as a leading contender to define the future of circular fashion.

with Dave Vellante Dive into tech news and cutting-edge insights on current technology topics with Breaking Analysis hosted by Dave Vellante. Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and theCUBE Research communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Salesforce is moving from the hype phase of generative AI into doing the harder engineering work to create the agentic enterprise. Dreamforce 2025 showed us that the company which created the original SaaS model now wants to lead what we call service as software. In our view, this represents a profound revolution, not just in technology but in business. In a world where AI agents deliver outcomes across systems of record, systems of engagement and systems of intelligence. Our assessment is that Salesforce’s AgentForce 360 platform is crossing day one early version to attack day two problems and customer requirements. What does that mean? It’s no longer just demoing copilots inside Customer 360. Rather, the company is going after the messy problems of observability, orchestration, data quality, etc. that determine whether agent systems can scale in the enterprise. The shift to service as software will bring learning curve advantages, software- like marginal economics, and winner- take- most dynamics to all companies across every industry, not just tech vendors. We believe those firms that can more quickly jump on the AI experience curve will see substantially increased benefits relative to their competitors. However, our research suggests that data management We’re on the cusp of a new software- enabled business model that will determine winners and losers in the coming decades. We call this service -as-software. Specifically, we believe enterprises will begin to organize knowledge work in new ways, that harmonize islands of automation into a build-to-order assembly line for knowledge work. Firms that aggressively pursue this opportunity will be on a learning curve that we think will create sustainable competitive advantage, and, importantly, a winner-take-most dynamic. Now, we’re not just talking about technology vendors here. Rather, we believe new technology, operational, and business models will emerge, and apply to all enterprises across every industry. In this breaking analysis, theCUBE Research team presents a new way to think about how businesses will operate in the AI era; with implications for application developers, edge deployments, and security / governance models. With a glimpse toward the path that we think organizations can take to go from where they are today into the future. For the past several decades, Cybersecurity has been an unfair fight. The economics have favored attackers, which have access to sophisticated resources, lower costs, fast innovation cycles and deep knowledge of vulnerabilities. Defenders, by contrast, bear the full burden of securing sprawling networks, fragmented technologies, and human error, all while operating under legal, regulatory, and financial scrutiny. In our view, the Intel–NVIDIA pact further accentuates NVIDIA’s dominance and represents a final handoff of the baton in the race to the next era of computing. Just as Intel had a lock on the market in the 80s and 90s, NVIDIA has now extended its moat deep into the x86 ecosystem (in both PCs and the data center) and expanded its TAM by $500B to $1T by our estimates. The subtext here is that Lip-Bu Tan is taking necessary steps to save Intel. In doing so, he’s hitching the company’s wagon to the future, which is being defined by CUDA, NVIDIA’s software platform. This move by our estimates, increases Intel’s TAM by $100B and breathes new life into the x86 franchise, which was rapidly deteriorating. In our view, Intel foundry remains problematic but will get a boost from the system on chip (SoC) products that this partnership will produce. On balance we see this as a win for both companies, x86 customers and a further boost for AI’s momentum. CrowdStrike used Fal.con 2025 to harden its ongoing value proposition that security is a speed game. But the company extended its messaging emphasizing that platforms which orchestrate fleets of AI agents will set the bar for the future of security. In our view, George Kurtz’s keynote and theCUBE interview (below) mark a goal to create a clean hand-off from “assistive The threat landscape is undergoing a profound transformation. At CrowdStrike’s Fal.Con 2025 event in Las Vegas, Adam Meyers, who heads counter-adversary operations, provided a rare window into how the world’s most capable adversaries are adapting their tactics. His insights underscore a sobering reality in that artificial intelligence has become both a weapon and a defense shield, underscoring the asymmetry between attackers and defenders. We believe CrowdStrike (CRWD) has re-established growth momentum while still working through the financial and reputational overhang of the July 19, 2024 global outage. The company recently delivered net new ARR reacceleration ahead of expectations, showcased strong platform expansion across cloud, identity, and Next-Gen SIEM, and leaned on Falcon Flex as a durable consolidation lever. In our view, the near-term debate centers not only on churn or Flex conversion but more on net new ARR performance, valuation skepticism, and whether identity and SIEM can offset a maturing core endpoint business while fending off intensifying competition. The mainspring of CrowdStrike’s success remains relentless product innovation, increasingly defined by its platform. We believe its unified platform and AI-driven threat defense at scale underpin the company’s premium valuation through customer consolidation, stickiness, and durable ARR growth. We believe the prevailing narrative that Broadcom and NVIDIA are locked in a zero-sum battle for AI data center dominance is misleading. The reality is these companies are playing very different games. NVIDIA has built a vertically integrated compute and software platform that has become the engine of the AI factory era. Broadcom, by contrast, has constructed a durable business model around connectivity, custom silicon, and high-margin software. The strategies overlap but are not mutually exclusive. We believe the real story is how these firms are carving out complementary positions in the most important technology cycle since the dawn of the Internet. We believe the industry’s broad interpretation of Jensen’s Law — i.e. “Jensen’s Law accelerates Moore’s Law” — understates a fundamental economic reality of AI Factories. Jensen Huang’s own language and NVIDIA’s operating model point to a financial law of motion for AI factories: When power is the binding constraint and demand is elastic, perf/watt increases raise monetizable throughput faster than they raise total cost. The result is an extension to existing laws of tech that we’ve come to know. Specifically, Jensen’s invoking of Buy ore to make more (i.e. revenue up) and spend more to save more (i.e. unit cost down) has explicit economic implications that we believe need further examination. In addition, there is a corollary in this new regime in that, under certain conditions, fabric‑driven utilization unlocks are so valuable that high‑speed networking becomes “economically free” (i.e. where utilization gains exceed amortized fabric cost). In this Breaking Analysis we explain in detail what we’re referring to as a new Jensen’s Law. We’ll explore why this phenomenon is so important, review the math behind it, share some concrete examples of where the law is applicable, when the corollary of “the network is free” holds, implications for investors and operators; and where the law is not applicable. We believe the center of gravity in AI infrastructure has shifted from servers to AI factories, where networking is perhaps as critical as compute. Our analysis of an interview with NVIDIA SVP of Networking, Gilad Shainer, indicates NVIDIA’s thesis is straightforward. Specifically, that scale-up fabrics (NVLink/NVLink Fusion) plus scale-out Ethernet purpose-built for AI (Spectrum-X) — and increasingly scale-across for multi–data center topologies (Spectrum-XGS) — deliver superior determinism, efficiency, and time-to-outcomes at giga-scale. At the same time, the market is too large and heterogeneous for any single fabric to dominate; open standards and merchant Ethernet will continue to win broad adoption, and even NVIDIA is embracing open interfaces and ecosystems to complement its proprietary advantages. In our view, NVIDIA is a somewhat rare case where first-mover advantage has paid off. Its early conviction in parallel computing, GPUs, CUDA/NCCL software moats, and the Mellanox acquisition now underpin a defensible systems position across scale-up, scale-out, and (increasingly) scale-across. Cybersecurity is the number one risk facing enterprises today, and yet organizations remain dangerously unprepared. Executives are not blind to the problem — they understand the financial exposure, the reputational stakes, and the business impact of a major breach. They acknowledge gaps in their defenses and recognize the vulnerabilities that could cripple their mission-critical systems. But awareness has not translated into readiness and true business resilience remains elusive for the vast majority of firms. Data strategies are especially important – specifically data governance, data protection, and data quality. These remain essential elements of cyber resilience, but they’re only part of the equation. True business resilience requires confronting a multitude of dimensions — from application security to identity, supply chain integrity, operational continuity, infrastructure defenses and more. The uncomfortable truth is that most firms still lack the cohesive strategy, investment, and execution to protect their most vital assets. Donald Trump’s 180 on Intel is at least directionally correct, certainly more so than calling for the ouster of Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s CEO. But a contemplated investment by the US in Intel, as reported by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, without a significant restructuring of Intel’s entire business, is a recipe for failure in our view. Specifically, we continue to urge Intel’s board to spin out its foundry business. Every day it waits further decreases foundry’s value. Moreover, we call on the U.S. government to use money from the CHIPS Act and its influence on large US chip designers, and TSMC, to secure a position for a US-domiciled company in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. AI is currently running on a one lane, CapEx highway that is capacity constrained. Hyperscalers are the largest contributor to the momentum and as such, investors keep score with cloud growth rates. But this past quarter you had to read the footnotes and the fine print to go beyond the massive investments fueling the wave. Microsoft put up eye-popping Azure growth again, but a big part of that acceleration is Azure serving AI inference — notably ChatGPT — now neatly included in the revised definition of what’s included in Azure. This is great for headlines but not conducive to apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Meanwhile, AWS delivered the largest revenue for cloud infrastructure and sent a clear message that demand exceeds supply. Meaning growth is capped by power and components, not pipeline. That creates a weird optics penalty — AWS showing growth in the high teens on a $120B-plus run rate and it’s deemed “concerning.” But it also telegraphs future upside as capacity goes online and depreciation cycles progress. OpenAI and NVIDIA just dropped news with implications for every model lab, cloud, and enterprise AI customer and vendor. The two companies released gpt-oss-20B and gpt-oss-120B, open-weight reasoning models trained on H100, tuned across NVIDIA’s full stack, and capable of spitting out 1.5 million tokens per second on a single Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack. The weights ship under a permissive license; the inference path spans DGX Cloud, Blackwell servers, and RTX PCs via Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, FlashInfer, Hugging Face, and Microsoft AI Foundry Local. Last November, we argued that Jamie Dimon is sitting on a treasure trove of proprietary data that will never find its way into proprietary LLMs via the Internet. And as such, he was Sam Altman’s biggest competitor because his data is more valuable than the democratized insights from these LLMs. Our premise was and continues to be that foundation model companies are waging an internecine battle chasing artificial general intelligence (Messiah AGI) and the true holy grail is what we called “enterprise AGI;” meaning applying AI to proprietary data inside of enterprises will ultimately prove to be the most valuable endeavor. Today we extend that argument and posit that agents and enterprise digital twins, powered by that proprietary data, will drive the next wave of AI value. By all accounts, Microsoft just delivered one of the most powerful quarters in its history. But this wasn’t just a blowout print, it was a signal that Microsoft is playing a new game. The company’s performance is redefining what hyperscale looks like in the AI era. An objective analysis of the Q4 FY2025 earnings call suggests that Microsoft is firing on all cylinders in cloud, AI, and infrastructure execution, and it’s building for a future measured in gigawatts, not racks. The only potential negatives for investors are: 1) Capital expenditures are expected to be more than $30B in the coming quarter, signalling continued spending ahead of revenue and negatively affecting cash flow; and 2) Gross margin pressure continues in cloud due to the lower margins realized in its Azure / infrastructure business. The stablecoin market is rapidly maturing into one of the most consequential sectors of the digital asset econoour. After years of uncertainty, regulatory friction, and media skepticism, stablecoins are no longer a speculative curiosity, rather they are foundational to the next chapter of programmable finance. Our research suggests that the convergence of policy shifts, institutional adoption, and new economic use cases has thrust stablecoins into the spotlight. In short: crypto’s ChatGPT moment has arrived, and its name is stablecoin. In our view, IBM delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent memory, reinforcing a narrative we’ve tracked for some time – i.e. the pivot from legacy to a modern, AI-driven hybrid cloud company is finally showing up in the numbers. The company beat expectations across revenue, profit, margin, and free cash flow, and perhaps more importantly, demonstrated credible traction While the NASDAQ seems to reach new highs daily, enterprise tech spending remains persistently cautious at the macro amid continued uncertainty. That’s not necessarily bad news but it can be disconcerting to decision makers. Often during transitional cycles, like the one we’re in now, executives don’t want to overrotate on capital allocations that deliver outcomes, which could potentially be achieved much more cost effectively with emerging technologies like AI. We’ve seen similar patterns in previous waves. There was a period of “great softness” in enterprise IT spending when transitioning from mainframes and minis to the PC era, a huge backlash from overly exuberant Y2K and dotcom spending; and a steady deterioration of traditional enterprise tech momentum during the cloud, mobile, SaaS, social, big data era. Each wave is different but two common themes remain: 1/ strong conviction that a new era is here; and 2/ fear of disruption, which sometimes leads to hasty decision making and waste. These countervailing forces seem to be in play today as 87% of enterprises report taking a cautious approach to AI investments. And that caution is showing up in the macro spend environment. Intel’s new CEO has promised to clean up the balance sheet, slim down the company, return to a culture of engineering, sharpen its customer focus, shore up its products, become a world class independent foundry and lead Intel for as long as it takes to achieve success, however that is defined. As our audience knows, unlike most other analysts, we have aggressively emphasized the icebergs ahead for Intel since 2013, culminating in our prediction that Intel would go bankrupt trying to execute on its most previous strategy. While we would have preferred a different approach to Intel’s foundry – i.e. JV with TSM – Lip-Bu Tan at least has what we consider to be a viable go forward plan. The steady state outcome of this new direction, however is far from certain. In last week’s Breaking Analysis we argued that Snowflake was attempting to cross the Rubicon, vaulting from cloud data warehouse innovator into AI leader and intelligent application platform. This week the competitive fire got a fresh accelerant. As usual, Databricks followed up Snowflake Summit and put forth bold claims of its own, emphasizing unified governance, data intelligence, simplified user experiences, transactional capabilities and, of course, open data. Cisco hasn’t enjoyed much organic revenue growth in more than a decade. It just rolled into San Diego claiming this year’s Cisco Live is the “most consequential” event in the company’s history. Hyperbole? Maybe. But after three days on-site comprising Q&A with Chuck Robbins and Jeetu Patel, closed-door roadmap dives, and a flood of product reveals in public, our assessment is that Cisco finally has a credible, end-to-end story for the AI era. Our research indicates that data platform wars have entered an entirely new phase, one where open data is no longer a marketing slogan and governance catalogs are now the new control point. We see this as the first of several structural changes to the software industry. The next price of entry we think will be an emerging layer that we call systems of intelligence, or SOI, which we believe will become a high value piece of real estate in the AI-optimized software stack. In this Breaking Analysis, and just a few days removed from Snowflake Summit 2025, we unpack how Snowflake has moved from steward of its pristine proprietary data platform to orchestrating an ecosystem in a world that enables any compute engine to operate on any open data formats. Last week, we framed the company’s Rubicon moment, meaning the pivot from analytic warehouse to enabler of intelligent data apps. The data industry has arrived at a pivotal juncture that echoes the themes we’ve charted in previous Breaking Analysis episodes, from The Sixth Data Platform through The Yellow Brick Road to Agentic AI; Why Jamie Dimon is Sam Altman’s Biggest Competitor all the way to the Faceoff between Benioff and Nadella. Those analyses have chronicled the steady convergence of analytic data platforms such as Snowflake and Databricks, not only with the hyperscalers’ estates, but increasingly, with the operational applications that run businesses. Our research indicates that this merger is not a side-effect of Gen AI hype, rather it’s a structural shift in how enterprises will create value from data and software over the next several decades. Thirty months into the GenAI awakening, the jury is still out on how much enterprises are benefiting from investments in artificial intelligence. While the vast majority of customers continue to spend on AI, reported returns are no greater than, and frankly lag those, typically associated with historical IT initiatives like ERP, data warehousing and cloud computing. Let’s face it, the multi-hundred billion dollar annual CAPEX outlay from hyperscalers and sovereign nations is fueling the euphoria and essentially supporting blind faith in the AI movement. But ground truth returns from enterprise AI adoption remain opaque. This combined with geopolitical unrest, fluctuating public policy and GDP estimates in the low single digits, have buyers tempering expectations for tech spending relative to January of this year. Dell’s founder-led business is one of the most remarkable and under appreciated stories in tech. Dell Technologies is not particularly sexy, nor does it put forth an earth- shattering vision that bends the mind. Yet it’s a company that has consistently figured out how to ride successive waves without becoming driftwood. And like Hyman Roth of Godfather fame, Michael Dell always seems to make money for his partners. Unlike Roth, Mr. Dell is not a gangster, rather he’s a gentleman that literally wrote the book on how to play nice and win. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of DTW 2025, we examine the question, how will Dell capture the explosive AI opportunity, while transitioning the millions of servers, arrays, and PCs it already has in the field to this new AI era? The Road to ‘Service-as-Software.’ Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff is articulating a bold vision for the next era of enterprise software. In an exclusive interview with theCUBE on April 25, 2025, Benioff outlined how AI-driven agents and a unified data architecture will transform Software as a Service (SaaS) into what we’re calling “Service as Software” – a model where software-based digital agents augment every business process. The Salesforce chief has often quipped that today’s CEOs are “the last generation of executives leading exclusively human workforces,” underscoring his conviction that AI agents (what many call agentic AI) will soon work alongside humans in every enterprise. Our premise is that this “digital labor” revolution could be more disruptive than the cloud and mobile waves of 15 years ago, fundamentally redefining how applications function. Our view is that IBM has crystallized a coherent, differentiated AI thesis based on smaller, domain‑tuned models running on an open, hybrid‑cloud fabric. The goal is to unlock what it claims is the 99 percent of enterprise data still untouched by GenAI. If execution matches the marketing—particularly on integration speed and cost transparency—IBM will change the perception from perennial AI underdog to a primary or even default choice for risk‑averse enterprises seeking tangible ROI. The next two quarters of Watsonx bookings and Granite adoption will tell us whether the strategy is hitting escape velocity, merely clearing the launchpad or needs a reset. Based on this quarter’s earnings reports, it’s clear to us that demand is not the constraint for hyperscale clouds. They are, however running head‑long into the hard limits of physics. Access to megawatts, liquid‑cooled racks, and a GPU supply chain that begins and ends with NVIDIA are now critical paths to tapping what appears to be unlimited demand. AWS, Microsoft, and Google each chalked up record‑setting capital outlays last quarter—collectively dropping around $63 billion in CAPEX—yet even that eye‑popping sum can’t fully satiate the compute‑hungry AI models racing toward trillion‑parameter scale. We believe the real story isn’t simply “AI is expensive”; it’s that power availability, not revenue potential, is now the gating factor on hyperscaler growth. In our view, the winners of the next cycle will be the providers that secure sustainable energy footprints, master GPU allocation, and—critically—translate all that infrastructure into margin‑accretive AI services before the depreciation schedules kick in. Welcome to the ironic era where megawatts equal market share. As RSAC 2025 approaches, key themes are emerging that are set to dominate the world’s largest cybersecurity gathering. Industry dynamics are shifting rapidly – from AI enabling higher velocity threats, an intensified platform consolidation debate, high-profile M&A, rising interest in AI agents (with somewhat tepid adoption in cyber) and shifting security budget priorities. Our research shows that while cybersecurity remains At last week’s AI Agent Builder Summit, hosted by Scott Hebner of theCUBE Research at SiliconANGLE’s Palo Alto Studios, the hype around “agentic AI” – autonomous software agents that can orchestrate complex tasks – was on full display. Demos and keynotes painted a bold vision of AI-driven business processes. But scratch beneath the surface, and a sobering reality emerges: Most enterprises are far from ready to reap the benefits of fully autonomous agents. Much work needs to be done to realize the promise of agentic systems, including organizational alignment to create a true data culture, cleaning up data silos, harmonizing that data, data ownership, data product thinking, getting governance and security right, choosing technology partners, rationalizing your SaaS and on-prem applications portfolio, and of course change management to get all this done. Starting the journey toward an agentic enterprise is an exciting imperative, but in our view will take the better part of a decade to realize. We estimate that Google’s Cloud business will exceed $50B in annual revenue this year with Google Cloud Platform comprising more than 50% of its cloud revenue for the first time ever. Why is it then that Google’s cloud business, a $50B+ entity growing deep into the double digits gets so much criticism? The answer is simple. Google’s cloud, with arguably the best technology in the industry, is 2.5 – 3.5 times smaller than the cloud businesses of AWS and Microsoft. We are in the midst of a fundamental transformation of computing architectures. We’re moving from a world where we create data, store it, retrieve it, harmonize it and present it so that we can make better decisions, to a world that creates content from knowledge using tokens as a new unit of value; and increasingly takes action in real time with or without human intervention, driving unprecedented increases in value. What this means is every part of the computing stack, from silicon, infrastructure, security, middleware, development tools, applications and even services, is changing. As with other waves in computing, consumer adoption leads us up the innovation curve where the value is clear, the volume is high and the velocity is accelerated, leading to lower costs and eventual adoption into and disruption of enterprise applications. Importantly, to do this work on today’s data center infrastructure would be 10X more expensive, trending toward 100X by the end of the decade. As such, virtually everything is going to move to this new model of computing. Automation generally and AI specifically, render today’s cybersecurity stacks ineffective. Previously, stopping 99% of attacks and leaving the 1% for armed human hunters to deal with was, while not ideal, at least feasible. With AI, that all goes away because adversaries can scale phishing and other attacks at unprecedented rates, which overwhelms the ability of humans. This creates a wider gap between exfiltration times, which are shrinking, and mean time to remediation, giving even greater advantage to attackers. As such, the only way to fight AI is with AI. Moreover, the ever expanding number of tools in an organization’s security stack continues to exacerbate the problem. According to Palo Alto Networks, the answer is a complete makeover of your cybersecurity stack where consolidating multiple tools into a single platform and gaining comprehensive access to the right data, simplifies security operations and enables AI to operate in real time. The analyst relations (AR) function is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Once dominated by a handful of large research houses, such as Gartner, IDC and Forrester, the market now features a spectrum of independent analysts and influencers. The fast-paced nature of the tech industry, its speed of change, the relentless competition and ubiquity of technology, make it a challenging sector for Since the Gen AI awakening, we’ve said consistently that NVIDIA and Broadcom are the #1 and #2 AI plays in tech. Since peaking in mid-December of last year, Broadcom shares have been under pressure, off on sympathy with other semiconductor stocks and the general confusion about the economy, tariffs, inflation, jobs, geopolitics, debt, etc. Broadcom’s Q1 results were impressive and assuaged some of these fears. At one point last night after hours the stock was up 15% from its previous close and midday Friday was up around 6-7% despite continued pressure on tech shares. Market transitions such as the one we’re in now often bring confusion and market volatility as the new high growth sectors are not large enough to offset the slowdown in the larger declining markets. NVIDIA doesn’t have this problem because it is at the mainspring of the new wave. Broadcom is facing a similar but different dynamic in that its traditional businesses are ones that are extremely durable. Moreover, we see two relatively new dynamics coming into play for Broadcom: 1) Hyperscalers are coming to Broadcom to enable their custom AI accelerators; and 2) Broadcom’s VMware strategy is working, lifting the company to new software heights. A seismic shift is underway in enterprise software, one that pits two of the most influential leaders in the industry—Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff—against each other in a war of words that highlights the broader transformation unfolding in enterprise applications. Nadella predicts the demise of traditional SaaS applications, arguing that AI-powered agents will take over, fundamentally redefining enterprise software. Benioff, on the other hand, argues that AI will serve as an augmentation layer and rely on his existing platform to supply the digital workforce of the future. Few brands in technology carry the storied pedigree of Intel. For decades, “Intel Inside” was synonymous with progress in computing—an American icon that repeatedly raised the bar for processor performance and innovation. Today, Intel finds itself in a precarious position. Its once-vaunted manufacturing machine has fallen behind TSMC, which dominates advanced process nodes. Meanwhile, Intel’s core CPU design business—a substantial, if bruised, revenue engine—remains overshadowed by the mounting losses and capital burn in its foundry operations. Rumors swirl that Broadcom might step in and scoop up Intel’s design arm. But for those who believe in competition, national security, and the long-term integrity of an American technology brand, that outcome would be deeply misguided. Earnings reports from the big three cloud players disappointed investors this week. All three US hyperscalers fell a bit short of consensus for their cloud revenues in the December quarter and investor reaction has been negative. But squinting through the data, there’s a lot to like about the position of AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. In particular, the IaaS and PaaS revenue alone for the big 3 approached $200B in 2024 and grew 25%. All three cited capacity constraints and, along with Meta, are committing more than $300B in CAPEX spend this year, most of it to support current and future AI demand. As is often the case, when a new wave hits it tends to be overhyped at the beginning of the cycle and underestimated when it hits a steady state. And in between points A and B we often see blips and bumps that represent opportunities for long term investors. Make no mistake. We are entering a technology cycle that is completely new. Massively parallel computing and the Gen AI awakening is creating an entirely different industry focus that has altered customer spending patterns. Moreover, this new computing paradigm has changed competitive dynamics almost overnight. Decisions whether to spend tens of billions or hundreds of billions on CAPEX are being challenged by novel approaches to deploying AI. Geopolitical tensions are higher than at any time in the history of tech. While the pace of change appears to be accelerating, causing consternation and confusion, the reality is that broad technology adoption evolves over long periods of time, creating opportunities, risks, and tectonic shifts in industry structures. At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we collaborate with ETR to dig through the latest data and craft ten predictions for the coming year. This year’s batch follows some annual favorites and some new territory. In this Breaking Analysis we put forth our top ten predictions for enterprise tech in 2025 with our usual data-heavy opinions and prognostications. In just two short years, the entire data and technology industry has undergone a seismic shift. Tech stacks—from top to bottom—are being tuned to harness extreme parallel computing, often called Accelerated Computing. From silicon to infrastructure and throughout the software layer, nowhere is this transformation more pronounced than in the data stack. Over the past seven years, modern cloud-native data platforms set the agenda. Today, however, the rise of open table formats, shifting control points, open-source governance catalogs, and a heightened focus on AI are creating both challenges and opportunities for enterprises and the tech providers who serve them. In this special breaking analysis, we’re pleased to host our fourth annual data predictions power panel with some of our collaborators in the Cube Collective and members of the Data Gang. With us today are five of the top industry analysts focused on data platforms. Sanjeev Mohan of Sanjmo, Tony Bear of DB Insight, recent IDC graduate Carl Olofson, Dave Menninger of ISG and Brad Schimmin with Omdia. We are witnessing the rise of a completely new computing era. Within the next decade, a trillion-dollar-plus data center business is poised for transformation, powered by what we refer to as extreme parallel computing (EPC)—or as some prefer to call it, accelerated computing. While artificial intelligence is the primary accelerant, the effects ripple across the entire technology stack. Nvidia sits in the vanguard of this shift, forging an end-to-end platform that integrates hardware, software, systems engineering, and a massive ecosystem. Our view is that Nvidia has a 10-to-20-year runway to drive this transformation, but the market forces at play are much larger than a single player. This new paradigm is about reimagining compute from the ground up: from the chip level to data center equipment, to distributed computing at scale, data and applications stacks and emerging robotics at the edge. The road to agentic AI will be paved with stepping stones that progressively build on each other. Our research suggests that Agentic AI will not suddenly appear without a strong data foundation built on: 1) cloud-like scalability; 2) a unified metadata model; 3) data mesh organizing principles; 4) harmonized data and business process logic; and an orchestration framework that incorporates governance, security and observability. The time for Intel to shed its foundry business is now. While former CEO Pat Gelsinger made a persuasive case for U.S.-based advanced semiconductor manufacturing, his vision was flawed from the start. Intel’s foundry operation, like IBM’s Microelectronics business a decade ago, is an asset with negative value. Yet, its strategic significance for U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor race cannot be overstated. If financial institutions are deemed too big to fail, then Intel’s foundry represents a similarly critical infrastructure for U.S. national interests. AWS re:Invent 2024 ushered in a transformative chapter for both Amazon Web Services and the broader tech ecosystem. This year’s event marked the debut of Matt Garman as CEO of AWS, stepping into a role that aligns with what John Furrier aptly describes as a “wartime CEO”—a technically adept leader and trusted consigliere. Garman’s keynote set the tone for AWS’s strategic focus: doubling down on core infrastructure capabilities across silicon, compute, storage, and networking, while extending its Graviton playbook to GPUs and potentially large language models (LLMs). The inboxes are overflowing once again with predictions about the future of enterprise tech, as we gear up for 2025. While many of these forecasts are insightful, we’ll sift through them carefully before releasing our own predictions later in January of next year. True to tradition, we aim to set a higher bar for our forecasts by focusing on measurable outcomes—whether it’s tied to a specific number or a clear binary result. Our philosophy remains consistent: a good prediction should be testable, enabling us to look back a year later and determine, with confidence and supporting data, whether it held true. In this Breaking Analysis, we evaluate the 2024 predictions we made alongside ETR’s Erik Bradley. We revisit our January forecasts on topics like the macro IT spending environment, GenAI ROI, security, on-prem AI, technology priorities and more. The ever expanding cloud has become ubiquitous. No longer is the cloud some remote set of services, somewhere up in the sky. Rather, the cloud is seeping into every industry, hybrid on-prem models, edge workloads, telco markets and has its sights on space. The market size is staggering and will surpass $1T in revenue when including infrastructure – IaaS and PaaS – SaaS and professional services. Much AI work is being done today in the public cloud and despite indications that bringing AI to on-prem data will be a growing trend, it’s unlikely that the cloud will stop expanding any time soon. Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware is proceeding almost exactly as we expected when the deal was announced in May of 2022. While much of the media and competitor narrative is focused on the increased license fees Broadcom is imposing and the urgency of migrating off VMware, customer conversations and recent surveys show that while migrations are happening, the real story is that VMware’s more narrow focus and cost discipline are allowing Broadcom to integrate VMWare into its highly successful business model. Specifically, we see two seemingly countervailing trends that are both possible to be true: 1) Customers are actively moving many low value workloads off VMware; and 2) Most mission critical work is staying put, allowing Broadcom to dramatically increase the contribution from its software business and deliver a roadmap for customers that will be more cost effective than migrating. Investors have poured north of $30B into independent foundation model players including OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Mistral and others. OpenAI itself has raised more than $20B. To keep pace, both Meta and xAI will have to spend comparable amounts. In our view, the stampeding herd of LLM investors is blindly focused on the false grail of so-called artificial general intelligence AGI. We believe the greatest value capture exists in what we’re calling enterprise AGI, metaphorically represented by the proprietary data estates and managerial know-how locked inside of firms like JP Morgan Chase, and virtually every enterprise. The tools to curate and harness that collective intelligence will allow these firms to capture the majority of value in the race for AI leadership. Gen AI enthusiasm has lately turned to AI skepticism. Lack of clarity on tangible ROI for mainstream businesses, a narrow list of early winners and relentless vendor marketing around AI has caused cynicism and media backlash. But the reality remains that we have entered a new era in technology innovation that has a high probability of transforming industries, public policy, company leadership and the related fortunes of individuals and organizations. Moreover, 97% of leading Gen AI adopters report that they’re achieving tangible benefits from their deployments. Adoption of Gen AI is relentlessly on the rise and nearly two years in, is poised to begin throwing off enough value that it will heighten a mandate to apply AI to drive business results. As such, we believe that as we exit Q4 into 2025, the demand for AI solutions will continue to occupy the headspace of business technology pros and AI momentum will maintain its accelerated pace. It’s estimated that organizations spend more than $200B annually on security hardware, software and services globally. That’s a big number. But consider that the economic impact of cybercrime ranges from $500B – $2T annually. There’s even an estimate from cybersecurity ventures that says the figure is as high as $9.5T. Each year, it seems the more we spend, the more vulnerable we become, which is especially concerning given the exposure to critical infrastructures. Governments around the world have stepped up their involvement with executive orders, privacy regulations and lots of “finger wagging” at the technology industry and its customers. Frankly some of that is justified. The technology industry does much good but has a subpar record at solving this problem. One premise that we’ve put forth at theCUBE Research is that the industry must find ways to better collaborate and share resources to combat cyber threats. Two firms, IBM and Palo Alto Networks, have joined forces to combine deep expertise, AI and platform approach to better protect organizations from attackers. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the security landscape and unpack the multi-dimensional relationship between IBM and Palo Alto Networks to better understand how industry collaboration can improve cyber defenses and modernize security operations. With us are two senior executives from each firm, Mohamad Ali, SVP and Head of IBM Consulting and BJ Jenkins, the President of Palo Alto Networks. Microsoft’s new financial disclosures include changes to the way it reports Azure metrics. The company said the change was to better align Azure with consumption revenue and by inference, more closely aligning with how AWS, the leader in cloud computing infrastructure, reports its metrics. The accounting change removed certain mature, slower growth revenue streams and consequently raised the growth rates for Azure. It also had the effect of increasing the AI services contribution within Azure. While this was reported and often applauded in the media and financial circles, what wasn’t widely discussed is that while such a change increases growth rates, by definition it reduces the size of the Azure business and its resulting revenue market share. Regardless, in our view, Microsoft is comfortable that the future AI revenue contribution within Azure combined with both higher growth rates and a greater AI contribution will foster greater investor confidence and enthusiasm over time. They’re probably correct. Data from recent surveys shows that the scenarios we’ve been putting forth throughout 2024 continue to be in play. Specifically, we cite three main dynamics affecting the tech spending climate, including: 1) IT budgets continue to be constrained as; 2) GenAI is being funded by stealing from other budget buckets; and 3) The ROI for AI initiatives remains tepid, as expectations for break even continue to be pushed out to the right. Nonetheless, customers remain highly optimistic about the prospects for AI driving productivity improvements. Moreover, the cloud remains a key ingredient in supporting AI workloads. We believe the AI center of gravity for enterprise value creation is shifting from LLMs to SLMs. Where the S not only stands for small but encompasses a system of small, specialized, secure and sovereign models. Moreover, we see LLMs and SLMs evolving to become agentic, hence SAM – i.e. small action models. In our view, it’s the collection of these “S-models,” combined with an emerging data harmonization layer, that will enable systems of agents to work in concert and create high impact business outcomes. These multi-agent systems will completely reshape the software industry generally and more specifically, unleash a new productivity paradigm for organizations globally. Technology generally and big tech specifically are regularly cited by politicians, media and governments around the world as the root of many societal problems today. Accusations like privacy invaders, fake news amplifiers, job destroyers, discriminators and more are commonly lobbed at technology firms with little recognition for the substantial value large tech companies have delivered over the decades. Moreover, many powerful government officials have rewritten the history of effective government oversight and are attempting to apply antitrust law in novel ways that have virtually killed M&A and threaten to stifle American exceptionalism and innovation. For over a decade we’ve been sounding the alarm on Intel. Five years ago, like some on Wall Street, we recommended a strategy to recreate Intel by splitting up its design and manufacturing divisions. Most recently we posited that a miracle would be needed for Intel to achieve its aspirations of becoming a viable number two foundry by 2030. The majority of industry pundits have finally come to the realization that Intel’s current path is unsustainable. However some still feel that splitting Intel’s fabs from its design business doesn’t make sense. We disagree. Oracle Corporation is seeing renewed business momentum powered by a combination of an entrenched database business, years of investment in cloud infrastructure, an integrated application suite and AI technologies that are being infused throughout its product line. This includes its autonomous database, 23ai, Exadata/Exascale, other Oracle infrastructure and its vast applications portfolio. Oracle has a highly differentiated strategy that is hitting on most if not all cylinders. And it appears the best is yet to come. It’s one reason that, year to date, the stock is up 54%, compared to the Nasdaq which is up 19% as of the recording of this recording. Input from theCUBE and data practitioner communities suggests that acceleration in compute performance and the sophistication of the modern data stack (MDS) is outpacing the needs of many traditional analytic workloads. Most analytics workloads today are performed on small data sets and generally can run on a single node, somewhat neutralizing the value of distributed, highly scalable data platforms. As We believe enterprise applications are undergoing a profound change. By next year, highly capable agentic systems will emerge to create new application classes and alter the way organizations think about their backend systems, data platforms and user interfaces. The extent of the transformation, we believe, will be more impactful to the application stack than were the changes brought about by innovations seen during the modern GUI, Web, cloud and mobile eras. Customers and partners are pivoting to address Broadcom’s swift changes to its VMware packaging, pricing and partnership programs. Our data suggests customers and MSPs have moved beyond the emotional shock phase to implementing their options in earnest. Our advice to large VMware customers has been to evaluate your ELA expiration and work backwards from that timeframe. Isolate core workloads that The investor community is realizing that the return on invested capital for the AI buildout is going to take some time. The payback period for enterprise AI investments is not akin to the dopamine rush from completing a great workout. This realization combined with several other macro factors, has caused the big AI names to pullback hard recently. But the The so-called modern data stack is getting a facelift and perhaps a complete body makeover. As the point of control shifts from the DBMS to the governance layer we cite three dynamics that highlight a reshaping of today’s data landscape, including: 1) Key data players are disrupting the established norm as they expand their aspirations; 2) Data platform vendors used Three main pressure points are transforming the modern data landscape: 1) Increased interest in adopting open table formats to allow any compute to operate on any data; 2) The point of control is shifting from the DBMS to the governance layer; and 3) AI is enabling the emergence of a new class of intelligent data apps that promise to radically automate business processes and drive unprecedented levels of productivity. The chaos caused by yesterday’s CrowdStrike content update shows that even the most successful cybersecurity firms with great management, award-winning products and a growing business, are exposed to unexpected events. What’s even more important is that it underscores the fragility of our connected world and the critical infrastructure that makes it run. Virtually every industry, and who knows how many AI continues to lead all enterprise IT sectors by a wide margin in terms of spending momentum. But that momentum has not led to an across the board boost in productivity or meaningful revenue gains for firms. Specifically, the adoption of Gen AI is increasing steadily but the use cases are not yet self-funding. As such, the outlook for IT spending, while slowly improving in the second half of 2024, remains constrained. In this Breaking Analysis we share our thoughts on the emerging trends around agentic AI. We’ll define what it is, how agentic builds on (and is additive to) generative AI, what’s missing to make it real, what the stack components look like and some of the likely players in the space. As customers try to “get AI right,” the need to rationalize siloed data becomes increasingly important. Data practitioners could put all their data eggs into a single platform basket, but that’s proving impractical. As such, firms are moving to an open model where they maintain control of their data and can bring any compute engine to any of their data. While compelling, the capabilities to govern open data across an entire estate remain immature. Regardless, the move toward open table formats is gaining traction and the point of control in the data platform wars is shifting from the database to the governance catalog. Earnings prints from the likes of Dell, Supermicro and more recently HPE have shown the AI server trend is not just benefiting cloud hyperscalers but also firms with large on-premises installed bases. Oracle as well is trading at an all time high citing cloud momentum and recent deals with Google, OpenAI and prior deals with Microsoft. But make no mistake, Snowflake Summit 2024 marks the next chapter in the company’s history with new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy taking center stage, driving even faster product innovation and an ambitious TAM expansion strategy. Snowflake has moved beyond being a friendly and simpler data warehouse to tackling new problems including how to bring AI value to enterprise customers, helping ecosystem partners monetize and providing tools and services to build AI-powered enterprise data apps. Snowflake is at a crossroads. The company, which defined the modern data platform, now faces fresh challenges on four fronts. Specifically, Snowflake must: 1) advance its data cloud vision; 2) transform into an AI leader; 3) become a platform for data apps; and 4) address external market forces that pressure its core values of simplicity, efficiency, and trusted data. In this research we quantify the semiconductor ecosystem which we believe is being led by a transition to AI. Four companies stand out including NVIDIA, TSMC, Broadcom and Qualcomm to make up 45% of a $900B market by 2028. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, ahead of IBM Think and Dell Technologies World, we shine a spotlight on these two firms as leading examples of hybrid AI players that we believe will benefit from the AI wave that is upon us. And of course we’ll share several survey data points from ETR to support our assertions. RSAC 2024 was crowded, buzzy, vibrant and chaotic, underscoring the very nature of the cybersecurity industry. This market has a kind of self-propelling energy with a dynamic that blends tons of money, an ever-present and capable adversary, technical innovation, public policy, geopolitics, and a smashing together of the digital and physical worlds. In this Breaking Analysis we introduce you to Blue Yonder, a builder of digital supply chain management solutions that we believe represents an emerging example of intelligent data applications. Organizations continue to spend more on security with 87% of firms expecting to increase spend on cyber in the next twelve months. But are we safer? It’s estimated that firms on average have between 60-75 security tools installed. While leading vendors logically market the benefits of addressing tools sprawl and complexity through consolidation, the data suggests that more than half the firms are increasing the number of security vendors installed with a very small percentage able to affect vendor consolidation. In another big week we saw the AI battles continue to escalate. Google reorged to better focus on AI, Meta’s Llama 3 was released, TSM is doubling its manufacturing capacity for NVIDIA high end chips, Samsung got a $6.4B tranche of the chips act money, a Microsoft paper describes VASA-1 that turns photos into a kinda creepy talking head, Mistral Enterprises are fighting a dual mandate of operating inside a tight IT budget envelope while at the same time transforming their organization into an AI-first company. Navigating macroeconomic headwinds while driving innovation is an exciting challenge for IT decision makers. To deliver the goods, technology leaders are stealing from other budgets to fund AI, finding quick wins with fairly unspectacular AWS’ AI strategy combines foundation model optionality from partners with its own innovations across a three layered AI stack. In this Breaking Analysis we review takeaways from our AI field trip to NYC. Adobe Summit 2024 put highlighted AI powered digital experiences and personalization at scale. By applying AI, Adobe showed off its ability to bring custom experiences to the masses and do so with trusted, enterprise-grade content. Adobe’s TAM is approaching $300B and the company is demonstrating the ability to monetize AI at scale. We attended both NVIDIA GTC and Broadcom’s investor day this week where the AI platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. When you think of AI leadership, which companies come to mind? NVIDIA, OpenAI, the hyperscalers, Meta, Hugging Face, Anthropic and names like that, right? You don’t typically think of Broadcom do you? You should. Many people question whether the current AI boom will end in the same way that the dotcom bubble burst. It’s understandable as there are many similarities, especially with the exuberance seen this past week in the stock market following NVIDIA’s earnings print. The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, i.e. a capability that allows a globally consistent, real time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and non-relational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. Predictions become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true– ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Recent spending intentions data from more than 1,700 IT decision makers indicates that executives expect technology budgets to grow at 4.3% this year. That’s up from roughly 3.5% in 2023 and is higher than the expectation in October which was 3.8%. But the forecasts for 2024 are backend loaded. Moreover, while some sectors such as energy and regions like APAC With George Gilbert We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with With Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer, Carl Olofson, Dave Menninger and Doug Henschen In the words of famous people like Nobel laureate Neils Bohr and baseball legend Yogi Berra, predictions are very difficult, especially if they’re about the future. In this special Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to host our third annual data predictions power panel with some of our collaborators in Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them The rapid awareness and adoption of AI has increased concerns around security, governance, compliance and business risk. The digital business imperative to improve customer experience combined with a vastly more complex technology environment, comprising multiple clouds, IoT, containers, app integration and the popularity of open source, are driving need for better observability across technology stacks. But fragmented IT environments, lack Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, With George Gilbert We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s With George Gilbert Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to Episode 207 Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by Cisco’s $28B acquisition of Splunk represents a good outcome for Splunk and a strategic growth opportunity for Cisco. Splunk’s painful transition to a cloud and subscription pricing model was largely through the knot hole as seen by its margins and recent P&L performance. But questions remained with respect to its growth prospects and competitiveness in the hot observability space. For Cisco’s $28B acquisition of Splunk represents a good outcome for Splunk and a strategic growth opportunity for Cisco. Splunk’s painful transition to a cloud and subscription pricing model was largely through the knot hole as seen by its margins and recent P&L performance. But questions remained with respect to its growth prospects and competitiveness in the hot observability space. For With George Gilbert The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, realtime system. The premise is that increasingly, George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this With George Gilbert and Rob Strechay At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. With George Gilbert Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent With Rob Strechay and Zeus Kerravala The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware.

Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates.

Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration With George Gilbert, Rob Strechay & Andy Thurai The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, With George Gilbert Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data With Rob Strechay & Andy Thurai HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business.

But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley With Andy Thurai, VP & Principal Analyst, Constellation Research The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of AI raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing.

Once hopeful that the security industry would be shielded from macroeconomic conditions, the past year has been painful for many investors with some exceptions – most notably those investors who stuck with Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet. That On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll An AI-powered rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over The financial services industry has always been a leading consumer of tech with big IT budgets. The recent banking crisis will add even more headwinds to the already challenging IT spending climate and several tech firms are exposed. In particular, we believe those companies with a higher than average mix of business in financial sectors, combined with decelerating spend momentum The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and With George Gilbert When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC.

The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most With Erik Bradley, ETR Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not.

They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2021 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, With Andy Thurai, VP & Principal Analyst, Constellation Research A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities.

AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0.

The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up The following definition is the result of direct and indirect feedback from more than fifty technology experts, practitioners, consultants, analysts and business leaders. The methodology used to develop this definition was to put forth a premise about a new architectural framework called supercloud and iterate the definition with community input over a nine month period. The primary input for this With David Floyer While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger The rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Today we’ll address the following frequently asked questions: 1. In an industry full of hype and buzzwords, why After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. But judging by the attendance and enthusiasm at Despite fears of inflation, supply chain issues, skyrocketing energy and home prices and global instability caused by the Ukraine crisis, CIOs and IT buyers continue to expect overall spending to increase more than 6% in 2022. While this is lower than our 8% prediction made in January of this year, it remains in line with last year’s roughly 6-7% growth Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches.

The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it?

As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it.

Every With Erik Bradley The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional In the 2010s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon Despite the more than $100B spent each year fighting cybercrime, when we do an end of year look back and ask, “how did we do” — the answer is invariably the same; worse than last year. Pre-pandemic, the picture was disheartening. But since March of 2020 the situation has only worsened as cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated, better funded and Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy.

Specifically, 44% of roughly 700 executives surveyed believe revenue declines will continue through most of 2020 with growth returning next year. This is a key finding of the latest flash survey data from ETR. Not surprisingly however, the shape of the recovery will be mixed and vary substantially by CIOs and IT execs report strong RPA adoption plans in a post-pandemic environment. We’ve been reporting that the COVID pandemic has created a bifurcated IT spending outlook. Legacy on-prem infrastructure and traditional software licensing models are giving way to approaches that enable more flexibility and business agility. Automation initiatives that reduce human labor that is not value add has been gaining AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Momentum in the Post-COVID Era Analysis from company earnings reports and customer surveys continues to show that Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are closing the gap on AWS’ cloud dominance. While reporting definitions of cloud remain fuzzy, it’s clear that the big three U.S. cloud players are leading the steady march into the The COVID-19 pandemic has created a bifurcated IT spending climate. Several vendors taking advantage of cloud and work from home tailwinds are thriving while others relying on legacy stacks and maintenance streams are struggling to show momentum. This story of the haves and have nots is playing out in several sectors that we examine in this week’s Breaking Analysis.

This according to the latest survey data and analysis by ETR. While the drop represents a 900 basis swing from 4% consensus growth entering 2020, tech spending remains bifurcated with some suppliers and sectors showing significantly stronger spending momentum than others. How CIOs and CISOs are Taking the COVID-19 Budget Hit CIOs and CISOs in some of the hardest hit industries see significant near-term and many permanent shifts to their IT and security strategies. This was the consensus of four technology executives at leading companies that are feeling the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic.

Implications for IoT, Intel and the three tiered edge… Arm (formerly ARM) today announced it has acquired Treasure Data, a cloud-based big data management company. Bloomberg reported the transaction value, which was not disclosed by the companies, at $600M. Arm is Premise Server SAN continues to grow fast, and is projected to replace most traditional storage arrays by 2026. Wikibon projects Enterprise Hyperscale Server SAN will migrate to True Private Cloud (TPC) Server SAN. Wikibon also projects that True Private Cloud Server SAN will make some headway together with Hyperscale Server SAN in public cloud storage. Definitions for the Wikibon Server SAN classifications are Premise. The digital twin programming concept will extend well beyond IoT. It presents a richer representation of real things that traditional programming technologies. Users need conventions for core concepts and how they fit together. In our conversations with the Wikibon community, we hear both interest and confusion regarding the notion of digital twins. We believe digital twins will have enormous If you’ve been following IBM’s strategic moves over the past 6 months in data and analytics, it’s hard not to have some concerns. The announcements they’ve been making this year err on the side of excessive caution. What they illustrate is IBM Analytics’ ongoing retrenchment into mainframes, private clouds, and end-to-end data governance. IBM seems to be re-crafting its core Wikibon projects that 3D XPoint will not make it in volume in either the enterprise or consumer markets; it may reside in some specialist application niches. The areas of uniqueness claimed for 3D XPoint will be addressed by DRAM, 3D NAND, and innovative non-volatile combinations of DRAM and 3D NAND. CIOs and CTOs should assume 3D XPoint will NOT be important to the enterprise, and not evaluate it further. The focus should be on deployment of 3D NAND technologies, and expect a rapid cadence of increases in performance, density, form factor, and volume. Hybrid DIMMs with DRAM and 3D NAND should also be evaluated as the technologies mature, as well as UniGrid Architectures. Premise By mid 2018, 3D NAND will become the backbone of almost all deliveries and all vendors of NAND flash, to both the consumer and enterprise markets, with a clear path to increased density, higher performance, and decreasing cost. Consumer NAND announcements are a leading indicator of enterprise NAND capabilities. Toshiba Consumer SSD NAND Announcement The concept of Private Cloud has been in the market since 2008, but the ability of IT organizations to build Private Cloud services that match Public Cloud have been limited. Wikibon forecasts the Private Cloud market revenues from 2015-2026, as well as introducing the enhanced concept of “True” Private Cloud. As more companies transition into digital businesses, it is critical to understand the business and technology trends that will shape Cloud Computing for the next decade. Wikibon examines the critical elements to help companies understand this rapidly evolving landscape and marketplace. Customers are asking how to choose from the rich and growing array of tools in the Hadoop ecosystem. Part of the consideration centers on how to insulate them from fragmentation in the continually evolving Hadoop ecosystem. The incredibly rapid pace of innovation distinguishes the ecosystem but it also has its downsides. The mix and match richness of choice introduces complexity for administrators and developers. At some point it makes sense for customers to consider investing in tools that can hide much of that complexity in data ready for analysis. To be clear, there is no magic product that can hide all these technologies. But when customers take the perspective of simplifying specific end-to-end processes, solutions are available to address the problem. IT leaders can no longer treat stream processors as esoteric functionality employed solely by leading-edge consumer Internet services. They are becoming core functionality that works side-by-side with the more familiar batch processing engines such as Hive, HBase, or Impala. Application developers that need near real-time functionality can start to evaluate stream processors as part of design patterns. However, their analytics functionality is still a bit primitive and most of them need a lot of hardening in order to be resilient enough for mainstream customers.

Application developers that need near real-time functionality can start to evaluate stream processors as part of design patterns. However, their analytics functionality is still a bit primitive and most of them need a lot of hardening in order to be resilient enough for mainstream customers. Wikibon Research has forecasted Public Cloud revenues from 2015 through 2026; with the expectations that 33% of all IT spending ($500B) will move to Public Cloud services within the next decade. The impact this will have on IT vendors and IT strategy will be significant as more applications focus on mobile and real-time data analytics. In this research paper, Wikibon looks back at the introductory Server SAN research, adjusts the Server SAN definition to include System Drag, and increases the speed of adoption of Server SAN based on very fast adoption from 2012 to 2014. The overall growth of Server SAN is projected to be about a 23% CAGR from 2014 to 2026, with a faster growth from 2014 to 2020 of 38%. The total Server SAN market is projected to grow to over $48 billion by 2026. The traditional enterprise storage market is projected to decline by -16% CAGR, leading to an overall growth in storage spend of 3% CAGR through 2026. Traditional enterprise storage is being squeezed in a vice between a superior, lower cost and more flexible storage model with Enterprise Server SAN, and the migration of IT towards cloud computing and Hyperscale Server SAN deployments. Wikibon strongly recommends that CTOs & CIOs initiate Server SAN pilot projects in 2015, particularly for applications where either low cost or high performance is required. Mainstream IT, LoB execs and application development professionals each provide different yet critical perspectives to Systems of Intelligence. IT exes must be in a position to deliver the right infrastructure (e.g. cloud, on-prem, etc.) with the proper performance and SLA profile to support LoB requirements. Line-of-Business execs must have enough knowledge to specify the real-time needs of applications while application development pros must ensure the right skills are in place to deliver and maintain services to Systems of Intelligence over a full life cycle. The Big Data market continued its maturation in 2014, experiencing both significant growth as measured by vendor revenue and increased adoption of Big Data tools and technologies by large enterprises across vertical markets. In this exclusive report for Wikibon Premium members, Wikibon details Big Data vendor revenue and extends its groundbreaking market forecast through 2020. Converged infrastructure is a trend that has been growing for over 5 years and is rapidly transforming the way that users consume IT. In 2012, Wikibon forecasted (see Converged Infrastructure Takes the Market By Storm) that 2/3 of infrastructure for enterprise applications would be packaged as some form of converged infrastructure by 2017. Now there are billions of dollars of Hortonworks plans to go public in 2015 and its S-1 filing, revealed to the world yesterday, says a lot about the state of the Hadoop market generally and, obviously, Hortonworks specifically. First, a mea culpa.

The company’s fourth quarter results were particularly weak, coming in 5.5% below expectations. This was due in large part to IBM’s struggling hardware business, with revenue dropping a staggering 27%. Much of the blame can be attributed to the cloud, or I should say to IBM’s slowness IBM’s annual revenue last year dropped below $100 billion for the first time since 2010.

Much of the blame can be attributed to the cloud, or I should say to See Wikibon’s software-led infrastructure page for more on how converged infrastructure fits into the SDDC at Wikibon.com/SLI. Converged Infrastructure Moving to Early Majority The growth of converged infrastructure solutions is impossible to miss in conversations across the marketplace (see videos from the recent VMworld conference). Customers, however, are not looking to buy “convergence”; rather, IT is in desperate need for solutions While VMware is still dominant in the x86 server virtualization market, there are clear signs that the hypervisor is being commoditized and that competing solutions are closing the functionality gap. Over half of respondents to Wikibon’s survey last year were running multiple hypervisors. Wikibon is digging deeper into customer adoption including both multi-hypervisor environments and what is driving customers to Web Giant Targets the Cloud Google has spent the last 14 years building one of the largest networks and most scalable architectures in the world. The Google Compute Engine (GCE) is a public cloud now generally available that brings Google’s architecture to the masses. While it is undeniable that Google has immense resources (having spent over $2.9B on infrastructure) and The research behind this article drills down into the database components, Big Data SQL database revenue, and Big Data NoSQL database revenue. The total represents 10.4% of total Big Data in 2012, and remains at about 10% of total through 2017. Last week at the Open Compute Summit Winter 2013 event, Facebook shared insight into its IT infrastructure. While hyperscale companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are quite different from the typical enterprise, it is Wikibon’s belief that those companies are driving key changes to how infrastructure is consumed that will filter down to the service provider and enterprise worlds in the Providing effective business analytics tools and technologies to the enterprise is a top priority of CIOs and for good reason. Effective business analytics – from basic reporting to advanced data mining and predictive analytics — allows data analysts and business users alike to extract insights from corporate data that, when translated into action, deliver higher levels of efficiency and profitability to the enterprise. Underlying every business analytics practice is data. Traditionally, this meant structured data created and stored by enterprises themselves, such as customer data housed in CRM applications, operational data stored in ERP systems or financial data tallied in accounting databases. But the volume and type of data now available to enterprises — and the need to analyze it in near-real time for maximum business value — is growing rapidly thanks to the popularity of social media and networking services like Facebook and Twitter, data-generating sensor equipped and networked devices, both machine- and human-generated online transactions, and other sources of unstructured and semi-structured data. We call this Big Data.

URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/15/how-lly-stock-delivered-47-billion-to-shareholders/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In the last decade, Eli Lilly stock (NYSE: LLY) has returned $47 billion to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-centric approach has delivered solid results in 2025, with the stock posting 9% year-to-date returns, despite experiencing some volatility from its peak of $937 earlier in the year, while demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of increased competition in the diabetes and obesity treatment markets. Eli Lilly's commitment to rewarding shareholders reached new heights with the board's approval of a massive $15 billion share repurchase program in December 2024, replacing the completed $5 billion buyback and representing one of the largest capital return initiatives in pharmaceutical industry history. The diabetes and obesity treatment leader further reinforced its shareholder-first philosophy by announcing a 15% dividend increase for the seventh consecutive year, raising the quarterly dividend from $1.30 to $1.50 per share, bringing the annual dividend to $6.00 and yielding approximately 0.74% at current levels. Eli Lilly’s exceptional financial performance has been driven by the blockbuster success of its GLP-1 medications Mounjaro and Zepbound, with 2024 revenues reaching $45.04 billion (up 32% year-over-year) and earnings of $10.59 billion (up 102%), providing the robust cash generation that enables both aggressive share buybacks and consistent dividend growth while maintaining substantial R&D investments for pipeline advancement. These two drugs alone accounted for $11.5 billion in total sales last year, and in the first half of 2025, this figure has surged 115% y-o-y to $14.5 billion. Let’s look at some numbers and compare how this payout power stacks up against the market's biggest capital-return machines. Interestingly, LLY stock ranks 58th in history in total shareholder returns. Why does this matter? Because dividends and buybacks represent direct returns to shareholders and reflect management’s confidence in future cash generation. Many companies follow this strategy. Below is a list of the top 10 companies by total capital returned through dividends and repurchases. While that’s one perspective, Trefis High Quality Portfolio considers many more factors to help reduce company-specific risk while maintaining growth exposure. For the complete list, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking. Key takeaway: Total shareholder returns as a percentage of market cap often appear inversely related to growth potential. Companies like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding faster and more predictably but have returned smaller proportions of their value to shareholders. That’s the trade-off: attractive capital returns can sometimes come at the cost of growth. Keeping that in mind, let’s examine Eli Lilly’s fundamentals. (See Buy or Sell Eli Lilly Stock for more.) That’s a solid snapshot, but a complete investment evaluation requires a broader view. That’s exactly what the Trefis High Quality Portfolio delivers—balancing lower risk with upside exposure. Still, Lilly isn’t immune to volatility. It dropped 51% during the Global Financial Crisis and 43% in the Dot-Com bubble. Even during more recent events—the 2018 correction, inflation shock, and Covid pandemic—it declined between 18% and 22%. So, while fundamentals remain strong, the stock can still see notable drawdowns during market downturns. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio of 30 stocks has consistently outperformed major benchmarks such as the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000. Why? Collectively, HQ stocks have offered higher returns with lower volatility—a smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: AVGO Stock AI Jackpot: $51B Shareholder Returns
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/avgo-stock-ai-jackpot-51b-shareholder-returns/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:40:46Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has returned an impressive $51 billion to its investors through direct cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-focused strategy has delivered extraordinary results in 2025, with the stock posting a remarkable 50% year-to-date return, dramatically outperforming the broader market and establishing AVGO as one of the year’s most compelling semiconductor investments despite recent volatility. See – What’s Behind The Surge In Broadcom’s Stock? – for more details. Broadcom's commitment to consistent income generation continues through its steady quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, maintaining an annualized dividend of $2.36 that yields approximately 0.68%, with the company successfully sustaining 13 consecutive years of dividend increases since becoming a public company. The semiconductor giant's robust capital allocation was significantly amplified in April 2025 when the board authorized a massive $10 billion share repurchase program running through December 31, 2025, reflecting management's confidence in the company's strong cash flow generation and its dominant position in AI infrastructure and mission-critical software. Broadcom’s exceptional financial performance has been underpinned by robust revenue growth, with Q3 2025 revenues reaching $16 billion and generating an impressive free cash flow of $7 billion (44% of revenue), while Q4 guidance of $17.4 billion represents a 24% year-over-year increase driven by accelerating demand for AI semiconductors and infrastructure software solutions. Let’s examine some statistics and evaluate how this payout capability compares to the market’s leading capital-return powerhouses. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd largest return to shareholders in history. Why should you care? This is because dividends and share buybacks signify direct and tangible returns of capital to investors. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s financial well-being and its capacity to generate sustainable cash flows. Furthermore, there are numerous other stocks with similar characteristics. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by the total capital returned to investors via dividends and stock repurchases. For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you observe here? The overall capital returned to investors as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a quicker pace, in a more predictable manner, compared to others, yet they have delivered a significantly lower percentage of their market valuation to stockholders. That’s the downside to substantial capital returns. While they are appealing, one must reflect on the question: Am I forfeiting growth and robust fundamentals? Keeping that in perspective, let’s analyze some figures for AVGO. (see Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for further details) Nonetheless, AVGO isn’t immune to significant declines. It experienced a drop of nearly 48% during the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 35% in the 2021 inflation shock, and around 27% in the 2018 correction. Even with robust fundamentals, it’s apparent that the stock can endure substantial setbacks when the market shifts. Quality companies still suffer when investor sentiment changes dramatically. However, the risk isn't restricted to considerable market declines. Stocks can decrease even when markets are favorable – consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. To understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp downturns in the past, read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
