With MSCI freeze blocking automatic buys, Strategy must pivot to active investors for new funding, challenging its Bitcoin acquisition model. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The threat of a massive forced sell-off in crypto-linked equities has been averted. However, that reprieve comes with a structural catch that fundamentally alters the economics of the “Bitcoin Treasury” trade. On Jan. 6, the dominant benchmark provider for global equity and ETF markets, MSCI Inc., announced it will retain “Digital Asset Treasury Companies” (DATCOs) in its global indices for the February 2026 review, sparing firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) from expulsion. It stated: “For the time being, the current index treatment of DATCOs identified in the preliminary list published by MSCI of companies whose digital asset holdings represent 50% or more of their total assets will remain unchanged.” Following the news, Michael Saylor, Strategy's executive chairman, touted the victory of remaining in the benchmark. However, the index provider has simultaneously introduced a technical freeze on share counts for these entities. It explained: “MSCI will not implement increases to the Number of Shares (NOS), Foreign Inclusion Factor (FIF) or Domestic Inclusion Factor (DIF) for these securities. MSCI will defer any additions or size-segment migrations for all securities included in the preliminary list.” Through this decision, MSCI has effectively severed the link between new equity issuance and automatic passive buying. This move simply meant the “downside” of a forced liquidation has been removed, but the “upside” mechanics of the index trade have been dismantled The immediate market reaction, a surge of over 6% in Strategy’s stock, reflected relief that a catastrophic liquidity event was off the table. Notably, JPMorgan suggested that a full exclusion could have triggered between $3 billion and $9 billion in passive selling of MSTR. MSCI consultation paper and JPMorgan's positioning resulting in some major fallout across social media to defend DATs like Strategy. This volume would likely have crushed the stock price and forced the liquidation of Bitcoin holdings. However, the removed threat of exclusion masks a new reality where the automatic demand lever for the stocks is gone. Historically, when Strategy issued new shares to fund Bitcoin acquisitions, the index provider would eventually update the share count. As a result, passive funds tracking the index were then mathematically compelled to buy a pro rata portion of the new issuance to minimize tracking error. This created a guaranteed, price-insensitive source of demand that helped absorb dilution. Under the new “freeze” policy, this loop is broken. Even if Strategy significantly expands its float to raise capital, MSCI will effectively ignore those new shares for index calculation purposes. The company’s weight in the index will not increase, and consequently, ETFs and index funds will not be forced to buy the new paper. Market analysts note that this shift forces a return to fundamentals. Without the backstop of benchmark-tracking demand, Strategy and its peers must now rely on active managers, hedge funds, and retail investors to absorb new supply. To understand the magnitude of this shift, market researchers are modeling the “lost bid” that issuers must now navigate. Bull Theory, a crypto research firm, quantified this liquidity gap in a note to clients. The firm posited a hypothetical scenario involving a treasury company with 200 million outstanding shares, of which roughly 10% are typically held by passive index trackers. In the Bull Theory model, if that company issues 20 million new shares to raise capital, the old index mechanics would eventually mandate that passive funds purchase 2 million of those shares. At a theoretical price point of $300 per share, that represents $600 million of automatic, price-insensitive buying pressure. Under MSCI’s new freeze, Bull Theory noted that the $600 million bid falls to zero. Considering this, it stated: “Strategy now must find private buyers, offer discounts, or raise less money.” This means that the forced demand from index funds has been eliminated. Thus, it presents a significant hurdle for Strategy, which issued more than $15 billion in new shares throughout 2025 to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin. The arbitrage trade allowing firms to print equity for crypto is dead, leaving their $60 billion hoard structurally exposed. If the company attempts to replicate that scale of issuance in 2026, it will do so in a market void of passive support. Without that structural bid, the risk of a price correction during dilution events increases significantly. MSCI's decision to cap these companies rather than expel them or leave them alone has also significantly altered the competitive dynamics in the asset management sector. Over the past year, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have matured as an asset class and have seen significant institutional interest. In fact, this rise led MSCI's former parent company, Morgan Stanley, to file for its own Spot Bitcoin ETF. From this vantage point, Strategy competes with these fee-bearing Bitcoin ETFs, offering investors a way to gain passive Bitcoin exposure through an operating company structure. By freezing the index weighting of DATCOs, the new rule degrades their ability to efficiently scale via equity markets. If Strategy’s ability to raise cheap capital is curtailed, large allocators may rotate capital out of the corporate equity and into Spot ETFs, which do not carry the operational risks of a company or the premium-to-NAV volatility. This flow of funds would directly benefit issuers of spot ETFs, including major Wall Street banks, effectively capturing the fees previously reflected in equity premiums. Inflows hit $697 million in days, yet the charts remain frozen because structured demand is neutralizing the rally. By neutering the “flywheel” effect of the treasury strategy, the index provider may have inadvertently, or intentionally, leveled the playing field in favor of traditional asset management products.

Title: Can Retirees Count on QYLD’s Amazing 11% Dividend Any More?

Investing QYLD’s annual distributions have dropped 24% from $2.67 per share in 2021 to roughly $2.04 in 2025. QYLD returned 44% over five years while QQQ delivered 100%. The covered call strategy sacrificed over half the market’s gains. JEPQ uses active management to adjust option coverage instead of selling calls on 100% of holdings. It yields 9% with better total returns. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Inside Creative House / Shutterstock.com The Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (NYSEARCA:QYLD) has attracted income-seeking investors with its impressive 11% yield, but recent trends suggest retirees should approach this fund with caution. The sustainability of this income stream faces meaningful headwinds. QYLD produces income through a covered call strategy on the NASDAQ 100 index. The fund holds the same tech-heavy stocks as the index—with top positions including NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) (9.2%), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) (8.1%), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (7.3%)—but simultaneously sells call options on these holdings. When investors buy these call options, they pay premiums that become the fund’s primary income source. This generates consistent monthly cash flow but caps upside potential when markets rally. QYLD’s distribution history reveals a troubling pattern. Annual payouts have declined 24% from their 2021 peak of $2.67 per share to approximately $2.04 in 2025. Monthly payments now fluctuate between $0.16 and $0.19, reflecting the volatility-dependent nature of option premium income. When market volatility drops—as it has during recent periods of steady gains—the premiums QYLD can collect shrink accordingly. The mechanics are straightforward: covered call funds cannot grow dividends like traditional dividend stocks. They can only redistribute the option income they collect, which varies with market conditions. In low-volatility bull markets, QYLD’s income generation weakens. More concerning for retirees is QYLD’s massive underperformance relative to simply holding the NASDAQ 100. Over the past five years, QYLD returned 44% while the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) delivered 100%—a 56 percentage point gap. Even accounting for QYLD’s distributions, investors sacrificed more than half the market’s gains. The 10-year comparison is starker: QYLD’s 131% total return versus QQQ’s 447%. As Seeking Alpha analyst The Alpha Analyst noted in October 2025, “GPIQ’s active and flexible coverage is shown to outperform QYLD in various market conditions, offering better upside capture and reasonable downside protection.” Newer covered call strategies with dynamic approaches are now outpacing QYLD’s static methodology. The JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) employs an actively managed equity-linked notes strategy that provides similar income—currently yielding around 9%—while maintaining more flexibility to participate in market gains. The fund’s active approach allows managers to adjust option coverage based on market conditions rather than mechanically selling calls on 100% of holdings. With lower expenses and stronger total returns than QYLD, JEPQ represents an evolution in covered call strategies that addresses many of QYLD’s structural limitations. For income investors in 2026, JEPQ offers a more balanced approach to generating yield without completely sacrificing growth potential. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Investing Under Armour Inc. (NYSE: UAA), W.R. Berkley Corp. (NYSE: WRB), and Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust (NYSE: GRX) have just seen some huge insider purchases. However, there were some other notable insider purchases as well. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Brandon Bell / Getty Images News via Getty Images The so-called Warren Buffett of Canada and a prominent American billionaire investor and financial analyst started the year with huge insider purchases. Some of the most prominent buying that has been reported so far this year were from return trips to build stakes in Under Armour Inc. (NYSE: UAA), W.R. Berkley Corp. (NYSE: WRB), and Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust (NYSE: GRX). Though these were the most prominent insider purchases, there were a handful of other notable ones as well. Let’s take a quick look at these transactions. What does insider buying tell us? A well-known adage reminds us that corporate insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company because they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. Thus, insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors. This is especially so during times of market uncertainty, and even when markets are near all-time highs. The fourth-quarter earnings-reporting season is yet to begin, so few insiders are prohibited from buying or selling shares. Below are some of the most notable insider purchases that were reported recently, starting with the largest and most prominent. This buyer, led by billionaire V. Prem Watsa, sometimes called the Warren Buffett of Canada, also scooped up $70 million worth of shares prior to this purchase. The stake is now up to more than 41.9 million shares, and the investment helped boost the stock still suffering after the brand parted ways with spokesperson Steph Curry. Shares were last seen trading for more than the purchase price range above. The stock is still more than 23% lower than six months ago. Given the Wall Street consensus target of $6.07, the analysts anticipate 8.2% upside in the next 12 months. However, only five of 26 analysts recommend buying shares. Guggenheim initiated coverage recently with a Buy rating with a $6 price target. Watsa, founder and CEO of Fairfax, maintains a controlling interest in the company but reportedly is stepping back from some roles to plan for succession. Last spring, this buyer reached an agreement to acquire 15% of W.R. Berkley’s shares. Mitsui Sumitomo expects to complete its investment in this Connecticut-based insurance holding company during the first quarter of 2026. Its stake is up to more than 50.7 million shares, or over 13%. The share price was last seen within the buyer’s latest purchase price range. Yet, the stock is 2.6% lower than six months ago because of recent volatility due to profit-taking. But note that shares are up 20.2% year over year, outperforming the S&P 500 in that time. Analysts are cautious, with only four out of 18 of them recommending buying shares. The mean price target of $73.06 is 3.2% higher than the current price but less than the recent all-time high of $78.96. Mitsui Sumitomo is a massive Japanese financial conglomerate. Note that it also recently acquired an 18% stake in MassMutual’s Barings. This purchase followed on a 100,000-share buy reported at the end of last month. Gabelli also acquired shares of Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (NYSE: GDV) and Gabelli Equity Trust Inc. (NYSE: GAB) in December. Note that another beneficial owner also picked up some shares of Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust earlier in the month. Shares were last seen trading for less than the $10 purchase price. They have underperformed the S&P 500 in the past year but are 4.2% higher than 90 days ago. In addition, Gabelli also boosted his stake in Florida-based electronic equipment and components maker LGL Group Inc. (NYSE: LGL) in late December. These were not the only notable insider purchases of the past week. Here is a quick look at some others. Some smaller insider buying was reported at CME, Gitlab, Joby Aviation, SAIC, and Simon Property as well.

Title: Tech companies may only get half the profit they need to justify AI investment, Goldman analyst warns

The S&P 500 hit a new record high yesterday, up 0.62% at 6,944.82. Futures are marginally down this morning, as might be expected from traders who want to sell up and lock in some of those gains. The STOXX Europe 600 also hit a new high yesterday and was flat in early trading this morning.Much of the bullishness is coming as analysts realize that the massive amounts of capital expenditure (capex) on building out AI data centers isn’t likely to stop anytime soon.The result of all that new spending will be that “we expect another year of solid gains for U.S. equities in 2026. We forecast an S&P 500 total return of 12% to a year-end level of 7,600,” Goldman Sachs analyst Ben Snider and his colleagues told clients in a note sent this morning.However, the wrinkle for 2026 will be that AI capex growth will start to slow down, he said. In turn, the amount of profit needed to justify all that capex won’t show up, Snider et al argue, and that will cause traders to pick and choose winners and losers among the big tech firms of the S&P 500. “The 10 largest stocks in the S&P 500 account for 41% of market cap and drove 53% of the S&P 500 2025 return. We expect AI spending will exceed consensus estimates this year but begin to decelerate in growth terms while corporate adoption increases, causing rotations among the largest U.S. tech stocks that create two-way risk for the aggregate index,” he told clients. Capex spending by the big “hyperscalers” (Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, etc.) was roughly $400 billion in 2025, up 70% annually, Goldman calculates. The big tech companies have also started to fund much of that growth with debt. “As spending and debt grow, so do the necessary eventual profits to justify ongoing investments,” Snider says. So far, tech companies have been happy to spend that money because the profits they generated were two or three times as much as they invested, Goldman estimates. The problem is that that might be unsustainable, Snider says. “Given consensus estimates for an annual average of $500 billion in capex from 2025-2027, maintaining the returns on capital to which their investors have become accustomed would require these companies to realize an annual profit run-rate of over $1 trillion, more than double the 2026 consensus estimate of $450 billion in income,” he wrote. While some of these companies will successfully generate the profits they need, others won’t, he says. “The magnitudes of current spending and market caps alongside increasing competition within the group suggest a diminishing probability that all of today’s market leaders generate enough long-term profits to sufficiently reward today’s investors.” Analysts at Vanguard and Piper Sandler are also focused on the AI-capex-profit story. Piper chief global economist Nancy R. Lazar and her colleagues anticipate that tech companies have not yet reached the ceiling of their capex budgets, especially as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA) grants new tax breaks on companies’ capital spending. “Tech capex has been a huge story for a while now, but against history, it’s still not ‘too high’ vs. GDP. And there’s plenty of upside ahead, given OBBA’s full capex expensing, Fed easing, and banks easing lending standards,” they told clients. Vanguard’s Qian Wang, global head of capital market research, also warned that if profits don’t follow capex then investors should expect a downturn. “We are bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy. But transformative technology needs profitable business models to win. And, in the financial markets, returns hinge on expectations. Tech companies’ earnings have been strong so far, but their valuations may have gotten ahead of themselves. When expectations get too far out of whack, it is not surprising to see markets pull back,” she said in an email sent to Fortune. Here’s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:

Investing Shake Shack targets 1,500 stores long-term and trades 41% below its all-time high. Celsius Holdings acquired Alani Nu to expand its health and wellness portfolio. Celsius trades at 32x forward P/E after rising 65% last year. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 2022 Getty Images / Getty Images News via Getty Images Many investors and analysts are bullish on the stock market and the state of the AI trade going into the new year. And while it’s sure to be another pivotal year for the technology, investors should also consider the low-tech names that might be better able to withstand tech-driven market corrections. Undoubtedly, the broad market went into 2026 with a fairly high multiple and while this alone doesn’t mean we’ll spend a big chunk of the year in a bear market, I do think that some of the neglected non-AI and non-tech plays might be in a position to do well in their own right, especially if an AI bubble (if it even exists) finally does go bust, dragging down the broad stock market along with it. It’s all right to be bullish and overweight in the top AI names, provided you’re comfortable with increased volatility. But if you’re at all fearful of an AI bubble or rolling sector-based corrections, I’d argue that a bit of diversification can never hurt. In this piece, we’ll look at two low-tech stocks that have impressive growth rates and the means to sidestep a potential AI growth scare should one happen in 2026. Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) stands out as a compelling buy on the dip after shedding more than 41% from its all-time highs. Undoubtedly, it’s been a sharp implosion, but one that might be overdone, especially if the $3.5 billion premium fast-food firm can successfully shift gears from recovery to acceleration. As a relatively small chain with a ton of expansion potential in the quick-serve restaurant scene, Shake Shack might be the restaurant growth play to stick with, especially if you’re looking for an impressive low-tech growth profile. With its ambitious 1,500-store long-term expansion plan, efforts to drive same-store sales growth (think loyalty and new burgers like the Big Shack), and the potential to drive operating efficiencies via the incorporation of new tech, I see an earnings growth pathway that could help shares of Shake Shack recover quite swiftly from here. Though Raymond James may have dropped Shake Shack stock from its “Favorites List” last month, I still think recent trends shouldn’t take away from the long-term growth story at hand. If you’re a fan of the chain, it might be finally time to nibble while shares are under $85 per share. Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a relatively small $12.4 billion beverage company that’s fresh off a decent recovery year. Last year, the stock rose more than 65%, and while such an upside move hasn’t allowed shares to touch prior all-time highs (believe it or not, shares are still down 50% from their peak), I do think recent momentum and progress going on behind the scenes is worth getting behind. The company can keep gaining market share while making further margin improvements, allowing the stock to comfortably grow into its seemingly frothy multiple. With the acquisition of healthy supplement market Alani Nu last year, I view Celsius’ health and wellness moat as increasing in size. Undoubtedly, the deal not only makes Celsius a bigger force in “healthy” energy beverages, but it also could give the firm a front-row seat to the protein supplements market. Like Celsius, Alani Nu is a fast-moving up-and-comer that’s capable of massive market disruption. At 32.0 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), I view Celsius as a very reasonably-priced mid-cap growth stock that can do well, even if the AI trade were to run out of its steam in this new year. With such an impressive growth rate and a broader portfolio of products that have resonated with health-conscious consumers, I think 2026 could be the year Celisus’ stock really heats up.

Investing Home Depot (HD) could benefit whether buyers remain locked in homes (driving renovations) or rates drop (spurring purchases). Lennar and other homebuilders now offer mortgage buydowns and free upgrades as elevated rates compress margins and deter buyers. Home Depot and Lowe’s (LOW) face potential upside if the lock-in effect drives homeowners to invest in upgrades instead of moving. Sending You to Google News in 3 © saweang.w / Shutterstock.com As we kick off a new year, the thought process many investors may have is which sectors or areas of the economy will be the places to invest. After all, various macro dynamics have changed a great deal in recent months, and this year is shaping up to be much different than 2025 in a number of ways. Aside from the ongoing geopolitical turmoil we’ve seen, as well as concerns around inflation driven by quickly-changing tariff and trade policies, the direction of monetary policy coming out of the Federal Reserve could be the hot topic many will be watching very closely. Given president Trump’s views on interest rates (namely, that they’re way too high right now), a pressure campaign is still being waged on the Fed to drop rates, and do so quickly. I’m not so sure the president will have as much say on interest rates as overall economic developments will. But one thing I will be watching that will likely determine monetary policy decisions will be the labor market, which has been weakening at a rapid pace. For those who think interest rates are likely to come down because of (or in spite of) president Trump’s rhetoric, here’s why the construction sector is one to watch this year. Interest rate visual With three consecutive 25 basis point (0.25%) interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve to end fiscal 2025, plenty of investors may be looking at interest rate-sensitive areas of the economy to put some capital to work in, come the New Year. It think construction-related companies could be among the biggest beneficiaries of this trend. Indeed, home sales continue to slow, as prices remain high (but look to be coming down in some key metropolitan markets across the country). In order for these trends to reverse, and for buyers to come off the sidelines, many experts have suggested that interest rates would need to come down to a 5-handle to encourage greater activity. For new home builders, interest rates have become the key headwind for profitability and earnings growth in recent quarters. Builders are now having to resort to providing builder financing, or buying down mortgage rates, to entice new homebuyers to take on their inventory. What that’s led to is an interesting dynamic where, in certain markets, new homes are now selling for effectively less than existing homes – something that generally shouldn’t be possible, considering the depreciating value of hard assets such as real estate. That said, if Trump’s new pick for Fed chair does indeed follow his lead and lower interest rates aggressively at the front end of the curve (whether spurred by further economic weakness or not), it will be interesting to see if long bonds (mortgage rates generally follow the 10-Year Treasury yield, not short-term overnight rates set by the Fed) will follow. For those who think they will, this is a trade potentially worth putting on. Real estate agent passing keys to a new homebuyer New supply of homes are coming on the market, with many homeowners who are looking to lock in the gains they saw following a pandemic-driven frenzy seemingly wanting to do so before prices drop. In some areas of the real estate market (such as condos in key metropolitan areas in Florida and other states), prices are falling. So, the time to offload some inventory (either for individual homeowners or builders) appears to be closing. That said, despite this new supply, the reality that prices remain elevated compared to historical income standards, in mortgage rates are still near the highest levels they’ve been in a decade, has led to an affordability crisis where few homeowners are willing to buy. This has depressed margins for new homebuilders such as Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and others, who are being forced to offer significant incentives such as mortgage rate buy downs and free upgrades to get buyers to pull the trigger. That said, I think despite slightly softening prices across the board, we could be due for a reasonably solid year for homebuilders and other companies tied to the construction trade. Retailers like Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOWE) could see a resurgence of business, if those who feel locked into their homes are willing to put the necessary upgrades in to maintain their place of residence. The lock-in effect is real, but if we’re all going to be locked into our place for years to come, I think the recent declines these stocks have seen may provide a buying opportunity for those thinking long-term. Judge banging his gavel on a desk The reality is that the housing market is a very difficult and complex animal to analyze. Broad supply and demand metrics are a good starting point. But this market is made up of millions of individuals, each making the best decisions for them and their families. With that in mind, I think investors may be looking too closely at the macro data, and not enough at home homeowners are actually making their purchase decisions. If home buying activity slows down, home renovation stocks like Home Depot and Lowe’s could be screaming buys. But if interest rates come down, that’s a broad-based catalyst for all stocks in this space, providing the rising tide that should lift all boats. Overall, I’m looking most closely at Home Depot in particular of the three stocks I mentioned in this article as a potential winner in 2026. That’s because no matter what happens, I think this is a retailer with upside potential that’s not being priced in presently. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Investing SoFi (SOFI) gained 85% in 2025 and hit an all-time high of $32.73. The stock now trades at $27.46. SoFi reported Q3 revenue of $950M (up 37.7% year over year) and added 35% more users to reach 12.6M members. SoFi launched SoFi Crypto in November as the first chartered bank enabling crypto transactions. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Courtesy of Social Finance, Inc. Stocks have had a wild ride in 2025. While it wasn’t a smooth year, the stock market remained resilient despite the ups and downs. With the onset of the new year, there’s an opportunity for you to take a look at your portfolio and consider the changes you need to make. If you’re willing to add new stocks to your portfolio, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) is one fintech stock worth considering. SoFi Technologies is one of the most disruptive names in the industry. It has attracted young users and become a ‘one-stop shop’ for all things money. Users can save, invest, spend, and budget on the SoFi app. 2025 has been the best year ever for SoFi Technologies, as its shares hit an all-time high of $32.73. The fintech stock gained 85% in 2025 and is now trading below its all-time high at $27.46. It started in 2025 at $14 and ended the year at $26. Is more upside possible? Should you buy the stock while it is below $40? Here’s why I think SOFI is one of the top fintech stocks to own this year. SoFi has gone beyond the traditional business of consumer lending and has now built impressive technology and infrastructure capabilities that steadily attract users. The company has been growing across different metrics, and its management has ensured consistent expansion of the ecosystem. The company first beat revenue expectations in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the market believes that it will continue doing so in 2026. Further, in the fourth quarter results, SoFi will inch closer to the milestone of $1 billion in quarterly sales. It has delivered strong financials for the third quarter. SOFI recorded a 35% jump in the number of users and a 36% year-over-year jump in the number of products. Since the number of products has surpassed the number of users, it shows that SOFI continues to sell services to existing customers. It reported an EPS of $0.11 and a revenue of $950 million, up 37.7% year over year. The net income came in at $139 million, and it ended the quarter with a record 12.6 million members. For the full year, the management now expects to add about 3.5 million new members. Its financial services segment revenue saw a 76% year-over-year jump, while the technology platform segment saw a 12% jump, and the lending segment saw a 25% rise. Analysts expect SoFi to generate a revenue of $985 million in the upcoming fourth-quarter results. The company is set to announce results on January 30. SoFi is expanding into the digital assets segment and launched SoFi Crypto in November, the first chartered bank that allows consumers to make transactions using crypto assets. Further, in December, it launched SoFiUSD, a stablecoin space. One of the biggest reasons to buy SOFI is the strong leadership and management execution. Everything has gone right for the company since 2023, and it consistently beats Wall Street forecasts. The management continues to boost guidance, strengthening its market position and showing that it has massive potential for the long term. SashaMagic / Shutterstock.com SOFI has been trading between $25 and $30 over the past few months. However, a strong fourth-quarter report could boost the stock and push it beyond $30. SOFI has the potential to deliver extraordinarily and beat market expectations quarter after quarter. The company is in growth mode and on the cusp of significant gains. While the stock is valued at a premium, there is a strong chance of steady upside. If you already own SOFI shares, it will be worth holding on to them for the long term. The stock has the potential to double your money. If you’re interested in riding the fintech wave, do not wait for a bottom in the stock. SOFI could have another impressive run in 2026.

Title: SpaceX, Private Ventures Fuel Elon Musk’s Trillion-Dollar Dreams
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/elon-musks-private-ventures-pave-path-toward-trillionaire-status/

Tesla’s sleek cars and futuristic trucks have defined Elon Musk’s public image, but SpaceX is the real engine behind his growing net worth. Jennifer Ablan Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Elon Musk, often described as a modern-day Thomas Edison, may soon add an unprecedented title to his résumé: the world’s first trillionaire. Tesla’s sleek cars and futuristic trucks have defined his public image, but SpaceX is the real engine behind his growing net worth. The buzz around a potential IPO valued at as much as $1.5 trillion for the high-flying government contractor has emerged as the primary swing factor in the entrepreneur’s net worth at the same time that Tesla shareholders have approved a massive, performance-based compensation package that could significantly expand his stake in the electric-car maker. Together, these developments have shifted Musk’s path to extreme wealth from incremental gains to a handful of high-stakes corporate milestones. Musk’s net worth has surged nearly 50% year over year to an estimated $645 billion. In October, he became the first individual to surpass a $500 billion net worth, propelled by rising private-market valuations for SpaceX and renewed confidence in Tesla’s long-term strategy. If Musk meets the aggressive performance targets tied to his Tesla compensation plan, and if SpaceX continues on its current trajectory, he could break the trillion-dollar barrier. Such an accomplishment would test the upper bounds of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, created and named when the idea of a trillionaire still seemed unfathomable and absurd. Now, it no longer does. Already, Musk has been cast front and center, most recently by Forbes, as the maestro of this era’s wealth creation. SpaceX, which has invested aggressively in reusable rockets, launch infrastructure, and satellites, is the single largest lever in the trillionaire equation. Musk owns an estimated 42% of the private rocket and satellite company, which recent secondary share transactions have valued at $350 billion to $800 billion in private markets; that makes his stake worth roughly $136 billion to more than $300 billion on paper today. The real upside comes from long-term growth and the potential for a public offering; if SpaceX lists at valuations some analysts forecast (up to about $1.5 trillion), Musk’s stake alone could exceed $600 billion, reshaping his net worth significantly. Indeed, Starlink has rapidly become the financial backbone of SpaceX. The satellite internet service has added 1 million new customers in under seven weeks, bringing its total to more than 9 million active users across 155 countries and territories, according to the company, implying a growth rate of more than 20,000 new users per day since early November. That momentum caps an explosive year. In December 2024, SpaceX reported 4.6 million Starlink customers; by August 2025, the figure had climbed to 7 million, before accelerating sharply in recent months. The service now operates on a constellation of more than 9,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites, enabling broadband connectivity in rural, maritime, aviation, and defense-critical regions beyond the reach of traditional networks (For my part, I can now use Wi-Fi on routes to and from New York and Hawaii, even over the Pacific Ocean — something that was previously impossible — because of Starlink.) Musk has said Starlink is now “by far” the largest driver of SpaceX’s revenue — a distinction that has materially altered how investors assess the company. While SpaceX and Starlink represent the transformational upside, Tesla remains a critical component of Musk’s wealth trajectory. His 2018 compensation package, revived after the Delaware Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that had voided it, entitles Musk to acquire stock options tied to ambitious operational and market-capitalization milestones. Most of those milestones have already been achieved, giving Musk the right to purchase roughly 304 million Tesla shares at deeply discounted prices, currently valued at approximately $139 billion. Adding to this, Tesla’s shareholders have also approved a new performance-based pay plan, further increasing Musk’s potential upside and consolidating his control over the company. If fully realized, these packages could add hundreds of billions in theoretical value, though the actual gain depends on hitting aggressive targets and on public-market conditions. All told, the new performance plan positions Musk to unlock value as Tesla begins monetizing AI-driven initiatives, including full self-driving, autonomous fleet operations and robotics. In this framework, Tesla serves as an accelerant rather than the primary driver of Musk’s net worth. Its gains are meaningful but incremental, constrained by stock performance, earnings multiples and investor sentiment. SpaceX, by contrast, offers the potential for sudden, transformative gains: an IPO, Starlink expansion or secondary-market repricing could add hundreds of billions almost overnight. “Heading into 2026, this marks a monster year for Tesla and Musk as the autonomous and robotics chapter begins,” analyst Dan Ives writes in his latest report on Top 5 Names to Play the AI Revolution into 2026. “The AI valuation will start to get unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next six to nine months has now begun, with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla’s installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose for Musk & Co. We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year, and in a bull-case scenario, $3 trillion by the end of 2026.” Beyond Tesla and SpaceX, Musk holds stakes in several ventures that extend both financial upside and strategic influence, positioning him across AI, social platforms, neurotechnology and infrastructure: In true “Musk fashion,” the venture was inspired when Musk was stuck in LA traffic. Shares of Blackrock bounced back on Thursday as analysts assessed the headwinds that have past blocked proposals similar to President Trump’s. Just last year, the FDA sent a warning letter to wellness wearable firm Whoop after it rolled out a feature to check users’ blood pressure. Caterpillar’s not alone in transforming worksites: Deere & Co. showed off new equipment at CES this week, too. Since the 1980s, Citgo Petroleum has operated as the US-based subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil and gas company. The official unveiling of Nvidia’s new chip architecture, dubbed the Vera Rubin, wasn’t expected until later this spring. Bitcoin ETFs just notched $697 million worth of inflows on Monday, their biggest gain since early October. Artificial intelligence-powered bots’ big presence at CES belies the tech industry’s expectations to turn a profit on them. Greg Abel earned Warren Buffett’s trust and, eventually, his job. Here’s what you need to know about Berkshire Hathaway’s new, lower-key CEO. Bitcoin, the No. 1 crypto by market cap, hasn’t recovered from a flash crash, chopping more than $1 trillion from the broader sector’s value. With an estimated half a million workers needed to fill the construction industry’s labor shortages, AI investments this year may get stalled. US automakers General Motors, Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) and Ford are bracing for slowing sales in 2026 amid rising unemployment.
