Goldiam has responded swiftly with a U.S.‐origin casting model, a globally accepted and compliant approach that effectively mitigates tariff exposure:  Through its U.S. subsidiary, Goldiam now casts raw gold into unfinished jewellery pieces within the United States.  These castings are then shipped to India for finishing, polishing, and diamond setting.  The final jewellery is re‐exported to the U.S., where it qualifies for tariff exemptions under U.S. Customs rules. Because the gold is bought and casted in the U.S., the product retains U.S. origin status. As a result, no tariff applies to the gold component, and instead 5.5% duty is levied on the incremental value addition (diamonds and labour).

In 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board reduced the Federal Funds Rate from 5.375% to 4.375%. Today, after an extended pause, they cut it again from 4.375% to 4.125%. More importantly, the Fed signalled two additional rate cuts in 2025, which would bring the Federal Funds Rate down to 3.625% by year-end, still slightly ahead of the neutral rate. There is more room to cut rates in 2026. Historically, when the Fed lowers rates, capital tends to shift out of safe assets such as U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits into riskier assets, including equities, private equity, venture capital, and emerging markets. The anticipated rate cuts in 2025 and in 2026 are expected to boost the valuations of risky assets. As a result, India should expect stronger capital inflows—particularly in Q4, when large global asset managers finalize allocations. This comes at a time when the Indian economy is demonstrating resilience, even in the face of headwinds such as the Trump administration’s imposition of a 50% tariff on Indian exports. Overall, India stands to benefit from a “double engine” of global liquidity easing and strong domestic fundamentals. Vikram Kasat, Head - Advisory, PL Capital. “The Fed Cuts, Wall Street Yawns Wish Granted - Like a dog chasing cars, Wall Street didn’t know what to do with itself once it finally got its rate cut. 2025 now marks the 3rd year since 1996 where rate cuts have happened with the S&P 500 at record highs The Recession That Never Was - The base case remains for a 25bp rate cut even though inflation is still running well above the 2% target based on the latest data. US headline CPI and core CPI were up 2.9% YoY and 3.1% YoY, respectively, in August. The official reason is growing evidence of labour market weakness US commercial banks’ total loan growth has risen from 1.5% YoY in mid-March 2024 to 4.6% YoY in early September 2025, while commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth is up from a negative 2.6% YoY to 4.1% YoY over the same period - For such reasons it is entirely possible to make the argument that the US economy could be in the early days of a new cyclical rebound Nifty 25330.25 Nifty has decisively closed above the high of 25250 Support Levels 20HMA: 25209 40HEMA: 25130” EaseMyTrip partners with Hoi for India's first Smart Kiosk Rewards Program at major airports, offering travel benefits to passengers.

KPI Green Energy's green bond listing marks a milestone in sustainable finance for India's renewable sector. Renisha Chainani, Head of Research of Augmont, writes - Gold and silver prices continued to decline as a result of the dollar’s rise, after the U.S. Federal Reserve dropped interest rates by 25 bps, as anticipated, and signalled two more cuts this year as the job market deteriorated. · Chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile, expressed caution about additional easing, characterising the action as a risk-management strategy in reaction to a deteriorating labour market. The central bank will evaluate the future trajectory of interest rates “meeting-by-meeting,” he continued. · Due to persistent geopolitical concerns, Fed easing expectations, and robust central bank demand, gold has increased 40% so far this year. · The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are anticipated to maintain policy stability this week, while the Bank of Canada also reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points. Technical Triggers · Gold Oct Futures seems to have topped out, and if it sustains below $3700 (~Rs 109,500), then we could only see further profit booking up to $3650(~Rs 108,000) and $3600 (~Rs 106,500). · Silver Nov Futures also seems to have topped out around $43, the next target is $41(~Rs 123,500). Sell on rallies The Nifty IT index surged 0.92 per cent to 36,780.85 points in morning trade, with all constituent stocks advancing as investors responded positively to the Federal Reserve’s 25 basis point interest rate cut announced overnight. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group. The U.S. Fed’s 25 basis points rate cut is expected to have a measured impact on Indian markets. Softer U.S. yields enhance the relative appeal of Indian assets, which could draw interest from global investors into emerging markets. But the wide anticipation of at least a 25 bps cut was already factored in by the market to a great extent. That said, a more decisive driver for market sentiment would be the progress on the U.S.–India trade deal, which would ease some pressures by lowering tariff barriers. Domestically the ongoing momentum is being supported by GST reforms, while the prospect of an agreement with the US. Further, the Fed projections of an additional 50 basis points cut in 2025 ahead, coupled with the previous stated factors would greatly ease the situation and FII positioning for Indian markets. Still, in the near term, sectors with exposure to international borrowings and export-oriented industries could benefit, providing selective opportunities.

With US being a large market for exports, the fed cut post the implementation of tariffs will drive momentum in exports by bringing in some relief to the business. In terms of gold, the prices declined in the domestic as well as international markets after setting a new high in India before the Fed rate cut. It is expected that the gold prices in India will further rise though but this can be cushioned if the rupee gains strength against the dollar. Going ahead, we expect gold prices to be elevated with lower U.S yields making the metal more attractive to investors. In the domestic market, the demand is likely to remain steady even with mild price fluctuation, given the festive and wedding season. Prices could hover in the range of INR 1,10,000 to 1,12,000/10 gms in the domestic market and USD 3600 to 3700/Oz in the international markets in the near term.” China’s exports of refined oil products in August rose 8.5% year-on-year, according to customs data, but slowed from July when it recorded the highest monthly total since June 2024. - Reuters The rupee depreciated 16 paise to 88.01 against the US dollar in early trade on Thursday, as traders assessed the US FED outlook following a rate cut. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points, marking its first reduction of the year. This decision reflects a cautious approach to supporting the labour market amid increasing employment risks. The dovish stance is expected to lower borrowing costs and encourage consumer spending in the U.S. markets, which could lead to gains in equities, bonds, and real estate. However, some volatility may persist due to internal divisions. In India, the Fed’s actions could attract foreign capital, strengthening the rupee and benefiting stock indices like the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty. This favourable environment may help ease inflationary pressures and provide the RBI room for adjustments, although exporters might face challenges from currency strength. When combined with domestic factors, including the RBI’s earlier interest rate reductions, specifically a 50 basis point cut in June 2025 and another cut in April, as well as GST rate rationalization and various measures to boost consumption, the outlook for India’s economy appears strong. Potential GDP growth is projected to remain steady at around 6.5% to 6.7% for FY2025/26. Given these favourable conditions, several sectors, including Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), Information Technology (IT), Metals, and Domestic Consumption (FMCG, Retail, Durables), are positioned for potential gains.

Retail Participation in Cash Segment – A Sharp Decline Retail investors once dominated direct equity trading, but their share in NSE’s cash market has dropped to 34.2% in FY25-26 (till August). This is a sharp fall from the pandemic peak of 45% in FY20-21, when retail enthusiasm was at its highest. Current levels are comparable to 2015-16, highlighting a gradual retreat from direct market dominance. 2. Why Retail Investors are Withdrawing Pandemic Euphoria Faded: During COVID, easy apps and abundant liquidity brought millions of new investors. But many came for quick gains and exited after facing cycles of poor returns. Shift Towards Indirect Routes: Instead of trading themselves, many retail investors now prefer mutual funds, insurance-linked products, and PMS where professionals manage money. Regulatory Tightening: SEBI has raised margin rules, introduced stricter norms, and curbed speculative trading in F&O. Losses in F&O: Data shows most new entrants lost money in F&O, and sharp corrections in many mid- and small-cap stocks further discouraged direct participation. 3. Where Retail Money is Moving Mutual Funds & Systematic Plans (SIPs): Steady inflows suggest retailers are now choosing professional fund managers over self-trading. Insurance & PMS: Increasing reliance on structured, long-term wealth management solutions. Indirect Exposure to F&O: Retailers’ footprint in futures & options rose from 23% in FY15-16 to 27.7% in FY25-26 (till August). 4. Key Risks and Lessons for Retailers Chasing Quick Profits Backfires: Many investors entered for short-term gains but faced losses. The lesson: discipline matters more than thrill. High-Risk Speculation Curbed: Stricter rules may reduce short-term excitement, but they are designed to protect investors from reckless losses. Market Reality Check: Small and mid-cap stocks have fallen 30-40% from peaks, versus only 4-5% in the broader index. This proves that investing without understanding fundamentals can be dangerous. 5. Outlook – A More Mature Market Ahead Experts believe that although curbs may dampen high-risk speculation, they will foster a healthier, long-term investing environment. With retail investors moving towards mutual funds and institutions playing a stronger role, India’s market is slowly shifting to a sustainable growth path. Future success for retailers lies in: Understanding fundamentals rather than speculation. Diversifying via funds instead of only direct stocks. Adopting discipline and patience rather than chasing momentum. Aluminium prices expected to stay high in 2025 due to a weaker dollar and stable Chinese demand. India's top online used car vendors prepare for IPOs exceeding $1 billion, cutting costs and streamlining operations. Bulls Stay in Control, Key Levels to Watch Post Fed Rate Cut The US Federal Reserve delivered a widely anticipated 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday. With the US being the world’s largest economy, this decision has global market implications and early cues are already reflecting in positive US indices and Gift Nifty, hinting at a positive opening for Nifty today. Nifty 50 extended its winning streak on Wednesday, gaining 91.15 points (+0.36%) to close at 25,330.25. The index continues to exhibit strong bullish momentum, backed by robust volumes. Technically, the spot remains well above its 9-, 20-, and 50-day EMAs, with the RSI (14) reading at 67 — inching toward the overbought zone. While this does not guarantee a reversal, traders should watch for potential consolidation or a healthy pullback towards the psychological 25,000 level. Such dips could present attractive buy-on-dip opportunities if the bullish bias sustains. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at 25,400 — a breakout above this zone could open doors for 25,500–25,600 levels. On the downside, 25,250 acts as the first line of support, followed by 25,100. For Thursday’s session, the expected range is between 25,470 on the higher side and 25,160 on the lower side if 25,250 fails to hold. In the institutional flow space, FIIs continued their selling streak with net outflows of ₹989.81 crore, while DIIs stepped in aggressively by pumping in ₹2,205.12 crore which provided strong support to the market’s bullish undertone. The U.S. Fed’s 25-bps rate cut marks a pivotal policy shift, lowering borrowing costs and reviving global risk appetite. Growth-sensitive sectors such as housing, tech, and small caps stand to benefit, though banks may face margin compression. A softer dollar also improves the prospects of stronger FII inflows into India. Coupled with consistent DII support and stable technical underpinnings, this development strengthens the case for continued market upside—so long as global cues remain favorable. FII Caution vs DII Confidence FIIs remain cautious, having offloaded ₹11,330.08 crores in the cash market month-to-date. However, their strategic additions in index futures (₹4,727.78 crores) and options (₹6,739.97 crores) reflect hedging activity rather than outright bearishness. Counterbalancing this, DIIs have infused ₹32,892.91 crores, supported by resilient retail SIP flows and confidence in India’s long-term growth story. This steady domestic support has anchored sentiment and offset external nervousness. Open Interest Signals Open Interest data indicates firm resistance around the 25,500–26,000 strike, where rising call OI suggests sellers may assert pressure. At the same time, concentrated put OI at 25,150–25,000 highlights strong defensive positioning, reinforcing the support base. The balance of OI shifts suggests cautious optimism, with market participants hedging while staying positioned for an eventual breakout. Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty 50 are likely to open gap up, as trend in GIFT Nifty suggests a positive start for the broader index. Asian markets were trading mixed in early trade.

Title: Alphabet Rides The AI Wave Over The $3 Trillion Mark

Time Published: 2025-09-17T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Alphabet is the newest member of the $3 trillion club, and it’s counting on rolling AI ambitions to take it higher. Jamie Wilde Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Tech giant Alphabet joined the $3 trillion club this week, making it the fourth company to reach that impressive market cap. Certainly, you’ve heard about the other three — Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia — but, if not, just Google them. A favorable ruling earlier this month in an antitrust case against Alphabet kickstarted the stock’s latest upward swing. A US court ruled the company didn’t need to sell off its Chrome browser or Android operating system, two outcomes investors feared would cut into the company’s core biz. Then there’s what pushed the stock over the top into $3 trillion territory: growing enthusiasm for Alphabet’s AI investments. Alphabet’s stock has climbed more than 70% from its April low. Its cloud-computing unit’s revenue surged a better-than-expected 32% in the second quarter, lifted by demand for new AI offerings like the Gemini chatbot from its Google subsidiary. Earlier this month, Google Cloud’s CEO said the company’s already made billions from AI and has $106 billion in customer demand for its cloud computing services. The success highlights Alphabet’s efforts to diversify beyond its advertising businesses, including at Google and YouTube, which make up more than half of revenue. And, following Google Cloud’s success, Alphabet’s bringing AI to more products: Surface Tension: Fears of the AI bubble bursting haven’t been realized, as investors continue to bet that massive investments into the tech will pay off. AI chip-maker Nvidia is still the most valuable company with a market cap of more than $4 trillion. And Oracle signed a $300 billion cloud deal with OpenAI last week, pouring fuel on its stock’s rally. If AI is a bubble, it seems to be made of something more durable than soapy water. Unfortunately for Intel, the deal does not provide a direct lifeline to its floundering chipmaking foundry business. Meta will likely soon face competition from Amazon, Alphabet, Snap and other tech firms with augmented-reality glasses in development. Quantum computers are expected to solve previously unsolvable problems (or ones that would take ages) across industries. Apple’s latest generation of iPhones were debuted with modest aplomb last week. Presales show the company has plenty to be confident about. Between 2000 and 2002, after the dot com bubble popped, the Nasdaq lost nearly 80% of its value, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Oracle said its remaining performance obligations is now sitting at $455 billion. That’s up 359% from where it stood just a year ago. Mistral has been hailed by policymakers as key to Europe’s ambitions to compete with dominant US and Asian rivals. iPhone sales surged to $44.5 billion in the quarter ending in June, besting analysts’ $40 billion expectations and rising 14% year-over-year. Pubmatic’s lawsuit comes after a US Judge ruled in April that Google was maintaining an illegal monopoly in the ad tech industry. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, having successfully diversified into cloud computing, is now making a push into artificial intelligence. So far, Tesla has launched limited rideshare services in Austin and the Bay area, and it’s looking to expand into Florida, Arizona and Nevada. For a year now, Apple shareholders have feared the company would lose out on easy revenue from making Google its default search engine. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Manage your account ... The 2025-26 NBA season is almost here, and with it comes my position-by-position fantasy basketball tiers, starting with the guards. This guide is points-league focused but includes insights for category formats as well. [Join or create a fantasy basketball league for the 2025-26 NBA season] Let's kick it off with two players who will drive much of the MVP conversation this season. Editor's note: Players are listed based on their primary position from last season or projected role this year. Luka Dončić, Los Angeles Lakers Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder Luka Dončić: Luka enters his first full Lakers season healthy and in shape, ready to deliver close to a nightly 30-point triple-double. Even in a down year, he dropped 28-8-8. His blend of usage, shot volume and all-around production makes him one of the safest fantasy picks available. With efficiency improvements and better conditioning, he could push for a top-three finish across formats. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: SGA and Luka were the only guards to average over 50 FPPG last season. After a legendary season finishing as the scoring leader, MVP, Finals MVP and champion, SGA's floor is top five across all formats. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves Cade Cunningham, Detroit Pistons Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks Devin Booker, Phoenix Suns Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers James Harden, Los Angeles Clippers Anthony Edwards: Edwards continues his ascent as Minnesota’s offensive centerpiece, combining highlight-reel finishes with steady statistical growth. His scoring is already elite, but his rebounds and assists have begun to rise, too. With another leap in efficiency, Edwards could join Tier 1 next season. Cade Cunningham: There's a chance Cunningham can sneak into the elites. He averaged 48 FPPG last season, so another leap forward for him and the Pistons in a weaker Eastern Conference can push him into 50 FPPG territory. Devin Booker: The only thing preventing Booker from being a savage offensively is a possible late-season tank. I don't see it happening, so expect Booker to put up top-tier points and assist numbers. Trae Young: Trae’s elite assists and scoring floor make him one of the best points-league guards. Turnovers and poor shooting don’t impact his value as much, so bank on him being one of the few players getting at least 24 points and 10 assists a night. Tyrese Maxey: I'm higher on Maxey than the consensus. Maxey posted the sixth-most FPPG among guards last year. Those numbers are going up with Joel Embiid and Paul George undoubtedly missing games. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors De’Aaron Fox, San Antonio Spurs Jalen Brunson, New York Knicks LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets Donovan Mitchell, Cleveland Cavaliers Stephen Curry: I'd draft Curry higher in category leagues than points because his 3s and high FT% are more statistically relevant. Still, he'll likely be a top-10 scorer in the NBA who also generates enough counting stats elsewhere to warrant an early pick in points leagues. De’Aaron Fox: Fox gets a full offseason to prepare to play with Victor Wembanyama, so an uptick in assists as the primary creator elevates his value. He finished in the top 10 in FPPG among guards last season, averaging 41 FPPG. Jalen Brunson: The engine for the Knicks has one of the safest floors for a guard. He'll likely go in the first three rounds of drafts, but be aware that the minutes are likely to dip under new HC Mike Brown. LaMelo Ball: Injuries always hold him back, and it's reflected in his ADP. When healthy, though, Ball is capable of being a top-10 scorer amongst guards in FPPG. Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies Tyler Herro, Miami Heat Josh Giddey, Chicago Bulls Jamal Murray, Denver Nuggets Amen Thompson, Houston Rockets Desmond Bane, Orlando Magic Derrick White, Boston Celtics Brandon Miller, Charlotte Hornets Ja Morant: Few guards are as explosive as Morant, capable of putting up 25/7/5 lines on any given night. The risk is obvious — injuries and off-court issues — but the reward is massive if he plays 65+ games. He’s a swing pick with league-winning upside. He's way better for points formats since you can ignore the poor FT shooting, turnovers and lack of 3s. Josh Giddey: He inked a new contract, plus was one of three players to average at least 8.0 rebounds and 7.0 assists per game last year. The other two? Luka and Nikola Jokić. Giddey can push for over 40 FPPG this year. Amen Thompson: With Jalen Green gone, Thompson steps into a bigger role in Houston’s offense. His rebounding and defensive stocks make him an unusual fantasy guard with multi-category upside. If his jumper stabilizes, it'll more than justify a third-round selection, even for points leagues. Desmond Bane: Bane is a solid 30-35 FPPG scorer, but he'll be in a new environment, playing alongside Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner. I prefer Bane in category leagues, but he'll have the counting stats to warrant a pick around the fourth or fifth round. Jalen Green, Phoenix Suns Cam Thomas, Brooklyn Nets Darius Garland, Cleveland Cavaliers Austin Reaves, Los Angeles Lakers Jordan Poole, New Orleans Pelicans Zach LaVine, Sacramento Kings Dyson Daniels, Atlanta Hawks Coby White, Chicago Bulls Fred VanVleet, Houston Rockets Anfernee Simons, Boston Celtics Jalen Green: Green gets a huge bump after getting traded to the Suns. Volume is king for points leagues and he'll get plenty of opportunities as the secondary option to Booker. He's much better for points than category leagues. Cam Thomas: Thomas still hasn't signed his qualifying offer with the Nets. We'll have to wait and see how long his contract situation plays out. Thomas and Michael Porter Jr. are going to have a ton of scoring opportunities playing for Brooklyn. Darius Garland: Garland should be a tier higher, but he underwent surgery on his toe in June with a recovery timeline of 4-5 months. I don't expect to see him in uniform until November. When fully healthy, he should average north of 35 FPPG. Dyson Daniels: The NBA's Most Improved Player took a massive step forward last season. However, Jalen Johnson was hurt for the majority of the season, and the team wasn't as equipped as it is now. I'm expecting some regression despite Daniels averaging 37 FPPG in 2024-25. Fred VanVleet: FVV loses value in points leagues because his 3s, steals and FT% don't carry as much weight. Still, he's a useful PG capable of putting up at least 30 FPPG. Immanuel Quickley, Toronto Raptors Andrew Nembhard, Indiana Pacers Jalen Suggs, Orlando Mag Payton Pritchard, Boston Celtics CJ McCollum, Washington Wizards Bennedict Mathurin, Indiana Pacers Norman Powell, Miami Heat Bradley Beal, Los Angeles Clippers Shaedon Sharpe, Portland Trail Blazers Christian Braun, Denver Nuggets Immanuel Quickley: Quickley is looking to bounce back from an injury-riddled campaign. He averaged 31 FPPG when he played, so it's something to build off of playing with Scottie Barnes, Brandon Ingram and Jakob Poeltl. Andrew Nembhard: Nembhard is one of my favorite breakout candidates with Tyrese Haliburton being ruled out for the season. His skill set fits better with category leagues, but I'd also consider getting shares in points leagues. CJ McCollum: McCollum's ADP is just outside the top 100 over the past seven days on Yahoo. He's becoming a value, especially for points leagues. I think he'll play a lot of minutes for the Wizards until a mid-season trade likely sends him to a contender. Shaedon Sharpe: Sharpe’s athleticism pops every night, and he’s starting to find consistency as a scorer. Portland is giving him freedom to develop, which means more usage. He's on the verge of becoming a 20-point scorer in this League. Kevin Porter Jr., Milwaukee Bucks Keyonte George, Utah Jazz D’Angelo Russell, Dallas Mavericks Jaden Ivey, Detroit Pistons Stephon Castle, San Antonio Spurs Brandin Podziemski, Golden State Warriors Ayo Dosunmu, Chicago Bulls Davion Mitchell, Miami Heat Isaiah Collier, Utah Jazz Quentin Grimes, Philadelphia 76ers Malik Monk, Sacramento Kings Keyonte George: George had growing pains last year, but his court vision and scoring style — reminiscent of Jordan Clarkson — make him worth the gamble. If his efficiency stabilizes, he could jump to Tier 6 quickly. Brandin Podziemski: Podziemski is one of the rare guards who rebounds like a forward. Golden State trusts him with meaningful minutes, which ensures a solid floor. If Curry misses time, his value skyrockets. Stephon Castle: Castle will start at SG and offers some nice counting-stat potential heading into his second NBA season. He's a better asset for points leagues because his efficiency and lack of 3s remain an issue. Davion Mitchell: Once he was traded to the Heat last year, he was finally able to carve out a meaningful role. His defense is infectious and he looked far more comfortable shooting the ball and acting as a primary facilitator than he did with the Kings and Raptors. He's one of my sleepers whom I'll be selecting in the later rounds of drafts. Scoot Henderson, Portland Trail Blazers Cason Wallace, Oklahoma City Thunder Jared McCain, Philadelphia 76ers Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Atlanta Hawks Reed Sheppard, Houston Rockets Tre Johnson, Washington Wizards Anthony Black, Orlando Magic VJ Edgecombe, Philadelphia 76ers Rob Dillingham, Minnesota Timberwolves Bub Carrington, Washington Wizards Scoot Henderson: Henderson’s early career journey has been volatile. Bringing in Jrue Holiday likely puts him back on the bench. Perhaps a sixth-man role could pan out. Either way, he's better for points leagues than category if he continues getting 27 minutes a night. Cason Wallace: Wallace thrives as a low-mistake, high-efficiency rotation guard. OKC trusts him in high-leverage minutes, which locks in his role. I think we'll see his role expand this season, making him a fantasy asset in more category leagues than points leagues. Tre Johnson: Outside of Cooper Flagg, Johnson has a legitimate shot at Rookie of the Year. The injury to Bilal Coulibaly should expedite his fantasy impact as well. Rob Dillingham: The second-year guard looked great at Summer League. Mike Conley is getting older and Nickeil Alexander-Walker left in free agency, so they'll need Dillingham's speed and scoring punch off the bench. He's a bucket who will emerge as a points league guy this year. Russell Westbrook III, Free agent Donte DiVincenzo, Minnesota Timberwolves T.J.

Title: Can Natera Stock Reach $500?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Let's start with something remarkable. Natera (NASDAQ: NTRA) just marked its 10th anniversary as a public company, and what a journey it has been. The stock has delivered nearly 10x returns, rising from its $18 IPO price to around $170 today. Even more impressive, revenues have also expanded about 10-fold from $190 million to $2 billion. And the momentum hasn’t slowed — revenue growth over the last twelve months was a stellar 44%. So, what’s fueling this growth? It comes down to one word: intelligence — specifically, medical intelligence. Natera has placed itself at the forefront of molecular diagnostics, especially in cancer detection and monitoring. Think of them as medical detectives, helping doctors detect issues at the genomic level before they become life-threatening emergencies. The company focuses on three main areas: women’s health, oncology, and organ health. Their flagship product, Signatera, is a game-changer. This personalized tumor-informed test uses a simple blood draw to detect circulating tumor DNA and monitor for molecular residual disease across multiple cancer types, including breast, lung, ovarian, colorectal, and bladder cancers. This isn’t just an incremental improvement — it’s a revolutionary technology transforming how oncologists monitor their patients. But what makes their technology stand out? Its beauty lies in its simplicity and precision. Rather than invasive procedures, patients undergo a simple blood draw — a liquid biopsy. But this isn’t an ordinary blood test. Natera’s platform can detect tiny fragments of tumor DNA circulating in the bloodstream, offering doctors unprecedented insight into cancer progression and recurrence risk. Beyond Signatera, Natera also offers Altera for genomic profiling and Empower for hereditary cancer screening — creating a comprehensive suite that covers the entire cancer care spectrum. Before we dive into Natera stock’s specific metrics, it’s worth noting an important reality: investing in high-growth companies like Natera comes with volatility. While the upside can be significant, the ride is often bumpy. If you want high-quality growth with lower volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark — a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes — with returns exceeding 91% since inception. This diversified approach provides exposure to high-quality growth names while managing single-stock risk. On a separate note, see – What’s Happening With ABBV Stock? Now, let’s explore why Natera’s story is so compelling. Here’s where things get exciting. In the latest quarter, Natera processed over 850,000 tests, generating $546.6 million in revenue. About 22% of these tests were oncology-related, and this segment is growing at 50% year-over-year. This is the key engine driving future growth. Let’s zoom out. Cancer recurrence is every survivor’s worst fear, yet traditional monitoring often leaves patients waiting months for clarity. Nearly 19 million U.S. cancer survivors live in constant uncertainty between scans. They need better tools to track their cancer status, representing a massive market that will require sophisticated monitoring for decades to come. Now, we believe Natera can sustain 25% annual revenue growth over the next few years. That would boost revenue from about $1.7 billion last year to around $7 billion in 2030 — a 4x increase. For context, they’ve grown revenue at an average of 40% over the past three years, so 25% is actually not that aggressive. You might ask — is there room for a company this size to keep growing? Absolutely. The cell-free DNA testing market — which includes what Signatera does — is expected to almost double from $11 billion today to around $20 billion within five years. [1] Natera isn’t just riding this wave — they’re helping shape it. Consider the competition: Roche leads diagnostics with $16+ billion in revenue, followed by Danaher at $10 billion and Abbott at $9 billion. Natera’s $2 billion shows they’re still in the early innings of their growth story. The growth path breaks down into several key areas: How could $7 billion in revenue translate to a $500+ stock price? The math is compelling. If Natera hits $7 billion while maintaining its current price-to-sales multiple of 13x, the stock could reach about $700. Even with multiple compressions to 10x, that’s still well above $500. This assumes minimal dilution, which is reasonable given its cash-generation potential at scale. Yes, the company is currently loss-making, but as revenue grows, margins should turn positive. Natera’s net income margin has improved from -75% in 2021 to -13% now. Diagnostic market penetration takes time. For Natera to be valued at $50B, $100B, or even $200B (vs. $23B today), investors must think long-term — 2030 and beyond — with billions of tests processed annually worldwide. By 2035, liquid biopsies could be as routine as cholesterol tests. Still, several factors must align: Despite the opportunity, key risks remain: Natera is a genuine growth story driven by breakthrough technology addressing massive markets. It has scaled impressively while sustaining momentum that most CEOs would envy. The path to $500+ per share is mathematically feasible — but execution must be flawless. For risk-tolerant investors, this offers high growth with meaningful upside — balanced by real execution and market risks. For a more diversified approach, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has outperformed its benchmark of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000. Its quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap names has delivered strong returns while cushioning losses in down markets (RV Portfolio metrics). The opportunity is real — the question is whether Natera can execute and whether investors can stomach the volatility for what could be a rewarding ride. 1.

Title: Solana Price Prediction: SOL Price To $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/solana-price-prediction-sol-price-to-500/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Solana has been on a remarkable run lately. The price of SOL has surged by about 80% over the past six months and is now trading well above all its key moving averages. This impressive performance is supported by strong momentum, including its total value locked (TVL) reaching a record $13.22 billion and a surge of institutional investment. But the big question is—what would it take for SOL to double from here and surpass the $500 mark? Let’s explore what could drive that move. That said, if you are looking for upside potential with less volatility than holding an individual stock or token, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of more than 91% since inception. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Explosive rallies like this may seem extreme, but they are not uncommon in the crypto space. Here are some recent examples: With these catalysts lining up, could Solana be on the brink of its next big move? We’ve discussed the upside, but what about the risks? No investment is without challenges, and Solana is no exception. Here’s what could hold it back: While the outlook seems positive, such rapid growth is never guaranteed. The crypto market is highly volatile, and success depends on Solana’s continued execution and favorable market conditions. Alternatively, consider exploring the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 indices) to deliver strong returns. Why? The RV Portfolio’s quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks enables it to capture market gains while limiting downside in weaker conditions, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics. So, can Solana really hit $500? The fundamentals are compelling. With record TVL on the network and major investors piling in, the stage is set. Catalysts like a potential ETF approval and Solana’s booming ecosystem could drive a massive rally. Still, investors should carefully weigh the risks.

Title: S&P 500 Set To Surge 30%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/sp-500-set-to-surge-30/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In what's shaping up to be a pivotal week for global markets, the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to meet on September 16-17. Most analysts expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. While that’s the prevailing expectation, the Fed has a history of surprising markets. If they cut rates by 50 basis points instead of 25, it would be an unexpected move. Looking at past events, such surprises can serve as powerful catalysts for major market rallies. Our analysis shows that a move like this could potentially boost the market by 30%. That said, for investors looking for growth potential with lower exposure to the volatility of individual equities, consider the High Quality Portfolio. Since its inception, this portfolio has built a strong track record, consistently outperforming its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with cumulative returns exceeding 91%. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Recent history shows how impactful unexpected Fed moves can be. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, the Fed made two emergency rate cuts in March 2020 totaling 150 basis points. The first was a 50 basis point cut on March 3rd, followed by an even larger 100 basis point cut on March 15th that brought rates to near-zero. While markets initially dropped to around 2,237 on March 23, 2020, the aggressive action helped stabilize confidence. This sparked a massive rally, with the S&P 500 climbing to around 4,797 by January 2022—a gain of about 115% in under two years. Similarly, the 2019 rate cut cycle demonstrated the power of surprise. Beginning in July 2019, the Fed made three 25 basis point cuts, some of which were partly unexpected. These came after a period of rate hikes and helped fuel a major rally. From its low of about 2,346 in December 2018, the S&P 500 surged to around 3,393 by February 2020, a 45% gain in just 14 months. These examples show a clear pattern: when the Fed acts more aggressively than expected, it can ignite strong, sustained rallies. The current market setup is unique. The S&P 500 is trading near all-time highs around 6,584, unlike past rate-cut cycles, which often came during economic crises. The market has already priced in a 25 basis point cut, so a bigger move would be a major surprise. Adding complexity is political pressure from the Trump administration for deeper rate cuts. This could influence the Fed’s decision and the market’s response. Based on historical trends, the size of a surprise cut correlates directly with the rally potential. For perspective, the 45% rally starting in 2019 followed a total of 75 basis points in cuts, while the 115% rally from 2020 came after 150 basis points in emergency cuts. So a 50 basis point cut likely wouldn’t drive a rally on that scale, but a 30% gain is a realistic possibility. History shows that surprises can be powerful catalysts. There are compelling reasons for the Fed to go for an aggressive 50 basis point cut. The biggest is the element of surprise—since markets don’t expect it, such a move would be a strong signal. Lower rates also add liquidity, fueling growth and supporting multiple expansion as investors pay more for earnings. There’s also political pressure from the Trump administration, which could hint at more cuts to come. Of course, the Fed might do something else unexpected, like holding rates steady and maintaining its hawkish stance. That would likely hit markets hard. A lack of action could send the S&P 500 index down by as much as 8%. Inflation fears are real. See – Will Inflation Data Crush The S&P 500? – for more details. Even with the potential for a rally, there are key risks to consider. The upcoming Fed meeting is high stakes, and any deviation from the expected 25 basis point cut could spark big market moves. The consistent market swings after Fed meetings since 2019 highlight the importance of risk management. For instance, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 while avoiding much of this Fed-induced volatility, delivering cumulative returns of over 91% since inception—far better than broad market indices. A surprise 50-basis-point or larger Fed rate cut could still trigger a significant rally for the S&P 500, potentially 30% in the medium term based on historical precedent. However, the 2019 cycle offers a better comparison than the crisis-driven 2020 response, suggesting any rally would be more moderate but still substantial.
