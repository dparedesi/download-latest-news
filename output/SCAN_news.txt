Title: ETFs’ impact on Bitcoin – Is the classic bull-bear cycle over?

BTC’s cycle is becoming less predictable – Are ETFs and institutions changing the rules? The typical bull-bear Bitcoin [BTC] cycle may be facing a structural shift, according to DeFi analytics platform Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock). During previous cycles, Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTH) accumulated during bear markets and unloaded later during bull runs (mostly halving). This helped form the typical bowl-shaped (red) patterns on the crypto’s on-chain charts. Source: Sentora/X However, the current cycle has been different and confusing even to seasoned BTC cycle analysts, noted the analytics firm. “This time, however, the script is different: distribution kicked off much earlier, has unfolded in a slower, stop-start fashion, and shows none of the clean, symmetrical rhythm we’ve come to expect.” Most analysts have linked the perceived cycle changes to a greater number of institutions embracing BTC. Especially after the approval of U.S Spot ETFs in early 2024. In fact, CryptoQuant founder Ji Young Ju shared a similar outlook after making a wrong bear market call in early 2025, only for BTC to hit a new all-time high two months later. He said, “It feels like it’s time to throw out that cycle theory. New liquidity sources and volume are becoming more uncertain, signalling a transition as the Bitcoin market merges with TradFi.” Despite the aforementioned changes in demand and supply dynamics, the present cycle (epoch 5) has been closely trailing the third (blue) and fourth (green) cycles. Worth pointing out, however, that it slightly diverged in January 2025. Source: Glassnode Since the last April halving, Bitcoin has rallied by over 70%, rising from $63k to over $109k. However, over the same period, the past cycles saw much higher returns. In the 2020-2021 cycle (epoch 4), BTC pumped by 354% while in 2017 (epoch 3, blue), the asset gained by over 500%. When the returns were zoomed out on a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) basis, it revealed a steady decline. The 4-year BTC cycle CAGR dropped from over 850% in 2015 to about 30% in May 2025. In short, annual investor returns have shrunk over the years – A move some have linked to BTC’s “asset maturity” status as TradFi embraces it. This thesis can also be supported by easing volatility (price swings). Source: The Block Since the debut of U.S Spot ETFs, annualized BTC volatility (30-day) has dropped from 78% to 35% – A sign that the asset became relatively less volatile from early 2024. When zoomed out from 2017, its volatility has been trending southwards, indicating that BTC has become more mature. Further adoption by institutions may make it even more like stocks or gold. Going forward, BTC’s massive upside potential may diminish. Despite it being the best asset on a risk-adjusted basis, compared to most traditional investments.

Title: Should You Buy AVGO Stock At $230?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. SUQIAN, CHINA - MARCH 9, 2025 - An illustration photo shows the Broadcom LOGO displayed on a ... More smartphone in Suqian, Jiangsu province, China on March 9, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is up nearly 45% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the broader Nasdaq index, down 1%. This strong performance is largely due to the company’s rising sales, up 40% in the last twelve months. A major driver of this growth is Broadcom's AI product line, which saw an impressive 220% year-over-year increase in revenue to $12.2 billion in fiscal year 2024, fueled by high demand for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is strategically positioned to capitalize on the generative AI surge with its extensive suite of networking, storage, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Considering this strong performance, we believe AVGO stock is a good buy at its current price of around $230. While its current valuation is extremely high, making it sensitive to adverse events, we see minimal cause for concern. Our conclusion is based on comparing AVGO's current valuation with its recent operating performance and its current and historical financial health. Our analysis across key parameters—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—shows that Broadcom has a very strong operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Also, see – What Sparked UNH Stock Crash? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Broadcom's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Broadcom's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. AVGO stock has been less resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: AVGO stock has performed exceptionally well across these parameters. While the stock's valuation is currently high, it appears justifiable given its massive sales growth and solid operating cash flow margins of around 40%. Therefore, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock remains attractive, supporting our conclusion that AVGO is a good buy. However, investors should be aware of certain risks. The stock's high valuation makes it more prone to significant declines during adverse events, as demonstrated by its larger corrections than the broader market in two of the last three market crashes. Additionally, any slowdown in AI spending by companies would directly impact Broadcom's growth. Overall, investors should carefully consider these potential risks before investing in AVGO. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
