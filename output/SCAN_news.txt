Gold prices eased on Friday as investors booked profits from the previous session’s record high, but were set for an eighth straight weekly gain, driven by strong safe-haven demand amid concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff plans.

Trump’s fresh bout of tariff plans announced earlier this week includes duties on lumber and forest products, on top of previously announced plans to impose duties on imported cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.

The company has evolved from a traditional offline retail broking firm into a vibrant, fully integrated financial services powerhouse. Their strategic expansion into new realms such as Investment Banking, Alternative Investment Funds (AUM now at Rs 1000 cr.), Institutional Research, Debt Capital Markets, and Wealth Management has been nothing short of remarkable. The firm is present in 100+ cities with 55+ branches across the country and also has a sub-broker network of 900+. This year MNCL also announced a fundraise of 300 crore and issued a 1:1 bonus. The company profit soared from 2 crores in 2020 to 123 crores in 2024 with a profit of 40 crore alone in Q1 FY2025. “The market experienced tumultuous sessions, with initial attempts to rally ultimately faltering. The Trump administration’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs hit export-oriented industries hard, particularly the pharmaceutical sector, which saw significant underperformance. The auto sector also struggled, facing increased competition due to the opening up to foreign players. Adding to the market’s woes, the hawkish stance from the FOMC minutes cast a shadow over the likelihood of further rate cuts, complicating the economic outlook. However, the metal indices found some relief on Chinese steps to revive private investments. India is currently lagging behind its Asian peers, as FII outflows remain high, with the “sell India, buy China” strategy continuing to yield returns for the time being. Investors are keeping a close eye on upcoming pivotal indicators, such as the US Core PCE Price Index and India’s GDP growth rate. The market’s mood remains cautious, with pessimistic sentiments likely to linger until there is a marked improvement in corporate earnings and a conducive environment with easy global liquidity and stabilised currency.” Citi on Indigo: Maintain Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 5200/Sh versus Rs 5100/Sh (Positive) Citi on Federal Bank: Maintain Buy on Bank, target price at Rs 242/Sh (Positive) Jefferies on M&M: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 4075/Sh (Positive) MS on Cyient: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 1750/Sh (Positive) Nomura on Auto: EV policy to accelerate adoption, Tesla’s entry to benefit suppliers like Sona Comstar, Sansera and Motherson Sumi (Positive) CLSA on IT sector: Demand drivers improving; GenAI to be revenue driver going forward.

Throughout the week, the benchmark index struggled to break free from a narrow range, reflecting a cautious sentiment. The lingering pressure from developments in the previous week significantly influenced market performance, resulting in a persistent stagnation as the index remained anchored near the lower boundary of the falling wedge pattern. As the week ended, the overall lack of enthusiasm culminated in a negative outcome, with the index sliding by 0.58 percent to settle a tad below the 22800 zone. The benchmark index has been under pressure over the past 13 trading sessions, with the exception of a brief respite at the beginning of the week. Unfortunately, that single day of positive movement did not lead to any lasting improvements or beneficial effects on the overall market trend. Since NIFTY has been hovering around the lower band of 22900 - 22700 for the last few days and has rejected all attempts to convincingly cross the 23000 mark, the key support of 22700 seems in jeopardy. As a result, we would see it entering a crucial support zone of 22700 - 22400, where the actual litmus test lies for our markets. This scenario would likely heighten volatility and amplify concerns among investors; but we would advise traders to not get carried away and should avoid staying aggressive short in the market. Let the market decide its next course of action during the monthly expiry week. The first obstacle is located at 23000-23150, corresponding to the 20-DEMA, followed closely by 23300-23350, which marks the upper band of the wedge pattern. It is only through a decisive breach of these resistances that some relief and upward movement may be restored for market participants, potentially providing a much-needed boost to investor confidence. In light of the shortened monthly expiry week and the prevailing global uncertainties, we can expect an uptick in market volatility. Given the current landscape, it is prudent for traders to refrain from making overly aggressive bets and to adopt a more cautious approach, maintaining lighter positions on both the bullish and bearish sides. Furthermore, the inherent vulnerabilities within the market highlight the critical importance of vigilance. Traders should proactively consider various risk management strategies to navigate the evolving conditions effectively, ensuring they are prepared for potential market shifts. “FII selling continues unabated in the Indian stock market. After selling stocks for Rs 81903 crores through the exchanges in January, FIIs followed it up by selling stocks for Rs 30588 crores in February through 21st. This takes the total selling in 2025, so far, to Rs 112492 crores (NSDL). This massive selling has resulted in the Nifty yielding negative returns of 4% YTD. After Trump’s victory in US presidential elections, the US market has been attracting huge capital inflows from the rest of the world. But recently, China has emerged as a major destination of portfolio flows. The Chinese president’s new initiatives with their leading businessmen have kindled hopes of a growth recovery in China. The Chinese stock market responded positively to this. The Hang Seng index (FIIs buy Chinese stocks through the Hong Kong stock market) shot up by 18.7% in a month in sharp contrast to the 1.55 % decline in the Nifty. Since Chinese stocks continue to be cheap, this ‘Sell India, Buy China’ trade may continue. But this trade has happened in the past and experience is that it will fizzle out soon since there are structural problems constraining Chinese economic revival. Revival of FII investment in India will happen when economic growth and corporate earnings revive. Indications of that are likely to happen in two to three months.” Bears will continue to tighten their grip on the Indian markets amid heavy FII selling on Monday. Gift Nifty at 22,690 indicates a gap-down opening of about 300 points. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, said: foreign investor sentiment also remained weak, with approximately $25 billion in FII outflows since the market peak in late September, driven by concerns over high valuations and a slowing economy. India’s GDP growth is projected to decelerate to a four-year low of 6.4 per cent in this fiscal year, raising apprehensions about corporate profitability and economic stability. Institutional activity reflected net FII outflows of ₹7,793 crore in the cash segment, while DII inflows stood at ₹16,582 crore, offering some support to the market.

Title: The Next Big Energy Boom: How the Green Scam Collapse Is Driving a Historic Bull Market
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/uranium-market-trends-what-investors-should-know/
Time Published: 2025-02-23T02:14:19Z

Editor Economy International Man, Nick Giambruno “It was the single most important financial event of my career.” My friend and resource investing legend Rick Rule once shared this with me, reflecting on his experience in the uranium market during the last bull cycle—where extreme supply and demand imbalances triggered massive booms and busts. Rick was referring to Paladin Energy, a uranium stock that skyrocketed during uranium’s last bull market from less than one cent ($0.007) Australian dollar (AUD) per share at its bottom in April 2003 to AUD $9.57 at its peak in April 2007. It was a peak gain of over 130,000%—a greater than 1,000-fold increase. In other words, a $1,000 investment could have exploded into more than $1 million—had someone picked the bottom and top perfectly. Of course, that is not realistic, but as we can see in the chart below, even being within a year of the absolute bottom and top would have been enough to generate some phenomenal returns. Other uranium stocks also multiplied their share prices during the last bull market. However, Paladin was a rare and unique example. It was the best-performing company in the industry during the previous cycle. However, as stunning as Paladin’s performance was, it’s important to remember that past performance does not indicate future results—for any investment. I suspect it won’t be long before Western governments turn to nuclear energy in a big way. There are indications they are already doing that. In short, the Green Scam delusion is an enormous market distortion—a blessing in disguise. Distortions in the market allow shrewd speculators to get positioned for big potential profits as they collide with reality. It’s making uranium’s already attractive supply/demand situation even more appealing. Uranium mining stocks stand to be a primary beneficiary of this trend. In short, it is difficult for producers to ramp up production while uranium demand is rising. It often takes years for them to catch up. As a result, price is the only way for the market to resolve itself. That’s why the uranium price can have extraordinary spikes. However, the uranium market often doesn’t just settle into equilibrium during these periods. The uranium price often overshoots where it needs to go to balance the market, creating an enormous bull market. It’s a cycle that has played out three times before, and I think it will occur again soon. Looking at the Big Picture for uranium, I see a precarious supply situation, a long lead time to develop new mines (roughly ten years), dwindling inventories, and an unstable geopolitical situation in which countries are scrambling to secure their energy supplies. Yet, at the same time, there is growing (inflexible) demand for new nuclear power plants. With supply shrinking and demand rising, I think the stage is set for uranium prices to overshoot to the upside, just as we saw in the previous three bull market cycles with similar dynamics. The energy markets aren’t the only place where massive disruptions are unfolding. A dangerous combination of sky-high debt, relentless money printing, and deep cultural and political shifts is creating unprecedented economic instability. We are entering an era of volatility unlike anything we’ve seen in modern history—and those who fail to prepare could see their wealth and freedom evaporate.

Title: Travel Back in Time to 2009… and Buy Tech

By Adam Sharp PostedFebruary 20, 2025 In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2009, I was obsessed with the risk of a “double-dip” recession. The outlook was bleak. The banks all seemed to be failing, stocks had crashed, housing was belly-up, and the Fed was printing money like mad. So instead of gobbling up cheap tech shares, I was primarily focused on hoarding my (meager) stash of precious metals and preparing for an armageddon which never came. The gold and silver investments worked out fine, and I’m extremely bullish on gold and silver going forward. But let’s be honest. I would have been better off if I had diversified and bought fast-growing U.S. tech companies at huge discounts. For example, in January of 2009 Amazon (AMZN) shares traded as low as $2.38 (split-adjusted). Today it trades at $222, nearly 100x higher. That opportunity has passed. But what if there was a similar setup to the Nasdaq in 2009 available today? I think I’ve found it. But be forewarned, some of you are going to hate it. I’ve been reluctant to write about it for a while now, but simply can’t hold it in any longer. It’s… Chinese tech. Over the past few years, China’s massive real estate bubble has popped. Our own Jim Rickards nailed this event, writing in July of 2021 that China was a Fragile Giant. China also confronts an insolvent banking system and a real estate bubble. Up to half of China’s investment is a complete waste. It does produce jobs and utilize inputs like cement, steel, copper and glass. But the finished product, whether a city, train station or sports arena, is often a white elephant that will remain unused. The Chinese landscape is littered with “ghost cities” that have resulted from China’s wasted investment and flawed development model. It was an incredible call by Jim. In the years following that article, the KraneShares China Internet ETF (KWEB) crashed 80% from its all-time high. KWEB is China’s equivalent to the Nasdaq 100. So this was China’s version of America’s 2008 bubble crash, on steroids. Fast forward to today, however, and I believe the bottom is finally in for Chinese tech firms. KWEB still trades about 66% below its all-time high. Here’s a 5 year KWEB chart: As you can see, China’s tech sector is still far below all-time highs. If this is the beginning of a new bull market, it’s still quite early. Importantly, today DeepSeek has changed the narrative around Chinese technology. Whether we like it or not, they’re making major progress in areas such as AI, nuclear, fusion, electric vehicles, phones, satellites, semiconductors, and even planes. There are certainly problems in China, such as overcapacity and ruthless competition eroding profit margins. And needless to say, the communist government structure isn’t ideal for tech firms. Nevertheless, China’s tech sector is cheap, hated, and in an uptrend. That is typically a recipe for gains. This morning Alibaba (BABA) beat earnings and jumped more than 10% in early trading. As I write this it’s still up around 7% at midday. Alibaba is the “Amazon of China”. It’s the country’s largest online retailer, and the largest cloud computing provider (just like Amazon). You could also call the company the “Paypal of China”, due to its 33% stake in Ant Group, which owns the all-encompassing Alipay payment app (think Paypal meets Visa). Alibaba is also one of the top 3 AI companies in China, and its leading AI model, Qwen Max 2.5, is competitive with ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Google’s top models. Alibaba has soared 80% over the past year. But it has huge amounts of room to run to get back to all-time highs. Here’s a 5-year chart of BABA: So… why did Alibaba shares crash, anyways? The first factor was the real estate bubble popping, which we covered above. But there’s more to the story. Back in 2021 and 2022, Alibaba was dominating in China a little too much. President Xi and the CCP didn’t like that. Alibaba’s subsidiary Ant Group was making big moves in the financial space, threatening to cut in on state-owned banks and other financial businesses. So the Chinese government laid the smack down on Alibaba, issuing huge fines and cancelling the IPO of Ant Group (Alipay). This is a real risk of investing in China. The government has too much power over business matters. But I think that risk has mostly passed. Today Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma have paid their fines, and their dues. A meeting with President Xi this week sealed the deal. Jack Ma and BABA are suddenly back in polite society. President Xi and the government have signaled support for the private sector, and are stimulating the economy with QE and cheap loans (as we did in 2009). To be clear, I don’t think Alibaba will deliver 100x returns from here. It’s already too large for those types of gains. But I think it still has a very nice run ahead of it. The Ant Group (Alipay) IPO could happen in the near future, which would be a major catalyst for the stock. In full transparency, over the past 7 months I’ve been buying Alibaba (BABA), Xiaomi (XIACY), and BYD (BYDDY). These are some of China’s hottest tech firms. I also recently added a China small-cap ETF (ECNS) and PGJ (China internet ETF). I plan to hold these positions for at least five years, if not longer. This week President Trump posted the following message on his Truth Social platform. Source: Truth Social Some of you may be surprised by President Trump’s friendly tone here. I am not. We need to make a trade deal with China, and soon, as we discussed last month. It’s in both countries’ interests. If a trade deal with China does go through, that should throw gas on the fire beneath Chinese tech stocks. Uncertainty around trade wars and tariffs has been a major factor holding back the sector. Overall I strongly believe the global trade wars are just beginning, but we may see some progress soon on the China front. To conclude, I believe the setup in Chinese tech today is quite similar to the Nasdaq in 2009. I may be wrong, but am willing to take that chance given the potential upside. It’s not very often we get a chance to buy fast-growing tech at a 66% discount. I’m not going to miss the opportunity this time, even if it means investing in a communist country. If some of you can’t stomach that, however, I completely understand. It’s not the hand I would’ve chosen, but it is the one we’ve been dealt. I believe China’s tech sector is in for a lucrative bull market ahead. Phew, it feels good to have that off my chest. Disclosure: Of the companies and funds mentioned in this article, the author owns Alibaba, Xiaomi, BYD, PGJ, and ECNS.
