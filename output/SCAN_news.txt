Title: What’s Happening With AMZN Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 27 January 2025, Bavaria, Munich: The logo and lettering of global online mail order company Amazon ... More can be seen under the blue sky on the façade of Amazon Germany's headquarters in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on January 27, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) Amazon’s stock has declined approximately 18% this year, largely due to investor concerns about potential tariff impacts on its business model. This is particularly significant as Amazon’s marketplace relies heavily on third-party sellers from China, making it vulnerable to import tariff increases. Even if the Trump administration eventually reduces these tariffs, Amazon’s operations may face lasting structural changes. Additionally, broader tariff-driven inflation could dampen consumer purchasing power, further impacting Amazon’s retail sales. Separately, What’s Going On With META Stock? Looking at a longer timeframe reveals an even more concerning picture: since early 2022, Amazon's stock has gained only about 9% over three years. This underperformance can be attributed to several key factors: Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio — and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Amazon has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 36% revenue increase, growing from $470 billion in 2021 to $638 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is driven by several sustainable factors: Amazon's net income margin has improved by approximately 31%, increasing from 7.1% to 9.3% during this period. This margin expansion primarily stems from the increasing contribution of AWS, which operates at substantially higher margins than the retail business. As AWS constitutes a larger percentage of overall revenue, it positively impacts the company's aggregate profit margins. The combination of revenue growth and margin expansion has resulted in a 71% increase in earnings per share, rising from $3.24 in 2021 to $5.53 in the last twelve months. Despite strong operational improvements, Amazon's P/E ratio has contracted by 36% (from 51.5 to 32.7) since 2021, reflecting several investor concerns: Given these uncertainties, investors should ask themselves critical questions: Do you want to hold on to your AMZN stock now? Will you panic and sell if it starts dropping further? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy. While Amazon remains fundamentally strong with impressive growth and improving profitability, investors seeking to preserve wealth in volatile markets might consider alternative strategies. Trefis works with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston area wealth manager—whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns even during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: What’s Happening With Palantir Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. POLAND - 2024/11/21: In this photo illustration, the Palantir company logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) S&P is down 6% in April. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) is up 11%? That’s not bullish. That’s bizarre, considering the numbers you see when you lift the curtain. Tariffs are hammering tech, semiconductors are shaking, growth stocks are bleeding, and Palantir - a stock trading at PE multiple of 700 is rising? Either we’re witnessing brilliance or a bubble inflating before our eyes. And bubbles pop. When they do, you don’t want to be left holding nothing. This is why investing in a single stock, no matter how lucrative, can be very risky. We diversify away that risk while being exposed to upside in our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s break Palantir down. It’s not fundamentals driving this. It’s euphoria supercharged by three powerful story lines: [1] AI Buzz = Investor Sugar High Palantir calls itself an “AI company” now. That label alone triggers algos and retail fear-of-missing-out. Still, AI hype alone can send any ticker vertical. Just ask C3.ai - that reached highs of $180+ before falling to a mere $10. [2] Insane Momentum: The Stock is Up Almost 700% in 3 Years Palantir has returned 686% in the past 3 years. That’s the kind of move that breaks valuation anchors. People stop asking “what’s it worth?” and start asking “how high can it go?” [3] Retail Crowd Favorite Palantir is a retail darling - with a CEO (Alex Karp) who talks like a philosopher and a cult-like following that sees it as the next Palantir-for-planet-earth operating system. But sentiment isn’t a moat. And it isn’t a reason to buy. Palantir bulls love to talk about potential. But here’s what the data actually says: There are times to ride such momentum, but in the case of Palantir, that time is gone. Valuation multiples mean something. Evaluating multiples in the context of growth and margin expansion is one of the factors we consider in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByJacob Wolinsky ByJacob Wolinsky, Contributor. NEW YORK, NY - JANUARY 16: A sign hangs on the BlackRock offices on January 16, 2014 in New York ... More City. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Value stocks bounced in the second half of last year, and several experts are saying the day of value is returning. However, BlackRock is warning that investors might be underweight value stocks at a time when the markets could start shifting. Additionally, history has shown that savvy stock picking is a better way to gain access to value stocks rather than by tracking one of the value indexes. Here are four value stock picks from two leading managers as the second quarter goes into full swing. In a recent interview, Judson Traphagen of Plough Penny Partners chose Lesaka Technologies (NASDAQ:LSAK) and Veon (NASDAQ:VEON), which are trading at around $4.50 and $45 a share, respectively. Meanwhile, Alyx Wood of Kernow Asset Management selected Card Factory (LON:CARD) and Kistos (LON:KIST), which are trading at around GBX90 and GBX129 a share. Plough Penny Partners is a long-biased, fundamental growth fund that prefers to target holding periods of between three to five years. The fund typically holds a concentrated portfolio of 10 to 20 long positions with a handful of opportunistic shorts. Plough Penny specifically targets high-growth technology companies, investing globally in fintech, software and internet companies. Kernow Asset Management uses a long-short equity strategy in search of contrarian alpha from U.K. equities. The firm pairs fundamental analysis with catalyst-driven mean reversion investments. Kernow seeks market inefficiencies and tries to determine how they work and how valuation gaps might be closed. Traphagen describes Lesaka as an under-the-radar small-cap fintech company undergoing secular growth and in the early stages of a multi-year trajectory. The company’s business is largely in southern Africa. Comparing Lesaka to StoneCo and Nubank in Latin America, Traphagen believes it’s perhaps the best way for U.S. investors to target Africa’s largely untapped growth market for fintech. In the same way Square serves U.S. customers, Lesaka provides digital financial solutions to consumers and merchants in southern Africa. Traphagen was initially drawn to Lesaka Technologies because he’s always seeking companies with great management, rapid revenue growth, and expanding margins that are operating in massive total addressable markets. He also seeks companies with solid unit economics and that have “barely penetrated their target markets.” “We have made money in emerging markets fintech stocks like Nubank and StoneCo in Latin America and had read that Africa was the next big market in fintech, so we looked for a stock to benefit from that trend,” Traphagen explained. “LSAK is that stock.” In the short term, he believes Lesaka Technologies is worth $7.50 a share, but he suspects it might end up being a multi-bagger in the long term. Veon is a telecommunications company that operates in frontier markets, providing traditional telco services and newer digital products and services. In recent years, it has sped up its digital products and services and now generates a sizable share of its revenues from digital products and services. Like with Lesaka, Traphagen believes the opportunity in Veon exists because it’s still largely unknown to U.S. investors, operating in markets that are essentially alien to U.S. investors, although it trades on the Nasdaq. Traphagen was initially attracted to Veon because of its valuation, but then he discovered its “compelling” total addressable market and opportunity for digital products in an area where competition by U.S. technology companies is lacking. He also was attracted to Veon because the company is ambitiously de-levering, selling off non-core assets and repurchasing shares. Card Factory is a top greeting card retailer in the U.K. that also sells gifts, party supplies and related products. The company was founded based on the opportunity to sell greeting cards at much lower price points than competitors via a vertically integrated business model that includes manufacturing cards in-house. Interestingly, Wood was initially drawn to Card Factory as a potential short position during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, the company had high debt and was facing the possibility of bankruptcy. However, after Wood ran the fundamentals and conducted the people and strategy work, he found the company to be of higher quality than he had expected. “This made it a long idea as soon as they started growing profits and the debt was cleared by cashflow,” Wood explained. “The business is trading at a distressed price. This is at odds to the great balance sheet, and profits are set to double. It’s a hidden quality growth stock. So we did more work and linked our trade journey to the partnerships, which are free growth centers.” Management expects to double their profits over the next three years, although Wood said the market is skeptical because of the seemingly untested partnerships and international expansion. However, he added that they’re “comfortable with being paid to take the risk for free.” Those partnerships are basically new places where Card Factory’s cards are being sold on stands within stores rather than just on the High Street. Kistos is an independent, integrated energy company that has both upstream and midstream operations that span international markets. Wood was initially drawn to the stock by the 350% gap with their valuation in the Kernow Valuation Framework, which begins with valuing companies using their proprietary fundamental bottom-up process. He feels Kistos has a clear edge over other oil and gas companies because it extracts value from overlooked assets “more efficiently than almost anyone else.” Wood estimates the company’s intrinsic value at £350 million, although its market cap is only a mere £100 million currently. He said the company’s production is set to almost double this year to 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and the market is ignoring this potential. According to BlackRock, growth stocks accounted for 37% of the S&P 500 as of the end of November, versus the historical average of 24%. This was due to the heavy favoritism assigned to growth stocks in the first half of 2024 as investors widely preferred mega-cap technology stocks. However, that high concentration could unintentionally leave many investor portfolios coming up short in the diversification department, meaning a greater chance of missing out on the upside from rallies in value stocks like the one that started in July 2024. Thus, investors might want to take a closer look at their portfolios to see where they stand in the value-versus-growth.
