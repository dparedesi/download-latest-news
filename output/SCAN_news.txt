UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 20 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom.

Title: 3 Top Charles Schwab Index Funds To Invest In
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-charles-schwab-index-funds-invest-in/
Time Published: 2024-09-17T16:09:32Z

© 2024 Bloomberg Finance LP Charles Schwab ranks among the top 10 in the largest fund families for total net assets. The financial services firm has more than 50 years of history and presents ample opportunity for all investors to gain exposure to the markets. Of the 22 years I spent in my former life as an investment advisor, nearly all of it was with Schwab as my firm’s custodian. And while that is a separate (institutional) division versus the one we are talking about in this article, I did get a good sense of how this major player across the wealth spectrum operates. And, while the usual disclaimer applies, that “top” is a subjective term when investment products are the topic, I sorted through the range of index funds offered by Schwab and identified a few that I personally am most comfortable with. Each investor ultimately decides that for themselves, of course. Through simple, and cost-effective index funds, investors have plenty of outlets and information to seek the right fit when allocating their capital. Let’s take a deeper dive deeper into a few of this firm’s index fund offerings, and explain my rationale for choosing them for this short list. While I generally believe that the “cost” of investing is over-emphasized in a lot of ETF and mutual fund research, when it comes to funds that track a broad, liquid market index like the S&P 500, I get it. The main difference between otherwise identical funds is how much the fund company extracts for themselves. My opinion is that once we get outside of that investment area to funds that have other purposes, such as hedging risk and diversification beyond traditional stock and investments, expense ratios are less of a concern than finding a fund that can get that job done. The biggest “cost” to investors over time, unless they live through a lifetime of bull markets, is suffering steep losses in bad markets that take years to recover from. But these are the former type of investment, so costs are key. Schwab is known for its low fees and commissions. Many of its investment products, such as ETFs and mutual funds, have no transaction fees, and they were among the first large brokerages to eliminate standard commissions on stocks and ETFs. They also often offer lower expense ratios compared to other firms. But before anyone thinks that Schwab, Vanguard and their index peers are non-profit organizations, understand that there are other sources of revenue that allow them to offer some funds at zero or near zero expense ratio and “no commissions.” Schwab is the fifth-largest ETF provider in the U.S., with more than $342 billion in assets under management (AUM). They offer a wide array of investment products. In the index fund realm, they can accommodate many levels of diversification, and access many corners of the globe. Charles Schwab is well regarded for its user friendly platforms and extensive educational and research tools to help investors make informed decisions. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. My objective here was to go beyond the usual with the Schwab universe. I stuck with ETFs, as I feel that for investors who are cost-sensitive, ETFs structurally are designed to keep taxes and other investment management inefficiencies to a minimum versus index mutual funds. Here is a quick table showing a few key statistics on the three ETFs I am highlighting. Below I offer more detail on each of them. Data source: YCharts Recent Share Price: $84.15 Sector/Industry: Diversified across sectors, with high dividend emphasis Weighted Average Market Cap: $130 billion P/E Ratio: 17.1 Total Holdings: 103 I follow dividend ETFs quite closely in my research, and am a dividend investor at heart. So while SCHD is a solid peer among others in the dividend ETF space, I am quite surprised that it has blown through the $50 billion mark in assets. I see it as competitive within that peer group, but not the best. This is the power of a big firm like Schwab at work. SCHD seeks to track the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which includes 100 high dividend yielding U.S. stocks with a history of consistent dividend payments. The goal is to provide investors with exposure to dividend-paying equities while aiming for long-term capital appreciation. Uncertainty with interest rates, big company earnings, elections and geopolitical turmoil all contribute to the relative attractiveness of dividend stocks versus higher growth stocks. SCHD has had 12 consecutive years of dividend growth, which can act as a decent cushion in tough phases of the market cycle. While involving nearly every sector, SCHD focuses on high quality U.S companies that are typically larger in size. The stocks in this fund hav... (truncated)

Title: Rates to plunge to 2.75pc next year, says HSBC
URL: https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/rates-plunge-2-75pc-next-172625383.html
Time Published: 2024-09-20T17:26:25Z

The Bank of England could cut interest rates to 2.75pc next year, analysts have suggested, amid growing confidence that the worst of Britain’s inflationary crisis is over. Policymakers are likely to cut interest rates at November’s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and then again at every meeting next year from February, according to analysts from HSBC. It follows a decision by the Bank of England’s MPC earlier this week to keep rates on hold at 5pc. The Bank Rate had surged as high as 5.25pc following a series of rises over the past few years to try keep a lid on inflation. Last month, the Bank of England cut interest rates for the first time in four years. The analysts at HSBC said: “Part of the slightly better medium-term growth outlook reflects monetary policy. “With most indicators pointing to a cooling in the labour market, we and BoE have become more confident that the worst of the inflation pressures - and the risk of them becoming entrenched - is behind us. Given this, the current policy rate looks some way above neutral.” They said the latest statement from the Monetary Policy Committee suggested that rate setters were not in “the mood to move quickly”. However, the analysts said: “Given our own forecast that CPI inflation will rise back to 2.9pc by January next year (perhaps a touch above the Bank of England’s expectation), it might be February before the MPC has sufficient confidence for back-to-back rate cuts taking Bank Rate to 2.75pc in December next year.” HSBC suggested rates would then remain on hold throughout 2026. Read the latest updates below. Thanks for joining us today. The Markets blog will be back on Monday morning, but you can keep up to date over the weekend with business news and analysis from The Telegraph here. Christine Lagarde has said she was “shocked” by Germans’ enthusiastic use of cash when she moved to Frankfurt to head the European Central Bank. Tim Wallace reports: “I was shocked when I moved to Frankfurt to see how much was paid in banknotes. You had better have a big wallet, because a lot is paid in banknotes,” she said. “The citizens are attached to banknotes. You go to Sweden or to the Netherlands and you can hardly pay with a banknote - they send you off, bring your phone, don’t you have another way to pay?” The ECB President is looking into creating a central bank digital currency, but said citizens are worried about the privacy of the system. “The main concern people have is privacy - Big Brother is going to see where I spend my money,” she told an audience at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. “You know what, there are a few Big Brothers when you use your bank account or when you use other devices who know where you are spending your money, know what you are interested in and will send you instantly all those ads and nice proposals. “But the concern about the state - the assumption is the central bank will communicate all information collected to the state - will be privy to how you spend your money is something that is very very critical for citizens.” In her lecture to the IMF, Ms Lagarde warned that the inflation shock may not be a one-off. “If we enter an era where inflation is more volatile and monetary policy transmission more uncertain, maintaining this deep anchor for price formation will be essential,” she said, referring to the expectation among households and businesses that central banks will always raise interest rates to crush inflation. She also compared the 2020s to the 1920s, citing similarities including pandemics, a reversal of globalisation, and rapid technological progress. But she also raised the hope that central banks have learned their lesson from that era and should be able to avoid the “series of wrong turns” which tipped much of the world into the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve’s big interest rate cut this week is not a sign that the US economy is “falling behind,” Fed governor Christopher Waller said in an interview this afternoon. He told CNBC: It’s not about reacting to, or falling behind or anything like that. I do not believe we’re behind. Mr Waller was responding to arguments that the central bank should not do a half percentage point rate cut - instead opting for a smaller reduction - as this would be a sign of economic weakness. Citing a speech he made earlier this year, Mr Waller stressed that the Fed could cut rates even if the economy was doing fine. “And that’s the position we’re in,” he said, noting that inflation is cooling while the labour market remains solid. Central banks face a “difficult balancing act” as they start lowering interest rates around the world in the face of falling inflation, the head of the IMF said at an event this afternoon. Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have cut rates this year, with the US Federal Reserve reducing its key lending rate by half a percentage point earlier this week in a bid to boost demand, following in the footsteps of the European Ce...
