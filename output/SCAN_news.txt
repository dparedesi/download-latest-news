Investing Nvidia invested $2B in CoreWeave to accelerate AI data center expansion toward 5GW+ by 2030. Tesla’s European sales fell 27% in 2025 while BYD surged 286.6%. Sending You to Google News in 3 © IPhone 16 series in Apple Store Nagoya Sakae (CC BY-SA 4.0) by Kyu3a Shares of buy now, pay later stock Affirm (NASDAQ: AFRM) are gaining attention. All after analysts at Needham upgraded the stock to a buy with a $100 price target. The firm added that, “AFRM has submitted an application to establish Affirm Bank, a proposed Nevada-chartered industrial loan company,” as quoted by CNBC. We have to consider that BNPL is only expected to explode as Americans take on more debt. In doing so, they’re also using loans more than ever before. As noted by MarketWatch, shoppers used BNPL to spend about $20 billion between November 1 and December 31. That’s a 9.8% year over year increase. The global Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) market is experiencing massive growth. It’s projected to reach between $560 billion and over $900 billion in transaction volume by 2030. All are driven by surging e-commerce demand and flexible payment adoption. In the U.S. alone, the market is expected to reach $198 billion in 2026. All of which should help drive BNPL stock, like Affirm, to higher highs. Shares of CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) are up 12%, or by $12.51 on the day. For one, Nvidia just invested $2 billion to expand AI data center capacity. “This deal allows us to accelerate our build, which will lead to continued diversification and reducing dependency on any particular client as we scale into this additional data center capacity,” CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator told CNBC. Analysts at Deutsche Bank upgraded CRWV to a buy rating with a $140 price target on the Nvidia news. The firm added, “It provides CoreWeave three key things: (1) an accelerated path to its newly stated goal of adding 5GW+ of Al Infrastructure by 2030 (beyond current 2.9GW backlog), leveraging NVIDIA’s financial strength to secure access to additional land and powered shells; (2) deepened technical integration that should enable CoreWeave to remain among the very first to market with new NVIDIA compute architectures; (3) potential for the company’s SUNK and Mission Control,” as quoted by Seeking Alpha. Shares of Humana (NYSE: HUM) are down just over 19%, or by $68 a share. All after the Trump Administration proposed nearly flat rates for Medicare Advantage insurers. “The proposal entails a net average payment increase of 0.09% for Medicare Advantage plans in 2027, according to a press release from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as noted by CNBC. That number is significantly less than Wall Street analysts’ expectations that the agency would propose a rate increase of between 4% to 6% for next year.” Not helping, President Trump has said he wants to get rid of insurance brokers and corporate middlemen. All in an effort to help cut healthcare premiums, as noted in the Administration’s Great Healthcare Plan. That plan can be read here. Other health insurance stocks, like UnitedHealth, are down about $70 a share on that news. Not helping, the company just issued softer-than-expected revenue with a poor 2026 outlook. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is gaining momentum ahead of earnings on Thursday. Helping, JPMorgan reiterated its overweight rating on Apple. It also raised its price target to $315 from $305 ahead of Apple’s first-quarter earnings. Evercore ISI added Apple to its Tactical Outperform list, arguing that strong iPhone demand positions the company for strong earnings. The firm added, “We remain positive on shares of AAPL heading into the Dec-qtr earnings this Thursday, as our checks suggest that there’s near-term upside to street estimates, driven by strong iPhone demand and a minimal memory cost headwind (through the Mar-qtr),” as quoted by CNBC. Analysts at Citigroup say that the surge in demand for iPhone 17 models carried through the end of the year. In addition, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook, “First-quarter revenue is expected to demonstrate year-over-year growth ranging from 10% to 12%, which translates to $136.7B to $139.2B. This would easily eclipse Apple’s previous record high quarterly revenue of $124.3B set during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. What’s more, it would stand as Apple’s most significant year-over-year revenue jump since the first quarter of fiscal 2022, when it posted an 11.2% increase,” as quoted by Seeking Alpha. Cantor Fitzgerald just reiterated their overweight rating on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) ahead of earnings. The firm noted that ahead of tomorrow’s call, Tesla is likely to disclose its 2026 vehicle delivery outlook. It’s looking to see if the company is guiding for growth or for another year of soft sales, which will be a key catalyst for TSLA. At the moment, we know that TSLA finished 2025 with weak European sales as BYD continues to outperform Elon Musk’s company. On an annual basis, Tesla’s European sales were down 27% year over year, as compared to BYD’s 286.6% jump year over year. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Nvidia’s Rally Shows DeepSeek Fears Were Unfounded a Year Later

A year ago, the Chinese startup DeepSeek freaked out the stock market with the idea that developing artificial intelligence was much easier and cheaper than everyone imagined. But 12 months later, that’s turned out to be largely a mirage so far. DeepSeek erased a record $589 billion from Nvidia Corp.’s market value in one day after the company revealed an AI model thought to be comparable to those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. and developed at a fraction of the cost. Nvidia’s double-digit plunge led the S&P 500 Index 1.5% lower, while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 Index shed 3%. Even energy and utilities stocks like Vistra Corp. and Constellation Energy Corp., which benefit from the technology’s buildout, sold off. Just 24 hours later, though, Nvidia shares rebounded, erasing some its losses as investors rushed to buy the dip. Over the following days and weeks, investor concern waned as reports showed that DeepSeek’s model wasn’t as much of a competitive threat as first feared. “The initial reaction was ‘oh my God, this could be done way cheaper and these companies are in trouble, and Nvidia’s not going to be able to sell these expensive chips,'” said Eric Diton, president and managing director of Wealth Alliance. “Here we are a year later and that’s just obviously not true. Nvidia’s growth rate continues to just defy all logic.” Shares of Nvidia, which contributed to the lion’s share of the S&P 500’s advance in 2025, are now up 58% since the DeepSeek selloff. There was a “massive overreaction” to DeepSeek, said Google DeepMind Chief Executive Officer Demis Hassabis, at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, where the debate over whether China is a threat to tech in the US percolated. Even Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek “AI’s Sputnik moment” last year. The knee-jerk reaction to DeepSeek was a stark reminder of an investing tenant: Innovation is ever-present and can quickly change the course of the market, especially when it comes to nascent tech. “Technology moves incredibly fast,” said Eric Gerster, chief investment officer at AlphaCore Wealth Advisory. “One has to be a little bit nimble.” One of the key fears raised by DeepSeek was that the billions of dollars in capital expenditures pledged by hyperscalers would be cut, hampering growth at Nvidia and other companies associated with building AI. Instead, spending has soared, with Meta, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. expected to deploy roughly $475 billion for capital expenditures in 2026, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Though investors have largely cheered rising capex budgets, there are worries about bottlenecks hindering development and the possibility of an overbuild. Investors have become sensitive to deals between AI companies that appear circular in nature, and especially skeptical that OpenAI, a private company, will be able to spend the more than $1 trillion they’ve committed to building AI infrastructure. But, so far, the sheer amount of money being spent building data centers to get more computing power has helped the AI trade broaden beyond just chipmakers. Last year, memory stocks including Sandisk Corp., Seagate Technology Holdings Plc, Western Digital Corp. and Micron Technology Inc. were the S&P 500’s biggest winners. Energy, utilities, materials and industrial sectors also got a lift as investors looked for ways to invest in AI outside of large-cap tech companies. Memory stocks have continued to outperform so far in 2026. AI Evolution While it’s become clear that Nvidia’s graphics processing units still dominate the market, there’s a place for custom-made chips and more general purpose processors. That has helped other companies claim a stake. For example, Alphabet’s tensor processing unit, or TPU, chips have been an upside catalyst for its shares because of their use within the company and the potential that they could be sold to third parties. Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and even Intel Corp. have also seen shares rise over optimism for their chips. “DeepSeek was able to show there’s different, equally effective ways of using these artificial intelligence models that don’t necessarily mean you have to have the fastest and newest chips,” said Allen Bond, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management. “What we’ve seen is just more of an evolution, and we would expect that to continue at this point.” While the AI boom remains strong, some of the biggest winners from the tech — the Magnificent Seven group of stocks — is down about 0.3% this year, with Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta and Amazon shares in positive territory. That’s not a death knell for the AI trade, according to Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer at Spear Invest. The companies with the brightest outlooks for profit growth are now tied to infrastructure, she said. The AI “trade is still on, I’d compare it more to an industrial revolution,” Delevska said. “It’s impacting the entire market.” Top Tech Stories Photograph: The Deepseek logo; Photo credit: Raul Ariano/Bloomberg Related:

Title: After A Snake-Like 2025, Is The Bitcoin Price Ready to Break Out In 2026?

The bitcoin price twisted and turned through a tough 2025 — but historical cycles, investor sentiment, and market signals suggest a stronger 2026 may be ahead. We had high hopes for the bitcoin price in 2025. It was supposed to be the crescendo of the four-year cycle, the most bullish setup in recent memory. It was the year after the halving, the ETFs had just been approved, a new president was elected, with the promise of the money printer roaring back to life. Everything looked primed for a Q4 blow-off top, and instead of a new life in Monaco, all you got was this lousy article. What follows is my interpretation of the events of 2025 and my outlook for 2026. I’m not a trader, not an analyst, and like you, I’ve been outperforming professional funds for years, by simply stacking Sats, of course. I’m more of a “fix the money, fix the world” kinda guy, but like everyone else, it’s hard to ignore Bitcoin’s price movements, which I think of as the game of “Snakes and Ladders”. In the game of Snakes and Ladders, momentum drives us forward, but it can also provide a false sense of confidence. You can be one roll away from victory, only to land on a snake that sends you sliding back ten places. As much as hopium dictates that we pray for the price to go ‘up and to the right’, markets rarely oblige. Switching from the board to the chart, price action is played on a board of global liquidity and market sentiment. When sentiment is low or liquidity dries up, no amount of good news can sustain momentum. We simply crab sideways or find a snake that slides us down into further despair. On the other hand, when liquidity floods the system, we often find the ladders that shoot us through resistance levels. For most of 2025, we were stuck playing the former, while dreaming of the “ladder”. So let’s take this time to review 2025 from the perspective of hindsight, as foresight proved to be of little benefit. If there is a phrase that defines the Bitcoin market of 2025, it is exactly that: a Year of Snakes and precious few ladders. Interestingly, and unbeknownst to me, 2025 was indeed the year of the snake according to the 12-year Chinese zodiac cycle, starting January 29, 2025, and ending February 16, 2026. We began the year with the kind of euphoria that usually marks a cycle top. The halving was behind us, and the political stars had aligned perfectly. Google trends showed search queries were soaring. In fact, the year kicked off with a quiet but massive victory before the political fireworks even started: FASB fair value accounting rules took effect on January 1st, finally allowing companies to report bitcoin profits rather than just losses. Then came the main event. We witnessed the inauguration of a “Bitcoin President.” Gary Gensler departed, leaving behind a legacy that, in hindsight, was perhaps less villainous than we assumed, and Ross Ulbricht walked free within 48 hours. With the new administration came a few allies: Paul Atkins took over the SEC and Mike Selig the CFTC, securing a pro-crypto cabinet. The financial plumbing was finally completed. The ETFs were fully operational, options trading on IBIT were unleashed, and it quickly became clear that Michael Saylor was not about to let Larry Fink steal his thunder. MicroStrategy went on a $25 billion buying spree, 100x what they bought in 2020, and the corporate treasury list exploded from 60 companies to nearly 200. By October, the engines were well and truly revving. We hit the All-Time High on October 6th, ready to punch the accelerator for the glorious Q4 end-of-cycle run. Instead, we shifted the gear into reverse and slid all the way down to $80,000. First, we got our knickers in a twist over the “Knots vs. Core” drama. Then came the Binance incident, where the snake manifested itself as a “technical issue” at precisely the wrong time, and right as Gold broke out. We essentially got rug-pulled by a glitch. The issue of October 10th likely created added sell pressure through forced liquidations, whilst also triggering the 4-year cycle sellers who have been trained to sell Q4 of the 4th year. Few understood the gravity of it at the time, though I tip my hat to Jesse Olson for calling it early. Then the FUD machine was turned on. First, it targeted MicroStrategy with threats of MSCI exclusion; it didn’t help sentiment that its mNAV has been dropping all year. Then it pivoted back to Bitcoin with the return of the “quantum attack” narrative. While the headlines swirled, the bitcoin price became stuck in purgatory, range-bound between $84,000 and $95,000 and trapped by options traders, even though the handcuffs had theoretically been taken off IBIT options earlier in the year. Bitcoin was having an Austin Powers moment, while Peter Schiff enjoyed his first day out in the sun since high school. Bless him. While some fear 2026 will bring the hangover of a post-cycle bear market, I, like countless other optimists believe otherwise. If 2025 was the year of snakes, 2026 is the year we finally climb a few ladders. The setup is favourable. We have a Bitcoin-ish president, who’s hungry to fire up the printing press, we’ve a developing multipolar world, where the process of game theory should be heating up, there’s a $7 trillion debt wall to be paid, the old guard are positioned, the regulation stranglehold has been loosened, the cowboys (FTX, Terra-Luna, etc.) are gone, gold and silver have both had their runs, and Bitcoin’s supposed to follow next, or so we hope. Not to mention, the tax year is done, and new budgets have been allocated to fund managers and businesses alike. FASB fair value accounting is now live, smoothing the runway for corporate balance sheets. Michael Saylor is still buying with the relentless intensity of a man who understands math better than Archimedes. Even the “MSCI FUD” was defeated early, so credit to George and the Bitcoin for Corporations team for that victory. At the point in time as the price is beginning to climb higher, the bears are finally showing signs of exhaustion, that’s according to James Check and countless others. By far the most significant headwind Bitcoin faced in 2025 was the relentless onslaught of coins sold by long-term holders. That pressure looks to finally be ending. On November 1st, approximately 67% of the Realised Cap was invested above $95k. The last two months have seen a massive supply redistribution occur, with that metric declining to 47%. Over the last 30 days, around 80% of the coins which have transacted came from higher prices. This is the definition of capitulation. The weak hands who bought the top have flushed out, and new buyers have stepped in with a lower and stronger cost basis. Incidentally, the Year of the Snake officially ends on February 16, 2026, to be followed by a horse, which as we all know has the ability to outrun any bull. This coincides almost perfectly with the monthly CME Futures expiry on February 27th. The shedding of a snake’s skin happens right before the growth returns. Really, who can truly say they know? What we do know is that the four-year cycle is no longer connected to the halvings or the presidential cycles in the way we once thought, and the halvings are less likely to have an effect going forward, as the new coins distributed are a lower percentage of supply, and the miners are supported by huge funds which can help them weather any potential death spiral.We have not seen a Pi Cycle top signal, the 200 week moving average has not crossed the prior cycle top, the MVRV score is just 1.3, the Puell multiple is just .99, we’ve not had a considerable drawdown, and we’re still at the bottom of the range of almost every metric imaginable. For those of you who are old enough to remember the KitKat ad from the 90’s, “the 4 year cycle is not dead, it was just takin’ a break.” As the 4-year cycle is a purely Liquidity Based Cycle, it can be measured by proxy using the ISM Manufacturing PMI, a qualitative index sourced from purchasing managers in the manufacturing industry. I give credit to Raoul Pal for highlighting this metric; he was the first I observed to point out that bitcoin is a “Liquidity” asset rather than a “Halving” asset. Bitcoin, as the highest-beta risk asset in existence, responds to shifts in global risk appetite with greater force and speed than any other asset class. The PMI tracks the business cycle, and it has been in contraction for nearly two years. The current PMI at 47.9 signals ongoing contraction, but ISM projections indicate a 4.4% revenue growth for manufacturing in 2026, crossing 50 in Q2 as Trump’s policies kick in. The bitcoin price should follow. When the ISM PMI is below 50, we’re generally in a bear market, and we’ve been that way for over two years now. The bull markets have historically topped out between 55 and 65. The question remains, when is the business cycle going to see an upturn? TechDev is of the view that it’s happening very soon, as the bullish divergence reversal momentum is decidedly building. The $9 Trillion Debt Question The US government has to address the $9 trillion debt wall that’s due to mature this year. But the nuance is in how they do it. President Trump has made it clear he intends to build a “Dream Military” for 2027 and is pushing for a budget increase to $1.5 trillion. When you combine that with the $4.1 trillion of debt maturing in 2026 and the standard annual deficit, the US Treasury faces a $9 trillion liquidity gap, and a further $7.4 trillion before 2028. Does the US have to print all $9 trillion? No. And through this lens, the recent geopolitical moves make sense. Trump didn’t only capture Maduro for a photo-op; he has likely taken control over 303B barrels of reserves and is enforcing USD oil sales, creating artificial dollar demand and easing the liquidity gap by $2-3T annually. Can he cover the gap via a mix of tariffs (that Americans actually pay for!), Petro-Dollar demand, and the inevitable monetization of the rest by the Federal Reserve? I guess he’ll have to. With Jerome Powell expected to leave his chair in May, the path will be cleared to give the printer engines a whir. There’s another $5 – $10 tr due globally in 2026, and the same again in 2027. So the fed chair won’t be without company. The four-year cycle OGs may be stepping aside, but the Liquidity Cycle is just gearing up, and Bitcoin, as Raoul Pal has long argued, remains the ultimate liquidity barometer. Samuel Benner’s famous 19th-century forecasting chart (first published in 1875), maps long-term cycles of panics (“A” years), booms/high prices (“B” years), and depressions/low prices (“C” years). Interestingly, 2026 falls squarely in one of Benner’s “B” years, which is a period of “Good Times, High Prices and the time to sell Stocks and values of all kinds.” The chart places 2026 right alongside previous boom years like 2016, 2007, 1999, and 1989, suggesting we are entering a structurally favorable window for risk assets. How Long Will The Next Money Printing Last? Prediction: 18–24 months Why: History shows that once the dam gates open, it takes roughly two years to stabilize and reflate. If the official aggressive printing phase begins in late 2025 (as the liquidity uptick and Benner timeline imply, and as M2 shows), it will likely run strong through mid-2027. Prediction: ~$9–$10 trillion in the U.S. Treasury debt is maturing in 2026 alone (about one-third of outstanding marketable debt) and a further $5 – $10 tr globally. Why: As discussed above, the maturity walls for 2026 are nearly double what we faced during the COVID crisis. Yellen extended the pain by leaning on short-term issuance back then, but come hell or high water, that debt has to be paid or refinanced—the money will arrive from somewhere. Because of this, we can expect a new wave of inflation, the 70’s and 80’s have a story to tell about that! Prediction: $250,000 Why: During that $5 trillion COVID expansion, BTC rallied roughly 20x from the $3k–$4k lows to $69k. With the potential for double that liquidity entering the system this cycle, the upside is significant even if diminishing returns apply. From our $16k effective low, a conservative 10x to 12x multiple lands us in the $160k to $200k range as a base case. However, models suggest we could push higher. PlanC’s quantile model points toward $300k+ by the end of 2026, and Giovanni Santostasi’s Power Law projects a peak potentially around $210k early on, with room to stretch as high as $600k in outlier scenarios. But hey, I was expecting +$200k last cycle too. Oh, if the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act moves out of the committee, and if the U.S. Treasury officially starts side-stacking alongside MicroStrategy, all bets are off the table. Prediction: Late 2026 to mid-2027 The Logic: Bitcoin historically tops out 12–18 months after the liquidity expansion enters its “mania” phase. If the ISM Manufacturing PMI crosses back above 50 in early 2026, the perfect storm should unfold throughout 2026, setting up a blow-off top, potentially in the first half of 2027. Bitcoin is unlikely to go straight up, nothing ever does. We’ll almost certainly encounter a few snakes along the way: sharp corrections, regulatory noise, profit-taking, or some form of shenanigans. But the ladders are built, ready and waiting. The Year of the Snake is coming to an end, just ahead of the February 27 CME futures expiry, our potential ignition point, right before the anticipated PMI uptick in Q2. 2025 was a year of snakes and sideways pain, with long-term holders finally capitulated and weak hands flushed out. Now, with a wall of liquidity heading our way, 2026 looks like the ladder we’ve been waiting for. The horse year is coming, so stack and secure accordingly. Good luck.
