Cellectis SA (CLLS, Financial), a pioneer in gene-editing technology, is generating excitement on Wall Street, as analysts believe there is about 400% upside potential over its current prices. The current price is only $1.41 per share, and this under-the-radar cancer therapy has caught the eye of eight analysts who average a price target of $7.00 with a range of estimates from $3.00 to a really bullish $11.00. The company is working on the TALEN- TALEN-based gene Editing and is developing its pipeline Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with CLLS. Key indications in the allogeneic CAR-T portfolio are UCART22, which UCART20x22 will support for the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, respectively. They have designed these therapies to be off-the-shelf solutions, seriously advancing the field of reducing the cost and complexity involved with cell therapy. To continue investing in their pipeline, Cellectis has engaged with AstraZeneca to deliver cell and innovative gene therapies. This agreement signified a strong technology prowess for the company to make discovery-aided breakthroughs in genetic research and treatment solutions. Analysts are optimistic due to the strategic positioning of Cellectis in the flourishing category of personalized medicine, which is rapidly gaining greater relevance in the global health landscape. Yet, like most penny stocks, such investment comes with certain risks using regulatory hurdles and clinical outcomes on successful trials. For risk-savvy investors, Cellectis is a high-stakes gamble in the gene-editing arena. As this develops and merges further in partnerships, the company might become very well positioned to revolutionize treatment for cancers and make its current valuation look like a bargain in the years ahead.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Car Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) stands against the other car stocks. The automotive industry has witnessed a constant churn of innovation over the last several decades, with car makers continuously providing drivers with new features. However, there has been a different pace of change lately, with the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) being the most talked-of topic in the industry. READ ALSO: 10 Best Used Car Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now. A lot of the conversations in the automotive space currently revolve around robotaxis, the autonomous taxis for ride-hailing, especially after Elon Musk unveiled the Cybercab in October this year. His company is showcasing the self-driving two-seater at several key locations across the United States in December, with plans to deploy the autonomous services in California and Texas in 2025. According to a report in Euro News, global EV sales surged in November, with a record-breaking 1.8 million units sold worldwide, overtaking the record set in the prior month by 100,000 units. China accounted for two-thirds of the sales during the month. Around 15.2 million EVs were sold between January and November, growing 25% year-to-date. The report stated a 3% decline in EV sales in the region comprising the United Kingdom (UK), the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union (EU). With 280,000 units sold in November, annual sales for the region reached 2.7 million units. However, the UK is having an improvement in the second half of the year; sales have grown 17% from last year, driven by the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate. China is not only leading the EV market but is also on track to take over the global auto industry because of its massive and growing capacity. Earlier this month, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) highlighted that the country’s EV capacity will soon match its domestic auto demand, whereas China’s car production capacity is already half of the global demand for automobiles. It is projected to have a total output of 20 million electric vehicles in 2024, with production increasing between 4-5 million units annually, helped by heavy investments from Chinese firms to expand production. According to the New York Times, China also has the capacity to produce over 40 million internal combustion engine cars a year. India’s auto market is also seeing impressive growth, contributing significantly to the global market. Annual production of automobiles in the country stood at 25.9 million units in fiscal 2023. The thriving vehicle market has also resulted in a booming auto components industry, which has grown 11.3% during the first half of FY25, driven by strong demand for larger and more powerful cars. We sifted through screeners to identify stocks in the auto manufacturers, auto parts, and auto dealerships industries. From there, we selected the 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, based on Insider Monkey’s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024. The 10 best car stocks to invest in now have been ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. Where two or more stocks were tied on hedge fund sentiment, we used a higher market cap as a tiebreaker between them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A closeup of a hand holding a car engine component, highlighting the precision of the company's engineering. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52 Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is a technology and mobility architecture company that manufactures vehicle components and provides electrical, electronic, and safety technology solutions to the automobile market. The company’s share price has lost over 34% of its value this year, primarily due to the downward trajectory in the broader automotive industry, including factors like a dip in electrification momentum, growing labor and raw materials costs, and geopolitical tensions. Despite challenges, APTV has managed to maintain robust margins, which is a testament to its operational efficiencies. On October 31, Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) announced financial results for the third quarter of 2024. Revenue stood at $4.9 billion, down 6% from last year, driven by lower volume production at select customers in Europe and China. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $778 million while operating income was posted at $593 million. Improved operational performance across business segments, combined with efficient management of expenses in the current fiscal year and effective cost reduction measures taken at the end of 2023 have helped the company increase its operating margin by 120 basis points year-over-year. Moreover, its Q3 2024 EPS of $1.83 per share was the highest ever, growing 41% year-over-year. APTV is confident about ending the year on a high by delivering strong earnings growth and margin expansion. The trend is projected to continue in 2025, with the company stating that it expects to pay dividends in the year and beyond. Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock, with a consensus Buy rating and an average share price upside potential of 43%. Hedge fund sentiment around the stock has considerably improved as well. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024, 52 hedge funds had investments in Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV), up from 38 at the end of the second quarter. It is one of the best car stocks to invest in now. Overall APTV ranks 4th on our list of the best car stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of APTV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than APTV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A classic Ferrari sports car against a lush green hillside, symbolizing the company's luxurious performance. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36 Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) is an Italian designer, manufacturer, and retailer of luxury sports cars. It also produces limited series and one-off cars. The company is active in around 60 countries and territories through its network of authorized dealers. Following his election victory, President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase costs for automakers, due to their reliance on auto parts from these countries. While Europe has largely been absent from Trump’s protectionist policies, there are concerns the region might be next to face similar scrutiny. However, Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) remains unfazed by the chatter. When asked at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York on December 10 whether the company would consider manufacturing cars in the United States, CEO Benedetto Vigna stated that Ferrari will always make its cars in Maranello, northern Italy, and that will not change even if tariffs are introduced. Morningstar analyst Rella Suskin believes that, unlike its competitors in the industry, Ferrari’s high-end clientele and exclusive market allow the company to absorb high tariffs by adjusting prices without considerably impacting demand. Its order book is already strong, and the sports car maker is planning to launch its first fully electric vehicle by Q4 2025. Ferrari’s financial performance remained robust. During its recent Q3 2024 earnings call on November 5, the company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in revenues to EUR 1.6 billion ($1.68 billion), with a net profit of EUR 375 million ($394 million). The company is seeing order book visibility well into 2026, driven by impressive order intake for the 12Cilindri coupe Spider, and the unveiling of the F80 Supercar. Wall Street analysts have a consensus Buy rating for Ferrari with an average share price upside potential of 16%. Hedge fund sentiment around the stock has also improved. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024, 36 hedge funds held a stake in Ferrari, up from 30 at the end of Q2. It is one of the best car stocks to invest in now.

Title: bl.portfolio in 2024: Preferred prudence over popularity, rationalism over exuberance

It is no different for us at bl.portfolio. Here, we take this annual ritual very seriously as we are in the business of giving ideas for your hard-earned money. In the world of investing, no one can predict the markets with certainty but what we can do is prefer prudence over popularity and rationalism over exuberance. That has always been our credo and in the same spirit, we curated our product every week this year. Here is an honest report card of all we did 2024: Caution has been the watchword in our approach to and writings on the equity markets in 2024. On the back of the nearly 20 per cent rally in the markets in 2023, our equity outlook for 2024, published on January 7 , set the tone saying that while there was no case for pessimism, there was ample case for caution this year. Our stance emanated from the market valuation at the beginning of the year (23.8 times trailing) being above long-term averages as well as heightened optimism on earnings growth. In this firm belief, even as the markets raced to their all-time highs well into the year until end-September, we gave more hold/sell/book profit calls on stocks (44) as against buy/accumulate (31). Looking back, we stand vindicated, with the markets now 10 per cent below the September peak and India Inc faced with a consumption slowdown, a slow pick-up in private capex as well as a cooling off in earnings growth. In our assessment period for our stock calls (July 2023 to June 2024), we gave 117 calls across the primary (42) and secondary markets (75). About one-third of the sell /book profits/avoid calls have worked for us, prominent among them being the calls on telecom and IT players such as Vodafone Idea, Indus Towers, Tata Communications and Birlasoft. With Nifty IT up 23 per cent this year on the back of last year’s 22 per cent, book profit calls on stocks such as HCL Tech haven’t worked well. But we continue to remain watchful on IT stocks, as we believe the rally has been driven by valuation multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. Our book profits call on PSUs such as Power Grid and NHPC worked well too, but calls to take money out on IRFC, RVNL and Mazagon Dock, though backed by sound fundamental arguments, were given a bit early, in hindsight. These stocks have eventually seen corrections since the September market peak. Reiterating our cautious views on overvalued PSUs especially in the defence space, we highlighted the significant risks in holding on to these stocks, despite their growth potential. In our edition dated July 7 , we had noted why the stocks trading at obscene valuations would be unable to ‘avert a painful retreat when market cycle attacks with a vengeance.’ It was near-perfect timing given the significant fall in defence stocks since then. Our article on the underlying factors driving the PSU rally published on May 11, 2024, is one of the top-read articles this year from the bl.portfolio section on our website. That said, half of our well-researched ‘buys’ this year (six in 11 calls) have outperformed the bellwether and the broader markets. These include value-picks NCC, KNR Constructions and UTI AMC, international pick Alphabet as well as Godrej Agrovet and Motilal Oswal Financial Services. In-house expertise on international investing is our USP, but we do admit we have been very choosy this year due to our conservative stance. Apart from the call on Alphabet mentioned above, we recommended a partial book profit on Meta Platforms in February 2024. Investors would have made 5x returns from our earlier buy recommendation in our November 2022 edition in a 14-month timeframe on this stock. This year, we also consciously covered special situations such as buyback, open offers, buyouts etc. to give more actionable ideas to investors on their existing shareholdings. The call to tender the shares at ₹10,000 in the Bajaj Auto buyback citing the massive rally and the valuation expansion has worked well, with the shares now trading 11 per cent below. Ditto with the ‘subscribe’ recommendation to the Grasim Rights issue, which has paid off. On the other hand, we found that we did not see much success with ‘accumulate’ and ‘hold’ calls. Only six of our 20 ‘accumulate’ calls (Nippon AMC, Caplin Point Labs being examples) provided opportunities to accumulate on dips. We also found that the 15 ‘hold’ calls (expected to perform inline with the markets) didn’t work for us. But it is better to err on the side of caution. On the fixed income side, at the beginning of the year , we were very clear that while rate cuts may or may not happen in India in 2024, interest rates have peaked and that investors should make the best of the rates available. We found both the short-end and the long-end of the yield curve attractive and recommended bonds/mutual funds at these ends. Fast forward to end-2024 and 10-year G-Sec yields have dropped to 6.79 per cent from 7.21 per cent a year ago and a similar pattern can be seen across maturities. Investors have thus benefitted from a rally in bond prices this year. Keeping in tune with our cautious stance on equities as well as the expectation of a peaking out of interest rates, we carefully showcased options in categories such as balanced advantage, equity savings, multi-asset, ultra short-term as well as gilt/long-duration funds in our weekly ‘Fund Call’ space in the mutual fund section. For the risk-averse investors, we also recommended safer FD options across tenures from banks and NBFCs whenever attractive options came up. If you bet on gold as a diversifier this year, you would not be disappointed. Post gold’s decent 13 per cent upside in 2023 to end at $2,063 an ounce, we had predicted it to touch $2,200 this year (technical analysis) in our annual outlook published on January 14. We further followed it up with a more bullish case for gold in our article ‘Goldilocks moment for gold’, published on March 17 , as it neared $2,200 in early March. At that point, expectations of US Fed rate cut amidst some uncertainty on whether inflation battle was actually won or not, geopolitical turmoil in West Asia, Russia-Ukraine war and high government debt and fiscal deficit levels in developed countries, made the case for gold too good to ignore. Gold went on to hit a high of $2,790 in October this year. Although it has cooled off marginally from those levels, investors who had taken a cue from our writing would have been solidly rewarded. Rupee depreciation, too, has added to gains for investors in gold in India, offsetting some of the impact of customs duty cut in the July Budget. While we have been receiving your feedback regularly through mail or social media, 2024 has been a landmark year for brand bl.portfolio in terms of making an on-ground connection with readers/investors. Towards this, the first of the ‘bl.portfolio Investor Conclave’ was held in Coimbatore in June with a presentation followed by a panel discussion with various experts on the topic of retirement planning. This event was extremely well-received and enabled us to understand the mindset of our audience. There is a plan to do more such events especially in tier-2 cities in the coming year. With bl.portfolio being entirely behind paywall on our website, online subscribers are a lifeline. To reach out to them, we initiated subscriber-exclusive webinars this year. We have so far done one on US investing and another on the market outlook for 2025 is being planned soon. Our in-house technical analysis has a great following and to add value to these readers, we commenced our YouTube Shorts video series for the ‘Today’s Pick’ column (BL Today’s Pick: Stocks to Buy or Sell) this year. Our Nifty Prediction Weekly Video series, which has a big fan base, crossed a milestone of 100 episodes in March this year with 139 having been completed so far. This year, we also experimented with guest stories written by readers based on their personal investing experience. SEBI’s report on F&O trading put out in late September gave us this opportunity. Reader response to our call was overwhelming and at the same time, heart wrenching as well. We carried a few stories with their permission to help the larger investor community take away important lessons. As the New Year dawns, bl.portfolio will see new leadership at the helm. I step down after what has perhaps been the best four-and-a-half years both for the product as well as for me, professionally. The structural changes and demands that the pandemic brought about has seen team bl.portfolio grow from strength to strength in this period and am glad that I have been able to do my bit. The show will go on and if you are looking for best parking places for your money, fresh and unbiased perspectives await you in 2025 too, at bl.portfolio.
