With MSCI freeze blocking automatic buys, Strategy must pivot to active investors for new funding, challenging its Bitcoin acquisition model. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The threat of a massive forced sell-off in crypto-linked equities has been averted. However, that reprieve comes with a structural catch that fundamentally alters the economics of the “Bitcoin Treasury” trade. On Jan. 6, the dominant benchmark provider for global equity and ETF markets, MSCI Inc., announced it will retain “Digital Asset Treasury Companies” (DATCOs) in its global indices for the February 2026 review, sparing firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) from expulsion. It stated: “For the time being, the current index treatment of DATCOs identified in the preliminary list published by MSCI of companies whose digital asset holdings represent 50% or more of their total assets will remain unchanged.” Following the news, Michael Saylor, Strategy's executive chairman, touted the victory of remaining in the benchmark. However, the index provider has simultaneously introduced a technical freeze on share counts for these entities. It explained: “MSCI will not implement increases to the Number of Shares (NOS), Foreign Inclusion Factor (FIF) or Domestic Inclusion Factor (DIF) for these securities. MSCI will defer any additions or size-segment migrations for all securities included in the preliminary list.” Through this decision, MSCI has effectively severed the link between new equity issuance and automatic passive buying. This move simply meant the “downside” of a forced liquidation has been removed, but the “upside” mechanics of the index trade have been dismantled The immediate market reaction, a surge of over 6% in Strategy’s stock, reflected relief that a catastrophic liquidity event was off the table. Notably, JPMorgan suggested that a full exclusion could have triggered between $3 billion and $9 billion in passive selling of MSTR. MSCI consultation paper and JPMorgan's positioning resulting in some major fallout across social media to defend DATs like Strategy. This volume would likely have crushed the stock price and forced the liquidation of Bitcoin holdings. However, the removed threat of exclusion masks a new reality where the automatic demand lever for the stocks is gone. Historically, when Strategy issued new shares to fund Bitcoin acquisitions, the index provider would eventually update the share count. As a result, passive funds tracking the index were then mathematically compelled to buy a pro rata portion of the new issuance to minimize tracking error. This created a guaranteed, price-insensitive source of demand that helped absorb dilution. Under the new “freeze” policy, this loop is broken. Even if Strategy significantly expands its float to raise capital, MSCI will effectively ignore those new shares for index calculation purposes. The company’s weight in the index will not increase, and consequently, ETFs and index funds will not be forced to buy the new paper. Market analysts note that this shift forces a return to fundamentals. Without the backstop of benchmark-tracking demand, Strategy and its peers must now rely on active managers, hedge funds, and retail investors to absorb new supply. To understand the magnitude of this shift, market researchers are modeling the “lost bid” that issuers must now navigate. Bull Theory, a crypto research firm, quantified this liquidity gap in a note to clients. The firm posited a hypothetical scenario involving a treasury company with 200 million outstanding shares, of which roughly 10% are typically held by passive index trackers. In the Bull Theory model, if that company issues 20 million new shares to raise capital, the old index mechanics would eventually mandate that passive funds purchase 2 million of those shares. At a theoretical price point of $300 per share, that represents $600 million of automatic, price-insensitive buying pressure. Under MSCI’s new freeze, Bull Theory noted that the $600 million bid falls to zero. Considering this, it stated: “Strategy now must find private buyers, offer discounts, or raise less money.” This means that the forced demand from index funds has been eliminated. Thus, it presents a significant hurdle for Strategy, which issued more than $15 billion in new shares throughout 2025 to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin. The arbitrage trade allowing firms to print equity for crypto is dead, leaving their $60 billion hoard structurally exposed. If the company attempts to replicate that scale of issuance in 2026, it will do so in a market void of passive support. Without that structural bid, the risk of a price correction during dilution events increases significantly. MSCI's decision to cap these companies rather than expel them or leave them alone has also significantly altered the competitive dynamics in the asset management sector. Over the past year, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have matured as an asset class and have seen significant institutional interest. In fact, this rise led MSCI's former parent company, Morgan Stanley, to file for its own Spot Bitcoin ETF. From this vantage point, Strategy competes with these fee-bearing Bitcoin ETFs, offering investors a way to gain passive Bitcoin exposure through an operating company structure. By freezing the index weighting of DATCOs, the new rule degrades their ability to efficiently scale via equity markets. If Strategy’s ability to raise cheap capital is curtailed, large allocators may rotate capital out of the corporate equity and into Spot ETFs, which do not carry the operational risks of a company or the premium-to-NAV volatility. This flow of funds would directly benefit issuers of spot ETFs, including major Wall Street banks, effectively capturing the fees previously reflected in equity premiums. Inflows hit $697 million in days, yet the charts remain frozen because structured demand is neutralizing the rally. By neutering the “flywheel” effect of the treasury strategy, the index provider may have inadvertently, or intentionally, leveled the playing field in favor of traditional asset management products.

Title: Billionaires Start 2026 With Huge Insider Buys

Investing Under Armour Inc. (NYSE: UAA), W.R. Berkley Corp. (NYSE: WRB), and Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust (NYSE: GRX) have just seen some huge insider purchases. However, there were some other notable insider purchases as well. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Brandon Bell / Getty Images News via Getty Images The so-called Warren Buffett of Canada and a prominent American billionaire investor and financial analyst started the year with huge insider purchases. Some of the most prominent buying that has been reported so far this year were from return trips to build stakes in Under Armour Inc. (NYSE: UAA), W.R. Berkley Corp. (NYSE: WRB), and Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust (NYSE: GRX). Though these were the most prominent insider purchases, there were a handful of other notable ones as well. Let’s take a quick look at these transactions. What does insider buying tell us? A well-known adage reminds us that corporate insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company because they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. Thus, insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors. This is especially so during times of market uncertainty, and even when markets are near all-time highs. The fourth-quarter earnings-reporting season is yet to begin, so few insiders are prohibited from buying or selling shares. Below are some of the most notable insider purchases that were reported recently, starting with the largest and most prominent. This buyer, led by billionaire V. Prem Watsa, sometimes called the Warren Buffett of Canada, also scooped up $70 million worth of shares prior to this purchase. The stake is now up to more than 41.9 million shares, and the investment helped boost the stock still suffering after the brand parted ways with spokesperson Steph Curry. Shares were last seen trading for more than the purchase price range above. The stock is still more than 23% lower than six months ago. Given the Wall Street consensus target of $6.07, the analysts anticipate 8.2% upside in the next 12 months. However, only five of 26 analysts recommend buying shares. Guggenheim initiated coverage recently with a Buy rating with a $6 price target. Watsa, founder and CEO of Fairfax, maintains a controlling interest in the company but reportedly is stepping back from some roles to plan for succession. Last spring, this buyer reached an agreement to acquire 15% of W.R. Berkley’s shares. Mitsui Sumitomo expects to complete its investment in this Connecticut-based insurance holding company during the first quarter of 2026. Its stake is up to more than 50.7 million shares, or over 13%. The share price was last seen within the buyer’s latest purchase price range. Yet, the stock is 2.6% lower than six months ago because of recent volatility due to profit-taking. But note that shares are up 20.2% year over year, outperforming the S&P 500 in that time. Analysts are cautious, with only four out of 18 of them recommending buying shares. The mean price target of $73.06 is 3.2% higher than the current price but less than the recent all-time high of $78.96. Mitsui Sumitomo is a massive Japanese financial conglomerate. Note that it also recently acquired an 18% stake in MassMutual’s Barings. This purchase followed on a 100,000-share buy reported at the end of last month. Gabelli also acquired shares of Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (NYSE: GDV) and Gabelli Equity Trust Inc. (NYSE: GAB) in December. Note that another beneficial owner also picked up some shares of Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust earlier in the month. Shares were last seen trading for less than the $10 purchase price. They have underperformed the S&P 500 in the past year but are 4.2% higher than 90 days ago. In addition, Gabelli also boosted his stake in Florida-based electronic equipment and components maker LGL Group Inc. (NYSE: LGL) in late December. These were not the only notable insider purchases of the past week. Here is a quick look at some others. Some smaller insider buying was reported at CME, Gitlab, Joby Aviation, SAIC, and Simon Property as well.

Title: Tech companies may only get half the profit they need to justify AI investment, Goldman analyst warns

The S&P 500 hit a new record high yesterday, up 0.62% at 6,944.82. Futures are marginally down this morning, as might be expected from traders who want to sell up and lock in some of those gains. The STOXX Europe 600 also hit a new high yesterday and was flat in early trading this morning.Much of the bullishness is coming as analysts realize that the massive amounts of capital expenditure (capex) on building out AI data centers isn’t likely to stop anytime soon.The result of all that new spending will be that “we expect another year of solid gains for U.S. equities in 2026. We forecast an S&P 500 total return of 12% to a year-end level of 7,600,” Goldman Sachs analyst Ben Snider and his colleagues told clients in a note sent this morning.However, the wrinkle for 2026 will be that AI capex growth will start to slow down, he said. In turn, the amount of profit needed to justify all that capex won’t show up, Snider et al argue, and that will cause traders to pick and choose winners and losers among the big tech firms of the S&P 500. “The 10 largest stocks in the S&P 500 account for 41% of market cap and drove 53% of the S&P 500 2025 return. We expect AI spending will exceed consensus estimates this year but begin to decelerate in growth terms while corporate adoption increases, causing rotations among the largest U.S. tech stocks that create two-way risk for the aggregate index,” he told clients. Capex spending by the big “hyperscalers” (Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, etc.) was roughly $400 billion in 2025, up 70% annually, Goldman calculates. The big tech companies have also started to fund much of that growth with debt. “As spending and debt grow, so do the necessary eventual profits to justify ongoing investments,” Snider says. So far, tech companies have been happy to spend that money because the profits they generated were two or three times as much as they invested, Goldman estimates. The problem is that that might be unsustainable, Snider says. “Given consensus estimates for an annual average of $500 billion in capex from 2025-2027, maintaining the returns on capital to which their investors have become accustomed would require these companies to realize an annual profit run-rate of over $1 trillion, more than double the 2026 consensus estimate of $450 billion in income,” he wrote. While some of these companies will successfully generate the profits they need, others won’t, he says. “The magnitudes of current spending and market caps alongside increasing competition within the group suggest a diminishing probability that all of today’s market leaders generate enough long-term profits to sufficiently reward today’s investors.” Analysts at Vanguard and Piper Sandler are also focused on the AI-capex-profit story. Piper chief global economist Nancy R. Lazar and her colleagues anticipate that tech companies have not yet reached the ceiling of their capex budgets, especially as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA) grants new tax breaks on companies’ capital spending. “Tech capex has been a huge story for a while now, but against history, it’s still not ‘too high’ vs. GDP. And there’s plenty of upside ahead, given OBBA’s full capex expensing, Fed easing, and banks easing lending standards,” they told clients. Vanguard’s Qian Wang, global head of capital market research, also warned that if profits don’t follow capex then investors should expect a downturn. “We are bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy. But transformative technology needs profitable business models to win. And, in the financial markets, returns hinge on expectations. Tech companies’ earnings have been strong so far, but their valuations may have gotten ahead of themselves. When expectations get too far out of whack, it is not surprising to see markets pull back,” she said in an email sent to Fortune. Here’s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:

Investing Shake Shack targets 1,500 stores long-term and trades 41% below its all-time high. Celsius Holdings acquired Alani Nu to expand its health and wellness portfolio. Celsius trades at 32x forward P/E after rising 65% last year. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 2022 Getty Images / Getty Images News via Getty Images Many investors and analysts are bullish on the stock market and the state of the AI trade going into the new year. And while it’s sure to be another pivotal year for the technology, investors should also consider the low-tech names that might be better able to withstand tech-driven market corrections. Undoubtedly, the broad market went into 2026 with a fairly high multiple and while this alone doesn’t mean we’ll spend a big chunk of the year in a bear market, I do think that some of the neglected non-AI and non-tech plays might be in a position to do well in their own right, especially if an AI bubble (if it even exists) finally does go bust, dragging down the broad stock market along with it. It’s all right to be bullish and overweight in the top AI names, provided you’re comfortable with increased volatility. But if you’re at all fearful of an AI bubble or rolling sector-based corrections, I’d argue that a bit of diversification can never hurt. In this piece, we’ll look at two low-tech stocks that have impressive growth rates and the means to sidestep a potential AI growth scare should one happen in 2026. Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) stands out as a compelling buy on the dip after shedding more than 41% from its all-time highs. Undoubtedly, it’s been a sharp implosion, but one that might be overdone, especially if the $3.5 billion premium fast-food firm can successfully shift gears from recovery to acceleration. As a relatively small chain with a ton of expansion potential in the quick-serve restaurant scene, Shake Shack might be the restaurant growth play to stick with, especially if you’re looking for an impressive low-tech growth profile. With its ambitious 1,500-store long-term expansion plan, efforts to drive same-store sales growth (think loyalty and new burgers like the Big Shack), and the potential to drive operating efficiencies via the incorporation of new tech, I see an earnings growth pathway that could help shares of Shake Shack recover quite swiftly from here. Though Raymond James may have dropped Shake Shack stock from its “Favorites List” last month, I still think recent trends shouldn’t take away from the long-term growth story at hand. If you’re a fan of the chain, it might be finally time to nibble while shares are under $85 per share. Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a relatively small $12.4 billion beverage company that’s fresh off a decent recovery year. Last year, the stock rose more than 65%, and while such an upside move hasn’t allowed shares to touch prior all-time highs (believe it or not, shares are still down 50% from their peak), I do think recent momentum and progress going on behind the scenes is worth getting behind. The company can keep gaining market share while making further margin improvements, allowing the stock to comfortably grow into its seemingly frothy multiple. With the acquisition of healthy supplement market Alani Nu last year, I view Celsius’ health and wellness moat as increasing in size. Undoubtedly, the deal not only makes Celsius a bigger force in “healthy” energy beverages, but it also could give the firm a front-row seat to the protein supplements market. Like Celsius, Alani Nu is a fast-moving up-and-comer that’s capable of massive market disruption. At 32.0 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), I view Celsius as a very reasonably-priced mid-cap growth stock that can do well, even if the AI trade were to run out of its steam in this new year. With such an impressive growth rate and a broader portfolio of products that have resonated with health-conscious consumers, I think 2026 could be the year Celisus’ stock really heats up.

Investing Home Depot (HD) could benefit whether buyers remain locked in homes (driving renovations) or rates drop (spurring purchases). Lennar and other homebuilders now offer mortgage buydowns and free upgrades as elevated rates compress margins and deter buyers. Home Depot and Lowe’s (LOW) face potential upside if the lock-in effect drives homeowners to invest in upgrades instead of moving. Sending You to Google News in 3 © saweang.w / Shutterstock.com As we kick off a new year, the thought process many investors may have is which sectors or areas of the economy will be the places to invest. After all, various macro dynamics have changed a great deal in recent months, and this year is shaping up to be much different than 2025 in a number of ways. Aside from the ongoing geopolitical turmoil we’ve seen, as well as concerns around inflation driven by quickly-changing tariff and trade policies, the direction of monetary policy coming out of the Federal Reserve could be the hot topic many will be watching very closely. Given president Trump’s views on interest rates (namely, that they’re way too high right now), a pressure campaign is still being waged on the Fed to drop rates, and do so quickly. I’m not so sure the president will have as much say on interest rates as overall economic developments will. But one thing I will be watching that will likely determine monetary policy decisions will be the labor market, which has been weakening at a rapid pace. For those who think interest rates are likely to come down because of (or in spite of) president Trump’s rhetoric, here’s why the construction sector is one to watch this year. Interest rate visual With three consecutive 25 basis point (0.25%) interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve to end fiscal 2025, plenty of investors may be looking at interest rate-sensitive areas of the economy to put some capital to work in, come the New Year. It think construction-related companies could be among the biggest beneficiaries of this trend. Indeed, home sales continue to slow, as prices remain high (but look to be coming down in some key metropolitan markets across the country). In order for these trends to reverse, and for buyers to come off the sidelines, many experts have suggested that interest rates would need to come down to a 5-handle to encourage greater activity. For new home builders, interest rates have become the key headwind for profitability and earnings growth in recent quarters. Builders are now having to resort to providing builder financing, or buying down mortgage rates, to entice new homebuyers to take on their inventory. What that’s led to is an interesting dynamic where, in certain markets, new homes are now selling for effectively less than existing homes – something that generally shouldn’t be possible, considering the depreciating value of hard assets such as real estate. That said, if Trump’s new pick for Fed chair does indeed follow his lead and lower interest rates aggressively at the front end of the curve (whether spurred by further economic weakness or not), it will be interesting to see if long bonds (mortgage rates generally follow the 10-Year Treasury yield, not short-term overnight rates set by the Fed) will follow. For those who think they will, this is a trade potentially worth putting on. Real estate agent passing keys to a new homebuyer New supply of homes are coming on the market, with many homeowners who are looking to lock in the gains they saw following a pandemic-driven frenzy seemingly wanting to do so before prices drop. In some areas of the real estate market (such as condos in key metropolitan areas in Florida and other states), prices are falling. So, the time to offload some inventory (either for individual homeowners or builders) appears to be closing. That said, despite this new supply, the reality that prices remain elevated compared to historical income standards, in mortgage rates are still near the highest levels they’ve been in a decade, has led to an affordability crisis where few homeowners are willing to buy. This has depressed margins for new homebuilders such as Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and others, who are being forced to offer significant incentives such as mortgage rate buy downs and free upgrades to get buyers to pull the trigger. That said, I think despite slightly softening prices across the board, we could be due for a reasonably solid year for homebuilders and other companies tied to the construction trade. Retailers like Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOWE) could see a resurgence of business, if those who feel locked into their homes are willing to put the necessary upgrades in to maintain their place of residence. The lock-in effect is real, but if we’re all going to be locked into our place for years to come, I think the recent declines these stocks have seen may provide a buying opportunity for those thinking long-term. Judge banging his gavel on a desk The reality is that the housing market is a very difficult and complex animal to analyze. Broad supply and demand metrics are a good starting point. But this market is made up of millions of individuals, each making the best decisions for them and their families. With that in mind, I think investors may be looking too closely at the macro data, and not enough at home homeowners are actually making their purchase decisions. If home buying activity slows down, home renovation stocks like Home Depot and Lowe’s could be screaming buys. But if interest rates come down, that’s a broad-based catalyst for all stocks in this space, providing the rising tide that should lift all boats. Overall, I’m looking most closely at Home Depot in particular of the three stocks I mentioned in this article as a potential winner in 2026. That’s because no matter what happens, I think this is a retailer with upside potential that’s not being priced in presently. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

This is Masters in business with Barry Riol on Bloomberg Radio. 00:00:16 [Speaker Changed] This week on the podcast, I have an extra special guest. Stephanie Drescher is Chief Client and Product Development Officer at Private Investment Giant Apollo. She’s been there for over 20 years. She spent a decade before that doing alternatives at JP Morgan. What a fascinating person. Apollo runs $840 billion in client assets, and she has really not over overseen the wealth division, but also worked on a variety of geographies, new products. She’s on everybody’s best of lists. She’s been on the Barron’s Women in Finance list, sits inception every year. I thought this conversation was fascinating. If you’re remotely interested in private equity, private debt, private credit, private infrastructure, you’ll find this conversation absolutely fascinating. With no further ado, Apollos, Stephanie Drescher. Stephanie Drescher, welcome to Bloomberg. 00:01:17 [Speaker Changed] Thank you, Barry. Happy to be here. 00:01:20 [Speaker Changed] Happy to have you. So we’re gonna get into Apollo and your investment philosophy in a bit, but before we do, I, I just have to start with your background. Bachelor’s in Barnard at at Columbia MBA from Columbia Business School. What was the original career plan? 00:01:37 [Speaker Changed] I, I did always have finance in my sites. So undergrad, it was econ and psych. I, I joke that I use the psych in my day-to-day field, way more than the econ right, these days. But there, there was always a draw towards doing something in, in the financial kind of arena, interest in markets and the like. So, very early internships led me down that path. 00:02:04 [Speaker Changed] And I read somewhere in your background that you were particularly inspired to go into finance by your grandmother. Tell us about that. 00:02:13 [Speaker Changed] That is true. So my father’s mother lived with us for a time, and believe it or not, she was born in the very, very late 18 hundreds. And while her brother went on to become a doctor, she capped out at an eighth grade education. And so the power of education was always a core value and a focus of, of hers and my family. And she used to read the Wall Street Journal cover to cover every day. Super smart, loved tracking stocks. And so we started to track stocks together. And how 00:02:54 [Speaker Changed] Old were you at this time? 00:02:55 [Speaker Changed] Oh, I don’t know, maybe 12. Okay. And in a very high tech way, we would put it up on the refrigerator and kind of see the, the changes in, in the holdings that she had in her portfolio and sometimes overlapped with that of my parents. Huh. Really? So that was the early start. 00:03:13 [Speaker Changed] So you get an MBA from Columbia, JP Morgan was the first job right? Outta school? 00:03:19 [Speaker Changed] It was, although there, there was a mentor right prior to the JP Morgan opportunity that, believe it or not, I started babysitting for this family. And I didn’t know what the mother did day to day until after a period of time of of babysitting, she looked at me and she said, I think your babysitting days are over. And I said, I don’t know what you’re talking about. And she said, I run a women led healthcare consulting firm. Huh? Would you like an internship? And I practically fell off my chair and I said, I would love an internship. 00:03:58 [Speaker Changed] How old are you at this time? Like 16. 00:04:00 [Speaker Changed] This, it was like late high school, maybe early college. Early, early. And it was the most amazing kind of opportunity that someone could give me, right? Just seeing a professional organization do its thing and all the analysis and client relationship management that went into that. So while I, I decided that healthcare wasn’t my thing and consulting wasn’t my thing. It was very an easy bridge to, to JP Morgan and, and the finance field. 00:04:30 [Speaker Changed] So when you started JP Morgan, what was the role? How did you, what, what areas were you toiling in? 00:04:36 [Speaker Changed] So I started with a rotational opportunity, which was terrific. I had everything from fixed income research to private banking in Geneva. Did you 00:04:47 [Speaker Changed] Go to Switzerland? 00:04:48 [Speaker Changed] I did, yeah. For about six months. I realized that I needed to buy all of my groceries during the day because it was closed by the time I got out of work. And then I liked to travel on weekends. So importantly though, and seriously, it was a terrific time in my life to be more aware of time zones and cultural nuances and really see kind of a, a client perspective outside of, of New York and the US. So 00:05:17 [Speaker Changed] Great. It it’s a big world. 00:05:19 [Speaker Changed] Totally. Yet it also can feel so small once you start to, to travel and live elsewhere. So that was a terrific opportunity. And then ultimately out of that rotational program, ended up in alternatives within the private bank. And then we were off to the races. 00:05:36 [Speaker Changed] So alternatives way back then. But before you leave Switzerland, I recall a vacation not too long ago to Lake Geneva and what’s ama And we were in this hotel that used to be a castle and like you think you have some understanding of the gilded age and old money and then you see no, no, we mean 500 years of money. It’s just such a different eye-opening. So different than here. Yeah. Yeah. Really, really amazing. So you’re in the Alts group at, at JP Morgan. You stay at JP Morgan for a decade. Tell us a little bit about the work you did there. Yeah, 00:06:13 [Speaker Changed] So it was very early days of speaking to families around the world, the ultra high net worth clients of, of JP Morgan, about the role of alternatives in their portfolio. And I remember distinctly speaking about the core and satellite within alternatives now kind of private markets as our nomenclature. But it gave me such a great perspective in terms of the educational kind of foundation that we needed to set first with those clients. And I see it now continuing to play out. But my, my time at JP Morgan, and it was a very fast 10, 10 years and an amazing kind of training ground was, was kind of a, an assessment of all the different private market strategies from private equity to hedge funds to credit. And the seat was a combination of the buy side, so kind of due diligence on the managers we were going to put on platform. And then the sell side in terms of the educational component to the end banker and, and client. Super fun traveled around the world speaking about how alts could factor in to return profiles and diversification, smoother volatility all at a time when private equity was not on the front page every day. Yeah, it was very early. 00:07:40 [Speaker Changed] Let, let’s contextualize a little bit. This is the mid to late nineties and early two thousands. The stock market was just screaming higher double digits, especially the last four years of the nineties. What was it like then? How receptive was the audience to you should consider the private markets? How, how much smaller was the whole space back then? Yeah, 00:08:06 [Speaker Changed] It was very early days and a very small fraction. I mean, I remember, you know, if we, if we launched kind of one manager a quarter, it was a big deal. Now I feel like there are probably dozens kind of on, on the shelf available for, for clients every, every day, every quarter. The but the transformation was starting to take hold where there were especially the large families recognizing the return potential that a manager in, in alternatives could provide in, in their portfolio. And they didn’t wanna rely, it was very early, but they saw that they didn’t wanna rely exclusively on public market exposure. So, you know, when we look at actually the percentages in kind of large family office clients today, it matches or frankly exceeds that of an institution. But it still, they, they started at the ultra high net worth end so much earlier kind of in, back in those days than most in wealth. So I think, you know, there were, you know, the likes of a JP Morgan client base and a select number of other private banks did start early in, in showcasing these opportunities. And the adoption as I traveled around the world was, was strong. But it was still kind of storytelling and a lot of niche opportunities where I feel like if we fast forward to today, people recognize that private market solutions can play both the core and satellite in, in their portfolio as it relates to a compliment to the public market exposure. 00:09:56 [Speaker Changed] So you join Apollo in 2004, I’m kind of curious, a few years earlier we have the dotcom implosion a few years later we have the great financial crisis. I, I hate when people call these, you know, once a century events ’cause they seem to happen a lot more frequently than that. But how significant were those giant public events to telling the story of, hey, here’s some private market investments that you don’t have the same sort of volatility and regular, you know, explosions. 00:10:32 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, no, you’re, you’re right. They, they were such an incredibly important backdrop to, to why alternatives, why private markets. And, and in fact, when I was still in my seat at JP Morgan, but Apollo was offering then our private equity flagship fund five, the, the.com boom was just at its tail and was starting to fracture. You saw the signs and Apollo came onto the platform and was talking a value story. And for the first several weeks there wasn’t as much take up. And then as the, the market started to change dramatically, there was this wake up call of, whoa, you know what, let’s look at value again. And that kind of was the tail end of the, of the story for, for that fundraise back around the 2000 period. Fast forward to the great financial crisis, it was such an incredible time. At that point I was already in my Apollo seat to, to see the investment committee dynamic. 00:11:48 And you know, there were moments that thankfully because we were so steeped on the credit side, in addition to obviously our view of private equity, where we, we could back up the truck on certain credits with conviction. And I look back now with, with honestly such pride for the decisions that were made in that period of time and frankly many subsequently during moments of dislocation where it, it, they make it look so easy on the investment side, but it actually takes so much work and rigor to be in position to make those big investment calls in those moments in time. But it, it served us incredibly well and, and continues to even liberation day, right post, when the market started to move materially, there wasn’t that much time within 48 hours. There were, there was kind of a correction from, from the volatility that we saw on household issuers and, and names. But thankfully, based on our scale and knowledge of those capital structures, we were able to, to put about 25 billion of dollars to work in just a few days. And were one of the biggest market participants during that moment of, of dislocation. 00:13:18 [Speaker Changed] You know, you mentioned high conviction investments. I I recall in the mid to late two thousands, people tossed around the phrase toxic assets. And my attitude was always, there’s no such thing as toxic assets. There are only toxic prices. Everything discounted enough become eventually becomes attractive. 00:13:41 [Speaker Changed] Look, we are, one of our kind of taglines that you’ll hear internally and externally is purchase price matters. 00:13:50 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, a hundred percent. Yeah. What you pay for something is gonna have a giant impact on what the subsequent returns are gonna be. 00:13:56 [Speaker Changed] Totally. And you know, that that does, it does require discipline, especially when multiples are going to kind of stratospheric levels. But, you know, it has, that strategy has born out in a very kind of productive and successful way for us maintaining that discipline. But as you’re saying, like spotting those moments where in investments are mispriced or not well understood and being willing to deal with that complexity at the right place, at the right price in order to generate the outcome we want. 00:14:31 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, really interesting Coming up, we continue our conversation with Stephanie Drescher, Apollo’s Chief client and product development officer, discussing her career at Apollo. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. Mike extra special guest this week is Stephanie Drescher. She’s Apollo’s Chief Client and product Development Officer. Apollo runs about $840 billion in client assets. So I love this title, but it, I gotta think people are wondering what’s a day in the life of Apollo’s chief client and product development officer? Like, it sounds like that’s a really wide bit of land. 00:15:35 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s a fun job. So I’ve been at Apollo now 21 years and when I first started I built out the institutional side of, of the business globally. So sovereign wealth funds, think the DB public pension plans. And that was very much our core client base with an episodic offering through a private bank or a wire from time to time. As, as that market evolved and, and matured into a very robust global business there, it was clear to Mark Rowan, now CEO and I that at some point complimenting that institutional business with a wealth strategy was in our future. We wanted to make sure though that we chose the right moment to really lean in to wealth because it, it does take a massive commitment and I’m sure we’ll talk more about it. So in my role, I am fortunate enough to build out our business as it relates to our client set of offerings, our product development as well as our partnerships with, with our distributors, with our investors. And just making sure that as we continue to innovate, we meet our clients where they are and often kind of co-author the types of offerings that are most meaningful to them. So I, in any given day I get to think about our set of products and what we’re innovating. I get to speak with our clients and, and partners, existing and, and prospects. I manage a large group of, of people and our talent and I lean in with a very keen focus on culture, which means a lot to me. So 00:17:33 [Speaker Changed] That’s really interesting. How would you describe Apollo’s culture and and what do you do to help shape that? 00:17:40 [Speaker Changed] So look, since the day I joined there have been cer certain common themes to, to our culture, which I think have always kind of propelled us forward as a firm now public, but very much feels like a partnership. And, and the first one is making sure that we continue to innovate to feel very entrepreneurial to, to empower our people to kind of find those opportunities and, and pursue them in, in an appropriate way. We manage the firm as a meritocracy, so we wanna give people responsibility and let them kind of really kind of have the greatest impact that, that they can for their own professional careers as well as for, for the firm. And we, we wanna have a winning high performance culture, meaning, you know, even with all the success that we’ve had, we want to maintain that propell it forward and continue that high level of performance. And importantly we do it together. So it’s not about any one person. I often say to my team, you know, it’s, it’s we not me. And that’s really powerful. So when we bring everything that Apollo has to offer, we call it kind of the one Apollo to, to any client situation or any goal we can use that power of, of the firm to be successful and to allow us all to win. 00:19:10 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, really interesting. You know, so the biggest complaint I heard from various corporate executives during the pandemic was, how do we maintain the corporate culture? We’ve spent so much time and energy trying to build over the years. Suddenly everybody’s at home on a zoom call in their pajamas. How do, how do you maintain corporate culture like that? 00:19:31 [Speaker Changed] It it is, it’s so important, frankly, whether we’re all in the office to maintain that culture or certainly the challenges during, during the pandemic making sure, certainly during that, during kind of that COVID period of creating forums, even if it was remote to maintain the connectivity was, was really important to have different, I remember many different kind of lunchtime meetings that, that we would have on Zoom or our, our family community group would have different webinars where it was the employee as parent and then their children frankly were involved as well. So I think it’s kind of forced fostering that sense of, of community, even if it is in fact remote. And then thankfully once in office, I know as I was passing through the sixth floor here at, at Bloomberg, I saw the, the very deliberate kind of floor plan that you have and food and beverage kind of accessible to employees. 00:20:41 [Speaker Changed] Everybody has to go through six. It causes all these random meetings that you have, oh, I haven’t seen you in a long time, how’s everything going? ’cause everybody shows up for coffee or treats. 00:20:50 [Speaker Changed] Totally. And, and we have the same, so ours is on the eighth floor, but we call it the casual collision. And that’s really important to our culture to kind of show up certainly as soon as we could do, do so from a practical perspective and a allow for that collaboration. It’s, it’s super important for people to, to share and get to the best answer possible together. 00:21:14 [Speaker Changed] So I wanna talk about the wealth channel, but before I get there I have to ask about something that Apollo does that not every large private markets firm does. You have talked about realigning the interest of the firm with clients, making sure that you’re on the same side of trades. And towards that end, Apollo is a regular co-investor along with clients in certain projects. Tell, tell us about that. 00:21:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so from a, from a kind of balance sheet perspective, we are often one of, if not the largest investor side by side with our third party clients in the investments and strategies that we manage. So through our retirement services business, Athene as well as our third party business, we, we invest side by side. And so the decisions we make on behalf of the balance sheet are aligned with, with the outcomes of, of the strategies in which we invest third party capital. So we often say, well, we can’t guarantee the outcome, we guarantee a shared outcome. And, and that means a lot to us in terms of our commitment and focus, but also to our clients. ’cause they, they know how important it is to us in multiple ways. 00:22:42 [Speaker Changed] I I would imagine if anybody has hesitation on a investment, if you see the private equity firm co-investing along with you, that has to be a big confidence driver. 00:22:56 [Speaker Changed] It it is. And in certain instances, like when you look across the industry, a commitment from an asset manager might be at the 2.5% or 3.5%. It’s, it’s an outlier if it’s a 5% commitment, 00:23:16 [Speaker Changed] But not double digits. 00:23:17 [Speaker Changed] Exactly. Where in one strategy of ours, which has a diversified portfolio of, of private markets, we are two thirds Wow. Of that portfolio. So when, when we say that it’s, it’s meaningful to our balance sheet, we, we mean it, 00:23:39 [Speaker Changed] How does that work in terms of direct stakes and performance fees? Like if you are most of the invested assets that has to have an impact on what the balance sheet looks like, how do you guys align that? 00:23:52 [Speaker Changed] So look, we, we are performance first. At the end of the day, our, you know, our relationships and the trust that we build are overtime through performance and, and through service. I mean, we wanna make sure that our partners feel our, our support in just about every way. So for us it’s, it’s never about a particular fee of one type or or another. Ultimately we’re not focused on an AUM goal that is the reward for good performance. And as long as we are making the best investment decisions and showing up, frankly as a best in class partner for our clients, that is what drives our business forward. 00:24:45 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about the wealth channel, which is where, where you focus some of your time early in your career at Apollo. Tell us how this has changed over the past 20 years and tell us a little bit about what type of clients show up there. Yeah, 00:25:02 [Speaker Changed] So you know, the, the wealth business I saw certainly in my very early days of JP Morgan, but then for my first kind of 16 plus years at Apollo, the private bank or, or wire was really more the exception than the rule. It was a more of a episodic type of, of relationship that all completely transformed into a strategic commitment from, from all of us at, at Apollo starting about four or five years ago. So when Mark Rowan took the reins as CEO, all the stars aligned to build a wealth business to compliment the institutional and that that decision truly needed to come from the top CEO on down because it is strategic, it’s, it’s not transactional if you’re going to do it well, it needs to be a long term commitment to, to the channel. And in my view, there are actually only a small number of firms that can really show up and do this well in partnership with, with all the financial intermediaries involved with wealth. 00:26:21 And the reason I say that is when you look at what’s required, it’s a pretty massive lift. You need to make sure that you build out the right relationships and you need the team globally in place to do that across channels and geographies. You need to make sure that the product mix is extensive enough so that you’re relevant as it pertains to our investment capability. But you want to make sure that you’re showing up with the right structures for the right clients. Then there’s the educational component, there’s the servicing, there’s technology for example, we, we have spent actually a billion dollars, $1 billion from our balance sheet in wealth tech investments alone to make sure that we’re partnering and investing in firms that will help the industry. So the, I think there are very few that can do that well and, and truly meet the well clients where with, in order to meet their portfolio needs. 00:27:27 [Speaker Changed] So within that channel, family offices, high net wealth sovereign funds, are you also selling through other intermediaries like brokerage firms or RIAs? Tell us a little bit about that. 00:27:40 [Speaker Changed] Yes, so the, the channels represented in wealth include the private banks and wires as one channel. The independence, which includes RIAs and and independent broker dealers family office is also kind of under our, our wealth umbrella. So that’s the ultra high net worth space, selectively. And then we have geographic focus, you know, out outside of, of the US across EMEA and, and Asia. The rest of of North America is, is covered appropriately out of Canada and latam. So, so each of those channels are, are represented and while each has differences and we definitely approach them with different resourcing and and commitments, the common denominator of of all of them is helping the intermediary, the advisor or the banker or the CIO of the family office, either build for retirement in the case of their underlying client or bill to a certain level of wealth. And so whether it’s, you know, a, a wire like A-A-U-B-S or a a Morgan Stanley and their set of advisors or you name kind of a, an RIA, we wanna show up to that intermediary with offerings that are gonna work for their platform and, you know, their, their base and make sure that we can speak to semi-liquid as well as draw down and really kind of listen closely to what they’re looking to provide their clients. 00:29:30 [Speaker Changed] So the challenge we always see on, on the RAA side is on the privates it seems everything is sort of a one-off and whereas on the public side, the custodianship is standardized, the reporting is standardized, all the compliance and due diligence is pretty, you know, turnkey. Tell us about a, the challenges of, of all the private investments that may not all be identical and is there a solution out there, a platform in development that might make this more like a turnkey, more public security like than private? Yeah, 00:30:11 [Speaker Changed] It’s a journey, but I think it’s already getting better and I do see a world where it, it becomes so much easier, more efficient to, to access. And so if we look at what we’re already seeing, you know, when we think about an interval fund structure where you can buy many different underlying strategies, it’s point and click through an advisor, but it’s point and click, there isn’t kind of the fulsome subscription process that we’ve seen, right? There’s innovation, which, you know, we have worked on in, in partnership with State Street for example, where there are ETF structures of which private markets are apart. And I think the technology is moving from kind of more of an analog to digital in, in just kind of the, the plumbing and the infrastructure that supports the, the private markets overall ecosystem. So there’s, there’s definitely a lot of time and effort to try to simplify the processes and I think it’s going to go hand in hand with an evolution that’s already starting where allocators are looking to, to managers like ourselves to not only offer specific parts or specific strategies, but to increasingly offer more holistic solutions. 00:31:47 So a bundle of private market solutions, which could be multi-strategy, going to eventually kind of multi-strategy multi-manager as as well, which can then be housed not only in the accounts, brokerage accounts or self-directed that we see so often today, but in a range of pools of, of capital and models and a number of discretionary pools of capital that are highly applicable for private markets. 00:32:23 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, really interesting coming up, we continue our conversation with Stephanie Drescher, Apollo’s Chief client and product development officer, discussing the state of private markets today. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I’m Mary Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest is Stephanie Recher. She’s the chief client and product development officer at Private Investment giant Apollo helping to oversee $840 billion in client assets. So we’re living in a moment where private credit and private equity, they used to be a small niche that’s no longer the case. Not only are they mainstream, they’re one of the fastest growing parts of the investment world. Tell us a little bit about what’s happening in that space and what’s driving that shift. 00:33:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, I think there’s been a transformation in terms of public and private holdings in a portfolio and what does it mean to be safe or risky? I think historically people have thought that because something was liquid in the public markets, it was inherently safe or frankly safer than something less liquid in the private markets. And as we look at 2022 and frankly many moments of dislocation in the public markets, I think there’s now a, a much clearer recognition that the public markets can be both safe and risky as can the private markets. Because when we look at the public markets, let’s say the s and p 500, for example, the performance and frankly moments of underperformance have been so concentrated in terms of the attribution to roughly seven stocks. Sometimes people will say 10 stocks, but when there’s so much concentration or frankly lack of diversification in the public markets, it, it creates a moment where people start to zoom out and say, frankly, what if the toolkit for my equity piece of the portfolio should have a combination of both public and private. And frankly, what if my fixed income segment of the portfolio should have both public and private? Then the toolkit for advisors and for for families is much broader to create that excess return. And what we’ve seen is the desire to incorporate the private markets not just as an add-on to an otherwise traditional 60 40 portfolio, but rather thinking of it as part of their core holdings in equity and debt and think and now thinking simply of alternatives as an alternative to public stocks and bonds. 00:35:46 [Speaker Changed] So 60 40 becomes 50 30, 20 or 60 20 20 or something along those lines. Yeah. Or, 00:35:53 [Speaker Changed] Or it could even keep whatever percentages are split between public, between equity and debt, but have both the public and private options available within each of those percentages to maximize the return, to maximize our diversification and to reduce the volatility. It’s a game changer. It’s no longer nice to have private markets in a portfolio. It’s a need to have in order to meet the long-term financial goals of the client. 00:36:26 [Speaker Changed] So one of the things I can’t help but notice over the course of my career, which began more or less around the same time as yours in the mid nineties, is that the total number of public equities has shrunk dramatically. Yeah. The Wilshire 5,000 is about 3,400 stocks, the s and p 500, still 502 stocks because of a shares it’s a little over 500. But even the Russell 2000 and some of the other broader indexes, far fewer public names in there. How much is the shrinking of the public float driving activity onto the private side? 00:37:06 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I I think it’s very real. You, you’re right, it’s about half the number of public companies. It was, you know, just, you know, even a couple of decades ago at the same time when, when you look at the number of companies, total number of companies globally, 90% are in fact private. So if someone truly wants representative exposure in their portfolio, it’s really hard to rationalize eliminating 90% of the total number of companies out there, right? And focusing exclusively on public because it’s liquid. Realistically, one needs to look at what is the return profile goal for the portfolio? What, what type of illiquidity can, can someone accept and, and then create a portfolio that allows for that excess return. Institutions have realized that now over decades, and they’ve been the beneficiaries of that excess return by accepting some amount of illiquidity with the advent of new structures in the private market, certainly for wealth and increasingly even for institutions, you can, you can select offerings out there that provide more interim liquidity. It’s, it’s not, you’re ATM no one should think that it is, right? But it provides a much broader suite of solutions across a range of liquidity profiles offering far more liquidity than one would have received in a traditional private equity drawdown structure. In, in our view, in a, as we develop portfolios with our clients, depending on what they’re looking for in terms of underlying return and, and liquidity, we believe there’s a, a role for a mix of both. More, more liquid private markets structures as, as well as draw down depending on the strategy. 00:39:15 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about liquidity and semi-liquid as well as illiquidity. The academic perspective has always been, hey, when you’re moving into an illiquid market, you get the benefit of the illiquidity premium. It’s a smaller market, it’s less efficient, there’s opportunities to create alpha here, but the trade off is your money is locked up for three years, for five years, for seven years, whatever it is, when first with the semi-liquid product. So you’re giving up some of that upside in exchange for semi liquidity. 00:39:52 [Speaker Changed] Our, our view is that the, the structure and the design should marry the underlying assets in the portfolio. 00:40:00 [Speaker Changed] So two year credit notes are gonna be more liquid than perpetual open-ended 00:40:06 [Speaker Changed] E Exactly. So we have, you know, in our, our view the strategy is within private markets are so wide ranging, which to your point in terms of portfolio construction, you know, our, our view is that since a private market holding can span everything from short term investment grade credit all the way through to your traditional kind of private equity drawdown, that’s a very wide range. And when you think broadly about that type of exposure, why shouldn’t an allocation in a portfolio be maybe even 50% to private markets just given the breadth and applicability of the underlying assets from the short dated investment grade credit all the way through to more traditional private private equity. But, but to your point, there are options where private markets can be a part of an overall portfolio like an ETF format where it is in fact daily as part of a broader portfolio or if you go to kind of an investment grade strategy, it may be, you know, monthly in nature, but you’re, you’re right, the, the trade off for stepping out a bit on the liquidity curve, albeit, you know, not too much further is a pickup in in the access return. 00:41:34 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Real, really interesting. You know, I’m, I’m not gonna quote you exactly, but I did read something you had said a a about private credit is that you see a full on fundamental rethink taking place in the space. Explain what you mean by fundamental rethink. 00:41:55 [Speaker Changed] You know, the, the idea of of private markets or alternative of our alternatives being that very high risk portion of a portfolio and therefore small percentage of one’s allocation locked up for a long period of time. That’s just no longer the modern thinking of the use of private markets in a portfolio. There’s no reason right now why an advisor and a banker can’t think in a far more flexible way about how they are meeting the need to save for retirement or the ability to build wealth with private market structures in mind. So it kind of goes back to that idea of public markets being safe and private markets being risky. That’s no longer kind of the, the thinking in in the market. I think most intermediaries have really challenged that historical way of building portfolios and they want the same benefits that the institutions have now had for decades. The reality is that the, the size of the wealth market in terms of assets held by families, by individuals is about the same size as that held by institutions, right. Each about 150 trillion or so globally. The institutions right now have an a an average allocation of over 20% to private markets, the individual on average 3%. 00:43:44 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I was gonna say single digits clearly. It’s absolutely, and, and all of the, when we, when we look at the projections and a variety of war game scenarios, this looks like this is gonna continue to grow over the next decade. The the, I know this is a speculative question and no one really knows, but how large can the private markets get relative to the public markets? Can they be the same size eventually? 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] Look, our, our view is that origination is the great differentiator. So we, we focus not as kind of a UM as a limiter, but rather origination and making 00:44:32 [Speaker Changed] Sure and define that because when I hear origination, I’m thinking not all private investments are created the same, 00:44:40 [Speaker Changed] Right? It’s the ability to create proprietary investment opportunities is, is in our view a huge differentiator for a platform. And we partner with financial intermediaries and that is additive in, in terms of the flow of, of investment opportunities, but not exclusively. In fact, over the last almost 15 years now, we’ve built out 16 proprietary origination engines so that we can create that investment alpha in-house for the benefit of, of our clients. And that proprietary origination fuels our underlying portfolios, which ultimately in, in our view is critical to delivering on the return. 00:45:39 [Speaker Changed] So those 16 different engines, I’m gonna assume they’re each in a different type of space. 00:45:44 [Speaker Changed] E Exactly. So, 00:45:45 [Speaker Changed] So yeah, so real assets, infrastructure, private credit, private debt, which isn’t always the exact same thing. Private equity, there’s gotta be many more. What, what other spaces are you, what other geographies are you looking at? What other spaces are you looking at? What’s the product makes look like? Yeah. 00:46:04 [Speaker Changed] So on on the origination side, it it is quite broad. Think everything from fleet finance to 00:46:13 [Speaker Changed] Fleet jets, ships, 00:46:15 [Speaker Changed] E all the above. Exactly. And, and even trucking, you know, there’s a whole range in terms of everything from aviation to kind of ground transport. There’s consumer finance, there’s specialty finance that’s, there’s mortgages. So it’s, it’s quite broad in terms of the reach, but it’s, it’s ultimately originating the investment in what we call kind of the industrial renaissance. And the need for that private capital is, is real and additive to, to what could otherwise be found in the public markets. 00:46:55 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, really fascinating. But before I get to, I only have you for a limited amount of time. Before I get to my favorite questions, lemme just ask you one more question. What do you think investors who are looking at the private markets aren’t thinking about or talking about, but should be? What sort of topics, geographies, policy issues, what’s out there that is getting overlooked but perhaps shouldn’t? 00:47:24 [Speaker Changed] So what what I’m seeing more and more is, is a global trend of, of the democratization for private markets. And as I look at what’s happening, certainly in our own backyard in terms of the executive orders around 401k, and then I look to, to Europe and I see their regulation around the L TIF 2.0 or I look even to the UK and I see regs in the UK and France in terms of certain requirements and percentages to private markets in their retirement plans. To me there’s a global theme of the desire to allow more access of private markets to, to the individual and through their advisors, through the intermediaries to truly be able to adequately plan for retirement. And, and we see obviously the state of, of kind of retirees here in, in the US and there’s a dire need to give them, you know, through managed accounts, through target date access to investments that will provide that additional excess return. 00:48:55 And you know, as, as we think about it, you know, most of those 4 0 1 Ks have time horizons of decades, right? Yet the solutions they have available to them are daily liquid. That mismatch does not need to exist. And, you know, with, with the changes that we’re we’re seeing come out of dc you know, we’re, we’re hopeful that the framework for the benefit of those retirement plans will continue to be one that shifts from the historical view of maximizing those pools of capital to the lowest possible fee to one where they look to maximize outcome and truly maximize the result for, for those participants. Hmm. 00:49:48 [Speaker Changed] Really, really very fascinating. Let’s jump to our, our final five questions that I ask all of my guests starting with tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 00:50:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, I, I, I mentioned in, in a prior part of our series, someone that I used to babysit for who gave me my first shot in a healthcare consulting firm. So she will remain part of my, kind of my personal advisory board while at JP Morgan, Mary Erdos is kind of rockstar status Yep. In, in my book. And, and an amazing mentor throughout my career. And then, you know, many at, at Apollo that I won’t name ’cause I won’t embarrass them, but that have been incredible sponsors of, of my career with, of a lot of opportunities just to continue to grow and develop as a professional. 00:50:48 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about books. What are you reading? What are some of your favorites? 00:50:53 [Speaker Changed] So, well, in terms of what I’m reading right now, there’s a, a book called Such Good People, which I will give a disclaimer. It’s written by Amy Feld and she is a great close friend from college and it’s a great read. And so I’m, I’m at the end and I don’t want it to end. So that’s, that’s a great one. I was actually just away this weekend and I have to say I was struck when I was in the Berkshires and I was struck by the fall foliage and just how it’s 00:51:26 [Speaker Changed] Amazing this year. 00:51:27 [Speaker Changed] Beautiful. Like coming, you know, I live and work in New York City, so seeing those surroundings and being back in nature, it did make me think of Emerson and Throw who I did love. And it’s been a while since I’ve, I read their works, but it inspired me to go, to go back and dust that off. 00:51:47 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about what’s keeping you entertained these days? What are you streaming or, or listening to 00:51:52 [Speaker Changed] Other than you, 00:51:53 [Speaker Changed] Well, this doesn’t count. Give us, give us a different one. 00:51:58 [Speaker Changed] Okay, well one that is top of mind who we actually just had participate live at a, a client forum of ours is Dr. David Sinclair of Lifespan and he is affiliated with Harvard. And his work fascinates me in, in terms of, is 00:52:21 [Speaker Changed] That the Happiness series? 00:52:22 [Speaker Changed] Oh, I love that 00:52:23 [Speaker Changed] Too. Love the longitudinal study. 00:52:25 [Speaker Changed] I I love that. That’s a different one. And I, I I I love that professor as well in terms of the value of happiness at different stages of our lives. Right? I love that. But this actually relates to longevity more in terms of genetics and all the research and science and even drug development that is going into the kind of health and wellness from a longevity perspective. 00:52:49 [Speaker Changed] The health span study, is that what this one is? Yes, 00:52:52 [Speaker Changed] Yes, exactly. And research that they’re already doing in terms of eyes that could have applicability to many other parts of our body. So I just find it kind of a, a fascinating field that I think will develop so much over time. And of course from a work perspective as I think frankly of the work of both of those Harvard professors and doctors is now how does it tie into the high performance culture and mindset that we have as a firm? Like how do we take that thinking and, and try to think about our own employees over time? 00:53:25 [Speaker Changed] And our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interest in a career in investing privates alternative investings? What, what’s your advice? 00:53:38 [Speaker Changed] Well, first off, go for it because I think it’s, there’s still so much growth ahead and I would just say stay curious because, you know, as, as we think about kind of the innovation that’s happening just about from every angle of product innovation and channels, and frankly even applicability of AI to what we do today. If, if you’re tuned in from a, a curiosity perspective coupled with kind of strong work ethic, I, I think that’s a winning recipe. 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] And our final question, what do you know about the world of alternative and private market investing today would’ve been useful 30 years ago or so when you were first getting started? 00:54:33 [Speaker Changed] Well, no fun if you have the answer key, right? But look, I, I would say the one thing that stays the same is change and to embrace that and to be flexible to recognize that there will be so much evolution and change that continues in front of us from an industry. And certainly as someone starting, if someone’s starting out now to kind of enjoy that ride and recognize that there will be many chapters that unfold and the best we can kind of try to see where that puck is going. But certainly, and, and embrace that, that there’s so much more innovation and opportunity to come. Hmm. 00:55:26 [Speaker Changed] Really, really interesting.

Time Published: 2026-01-05T14:04:27Z

Investing SoFi (SOFI) gained 85% in 2025 and hit an all-time high of $32.73. The stock now trades at $27.46. SoFi reported Q3 revenue of $950M (up 37.7% year over year) and added 35% more users to reach 12.6M members. SoFi launched SoFi Crypto in November as the first chartered bank enabling crypto transactions. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Courtesy of Social Finance, Inc. Stocks have had a wild ride in 2025. While it wasn’t a smooth year, the stock market remained resilient despite the ups and downs. With the onset of the new year, there’s an opportunity for you to take a look at your portfolio and consider the changes you need to make. If you’re willing to add new stocks to your portfolio, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) is one fintech stock worth considering. SoFi Technologies is one of the most disruptive names in the industry. It has attracted young users and become a ‘one-stop shop’ for all things money. Users can save, invest, spend, and budget on the SoFi app. 2025 has been the best year ever for SoFi Technologies, as its shares hit an all-time high of $32.73. The fintech stock gained 85% in 2025 and is now trading below its all-time high at $27.46. It started in 2025 at $14 and ended the year at $26. Is more upside possible? Should you buy the stock while it is below $40? Here’s why I think SOFI is one of the top fintech stocks to own this year. SoFi has gone beyond the traditional business of consumer lending and has now built impressive technology and infrastructure capabilities that steadily attract users. The company has been growing across different metrics, and its management has ensured consistent expansion of the ecosystem. The company first beat revenue expectations in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the market believes that it will continue doing so in 2026. Further, in the fourth quarter results, SoFi will inch closer to the milestone of $1 billion in quarterly sales. It has delivered strong financials for the third quarter. SOFI recorded a 35% jump in the number of users and a 36% year-over-year jump in the number of products. Since the number of products has surpassed the number of users, it shows that SOFI continues to sell services to existing customers. It reported an EPS of $0.11 and a revenue of $950 million, up 37.7% year over year. The net income came in at $139 million, and it ended the quarter with a record 12.6 million members. For the full year, the management now expects to add about 3.5 million new members. Its financial services segment revenue saw a 76% year-over-year jump, while the technology platform segment saw a 12% jump, and the lending segment saw a 25% rise. Analysts expect SoFi to generate a revenue of $985 million in the upcoming fourth-quarter results. The company is set to announce results on January 30. SoFi is expanding into the digital assets segment and launched SoFi Crypto in November, the first chartered bank that allows consumers to make transactions using crypto assets. Further, in December, it launched SoFiUSD, a stablecoin space. One of the biggest reasons to buy SOFI is the strong leadership and management execution. Everything has gone right for the company since 2023, and it consistently beats Wall Street forecasts. The management continues to boost guidance, strengthening its market position and showing that it has massive potential for the long term. SashaMagic / Shutterstock.com SOFI has been trading between $25 and $30 over the past few months. However, a strong fourth-quarter report could boost the stock and push it beyond $30. SOFI has the potential to deliver extraordinarily and beat market expectations quarter after quarter. The company is in growth mode and on the cusp of significant gains. While the stock is valued at a premium, there is a strong chance of steady upside. If you already own SOFI shares, it will be worth holding on to them for the long term. The stock has the potential to double your money. If you’re interested in riding the fintech wave, do not wait for a bottom in the stock. SOFI could have another impressive run in 2026.

Title: SpaceX, Private Ventures Fuel Elon Musk’s Trillion-Dollar Dreams
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/elon-musks-private-ventures-pave-path-toward-trillionaire-status/

Tesla’s sleek cars and futuristic trucks have defined Elon Musk’s public image, but SpaceX is the real engine behind his growing net worth. Jennifer Ablan Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Elon Musk, often described as a modern-day Thomas Edison, may soon add an unprecedented title to his résumé: the world’s first trillionaire. Tesla’s sleek cars and futuristic trucks have defined his public image, but SpaceX is the real engine behind his growing net worth. The buzz around a potential IPO valued at as much as $1.5 trillion for the high-flying government contractor has emerged as the primary swing factor in the entrepreneur’s net worth at the same time that Tesla shareholders have approved a massive, performance-based compensation package that could significantly expand his stake in the electric-car maker. Together, these developments have shifted Musk’s path to extreme wealth from incremental gains to a handful of high-stakes corporate milestones. Musk’s net worth has surged nearly 50% year over year to an estimated $645 billion. In October, he became the first individual to surpass a $500 billion net worth, propelled by rising private-market valuations for SpaceX and renewed confidence in Tesla’s long-term strategy. If Musk meets the aggressive performance targets tied to his Tesla compensation plan, and if SpaceX continues on its current trajectory, he could break the trillion-dollar barrier. Such an accomplishment would test the upper bounds of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, created and named when the idea of a trillionaire still seemed unfathomable and absurd. Now, it no longer does. Already, Musk has been cast front and center, most recently by Forbes, as the maestro of this era’s wealth creation. SpaceX, which has invested aggressively in reusable rockets, launch infrastructure, and satellites, is the single largest lever in the trillionaire equation. Musk owns an estimated 42% of the private rocket and satellite company, which recent secondary share transactions have valued at $350 billion to $800 billion in private markets; that makes his stake worth roughly $136 billion to more than $300 billion on paper today. The real upside comes from long-term growth and the potential for a public offering; if SpaceX lists at valuations some analysts forecast (up to about $1.5 trillion), Musk’s stake alone could exceed $600 billion, reshaping his net worth significantly. Indeed, Starlink has rapidly become the financial backbone of SpaceX. The satellite internet service has added 1 million new customers in under seven weeks, bringing its total to more than 9 million active users across 155 countries and territories, according to the company, implying a growth rate of more than 20,000 new users per day since early November. That momentum caps an explosive year. In December 2024, SpaceX reported 4.6 million Starlink customers; by August 2025, the figure had climbed to 7 million, before accelerating sharply in recent months. The service now operates on a constellation of more than 9,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites, enabling broadband connectivity in rural, maritime, aviation, and defense-critical regions beyond the reach of traditional networks (For my part, I can now use Wi-Fi on routes to and from New York and Hawaii, even over the Pacific Ocean — something that was previously impossible — because of Starlink.) Musk has said Starlink is now “by far” the largest driver of SpaceX’s revenue — a distinction that has materially altered how investors assess the company. While SpaceX and Starlink represent the transformational upside, Tesla remains a critical component of Musk’s wealth trajectory. His 2018 compensation package, revived after the Delaware Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that had voided it, entitles Musk to acquire stock options tied to ambitious operational and market-capitalization milestones. Most of those milestones have already been achieved, giving Musk the right to purchase roughly 304 million Tesla shares at deeply discounted prices, currently valued at approximately $139 billion. Adding to this, Tesla’s shareholders have also approved a new performance-based pay plan, further increasing Musk’s potential upside and consolidating his control over the company. If fully realized, these packages could add hundreds of billions in theoretical value, though the actual gain depends on hitting aggressive targets and on public-market conditions. All told, the new performance plan positions Musk to unlock value as Tesla begins monetizing AI-driven initiatives, including full self-driving, autonomous fleet operations and robotics. In this framework, Tesla serves as an accelerant rather than the primary driver of Musk’s net worth. Its gains are meaningful but incremental, constrained by stock performance, earnings multiples and investor sentiment. SpaceX, by contrast, offers the potential for sudden, transformative gains: an IPO, Starlink expansion or secondary-market repricing could add hundreds of billions almost overnight. “Heading into 2026, this marks a monster year for Tesla and Musk as the autonomous and robotics chapter begins,” analyst Dan Ives writes in his latest report on Top 5 Names to Play the AI Revolution into 2026. “The AI valuation will start to get unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next six to nine months has now begun, with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla’s installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose for Musk & Co. We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year, and in a bull-case scenario, $3 trillion by the end of 2026.” Beyond Tesla and SpaceX, Musk holds stakes in several ventures that extend both financial upside and strategic influence, positioning him across AI, social platforms, neurotechnology and infrastructure: In true “Musk fashion,” the venture was inspired when Musk was stuck in LA traffic. Caterpillar’s not alone in transforming worksites: Deere & Co. showed off new equipment at CES this week, too. Since the 1980s, Citgo Petroleum has operated as the US-based subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil and gas company. The official unveiling of Nvidia’s new chip architecture, dubbed the Vera Rubin, wasn’t expected until later this spring. Bitcoin ETFs just notched $697 million worth of inflows on Monday, their biggest gain since early October. Artificial intelligence-powered bots’ big presence at CES belies the tech industry’s expectations to turn a profit on them. Greg Abel earned Warren Buffett’s trust and, eventually, his job. Here’s what you need to know about Berkshire Hathaway’s new, lower-key CEO. Bitcoin, the No. 1 crypto by market cap, hasn’t recovered from a flash crash, chopping more than $1 trillion from the broader sector’s value. With an estimated half a million workers needed to fill the construction industry’s labor shortages, AI investments this year may get stalled. US automakers General Motors, Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) and Ford are bracing for slowing sales in 2026 amid rising unemployment. The last three months of 2025 are only the start of a downturn for EV sales: The pace is expected to keep slowing next year. Despite initial concern from motorists, robotaxi services are finding plenty of passengers as they expand across the country.
