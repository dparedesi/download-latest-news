Unlike legacy dairy companies with large liquid milk exposure, Milky Mist has consciously built its business around high-margin products like paneer, cheese, curd, and yogurt. As of FY25, value-added products contributed a significant portion of its ₹2,350 crore topline, which has grown at a 30% CAGR over the last three years. However, profitability has been volatile. PAT dropped from ₹27.2 crore in FY23 to ₹19.4 crore in FY24, before rebounding to ₹46.1 crore in FY25—impacted by higher depreciation and finance costs from recent capacity investments. The company’s EBITDA margin stood at 11.6% in FY25. Operationally, the Perundurai plant runs at 110% utilization for paneer, reflecting both efficiency and potential capacity strain. 98% of milk procurement still comes from Tamil Nadu, posing concentration risk. The IPO proceeds aim to expand whey and yogurt capacity, reduce debt, and strengthen distribution through branded refrigeration units. In a sector known for supply chain complexity and margin compression, Milky Mist’s execution-led strategy offers visibility. However, scaling beyond South India while maintaining product quality and procurement control will be critical post-listing.” Drug maker Lupin on Thursday said it has received approval from the US health regulator to market generic medications to treat diabetes. The company has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its abbreviated new drug applications for Liraglutide Injection single-patient-use prefilled pens and glucagon for injection vials, the drug maker said in a statement. Lupin receives USFDA approval for generic diabetes medications, including Liraglutide Injection and Glucagon for Injection. India’s electricity demand is projected to triple by 2035, reaching over 4,000 TWh, driven by industrial expansion, urbanization, digital infrastructure, and the electrification of transport. Meeting this surge will require a massive scaleup in generation capacity across renewables like Solar and Wind, thermal, and nuclear, alongside robust transmission and distribution upgrades. This report outlines the estimated capital investment needed to build a resilient, sustainable, and future-ready power ecosystem. Here are key pointers from our analysis: According to the NEP, solar is expected to contribute 40% of India’s installed capacity by 2032—a figure we project to slightly increase to 41% by 2035, reflecting continued momentum in solar deployment. Coal’s share, which NEP estimates at 29% by 2032, is projected to decline further to 24% by 2035 in our analysis, consistent with India’s decarbonization goals and the growing dominance of renewables. Wind energy, which NEP places at 13%, is expected to rise significantly to 21% by 2035, capturing a portion of coal’s declining share and contributing to grid diversification. Other sources such as hydro, nuclear, and biomass remain relatively stable in both projections, supporting baseload and regional reliability. This alignment with NEP validates our methodology and also highlights the strategic direction India is taking toward a cleaner, more balanced energy future. “We have started FY26 on a strong note with sustained growth across all key parameters.

The Company gained 78 basis points improvement in private market share, i.e. 6.19% reflecting growing customer preference and an expanding footprint across key markets.

Continuing to outpace industry growth, the company reported a Profit After Tax (PAT) of INR 188 crores.

The company gained market share in the key categories of Health by 72 bps , Motor by 47 bps and Personal Accident by 49 bps.

(PTI) The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has approved a phased rollout of market coupling across India’s power exchanges, beginning with three months of pilot run. The decision shifts price-setting responsibilities from individual exchanges to a central body, a development that may hurt Indian Energy Exchange, which currently handles the bulk of trade volumes and plays a key role in price discovery. The Commission has asked the Grid Controller of India to start with pilot testing of three mechanisms: coupling the Real-Time Market (RTM) across all exchanges, coupling the RTM with Security Constrained Economic Dispatch, and coupling the Day-Ahead Market. The change is aimed at improving market efficiency, but it reduces the commercial price discovery role of exchanges like IEX in determining prices. Since IEX earns most of its revenue from high-volume trading in the Day-Ahead Market and Real-Time Market segments, the shift could affect its position and profitability.

Title: Rocket Lab Stock Is Up 800% In A Year. Is Now The Time To Buy?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/rocket-lab-rklb-stock-is-now-time-to-buy/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T18:34:07Z
Full Content:
BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. A lot hinges on Rocket Lab’s ability to evolve its revenue model and reach sustained profitability. Rocket Lab stock is in the stratosphere — skyrocketing 800% over the past year, propelled by a potent mix of explosive launch cadence, major contract wins and mounting anticipation around its upcoming Neutron rocket. Beyond fundamental strength, broader investor rotation into tariff-insulated aerospace names, and SpaceX-related political headwinds have turbocharged the rally. With sentiment now sky-high, the real question is: Can Rocket Lab keep climbing? Let’s break down the key drivers, risks and whether it’s still a buy. Rocket Lab has been feeding off investor excitement around the burgeoning space economy. Beyond offering reliable launch services for small satellites — significant in itself — Rocket Lab is deepening its moat by building an end-to-end space infrastructure platform. With its Electron rocket for small satellite launches, spacecraft platform, satellite components and on-orbit management solutions, Rocket Lab is targeting the full spectrum of the space value chain. This integrated approach strengthens its appeal for procuring large scale government and commercial contracts. Rocket Lab operates through two core segments: launch services and space systems. For the recent first quarter of 2025, space systems represented $87 million, or 70% of revenues, while launch services $35.6 million or 30%. Rocket Lab’s revenue has grown at a stellar pace of 7x, from $62.2 million in 2021 to $436.2 million in 2024, and is estimated to grow to $573.3 million in 2025, representing 31% year-on-year growth. The company is not yet profitable and cash flows are negative. Cash and equivalents at the end of Q1 2025 was $517 million. Backlog as of Q1 2025 was $1.067 billion with 60% attributed to the space systems segment and 40% to launch services. Commercial customers represented 54% of the backlog, while Government customers represented 46%. Rocket Lab expects about 56% of this backlog to be recognized within 12 months. Rocket Lab’s 800% stock surge reflects a blend of recent execution and future potential. Neutron is the main narrative investors are buying into now, even if Rocket Lab’s current fundamentals are still tied to Electron. At the heart of Rocket Lab’s next growth chapter is Neutron, its upcoming next-gen satellite launch vehicle that is central to its shift from small satellite missions to heavier payloads and high-value national security contracts. Neutron builds on the success of Electron, which has logged 3x more successful launches than all other American small launch providers combined over the past decade. If successful, Neutron could emerge as the first credible challenger to SpaceX’s Falcon 9 in the medium-lift launch market, breaking into a near-monopoly space and significantly expanding Rocket Lab’s total addressable market. Investors already have a reason to be optimistic: The U.S. Space Force selected Rocket Lab to compete for high-priority, national security missions under its $5.6 billion National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. Rocket Lab’s launch vehicle for this program will be Neutron. Meanwhile, Electron, which is the second most frequently launched U.S. rocket, remains Rocket Lab’s workhorse. The company successfully launched its 68th Electron rocket (as of June 28) and also set a new launch turnaround record, with the mission being the second of two launches from the same launch site in less than 48 hours. In the first quarter of 2025, Electron achieved a 100% mission success rate, including an impressive, rapid turnaround of three launches in 13 days. This operational excellence continues to win trust and contracts for Electron missions. Rocket Lab sees commercial and government demand for 20+ Electron launches in 2025. Rocket Lab’s hypersonic test vehicle — HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) is seeing strong demand in the U.S., and beginning to gain traction internationally. Regular hypersonic flight tests are vital to advancing a nation’s defense capabilities, and HASTE is playing a central role. Both The U.S and The United Kingdom have picked HASTE to develop sovereign hypersonic technology for their multibillion dollar defense programs. Rocket Lab is also a key subcontractor under Kratos Defense’s flagship DoD program MACH‑TB 2.0, a $1.45 billion, five-year project to boost the U.S.’s hypersonic testing capabilities. With the latest launch award, Rocket Lab has now secured a total of seven HASTE missions for MACH-TB, underscoring its reliable launch cadence. Critically, Rocket Lab’s U.S.-based, non-China-linked ecosystem is a major asset in an era where national security, tech sovereignty and supply-chain resilience are top priorities. Although there is remarkable progress in the U.S.-China relations, geopolitical setups are never fully reliable and remain a wildcard. So, it is reassuring for investors to know that Rocket Lab is well aligned with Western defense and aerospace priorities. The company sees its current backlog for Electron and HASTE to support a higher average selling price for missions for through 2025 vs. 2024, powering continued gross margin expansion. Non GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 33.4%, above its guidance of 30% to 32%, and is seen expanding to 34% to 36% for the second quarter. On June 30, 2025, Rocket Lab joined the Russell 1000 Growth Index, prompting a wave of passive fund rebalancing worth $200 billion as index-tracking ETFs snapped up RKLB shares. The stock is up 30% from its June 30, closing price of $35.77. Whether Rocket Lab stock will continue to rise, hinges on a successful Neutron launch, and seamless execution of its end-to-end space platform strategy. So far, everything seems to be going right with Neutron. Neutron’s inclusion in the Pentagon’s $5.6 billion National Security Space Launch program is a validation of its strategic alignment with U.S. defense and space priorities, and a potential springboard into high-value defense missions. Neutron is being designed for reuse and frequent launches, which is a critical advancement in space tech that the Department of Defense (DOD) appears highly supportive of. As an endorsement for Neutron’s return-to-Earth capabilities, the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has selected Neutron for a mission that supports its broader initiative to explore point-to-point cargo transportation using commercial launch vehicles. The mission will focus on returning payloads to Earth, and is scheduled to fly no earlier than 2026. Rocket Lab has signed a multi-launch agreement with an unnamed commercial satellite constellation operator, under which it will launch two dedicated missions on Neutron starting from mid-2026. The deal marks the start of what could become a larger collaboration, with Neutron likely to play a central role in launching the full constellation. All this interest in Neutron from Government and private customers, while it is still in the pre-launch phase - ups the ante significantly. Neutron has successfully completed its second stage qualification campaign — a major milestone that validates its design, operations and launch readiness for later this year. Rocket Lab said it conducted launch-like operations across the full stack, including flight software, hardware, avionics, and guidance, navigation and control systems. The stage was also proof-tested to more than 25% of its design load, including applying more than 1.3 million pounds of force and tension across the carbon composite structure. Neutron’s Stage 2 is a novel design compared to traditional rockets. Instead of being supported from the bottom, Stage 2 is suspended from the top of Stage 1’s tank, enabling a very lightweight structure. Retiring the risk associated with this novel configuration early on was a strategic priority. Stage 2’s structural design closely mirrors that of Stage 1, so this successful test campaign also helped de-risk critical elements of the first stage. Per Rocket Lab’s earnings call in May, Neutron Stage 2 is now going through final assembly and will be shipped to the launch site in the next few months in preparation for stage testing with the engine. Neutron’s Stage 1 upper module is also nearing completion. It integrates some of the most complex mechanical systems on the rocket, all of which are expected to perform seamlessly in testing. While most of Neutron is assembled at Rocket Lab’s facilities, the vehicle is shipped in segments to the Launch Complex 3 in Virginia, where it is integrated as a full rocket. The good news is construction at Launch Complex 3 is on schedule and nearing completion. The challenge is the launch site — the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia — has limited maritime infrastructure, and access through the shallow Sloop Gut channel is possible only during favorable tides. Rocket Lab is exploring a workaround with plans for dredging the channel so barges can deliver the segments more reliably. And yes, Rocket Lab still expects to launch Neutron in the second half of this year. Rocket Lab’s plan to build an end-to-end space company is key to its ability to win large-value contracts, so it is imperative that the plans succeed. A key part of this strategy is its pending acquisition of Mynaric, a German company specializing in laser-based satellite communication systems. The deal expands Rocket Lab’s footprint into Europe, and provides access to European programs and growth opportunities. The acquisition is a natural fit: Mynaric already supplies CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals to Rocket Lab under its $515 million Space Development Agency (SDA) contract to produce 18 satellites for the Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta. Mynaric is also involved in other SDA contracts and shares many clients with Rocket Lab spanning commercial constellation operators, prime contractors and defense and civil government agencies. Rocket Lab plans to scale production and improve efficiencies within Mynaric’s manufacturing process, bolstering its ability to deliver optical terminals on time and on budget. The move should position Rocket Lab to support a broader range of future SDA and defense initiatives. On the spacecraft side, Rocket Lab’s Pioneer spacecraft has already launched three missions for Varda Space Industries, supporting in-space pharmaceutical manufacturing and rapid reentry operations. The third mission for Varda was launched within 15 days after the successful return of Varda’s second mission, demonstrating Rocket Lab’s ability to maintain high-cadence launch and reentry space missions. Meanwhile, integration and testing for a fourth and final Pioneer spacecraft is in the works. New product launches like STARRAY, a plug and play, low-cost line of modular solar arrays to meet the power needs of satellites operating in any orbital conditions, are gaining traction with customers. Rocket Lab has also expanded its suite of Frontier satellite radios that are compatible with the industry’s most important global ground stations. The company has also launched the next generation versions of its popular MAX software packages for satellite guidance and control. Rocket Lab’s MAX software supported the successful Moon landing of Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 earlier this year. The MAX software suite is also utilized in both NASA's CAPSTONE mission and DARPA's Blackjack program, as well as in Rocket Lab’s own Pioneer spacecraft for its Varda missions. So, the vertical integration plan appears to be proceeding smoothly. As Rocket Lab gears up to compete on a larger scale, comparisons with industry giant SpaceX are inevitable. SpaceX claims that it represents approximately 80% of the payload mass launched in orbit. Rocket Lab, by contrast, has focused on launching smaller satellites and payloads, but is aiming to facilitate bigger payloads with Neutron. Neutron will be a few tons below the payload capacity of Space X’s Falcon 9, but a Neutron launch is estimated to cost customers an estimated $50-55 million compared to the $67 million price tag for a Falcon 9 launch. On a per-kilogram basis, the cost is more-or-less the same for both. The company expects Neutron launch margins of approximately 50%, with the cost per Neutron launch estimated between $20 million and $25 million. Rocket Lab anticipates flying each reusable Neutron booster 10 to 20 times, comparable with the reuse cadence of a Falcon 9 booster. For long-term, growth-oriented investors, Rocket Lab offers strong upside, subject to achieving key milestones. Some catalysts include: Steep valuation vs. opportunity: Bloomberg recently reported that SpaceX is preparing for an insider share sale that would value the company at around $400 billion, which is nearly 20x bigger than Rocket Lab’s $22.5 billion market cap. Even with a modest narrowing of this enormous valuation gap, the potential upside for Rocket Lab stock could be substantial. Neutron could unlock a larger total addressable market: If Neutron succeeds in the medium lift segment, Rocket Lab could unlock a sizable, multi-billion total addressable market over the next decade, paving the path to profitability and leaving room for further stock upside. Minimal tariff exposure: Rocket Lab’s Electron rockets are made in New Zealand and launched from there. Very few of its Electron launches happen outside of New Zealand. So, the tariff exposure is minimal in its Electron launch business. Rocket Lab’s Space Systems business is intensively domestically sourced. Most manufacturing happens in the U.S., and what is not manufactured in the U.S. still entails high U.S. involvement. Rocket Lab has its manufacturing intensity largely aligned to geographies with minimal tariff exposure. This factor is also key to procuring defense contracts ruled by national security concerns. Increasing launch cadence, a clear path to government-aligned revenue streams, a bold yet calculated bet on the Neutron rocket, strategic vertical integration and a growing backlog give Rocket Lab a foundation that many other space stocks still lack. This suggests that RKLB’s 800% rally over the past year is not merely rooted in hype. That said, the stock’s current valuation, with much of the investor optimism already priced in, leaves little room for missteps. A lot hinges on Rocket Lab’s ability to evolve its revenue model and reach sustained profitability. At current levels, the stock has already hit the upper range of analyst price targets, making it more of a Hold than a Buy for now.

Title: Is It Too Late To Buy MicroStrategy Stock Now After Soaring Over 100% In A Year?

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Rather than timing the market, focus on whether MicroStrategy's leveraged bitcoin strategy aligns ... More with your investment goals and risk capacity. MicroStrategy (MSTR) has become one of the most polarizing stocks on Wall Street, delivering explosive returns that have left investors wondering whether they've missed the boat. With gains ranging from 58% to 176% over the past year, depending on the measurement period, and year-to-date performance soaring between 140-143%, the company's transformation from a traditional business intelligence firm into what Executive Chairman Michael Saylor calls a "Bitcoin Treasury Company" has created unprecedented volatility and opportunity. The question facing investors today isn't whether MicroStrategy has been successful – the numbers speak for themselves. Instead, the question is whether the stock's meteoric rise has created an unsustainable bubble or if there's still room for growth. With shares trading at $435.60 and a market capitalization approaching $122 billion, MicroStrategy now commands a valuation that dwarfs many established tech giants, making this decision all the more critical for potential investors. MicroStrategy's extraordinary performance is directly attributed to its bold bet on bitcoin, which has fundamentally altered the company's risk-return profile. The company now holds approximately 592,000 bitcoin worth roughly $70 billion, making it a leveraged play on cryptocurrency rather than a traditional software business. This massive bitcoin treasury has created a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.93 with bitcoin returns, meaning the stock moves almost in lockstep with the world's largest cryptocurrency. The stock's recent surge has been amplified by MicroStrategy's aggressive acquisition strategy, including a July 2025 purchase of 4,225 additional bitcoin that brought total holdings above 600,000 coins. Each bitcoin purchase serves as a catalyst, often triggering immediate stock price reactions from investors who view these moves as validation of the company's strategy and a sign of confidence in bitcoin's long-term prospects. Today's MicroStrategy operates as a hybrid entity that straddles two vastly different business models. While the company still maintains its original business intelligence and analytics software operations, these traditional revenue streams have been overshadowed by the massive bitcoin holdings that now define the company's value proposition. The original software business continues generating revenue, but investors largely ignore these fundamentals in favor of bitcoin exposure. The company's financial structure reflects this transformation, with a beta of approximately 3.7 indicating extreme volatility compared to the broader market. MicroStrategy has funded its bitcoin acquisitions through a combination of debt financing and equity issuance, with outstanding shares increasing 42% year-over-year to roughly 279 million. This aggressive capital-raising approach has enabled continued bitcoin accumulation but has also introduced significant dilution risk for existing shareholders. Determining MicroStrategy's fair value has become increasingly complex as traditional valuation metrics have become less reliable. The company trades at a significant premium to the net asset value of its bitcoin holdings, with a $122 billion market cap exceeding the $70 billion value of its cryptocurrency treasury by a substantial margin. Critics argue that this premium creates a dangerous bubble, particularly considering the company's lack of profitability, with earnings per share ranging from a negative $22.22 to negative $25. The valuation challenge is compounded by MicroStrategy's transformation into what's essentially a bitcoin investment vehicle with software revenue on the side. Investors are paying not just for bitcoin exposure but for Michael Saylor's ability to continue acquiring cryptocurrency through creative financing structures. Whether this premium is justified depends primarily on one's view of bitcoin's future trajectory and MicroStrategy's ability to execute effectively in leveraging traditional capital markets for cryptocurrency accumulation. Wall Street analysts remain divided on MicroStrategy's prospects, reflecting the broader uncertainty surrounding both the company's unique business model and the future of bitcoin. The stock's extreme volatility and unconventional structure make it challenging for traditional equity analysts to apply standard valuation frameworks. Many analysts focus more on bitcoin price targets and MicroStrategy's ability to continue its accumulation strategy rather than conventional metrics, such as revenue growth or profit margins. The upcoming July 31, 2025, earnings announcement, after the market close, represents a key catalyst that could provide clarity on the company's financial health and future bitcoin acquisition plans. Recent moves, including the issuance of $1 billion in preferred shares with 10% annual non-cumulative dividends, have been viewed as accretive by some analysts, who see it as a creative way to fund further bitcoin purchases while providing yield to income-focused investors. Supporters argue that MicroStrategy remains undervalued relative to its long-term potential, particularly if bitcoin continues its adoption trajectory among institutional investors and potentially governments. The company's first-mover advantage in corporate bitcoin adoption has created a unique position that would be difficult for competitors to replicate, especially given the regulatory uncertainties and board-level resistance typically found at most traditional corporations. The bull case also emphasizes MicroStrategy's innovative financing strategies, which have allowed the company to accumulate bitcoin without selling existing holdings. The recent preferred shares offering demonstrates management's creativity in accessing capital markets, potentially providing a sustainable model for continued accumulation. Technical indicators support this optimism, with the stock trading above all major moving averages and an RSI of approximately 58 suggesting room for further gains. Furthermore, MicroStrategy's massive bitcoin treasury creates inherent optionality value. As bitcoin gains wider acceptance or regulatory clarity improves, the company's holdings could benefit from multiple expansion beyond just cryptocurrency price appreciation. The leverage inherent in the stock structure means that modest gains in bitcoin translate into amplified returns for equity holders. The bear case centers on valuation concerns and the inherent risks associated with MicroStrategy's leverage-heavy strategy. Trading at a significant premium to its net bitcoin value while generating losses from operations suggests that the market has already priced in optimistic bitcoin scenarios. The company's 3.7 beta indicates that any bitcoin downturn will be magnified, potentially resulting in devastating losses for shareholders who purchase at current elevated levels. The bear case isn’t just about valuation or leverage—it’s about bubble risk. MicroStrategy trades at a substantial premium to its bitcoin holdings, reflecting aggressive bullish expectations that assume the crypto market continues to surge. However, the core argument against Bitcoin—that it’s a speculative bubble—has been raised by many, including Nobel laureates such as Robert Shiller, Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman, and others. Even a moderate 20% drop in bitcoin could wipe out billions and trigger margin calls, magnified by MSTR’s 3.7 beta, making losses far steeper. And as the bitcoin bubble bursts, MSTR’s share count may continue rising—its 42% YoY dilution could erode any remaining equity value. Structural concerns about dilution present another significant risk factor. The company's reliance on equity and debt issuance to fund bitcoin purchases means existing shareholders face continuous dilution risk. The 42% year-over-year increase in share count demonstrates how quickly this dilution can occur, potentially erasing gains even if bitcoin appreciates modestly. The concentration risk cannot be ignored either. Unlike diversified bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy offers no protection against company-specific risks, management missteps, or regulatory challenges that could specifically target corporate bitcoin holders. The stock's correlation with bitcoin means that investors gain cryptocurrency exposure, but with additional corporate and operational risks layered on top. Your decision should start with an honest assessment of your bitcoin outlook and risk tolerance. If you believe bitcoin will significantly outperform over your investment horizon, MicroStrategy's leverage structure could amplify those gains. However, this same leverage works in reverse during downturns, making the stock unsuitable for risk-averse investors or those with short-term investment horizons. Consider your existing cryptocurrency exposure as well. MicroStrategy functions as a leveraged bitcoin play, so investors already holding bitcoin or crypto-related assets may inadvertently be concentrating their portfolio risk. The stock's extreme volatility requires firm conviction and the ability to withstand potentially significant short-term losses. Time horizon plays a crucial role in this decision. Short-term traders face the challenge of timing both bitcoin moves and MicroStrategy's premium expansion or contraction. Long-term investors should focus on whether they believe the company's bitcoin accumulation strategy will create sustainable value over multiple market cycles, while also considering the ongoing dilution risk from future equity issuances. Bottom Line MicroStrategy represents one of the most unique investment opportunities in today's market – a leveraged play on bitcoin wrapped in a traditional corporate structure. While the stock's 100%+ annual gains suggest significant upside has been realized, the investment thesis remains intact for those bullish on bitcoin's long-term prospects. However, the premium valuation, dilution risks and extreme volatility make this investment suitable only for investors with a high risk tolerance and firm conviction in the future of cryptocurrency. Rather than timing the market, focus on whether MicroStrategy's leveraged bitcoin strategy aligns with your investment goals and risk capacity.

Title: Australia & Japan Are Seemingly Having Second Thoughts About the De Facto Asian NATO

Yves here. American abuse of its supposed strategic allies has gotten to be so severe and inexcusable that some are having debates in political circles and the media about why they are continuing to accept this treatment. It’s as if the abusive husband intensified his wife-beating even as his income was shrinking due to bad career moves. Admittedly, the US has been engaged in a stunning show of disrespect and preening sense of entitlement towards Europe, so there’s every reason to see if the US can pull the same stunt on the Pacific Rim. The US harmed all of Europe by promising it would do whatever it takes to beat Russia in Ukraine in a conflict the US sought, drained NATO members of weapons stocks and EU states via non-military Ukraine assistance, and harmed Europe and most of all Germany by blowing up the Nordstream pipeline. But to add insult to injury, the Trump team has threatened the EU with further harm via sanctions while acting as if Europe should further subsidize the US by buying US weapons to continue Project Ukraine, rather than let them derive some modest benefit from continued war-mongering by fabricating their own arms. Now this pattern is obviously self-destructive, but there’s at least an explanation, which is the Iron Law of Institutions. The US exerts considerable influence in EU institutions and the NGOs that are career ladders and safety nets for pols and bureaucrats. So they see upside in playing nicely with the US and risk if they don’t. My sense is that while there is, or was, fear of crossing the US among its soi-disant Asian and antipodean allies, the upside is more limited. The Andrew Korybko piece below focuses on a fresh bit of US cheek, in the barely-coded demand by Under Secretary of Defense Eldridge Colby to Japanese and Australian official to pre-commit to assisting the US if things get ugly in its planned escalation with China. Although space prevents us from giving the full context, Japan and Australia were already souring on the US before the latest demand, Renegotiating such complicated relationships won’t happen quickly, but the fact that both countries are debating whether the US is worth its ever rising price is a seismic shift. For Japan, Trump’s trade thuggery has been a slap in the face, and the US shows no interest in repairing the damage. Alienating Japan is even more epically stupid than alienating Canada, since Japan is richer and in a more geopolitically important location. Unlike the EU, Japan has also been uncomfortable with its status as a military protectorate1 but has lacked an internal consensus as to what if anything to do about it. When Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs, Japan made a point of being one of the first to enter into talks. As former ambassador Chas Freeman recounted it, the Japanese were shocked to find the US completely unprepared, with no proposals as to what it might provide Japan and what it might expect in return, and instead thuggishly asked Japan what it was prepared to offer to escape US tariff punishment. If you have ever worked with the Japanese, they are extremely loath to complain or argue. The fact that many officials are now sharply criticizing US conduct means they are incandescent. The depth of the souring on the US is confirmed by media reports that Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea were discussing how to coordinate trade talk strategies against the US. I am pretty sure the translation below was sanitized. The key word reported elsewhere was “gangster”. Note that this was the head of the opposition party and the ruling LPD just suffered its biggest setback in 70 years in upper house elections, with the government’s poor performance in the trade negotiations cited as a big, if not the, reason: This Japanese MP (whose name is Shinji Oguma) absolutely nails it, and reflects what pretty all countries in Asia are thinking: pic.twitter.com/U1jZahc5Sh “When Japan negotiates with what [Trump] is saying it’s akin to being extorted by a delinquent.

But how one does it matters because allies have domestic politics, face, agency — and yes, choices. pic.twitter.com/LIC1KgC5fQ — Rush Doshi (@RushDoshi) July 12, 2025 Now to Australia. The disgraceful AUKUS submarine deal was a massive sellout to the US. For an overview, a section from a 2023 cross post by Prabir Purkayastha: The recent Australia, U.S., and UK $368 billion deal on buying nuclear submarines has been termed by Paul Keating, a former Australian prime minister, as the “worst deal in all history.” It commits Australia to buy conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines that will be delivered in the early 2040s. These will be based on new nuclear reactor designs yet to be developed by the UK. Meanwhile, starting from the 2030s, “pending approval from the U.S. Congress, the United States intends to sell Australia three Virginia class submarines, with the potential to sell up to two more if needed” (Trilateral Australia-UK-U.S. Partnership on Nuclear-Powered Submarines, March 13, 2023; emphasis mine). According to the details, it appears that this agreement commits Australia to buy from the U.S. eight new nuclear submarines, to be delivered from the 2040s through the end of the 2050s. If nuclear submarines were so crucial for Australia’s security, for which it broke its existing diesel-powered submarine deal with France, this agreement provides no credible answers. For those who have been following the nuclear proliferation issues, the deal raises a different red flag. If submarine nuclear reactor technology and weapons-grade (highly enriched) uranium are shared with Australia, it is a breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to which Australia is a signatory as a non-nuclear power. Even the supplying of such nuclear reactors by the U.S. and the UK would constitute a breach of the NPT. This is even if such submarines do not carry nuclear but conventional weapons as stated in this agreement. So why did Australia renege on its contract with France, which was to buy 12 diesel submarines from France at a cost of $67 billion, a small fraction of its gargantuan $368 billion deal with the U.S.? What does it gain, and what does the U.S. gain by annoying France, one of its close NATO allies? And as Satyajit Das noted: American willingness or ability to support allies, other than with financial assistance and low risk stand-off weaponry, is questionable. Outside of minor affairs like Panama and Granada, the US record in military combat is unimpressive. For Australians tied to the US and UK through the opaque 2021 AUKUS defence agreement, the possibility of being drawn into a military conflict with China and the prospect of the American cavalry not reporting for duty is a clear concern. The parallel to Great Britain’s abandonment of Australia during the World War 2 is striking. The criticism has become even more fierce as new bad facts are coming out, including a campaign to exit AUKUS: Australia “could sacrifice sovereignty” in AUKUS alignment, says Former FM #opinions pic.twitter.com/QVf3kdPVHb — T-House (@thouse_opinions) July 15, 2025 You thought the toxic nuclear submarines were the worst part of AUKUS. It gets worse… much worse. pic.twitter.com/DEsX0fQn8y — David Shoebridge (@DavidShoebridge) July 10, 2025 Nuclear waste costs are expected to double the already nosebleed level price tag. As the Michael West site explains (which ample detail): Everything about AUKUS nuclear waste is a political secret, including the cost, which will more than double the $368B announced AUKUS price tag. Former submariner Rex Patrick with the story. If we ever get these subs, the total price tag may well be over $1 trillion. I’m in the Federal Court at present, trying to pry open a November 2023 report into how the Government intends to deal with the high-level nuclear waste from AUKUS submarines. But there’s already a lot we can deduce by combining what has been extracted from the Government using Freedom of Information (FOI) laws, from Senate testimony and also looking at how the United States does and doesn’t take care of its naval nuclear waste. For starters, there was a short but insightful exchange in Senate Estimates last year between Senator Lidia Thorpe and the head of the Australian Submarine Agency (ASA), Admiral Jonathon Mead. After making quick reference to the cost of nuclear waste facilities overseas, Senator Thorpe asked about the waste costs for AUKUS, “There’s no costing as yet; is that right?” Mead responded, “That’s correct”. For an organisation that is required to cost its capability from cradle to grave, including support facilities, it’s a huge omission. It might be the case that they’re too frightened to do the math We’ll see if the backbenchers have enough support to move the leadership: Rank-and-file Labor members in Victoria are preparing to launch a blistering attack on US president Donald Trump and demand the Albanese government withdraw from AUKUS.https://t.co/gBfNxeG8Xe — Financial Review (@FinancialReview) July 22, 2025 Now to the main event. By Andrew Korybko, a Moscow-based American political analyst who specializes in the global systemic transition to multipolarity in the New Cold War. He has a PhD from MGIMO, which is under the umbrella of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Originally published at his website Playing any role in a Sino-US war over Taiwan, even a logistical one, could provoke Chinese retaliation. The Financial Times reported that US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby recently asked Australian and Japanese defense officials how their countries would respond to a war over Taiwan. He also asked them to boost defense spending after NATO just agreed to do so during its latest summit. Colby lent credence to this report by tweeting that he’s “focused on implementing the President’s America First, common sense agenda of restoring deterrence and achieving peace through strength.” This sequence shows that Trump 2.0 is serious about “Pivoting (back) to (East) Asia” in order to more robustly contain China. This requires freezing the Ukrainian Conflict and assembling a de facto Asian NATO, however, both of which are uncertain. As regards the first, Trump is being drawn into “mission creep”, while the latter is challenged by Australia’s and Japan’s reluctance to step up. To elaborate, they seemingly expected the US to do all the “heavy lifting”, just like NATO expected till recently as well. That would explain why they didn’t have a clear answer to Colby’s inquiry about how their countries would respond to a war over Taiwan. Simply put, they likely never planned to do anything at all, thus exposing the shallowness of the de facto Asian NATO that the US has sought to assemble in recent years via the AUKUS+ format. This refers to the AUKUS trilateral of Australia, the UK, and the US alongside what can be described as the honorary members of Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan. Australia and Japan are correspondingly envisaged as this informal bloc’s Southeast and Northeast Asian anchors, yet they’re evidently unwilling to fulfill the military roles that their US senior partner expects. What it apparently had in mind was them at the very least playing supportive logistical roles in the scenario of a Sino-US war but their representatives reportedly didn’t even suggest as much to Colby. This in turn reveals that they fear retaliation from China even if they don’t participate in combat. Japan’s population and resultant economic density make it extremely vulnerable to Chinese missile strikes while unconventional warfare could be waged against Australia through sabotage and the like. Moreover, China is their top trade partner, which opens up additional avenues for retaliation. At the same time, however, neither of them wants China to seize control of Taiwan’s TSMC (if it even survives a speculative conflict) and obtain a monopoly over the global semiconductor industry. The US doesn’t want that either, but the problem is that the two envisaged anchors of its de facto Asian NATO aren’t willing to boost defense spending nor seemingly assist America in a war over Taiwan. That’s unacceptable from Trump 2.0’s perspective so tariff and other forms of pressure could be applied for coercing Australia and Japan into at least spending more on their armed forces. The endgame, however, is for them to agree to play some sort of role (whether logistical or ideally combative) in that scenario. Seeing as how the US won’t relent on its “Pivot (back) to (East) Asia”, it’ll likely coerce the aforesaid concessions from Australia and Japan one way or another. The same goes for the other members of AUKUS+, namely South Korea, the Philippines, and Taiwan, albeit with perhaps a little less defense spending from the last two. All in all, “The US Is Rounding Up Allies Ahead Of A Possible War With China” as was assessed in May 2023, but it’s anyone’s guess whether it actually plans to spark a major conflict. ____ 1 Depending on who is doing the grading, Japan’s self defense force ranks between number five and number 8 in military power. An important white paper argued for increasing defense spending from 1% of GDP to 2% by 2027. That damned stupid nuke sub deal. Of course that happened when Scotty from Marketing was Prime Minister and I think that he got a kick from doing the dirty on the French. Last I heard, he got a job with an American think tank. For both Japan and Oz – as well as all those other Asian countries – is that the demands never stop. The US wants logistical support which is fair enough. But then it wants those nations to confront China. Then it wants all those countries to hand over 5% of their GDP to the MIC which would mean buying US weaponry, even if it means all those countries will have their economies wrecked. Now the US is demanding that if the US goes to war against China, that it wants Japan and Oz to sign up as well. And that would mean that we would be dependent on an erratic, mercurial and unpredictable Trump regime to decide for us if we go to war or not. Maybe that is why our present PM went on that trade mission to China. Trying to get some sort of balance and smooth relations. So what other demands will Washington be making the next three and a half years? I hate to think. Putting my tin foil hat on, I would make an observation about those nuclear wastes. I think that in the end that they will store those nuclear wastes here in Oz. More than that, the US will lean on Oz to store their nuclear wastes too for a nominal rent as it is contentious subject in the US. I once read this American official suggest that as the uranium came from Oz originally, then Oz had a responsibility to take it back in its end form for long term storage. That argument goes nowhere. That is like saying that if the US imports coal from Canada to burn in the US, then Canada has a responsibility to take back that coal ash and any pollution as well. But you can bet that there are some in DC eyeing Oz as a destination for all that nuclear waste accumulating in the US. I think the US and UK subs will ‘just happen to be in Australia’ when it’s time to dump their waste. There’s tons of waste stuck in Portsmouth the UK doesn’t know what to do with for their useless subs. I always thought it was all about the nuclear waste disposal. The rest was face-saving window dressing for the Australian public. The date for delivery of these subs is so far away, that if it happens, I will be very surprised. Morrison allowed the US to white ant our security organisations while our minds were on COVID, this was on purpose. This was at the time he and Hurley tried to finagle the Federal Executive Council on the quiet. US defence installations here are visible to all but their security takeover is not. The US is on the wrong side of history and our deep state intends for us to go down this road with them, the only real impediment is the Gaza genocide, Marles and others are supporting the Israelis on the quiet but there is a huge resistance to this here which could derail their plans. Make no mistake, the US is sizing up Australia and Japan to be the next US proxies in a war against China – just as Ukraine has been used and abused as a proxy in a US war against Russia. Australians need to learn a lesson from Germany and the destruction of the Nordstream Pipeline. THIS is how America treats a loyal ally. And don’t think this situation is especially bad because it is Trump. Nordstream was planned and executed by the Biden Administration, as was the war in Ukraine. Take it from an American, neither party is trustworthy. If we don’t have a nuclear war, China will continue to rise and the US and Europe will continue to decline. Australia needs to hitch its horse to the winning team and its best trading partner. And for the record, China has no interest in invading Australia unless the US starts shooting nuclear weapons from its shores. The neocons and other Washington elite seem to taken the American allies (really vassal states) for granted. It was inevitable that there would be some type of backlash, owing to the abuse that they were taking. The AUKUS deal occurred during Biden and burned both the French, but later as they learned the hard way, also the Australians themselves. Not discussed in the article in as much depth is how AUKUS is worsening tensions with China. I think that many other nations are going to realize that they are not junior partners for the US, but just another colony for the US elites to exploit. Trump’s tariffs may have been the last straw for some, on top of the neocons before him that made various demands of the US vassals, such as joining the US in Iraq. The same is true about the war in Ukraine, which the US provoked to try to break up Russia. The Europeans thought that they would be a junior partner and get some part of looting Russia, once it got regime changed. Of course Russia is winning in Ukraine, while Europe suffers from loss of industry, international reputation, and living standards. The war in Ukraine was never in Europe’s interests, but their corrupt leaders went along with it. They should have done a rapprochement with Russia at the end of the Cold War. On the morality front, the US wars in Iraq, when the US lied about Saddam having WMDs, and now genocide in Palestine, by backing its proxy Israel, have damaged America’s image irreparably. I suspect that the truth about Ukraine will as well someday. It’s a loss of soft power. As the US continues to decline, and the upside of complying with US demands becomes smaller, we are going to see more of this. The US doesn’t have the industrial base, nor the military strength, and increasingly does not have the world’s best technologies to offer other nations. As the US middle class declines, the US consumer market is not as lucrative an export market anymore. The world no longer aspires to be like the US. That’s a function of the evil actions that the American elite have done around the world and the falling living standards within the US itself. Hopefully in the future, the corrupt politicians who betrayed their nations by bending the knee to Washington will be held to account in their nations and face trials, along with other legal consequences. What’s astounding is how self-inflicted America’s problems are. The US elite of this generation will go down as some of the least competent leaders in history. They were as incompetent as they were evil. That will be their final historical judgement. Can guarantee the UK won’t bandon the US. The entire political class (including Reform) are completely beholding to them. I think a part of the british elite actually lives vicariously through the american elite and their empire. You have read my mind. I got that idea from reading Churchill. Some of his post war writings give the strong impression he felt Britain was “passing” on responsibility for the world to America. And as the USA was really a descendent of Britain in his view then that meant Britain wasn’t really losing it’s place. Self induldgent nonsense really, but I think that is a view that the british elite have, at least subconsciously. Part of it might have come from the fact that he had an American mother. The right wing LNP coalition, often thought of as simply the political wing of Newscorp in Australia, immediately demanded that the centrist ruling ALP commit to fighting in Taiwan. This without the USA itself committing to it. Australians have suffered 40 years of propaganda and social engineering to make it US militarism-friendly. Australians are isolated from their political system and riven by mindless culture wars. We are prime fodder for a proxy war. The ALP has a history of internal coups to create US-friendly administrations, the first in the mid 70s and the last in 2010 where the wikileaks showed that the prime minister was ousted for not being US friendly enough in refusing to join the quad or to have a US garrison in our northernmost port. His replacement, duly signed off on by the US embassy, immediately joined the quad and let the marines in. Australians are so divorced from reality that when told that the marines were simply a ‘rotational force’ they accepted it, obviously thinking other US bases have the troops sent there for life. The AUKUS deal has just as much to do with giving our military bases to the USA as it has to do with subs. Since 1996 massive emphasis has been placed in the Australian Defence Force on ‘interoperability’ to the point it is now a provincial arm of the US military with funny accents. Doctrine, equipment and logistics is steadily being replaced with US versions. Ask an member of the military. Australians will line up for their war, they believe the newspapers. They’ll especially line up for it if the happens to be a serendipitous and precipitous downturn in the economy as has happened in Europe to create a pool of ready (hungry) recruits. Australia is the stationary aircraft carrier in the S-W Pacific wholly owned by the USA. The only real essential to its US masters being Pine Gap. The other US bases and infrastructure are just performative and for a show of strength to Asia, as any next war is, as we are seeing in the Middle East, about rocketry delivering “kinetic” payloads. A consideration that rarely gets mentioned is the obscurely named Force Posture Agreement (FPA) https://johnmenadue.com/post/2023/05/what-is-the-us-australia-force-posture-agreement-fpa/. Vassalisation complete. 94% of Australians polled as opposed to the war in Iraq, a number that simply does not exist in poling. 250,000 protested in Sydney, as in over 5% of its population then of 4 million. But to your point, when Australia (liberal John Howard) joined the coalition of the willing, Australia fell in line. The continued grumbling was minimal, although ABC and SBS did cover in great detail how horrific conditions were for Iraqis, like the looting of hospitals and severe limits on electricity (only a few hours a day). These days watching SBS is like watching a cross between Fox News and CNN. I use to watch them for the news. These days I watch it to see what the agreed upon narrative is. Australia has dutifully followed the US into every war it could since WWII. And never gets tired of reminding them. Woe betide the 1st PM not to commit to the next one. Former PM Morrison’s AUKUS brain fart was, for him first and foremost an election ploy. It was intended that he would sign the docs in person alongside a US President then call an election. Unfortunately Covid meant he got a Zoom meeting instead. Still he got a job out of it. Lobbying with fellow evangelical and neocon & former director of the CIA Mike Pompeo. Oh, so *that’s* why they pushed out Rudd, the best Prime Minister you’ve had in ages. Thanks for explaining. (Rudd speaks fluent Mandarin.) This is more Making Shit Up. I was in Australia for a few years before Rudd became PM. I had been a fan and was shocked at how quickly he imploded. He had been a brilliant opposition leader and quickly started flailing about as PM. He was a more charismatic and articulate Jimmy Carter, a bad administrator by virtue of being a micromanager. He had less excuse than Carter by virtue of not being an outsider. He was self-destructing all on his own. The real question is whether, when the shooting starts, these US “allies (with plenty of well-earned hate-America reasons)” show up. My guess is not. Andrew K. doesn’t opine. China has never been an existential threat to Japan (well at least until that pesky genocide from 1937-45, lol) The invasion of Japan by “China” was when China was ruled/occupied by a Mongol elite. Of course PRC wants to expand its sphere of economic influence, but China is never going to “Red Dawn” Japan…even if Japan is involved in a Taiwan conflict. The US creates the instability it ostensibly seeks to prevent by placing its mlilitary within a lazy 60 min. flight’s radius of China in Korea and Japan True, but this doesn’t stop the Japanese media from constantly spreading fear about China and especially the DPRK. I would say that the sources of instability are: (1) The CCP’s obsession with territorial expansion — with Taiwan, which historically was never Chinese — let it go, guys — with Tibet — with Xinkiang — with Hong Kong — with the South China Sea. You have enough land, dudes, stop being so obsessive about having more. This behavior appears threatening to everyone, including Vietnam, the Phillipines, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, Laos, literally everyone. (2) The Kim dynasty’s desire to stay in power in North Korea despite having grotesquely mismanaged the economy to the point where they need repeated bailouts (alternating bailouts from China and Russia), and refusal to normalize relations with anyone or take a South Korean bailout. This is why the US is still stationed in South Korea. This is serious Making Shit Up, which is a violation of our written site Policies. Did you miss that Hong Kong was always part of China and only leased to the UK? China DID lose a lot of cred in the international community with their heavy handed takeover. But their right to Hong Kong is not at issue. As for Taiwan, Xi had expressed only a vague aspiration that Taiwan rejoin China by 2049. The increase in Chinese incomes relative to Taiwan would have led more Taiwanese over time to seek jobs in China (there is already some employment of Taiwanese in China) and could have achieved normalization all on its own. It’s the US that escalated, threatened by China’s ever increasing military and economic power and realizing if it were to act, 2027 was probably the latest time the US had. I am now in Southeast Asia and have a much better view than before of how aggressive Chinese businessmen very much cut the pie in their favor. The Chinese are hard core mercantilists. But that does not make everything they do unwarranted. I admit I know too little about this, but I’m wondering if, in case the Australians wanted to push back they could use Pine Gap or the Harold E. Holt joint naval communication station as leverage… somehow. Last time we tried it Mi6/CIA with the help of our own secret services ASIO overthrew the prime minister in an internal coup. Ugh, that’s terrible. :-( Thanks, James! Will look into this more. I did find this website that discusses both sites in some detail: https://nautilus.org/publications/books/australian-forces-abroad/defence-facilities/pine-gap/pine-gap-intro/ Great stuff this. It is getting more and more interesting…finally at least a bit of disagreement with the US from the East Asian vassals. Shinji Oguma summed it up. Will it all blow over, or get worse? Looks like the latter. Just an indulgent thought: what if ROK or Japan politely told the US to piss off and announced the cessation of all future SOFA (Status of Forces) agreements with the US and the eventual evacuation of all US military? What amount of financial and economic pressure could prevent such an event? That would be a historical event…it might take a while but the writing is on the wall. The US would undertake covert action against Japan and/or the ROK, to keep them in line, as it has done in the past. Why do they need covert action if the CIA owns the Liberal Democrats? And I see that extremist nationalist parties are rising in popularity again. Wonder where that came from? And I see that extremist nationalist parties are rising in popularity again. Wonder where that came from? Good question. There was an attempt, right before the election last weekend, to plant the idea of a link between Russia and Sanseito(aka the Japan First party). Wonder where that came from? Deteriorating economic conditions typically produce a rise in right wing support. As you note, the LDP is losing power in the Diet. The Japanese public has become sick of the endless scandals, corruption, dark money, and LDP connections to the whackjob Unification Church. It is entirely possible that Jiminto will become a minority party in the foreseeable future. Some of the other right-wing parties are LDP-adjacent pseudo-opposition, but may not be fully under control of the USian security apparatus. Following an electoral upset, a situation could thus arise in which the mechanisms of control that you suspect are no longer functional. (Btw, I assume this mechanism is also hypothetical, so we can entertain it as a possibility rather than a fact, but do you by chance have any hard evidence of how this mechanism of influence actually works in the present? I mean documents or credible investigative journalism or other hard evidence, i.e., not handwaving?) As Yves points out, above, economic conditions in Japan are deteriorating. Commodity prices are increasing. The price of rice has been at the center of a scandal. Ultra-right-wing parties like Sanseito are speaking to people who feel precarious, worry about food security, and want to blame foreigners. They target low information voters, of which there are many in Japan because media literacy is poor and civil society is weak to non-existent. Otherwise, it’s the usual script, nothing terribly new. This question from JohnnyJames is a hypothetical — i.e., what would happen if the Japanese leadership chose to exit ANPO, and either go it alone or else (another possibility) make peace with China, either of which presupposes that the leadership makes a decision to no longer submit to the American Empire (the “Japan that can say ‘no'”) —, and I submit that the most plausible answer is drawn from history, both in Japan and elsewhere. As John Mearsheimer has noted, the US today really looks like “the gang that can’t shoot straight” so it would make perfect sense for bureaucrats at Kasumigaseki to be quietly drawing up plans for a post-ANPO Japan, whatever that looks like. The other possibility (noted by Michael Hudson, I believe) would be that Japan becomes the Ukraine of East Asia, fighting a proxy war against China on behalf of the Empire. I assume the Japanese bureaucrats are not stupid enough to go down that path, especially given that the future of Ukraine as a nation is today rather in question, but again, a terror campaign against the Japanese public could change more than a few opinions. If China wants Taiwan badly enough, China will get Taiwan. You just have to look at a map. A long delaying action (including nominal acknowledgement of the ‘one China’ policy) is the only sensible Western policy on the matter, and to date China has seemed perfectly willing to preserve the status quo and use it as a bargaining chip. Doing nothing in response to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, as opposed to starting a massive war in the Pacific between global powers that could only end in defeat, would be a rational response. Does anybody really think the US would expend resources to protect Australia if it came under threat in the event of a defeat? Or that it could do so successfully enough to change the outcome, even if it would? Look at Ukraine. Based on past behavior the US would abandon any ally to its fate were it deemed expedient to do so. Given the purely transactional nature of any dealing with Trump and his administration, Japan and Australia … and all the others … should look to their interests. With all those US bases Japan is a big fat target should things get messy. WHat exactly does Australia gain from cozying up to the US? Stalin has been dead 72 years. The Soviet Union expired more than 30 years ago. DPRK has the A Bomb and functioning delivery systems. Their main target is US military sites in East Asian. Local nations should opt for disarmament, including any hint of U.S. nuclear umbrella. US treaty organization in East Asia would soon set very costly standards of self defense. Japan, for example, depends in part on U.S. for leaky missile defense which US in a treaty organization, would demand Japan provide. Japan, ROK and Oz should give non aligned peace a chance. A good round up on this is whether we could say ‘no’ at all with such a large US security presence in-country. https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/with-so-much-local-us-military-presence-can-australia-really-say-no-to-a-war-on-china/ These countries can be better allies by telling America to shut down these crazy unwinnable wars or threats of war/trade wars. But I suspect they cannot, and after a while the only reasonable action for them to take is to reach out to China and form a relationship there more closely aligned to their national interests.

Title: Stocks to Buy | India's Growth Engine: Why small & midcaps will lead the charge

Time Published: 2025-07-22T06:03:48Z
Full Content:
Nilesh Shah of Envision Capital in an interview to ET Now said that India has always been and will continue to be a small and midcap-driven market. While largecaps form the core of a portfolio, he believes that real wealth is created when investors identify and nurture promising companies early. According to him, this space consistently offers greater upside potential for those willing to hold with conviction. Nilesh Shah asserts that stock picking remains an eternal truth in investing. Regardless of whether one is investing in largecaps, midcaps, or smallcaps, careful selection of stocks is vital. He stresses that this principle holds true for all types of investors and professionals, including fund managers and CIOs. In his view, India’s diverse market provides an unmatched canvas for skilled stock pickers. Nilesh Shah points out that India’s market includes over 4,000 to 5,000 listed companies, a result of past conditions where high interest rates and underdeveloped VC/PE ecosystems pushed companies to go public early. He notes that only around 200 qualify as largecaps and a similar number as midcaps, leaving a massive small and microcap base. For Shah, this vast investable universe is a unique strength of the Indian market. According to Nilesh Shah, India’s continued economic growth—6–7% real and around 10% nominal—supports the long-term outperformance of mid and smallcap companies. He argues that as India moves from a $3,000 to $9,000–$10,000 per capita income, these companies are poised to benefit the most. Shah believes short-term corrections are insignificant if one keeps the long-term growth narrative in mind. Nilesh Shah observes that the last few years have seen a historic wave of IPOs, particularly in the mid and smallcap segments. He explains that earlier, many IPOs were premature due to capital constraints, but now companies are entering the market at a more stable stage. For Shah, this evolution has enriched the mid and smallcap ecosystem and created better long-term investment opportunities. Nilesh Shah highlights a major shift post-COVID, where a new class of tech-driven businesses has gone public. From online broking to food delivery and insurance platforms, he notes that these firms are leveraging technology to reach consumers faster and scale efficiently. According to Shah, these developments make the mid and smallcap space increasingly dynamic and future-ready. Nilesh Shah acknowledges that while some IPOs came with high valuations, subsequent corrections have offered buying opportunities. He advises that investors who have done their homework could take advantage of such dips. Although today’s IPOs may not be as attractively priced as in the past, Shah believes they still offer high-quality growth stories for long-term investors. Nilesh Shah concludes that India’s mid and small-cap universe is rich with long-term potential. He urges investors to look beyond short-term volatility and instead focus on structural growth trends, digital transformation, and strategic stock selection. Shah remains confident that these segments will continue to drive market performance over the coming decade.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

QuantumScape stock just took a nosedive — plunging nearly 17% in a single day — leaving investors scrambling for answers. The solid-state battery startup, once hailed as a potential game-changer in the electric vehicle (EV) revolution, had just ridden a massive wave of enthusiasm around its new “Cobra” separator technology. But Monday’s dramatic sell-off shows just how fragile that momentum can be. So, what triggered this sudden reversal, and what does it mean for the future of this high-profile EV battery maker?

International equity ETFs that invest in publicly traded companies have surged this year, posting returns of 20% or more and cementing international funds at the top of the heap of the best performing funds of 2025’s first half. The massive gains were due to overperforming European markets and strong performing sectors in other countries. The outperformance in Europe, relative to both the US and international stocks more broadly, can be attributed to an “increased willingness” for those countries to invest in companies that help drive economic growth, said Zachary Evens, a Morningstar research analyst. “Banks and utilities and industrials and communication service companies, like telecoms, these companies are more boring,” he said. “They don’t typically grow very fast, but they benefit from broad economic growth, so a lot of the outperformance has been concentrated in some of those stocks.” European stocks have outperformed their US counterparts for the past three years, reversing a trend of US dominance that began following the Great Recession, with the MSCI EMU Index outpacing the S&P 500 by more than 35 percentage points since 2022, according to Schwab. International stocks in general have also beaten American stocks, as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index. Some of the top-performing international markets ETFs so far this year are: Still, diversification is key to avoiding region-specific downturns. “If Spain grows by a lot, but France falters, then diversification will even that out… That also goes for the sector side,” said Evens. “You would be better suited to be more diversified across sectors and countries to minimize those negative impacts.” All Hail the Sector. Sector performance tends to be the main driver of stock performance, with US markets leaning heavily on tech companies in recent years. Still, outside factors — inflation, political deals, tariffs — have an impact on sectors, which in turn affects markets, according to Evens. “What impacts the performance of those sectors would be more idiosyncratic risks or geopolitical factors, or economic factors,” he said. “Weighing those is how investors can think about potential outperformance or underperformance of the respective markets.” An ETF from Roundhill Investments trades out of S&P 500 ETFs before dividends are paid, thus avoiding the tax implications. It may be only a matter of time before the Securities and Exchange Commission lets crypto ETFs redeem their digital assets in kind. The business Michael Venuto started over a decade ago has become one of the go-to places for small firms looking to launch ETFs. The asset manager has asked the SEC to make QQQ an open-end fund, which would benefit Invesco and its shareholders. The company’s latest spin on protected Bitcoin investing includes Calamos ETFs that diversify their exposure to a range of Bitcoin funds. The price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $123,000 this week as Congress prepares to vote on landmark crypto legislation. JPMorgan, T. Rowe Price, and Capital Group had some of the top-performing funds of the first half of 2025, according to a recent Morningstar report. A handful of asset managers reported earnings Tuesday. The firm has launched nine total fixed-income ETFs this year. Trump’s media company has filed for a third crypto-focused ETF that would hold Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Cronos and XRP. The agency’s new guidelines focus on disclosures around price fluctuations and market manipulation, among other common concerns. The fund pulled in more than $18 million in assets over two days last week but has seen negligible interest from investors long term. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Equirus Capital * RELIANCE posted a resilient 1QFY26 EBITDA of Rs 429bn (+11% yoy, -2% qoq), slightly below EE, with strong growth in R-Jio (+7% qoq EBITDA) and retail (+11% yoy). O2C was steady qoq but missed EE, while upstream remained soft. PAT surged to Rs 307bn (+37% qoq) aided by Rs 89bn gains on Asian Paints stake and higher interest income. * R-Jio continued to anchor growth with rising ARPU, robust net adds, and digital scale-up (broadband, FWA). We model a 12%/15% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E. Retail stayed in recovery with 8-quarter high store adds and margins steady at 7.2%. We expect a 12% revenue/EBITDA CAGR as restructuring eases and SSSg normalises. * O2C margins should gradually improve, with EBITDA/mt rising from US$ 91 in FY25 to US$ 105 by FY27, with easing feedstock pressures and better spreads amid record-low inventories. * Retail scale-up visibility, O2C margin bottoming, and commissioning of New Energy assets support our FY25-FY27E EBITDA CAGR of 19%. Retain ADD with a Sep’26 TP of Rs 1,546. Near-term triggers: Tariff hikes, retail recovery, value unlocking in R-Jio. Jio Platforms – growth visibility strong: R-Jio reported a solid 1Q with 7% qoq/24% yoy EBITDA growth and margins improving to ~52%. Growth was supported by rising ARPU (Rs 209, +15% yoy), strong net adds (10mn), and leadership across wireless (~51% market share), FWA, and broadband. Jio AirFiber subscribers crossed 7.4mn, making it the largest FWA platform globally. As per TRAI (May’25), Bharti Airtel (31% market share) and Vodafone (13%) had 302mn and 127mn subscribers, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect a 12%/15% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E, led by rising fixed broadband penetration, modest tariff hikes, and continued subscriber additions.

Digital commerce scaled up strongly – JioMart daily order volumes jumped 175% yoy, and AJIO Rush sustained its early momentum. We expect 12% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E, as store restructuring and SSSg normalise. O2C – margin normalisation to drive modest upside: Despite throughput pressure from planned M&I, EBITDA grew 11% yoy to Rs 145bn, with stable qoq EBITDA/mt at US$ 98. However, higher feedstock and freight costs weighed on qoq profitability. We expect margins to improve steadily, with EBITDA/mt rising from US$ 91 in FY25 to US$ 105 by FY27. New Energy – execution phase begins: The business is entering a critical execution phase, with large-scale investments underway across solar PV, storage, green hydrogen, and supply chain.

He was joined on the dais by Sanjay Nayar, President Assocham and Sajjan Jindal, Past President Assocham and Chairman JSW Group. Mr. Goyal also said that the EFTA-India FTA agreement will take effect on October 1, 2025. He urged ASSOCHAM members present at the meeting to focus on scale and quality to remain competitive and take advantage of these FTAs. He also highlighted the need to focus on innovation to stay competitive. The event saw the participation of leading CEOs from Indian Industry including Mr. B K Goenka, Chairman Welspun World, Dr. Niranjan Hiranandani, Founder & Chairman, Hiranandani Group, Mr. Vineet Aggarwal, Managing Director, Transport Corporation of India Ltd., Mr. M K Sanghi, Chairman, M K Sanghi Group, Mr. Sunil Kanoria, Trustee, Kanoria Foundation, Ms Falguni Nayar, CEO of Nykaa, Mr. Sanjeev Mehta, Executive Chairman, El Carterton India, Mr. Anant Goenka, Vice Chairman, RPG Group and Mr. Gunit Chadha, Founder and MD, APAC Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. among others. Speaking at the event, the minister said the FDI commitment would also create a million direct jobs in the coming years, and help technology and innovation through Swiss SMEs entering Indian markets “My calculation, or my gut sense is that $100 billion FDI, along with Indian promoter equity, when they come into your companies, it will catalyse to at least $500 billion investment in India into brownfield or greenfield,” said the minister. Citing a game-changing initiative, Mr. Goyal said that the cabinet has sanctioned ₹1 lakh crore towards an innovation fund to drive R&D in the country. “When I tell you that a 1 lakh crore rupees, which is about $12 billion, invest it, it’ll multiply through many rotations. It can be given out to all of you or any company willing to do it in, research and development in the form of a grant, in the form of low-cost loan, interest-free loan, long term loan,” said Mr. Goyal. Recognizing the pivotal role of MSMEs, Mr. Goyal stressed the need for enabling these enterprises with access to global markets, modern technology, and affordable capital. With 2.4 million STEM graduates annually, including 43% women, India is well-positioned to scale up its manufacturing and innovation capabilities. Recognising India’s potential as a global capability hub, he said the country can emerge as a high-quality destination for Global Capability Centers (GCCs), as India now offers, comparable or superior talent at a fifth of global costs, lower-than-expected real estate and energy costs, and a compelling alternative to offshore operations, amid declining H1B dependency. On the social security pact with the UK, Goyal said India has successfully negotiated a social security agreement with the UK, enabling Indian professionals on short-term UK work visas (up to 3 years) to contribute Indian EPF accounts rather than losing 25% of their overseas earnings in UK social security contributions. When asked by a delegate on the government’s Bharat Mart initiative, the union minister highlighted plans to replicate a similar model for Indian MSMEs, particularly leveraging Mumbai’s strategic and financial advantage, with government support and incentives promised. On the upcoming EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which mandates supply chain traceability for seven commodities (like coffee, wood, furniture, etc.), requiring detailed farmer and production data to be uploaded, the minister acknowledged this regulation as a non-tariff barrier. He urged Indian industries to proactively engage and negotiate such barriers and emphasised that quality compliance, not just quantity, must be a national priority.
