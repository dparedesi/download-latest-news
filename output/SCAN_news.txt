Title: AMZN Stock Set For A Major Upswing?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a history of delivering impressive, rapid returns, with the stock achieving over 30% gains in less than two months on 13 separate occasions, notably in 2010 and 2020. If these historical patterns persist, upcoming catalysts could propel AMZN stock to extraordinary new highs, offering significant benefits to shareholders. Several high-growth areas are poised to drive Amazon's stock higher: That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AMZN, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. It undoubtedly helps if the financial fundamentals are solid. For insights on AMZN, visit Buy or Sell AMZN Stock. Below are some key metrics to note. *LTM: Last Twelve Months When considering risk, it’s useful to assess Amazon’s performance during challenging market conditions. It experienced a nearly 94% decline during the Dot-Com Bubble, which is substantial. The Global Financial Crisis affected it by approximately 65%, and the Inflation Shock of 2022 also had a severe impact, resulting in a decline of over 56%. Even less extreme events, such as the 2018 correction and the COVID-19 selloff, caused drops of around 34% and 23%, respectively. Look at – How Low Can Amazon Stock Really Go – for more details. Therefore, despite the favorable indicators, Amazon's past indicates that it can incur significant losses when the market declines. However, risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decline even amid favorable market conditions – consider situations such as earnings announcements, business updates, and outlook revisions. To observe how the stock has bounced back from sharp downturns historically, refer to the AMZN Dip Buyer Analyses. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Are Crypto Income ETFs Really Profitable? Analyzing The Booming TradFi Trend

Written byandrew.packer Edited byMohammad Shahid The first wave of crypto ETFs allowed investors to onboard crypto assets into traditional brokerage accounts – and tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Given the long-term return potential of cryptocurrencies, that’s a win-win. But cryptos are still volatile. Last week’s $19 billion leveraged wipeout in bitcoin surpassed the wipeout at the Covid bottom in March 2020. And the FTX collapse in late 2022. Investors in traditional assets like the upside potential of crypto. But the downside volatility is a bit much to stomach. They want products that take some of the extreme swings out of it, even if it means a lower upside. Today, a new wave of ETFs are coming online. They boast higher fees, but more active management. There are currently 155 crypto ETF filings tracking 35 different digital assets. 👀 pic.twitter.com/nLgZccjplR Not content to simply buy and HODL, they’re employing different strategies to take advantage of the higher volatility in cryptocurrencies. For more cautious investors, crypto income ETFs may be attractive investment opportunities. But as with anything, buyer beware. A peek under the hood of some of the income ETFs show that – whether in a crypto-specific ETF or a basket of crypto stocks – there aren’t great total returns. On paper, crypto income ETFs offer investors most of the upside from cryptocurrencies, but with income along the way. But there’s a catch. Actually, quite a few. The most important is that these ETFs use crypto futures, rather than hold crypto itself. Being able to manage crypto futures allows for the ability to create income. By buying long-dated futures and then selling short-dated futures, income can be generated from price swings. Some of the income returns look good, at least during a bull market. For instance, the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) boasts a dividend yield of over 50% annualized. However, investors need to look at the total return. BITO shares are down nearly 20% year-to-date. With the underlying asset of Bitcoin up over 20%, BITO has generated only a modest gain on top of that. Anyone who has to sell shares of BITO will experience capital loss despite having to pay taxes on dividends received. And on top of that, investors are paying a 0.95% management fee. Using futures, ETFs effectively buy an asset with a time premium that decays. During a bull market, the impact is muted. But in sideways markets or a crypto winter, the losses can be brutal. Combine that with leverage, and the results can get pretty bad, pretty quickly. The Defiance Leveraged Long Income Ethereum ETF (ETHI) launched at the start of October. Designed to return 150-200% of the daily performance in Ethereum and using credit spreads to generate income, shares dropped 30% within their first few weeks of trading. October 10’s liquidation massacre is the immediate culprit. But the way this ETF is structured, it would likely bleed out over time. Currently, crypto income ETFs are set up to make investors only during a hot bull market – not a crypto winter, or even a sideway market. But the crypto space is now more than just cryptocurrencies themselves. There’s an ETF for everything after all, and it’s no surprise that crypto stock ETFs are making a debut. ETFs tracking crypto-related stocks have started to launch this year. In theory, these may be more attractive for investors compared to a single-crypto income ETF, since they offer some diversification. Let’s take a look at two of them: At the start of the year, the REX Crypto Equity Premium Income ETF (CEPI) launched. Boasting a monthly dividend payment, the ETF owns shares of several crypto-related companies, from mining companies, Bitcoin treasury company MicroStrategy, and even credit card giant Visa. Shares have been volatile since their launch, in a rising market for stocks – not good. But the dividends paid out have exceeded 20% year to date, for a positive total return. A second ETF that launched this year, the long-winded YieldMax Crypto Industry Portfolio Option Income ETF (LFGY), has a reported distribution of 19.9% annualized. Yet the ETF, which holds assets such as Coinbase, IBIT, MARA Holdings, and other runaway stock winners this year, is down nearly 25% since inception. With less than $200 million under management, it’s clear that this ETF is failing to attract investors. And with these returns in the first year of operation, it’s easy to see why. Despite the increasingly mainstream integration of cryptocurrencies, the October 10th massacre in altcoins serves as a painful reminder. Cryptocurrency is volatile. And while that volatility should decline as crypto assets gain traction and become integrated with traditional finance, it’s still subject to big swings. Investors looking to get into the cryptocurrency space don’t want to sit through a 30-50% decline – or more. They want the upside volatility, but may be willing to give up some gains if it means reducing the risk of having to sit through massive declines. But for now, crypto income ETFs are living up to their name by providing income – but they’re failing to hold their value. That’s a problem over time. Given the number of new crypto ETFs coming online, more competition in the space should drive ways to improve returns. For crypto enthusiasts, the ETFs are no reason to switch out of owning the real asset. For investors looking for crypto exposure, the spot ETFs that hold the underlying crypto still appear to be the best game in town.

Title: Apple Stockholders Hit $850 Billion Jackpot
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/22/apple-stockholders-hit-850-billion-jackpot/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T14:14:54Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past ten years, Apple (AAPL) stock has delivered a massive $847 billion back to its investors in tangible cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. In fact, AAPL stock has provided the highest returns to shareholders of any company in history. Continuing this trend in 2025, Apple raised its quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share, reflecting a 4% raise. Apple’s board has also authorized a new program to repurchase up to $100 billion of common stock. Let's examine some statistics and see how this payout ability compares to the market's largest return-of-capital entities. Why should you be concerned? Because dividends and share buybacks represent direct, tangible capital returns to shareholders. They also reflect management's confidence in the company’s financial stability and its capacity to generate sustainable cash flows. Moreover, there are other stocks exhibiting similar traits. Here is a list of the top 10 firms ranked by total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there’s significant value in the broader diversified approach we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend beyond just equities. What about a portfolio comprising 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities and bonds - is it likely to yield greater returns in the next 1-3 years and offer better protection if the markets fall by 20%? We have analyzed the figures. Top 10 Stocks By Total Shareholder Return For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What catches your attention here? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market cap seems inversely correlated to growth potential for reinvestments. Stocks like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a much quicker rate, in a more predictable manner, compared to the others, yet they have returned a significantly smaller portion of their market cap to shareholders. That represents the downside to high capital returns. Yes, they are appealing, but you must ponder: Am I compromising growth and robust fundamentals? With that consideration, let's review some data for AAPL. (refer to Buy or Sell Apple Stock for more information) Apple Basics That provides a good summary, but assessing a stock from an investment standpoint requires much more. This is precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio accomplishes. It aims to minimize stock-specific risks while providing potential upside. AAPL Historical Risk Nevertheless, Apple is not insulated from significant declines. It fell roughly 81% during the Dot-Com bubble and suffered a 61% drop in the Global Financial Crisis. The 2018 correction and the Covid sell-off also experienced reductions of around 31-39%. Even the recent inflation shock caused it to decline by approximately 31%. Strong firms can endure storms more effectively, yet sharp market downturns can still be severe. However, the risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decrease even in favorable market conditions - consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Check AAPL Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark that includes all three - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The 3 Bitcoin Treasury Company Models According to Michael Saylor
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/the-3-bitcoin-treasury-company-models-according-to-michael-saylor/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
A deep dive into the three strategic models emerging in corporate Bitcoin treasury companies, from pure-play credit issuers to hybrid operators, based on Michael Saylor’s latest thinking. But not all Bitcoin treasury companies are the same. In fact, Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), recently outlined a clear taxonomy for understanding the landscape: a three-tiered hierarchy that separates dabblers from dominators. Each tier comes with distinct incentives, risks, and expected outcomes. For investors, analysts, and executives, understanding this framework is essential for evaluating capital strategy in the age of Bitcoin. This is the highest-conviction model—a company that is entirely focused on accumulating and optimizing Bitcoin as its core strategic asset. Bitcoin is not just a reserve asset; it is the business. Pure plays are engineered for one thing: capital transformation through Bitcoin. They raise equity and issue Bitcoin-backed credit, using the proceeds to accumulate even more Bitcoin. Their growth isn’t tethered to traditional business models or fiat performance metrics. It flows directly from superior monetary architecture. Defining Characteristics: Strategic Advantage: Examples: Saylor’s View: “These are the next Mag-7 stocks. They can go from a billion to a hundred billion, even a trillion.” Pure plays are the apex predators of Bitcoin capital markets. They can achieve 100x or 1,000x returns because they own their category and multiply Bitcoin-denominated value through disciplined issuance and strategic clarity. This tier reflects a hybrid approach—companies with real Bitcoin exposure and strategic intent, but not full alignment. Strong Bitcoin operators maintain an existing business model while also accumulating BTC and potentially issuing Bitcoin-backed instruments. Their conviction is meaningful, but their operational complexity or regulatory constraints prevent full conversion. Defining Characteristics: Strategic Advantage: Expected Outcome: These companies are capable of winning in the Bitcoin era, but their upside is constrained by competing priorities. They are often stuck between traditional shareholder expectations and Bitcoin-native capital innovation. At the base of the hierarchy are companies that hold Bitcoin on the balance sheet as a passive hedge. They aren’t actively building around it, issuing Bitcoin-backed debt, or educating the market. They simply hold it. This model is increasingly common among firms that want long-term exposure without significant operational changes. Over time, as Bitcoin appreciates, it becomes a ballast for market cap—supporting equity value even when the core business underperforms. Defining Characteristics: Strategic Role: Expected Outcome: This model doesn’t transform capital markets. But it does offer a superior hedge versus holding fiat or underperforming fixed income. This hierarchy isn’t just semantic. It determines who thrives in the Bitcoin era. The delta between tiers is massive. A hedger might preserve value. A strong operator might outperform. But only a pure play rewrites the game. Saylor doesn’t see this as a corporate trend. He sees it as a full-spectrum transformation of credit, equity, and capital markets. “Bitcoin treasury companies are the engines, the drivers, the dynamos powering up that network.” In his view, a new financial system is emerging where: The companies that embrace the pure play model today will anchor this future. They will become the new financial institutions—issuing digital credit, shaping capital flows, and compounding Bitcoin-denominated value faster than traditional models allow. George Mekhail, Managing Director of Bitcoin For Corporations sits down with Michael Saylor to discuss Bitcoin disrupting capital, redefining balance sheets, and shaping 21st-century economics.
