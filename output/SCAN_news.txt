October 1, 2025 3:00pm by Barry Ritholtz At The Money: The Flood of New ETFs (October 1, 2025) There will be nearly 1,000 new ETFs issued this year. Most of these are NOT the usual low-cost passive indices, but tend to be complex, expensive active funds in an ETF wrapper. These include leveraged directional bets, options, derivatives, and a whole raft of exotic strategies. Full transcript below. ~~~ About this week’s guest: Dave Nadig is President and Director of Research at ETF.com, and he shares with us how investors should navigate all of these new products. Dave helped design and market some of the first exchange-traded funds. He is the author of “A Comprehensive Guide to Exchange-Traded Funds” for the CFA Institute.

And it’s gonna get worse because so many more ETFs are coming out next year. The growth has been explosive. What does this mean for investors? I have the perfect person to discuss this with. Dave Nadig is president and head of research at ETF.com. He has been tracking the ETF industry pretty much since his its beginning and is well known as an expert in the space. So Dave, let’s talk a little bit about what’s been going on. Most ETF assets are and will likely continue to be cheap, index based products. That’s the legacy for investors: Low cost beta. Is this the future of ETFs or are we going in a different direction? Dave Nadig: I think most of the money is gonna continue to flow into low cost asset allocation targets, right? The S&P 500 broad bonds, broad commodities at very, very cheap institutional prices. It’s just hard to beat that. It’s one of the best deals going in asset management in the investing world. And so whether you’re an individual mom and pop investor just trading your own account, or whether you’re the Harvard endowment, anything in between. Cheap beta is still probably gonna be important to your portfolio, and ETFs are gonna remain the best wrapper for that experience. However, this industry is not gonna take that lying down and desperately wants to make money. Most of the new products, the new launches you talked about, the 600 will probably have 800, 900 by the end of the year. Almost all of those products are very expensive. Doesn’t mean some of them aren’t good, but they’re all very expensive. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about that. New products are coming out with what you described as quote, insanely high fees that the big revenue winners are likely not the firms you think of when someone says ETF at a cocktail party. What does this mean for investors? What does this mean for the industry? Are there really massive profits to be had here? Dave Nadig: There are pretty huge profits to be had here. And if you look at where I, I like to look at revenue based on flow. Meaning like last month, X amount of money came in, what was the revenue implied by that money and the implied revenue of the industry? Now has, you know, probably about 25% of the implied revenue from Flow is going to products that cost over 1%. (Really?!) So that means there are a lot of investors buying products that cost over 1%. And the reason that’s an issue for investors is not that nothing is worth that fee, but that what’s getting launched tends to be very speculative. We’re not talking about core investing, building blocks; we’re talking about ETFs that use leverage or ETFs that use the derivatives markets to shape your pattern of returns to get you more income than you might otherwise be able to, e.g., “Selling volatility” Those types of products are expensive and while they may be useful like, like a really sharp knife in the drawer can be really useful when you got that chicken bone you gotta get through. It’s not a one size fits all thing. I have some concern that individual investors see the marketing from the industry, which is really exclusively focused on those expensive products and gets sort of suckered into ’em. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about what, what is transformative? What is innovative in ETFs over the past few years? What trends do you see shaping 2026 and beyond? What is the biggest new type of ETF that’s coming out? Dave Nadig: There’s really three buckets of, of hot development from a, from a what could you as an investor target. Crypto we have to talk about. Not only do we now have, um, hundreds of billions of dollars tracking crypto in various capacities, whether it’s spot Bitcoin, which is where most of those flows have gone, but now we’re talking about Ethereum and Solana. We’re talking about stake diversions where you’re taking your Solana and you’re putting it into a contract to earn fees off of or earn interest off of it. That ecosystem of crypto products is going to get very complex very quickly. The SEC has put out accelerated listing standards; default listing standards, which will allow probably the next 10 to 20 coins on the market cap list to be launched as spot ETFs. So those will all be launched within the next six to 12 months before you it gonna be a free for all Barry Ritholtz: Before you move off crypto. I have to ask about BlackRock’s Ibit – it was 5 billion at launch. It’s something like 82 billion already. Is this the fastest ever asset accumulator of any ETF that’s been launched? Dave Nadig: It’s pretty close if it’s not the winner. I, I certainly think on a, on a pure dollar basis, uh, I can’t think of anything that has had that kind of ramp. GLD when it first came out was one of the first to a billion and then the first to 5 billion, and that broke a lot of records. I think Ibit and Bitcoin as a class has really kind of blown all those things out of the water and it’s been, it’s been, I think, beneficial for the most part, and an orderly process. I think having these Bitcoin ETFs has helped investors understand it. Um, I’m hearing from bigger as bigger institutions, bigger advisors, they love the ETF because it solves all of their custody issues, right? Everything stays in the same account. They don’t have to worry about having on chain assets. So while crypto purists may not be into it, I think the average investor is way better suited to get their little bit of crypto exposure in that ETF wrapper. And, and you mentioned what the SEC is permitting, not just in crypto, but across the boards. I, I read your regular writings and one of the things you had said is. We have a “Incredibly permissive launch environment.” What does this mean in terms of the sort of things we can see in ETFs, either with leverage two x three x in verse two x? What, what does this permissive environment mean for what ETFs are gonna get launched? Dave Nadig: It means we’re gonna get a lot of ’em. We’re gonna launch “all the things,” as I like to say. (All the things!) Uh, the, the, the biggest thing we’ve had is this move towards single stock ETFs. And, and for people who might be confused by that, it’s not that you’re buying an Apple ETF to invest in just Apple ’cause you can obviously just buy Apple to do that. You’re buying an Apple ETF that maybe gives you two x Apple exposure or minus. Two x apple exposure. So when it goes, you goes down, you go up, or you’re writing options on your Apple position so that you can get some extra income. Or you’re doing a combination of both so that you can only get, you know, you get 2X the upside and minus 1X the downside but with caps involved, ’cause you’re selling a lot of options along the way. Anyway you can imagine mixing and matching these kinds of patterns of returns. The combination of leverage. Income and protection around a single stock is going to be launched. If you think about it, we’ve got 500 stocks in the S&P 500. There are about six different flavors you can think of for each individual stock. That’s a couple thousand ETFs we’re gonna have to keep track of, assuming there’s only one of each flavor, and this industry loves to compete against each other. Legitimately, I think by this time next year, we could have several thousand more ETFs than we do right now. Barry Ritholtz: More ETFs than there are actually stocks. Dave Nadig: Huge already. They’re absolutely, I mean, we’ve been under, we haven’t had 5,000 stocks in the Wilshire in a long time. I think 3,500. 500 or so. We’re gonna see all those single stock products, which are, for the most part, trading vehicles, right? If you’re a day trader, there’s lots of value in there. If you are trying to, you know, monetize a long term position, there’s some value in those kinds of covered call strategies. They’re all very expensive. They’re very inappropriate for most long-term investor from an allocation perspective, but sharp, useful trading tools for a certain class of trader. Barry Ritholtz: I keep reading some of the things you’re penning about share class relief. Explain what this means and why this is another flood of new ETFs that are coming out. Dave Nadig: Let’s pick an example. Like DFA Dimensional was late to the ETF party, very well known sort of in the nineties for being one of those shops where you could only buy them through an advisor who’d gone through their coursework. They made the shift to convert some of their mutual funds to ETFs a couple years ago, and were very successful at it. Now, why didn’t they convert all of them? Because a lot of the DFA products end up in 401k plans. And if you’re in a 401k plan, that means you need to be able to get fractional shares, which is really easy in a mutual fund and impossible in an ETF. The only way to get the efficiencies of the ETF structure into those mutual funds is a share class: an ETF share class pointing at the same pool of assets. That’s how a lot of Vanguard ETFs are built. They had a patent, which is now expired. The SEC has 70 odd applications from other players in the industry to basically duplicate things the way Vanguard does. They’ve made it very clear that. Imminent, I would suggest by the end of the year, at the very latest, we’ll see this first one’s approved and that will then be a flood because that becomes a very, very simple boilerplate piece of paperwork to file a new share class and get it trading on NYSE, Nasdaq, or CBOE. We’ll just see a lot of those. I would suspect by the end of the year, we could have maybe a thousand of those individual share class ETFs turned on if all of the people who have filed. Converted all or share classed all of the things they could. It would be about five or 6,000 new ETFs. Barry Ritholtz: That’s really intriguing. I have to ask a question, and you’re the one who’s really schooled me on this. If mutual funds were created today, they probably wouldn’t be approved. Explain the problem with mutual funds and why ETFs are arguably so much superior. Dave Nadig: Well, the biggest problem with funds is their tax fairness. It’s the issue with a fund is that if you as a big investor, let’s say you own 20% of the Dave Mutual Fund and you decide I’m terrible and you want out, well, the mutual fund me has to now go sell a bunch of securities to give you back your 20% of my fund all that cash that you’re gonna want. That engenders generally a bunch of capital gains. Those capital gains now have to be distributed to. All the people who were left, the people you abandoned buried, they end up paying taxes ’cause you left because you created a capital gain for everybody. Now it’s not that those are taxes that would never be paid, it’s just you’re paying them earlier than you would otherwise ’cause you get to reduce your basis. So. Individual investors in a mutual fund can often get tax distributions through no fault of their own, through no action of their own, simply because other investors go in and out in an ETF. That simply doesn’t happen. So it is a simply a fairer mechanism. The ETF also brings other things that are helpful, like the ability to wash out some cap gains by doing so-called creation redemption or heartbeat trading. That’s a little feature of ETFs that makes them very tax efficient. And of course liquidity and transparency and all those other things. But the big reason mutual funds would probably get the kibosh today is they’re inherently less fair in terms of how they treat individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: Even if I don’t sell my mutual fund, but other people have, I incur capital gains. Dave Nadig: A hundred percent. Now you get, again, you get to change your basis. So when you go to sell, you’ll pay less tax gains. But I don’t know about you. I prefer paying taxes later, hopefully never, or maybe after I’m dead. But not today. Barry Ritholtz: Final question. It sounds like the future of ETFs are pretty much anything. Anything you wanna do, sometimes cheap. Always very liquid, but can be accomplished very well with an ETF. Is this the future of asset management? Dave Nadig: I think so, I think the ETF structure is the most efficient vehicle we’ve come up with for taking exposures and getting them traded on exchanges. It’s hard for me to see how we’re going to make it any more efficient tokenization crypto. Sometime down the line, we’ll replace some of what we’ve done with ETFs, but we’ll largely duplicate it and it will just do it in a different fashion. The, the ETF structure is where you’re going to probably get almost all of your exposures for the foreseeable future with some very strange edge cases. Things like some private credit or maybe some real estate that you can’t trade daily. There’ll be some edge cases. Everything else is gonna be an ETF. Barry Ritholtz: If we’re talking about the future of ETFs, we’re really talking about the future of asset allocation and investing. For the most part, the big money is in the low-cost passive indexes that charge 3, 4, 5 basis points. But the fastest growing space in ETF-world are active funds. Our alternative funds are all sorts of niche. Areas, some of which are pretty pricey, a hundred, 125 basis points. Directional bets leverage two x three x inverse bets. Those are really special use cases. Tread carefully if you’re playing in those spaces. Use ETFs for what they’re really good at: Getting you low-cost exposure to inexpensive indices. Tread lightly when you go into the pricier, wilder stuff, those are potential accidents waiting to happen. I’m Barry Ritholtz.

Title: Yahoo Fantasy Basketball: Draft strategy for new High Score format
URL: https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy/article/yahoo-fantasy-basketball-draft-strategy-for-new-high-score-format-160632486.html
Time Published: 2025-10-01T16:06:32Z

Manage your account ... Welcome to Yahoo's High Score fantasy basketball. If you've been playing fantasy hoops for a while, get ready to unlearn some old habits. This game isn't about nightly grind and steady production — it's about chasing peak performances and embracing the fun and chaos of the NBA week. You can learn more in my High Score 101, but the rules are simple: Your weekly score is calculated using only the single-best fantasy performance from each of your six starters. That’s it. A player can have three bad games and one amazing game, and you only get the points from the amazing one. This changes everything. [High Score is a new way to play Fantasy Basketball on Yahoo with simple rosters and scoring. Create or join a league] Now, let's explore tips to help you in your High Score drafts — I also have in-season strategy, when you’re ready to dive deeper. As a reminder, the High Score scoring format is as follows: Points: 1 point Rebounds: 1 point Assists: 2 points Blocks: 3 points Steals: 3 points And here's how the starting lineup breaks down: Guard Guard Frontcourt Frontcourt Frontcourt FLEX/UTIL There are also four bench spots. 101 on the format In-season tips Overall rankings Draft tiers: Guard | Frontcourt Join a league now With High Score's streamlined and positionless format, there are just two guard spots, three frontcourt spots and a single flex/utility spot. There's no need to worry about filling every position (PG, SG, SF, PF or C) like traditional fantasy basketball formats. This gives you way more freedom to build your lineup your way — whether you want to stack up on guards, bulk up on versatile forwards or mix and match based on your favorite draft strategy. Or, better yet … Drafting players with both guard and frontcourt eligibility is a savvy move in High Score. With only 30 of these versatile options available within the top 150, you get the freedom to easily adjust your lineup when injuries or rest days pop up. Here's the list of players with dual eligibility whom I’d target: Scottie Barnes Jaylen Brown Amen Thompson Desmond Bane Josh Hart Dyson Daniels Paul George Cam Thomas Brandon Ingram Bennedict Mathurin Devin Vassell Shaedon Sharpe Norman Powell Andrew Wiggins Bradley Beal Christian Braun Ayo Dosunmu Nickeil Alexander-Walker Bilal Coulibaly Jaylen Wells Quentin Grimes Kyshawn George Prioritize these players on draft day for an additional edge in High Score. Let's start with one of the biggest changes you need to know: Guards are more valuable than ever. The scoring updates in High Score are a massive boost for playmakers and perimeter defenders. Assists are now worth a full 2 points each, a big jump from the previous 1.5, and turnovers no longer deduct points. This is a game-changer. This scoring tweak turns high-assist guards into prized fantasy assets. Trae Young and Cade Cunningham — two high-assist, high-turnover guards — are even better in High Score. But it doesn't stop there. Steals are worth a hefty 3 points, and guards tend to rack up steals at a higher rate than most frontcourt players. So, a guard who drops between 6-10 assists, plus a steal and no turnovers to worry about, is already giving you a huge point boost before you even count their points and rebounds. This doesn't mean you should ignore big men entirely. In fact, it makes certain types of frontcourt players even more valuable. Guys who are the hub of their offense, like Paolo Banchero, Domantas Sabonis or Alperen Şengün, also get a bump in High Score. Your draft plan should prioritize these assist-heavy players, whether they bring the ball up the court or facilitate from the high post. In other formats, a player who misses a game or two can be a weekly disaster. That fear leads to players with injury risk, like Joel Embiid, sliding down draft boards. In High Score, that risk practically vanishes. Since you only need one great game from a starter each week, "load management" and minor absences become far less concerning. Think about Embiid. He averages over 50 fantasy points per game when he plays, but his availability concerns often push him beyond the fifth round in traditional drafts. In High Score, he’s a first-round talent, no question. All you need is one of his signature dominant performances per week to get elite production from that roster spot. He can play once, drop a 50-burger and you're set for the week. This mindset applies throughout the draft. Look for players who have week-winning potential. Jalen Green is a perfect mid-round example. He's known for being inconsistent, but he’s also capable of erupting for a massive scoring night at any moment. In other formats, his duds would frustrate you. Here, you only care about the peak. One 40-point game is all it takes to make him a valuable asset. Your goal is to build a roster full of players who can go off, not just show up. These are reliable, night-in and night-out contributors who grab rebounds and block a couple of shots. In many fantasy formats, they provide a stable floor. In High Score, the Rudy Gobert types aren't as valuable. The scoring system devalues one of their primary contributions: Rebounds are now worth just 1 point compared to 1.2 previously. While Gobert might have a spike game with 20+ rebounds or four blocks, the overall offensive game for traditional frontcourt players is limited. You generally know what you're getting — a low-end double-double. That predictable production just doesn't move the needle in a format where you're chasing explosive point totals. Focus on bigs who are more involved in the offense or who contribute across multiple categories, not just the traditional big-man stats. Let someone else in your league draft these "safe" centers. High Score features smaller rosters (10 players in total, including four bench spots), which might seem restrictive, but it actually gives you incredible freedom in the later rounds of your draft. You don't need to waste those final picks on safe, low-upside players just to fill out your roster. Instead, it’s time to go big-game hunting. Use your late-round picks to swing for the fences. Target volatile players who have the potential for spike performances. Rookies with a clear path to scoring, like Wizards rookie Tre Johnson, are my ideal targets. He might be inconsistent early on, but his role is expected to grow and he has the talent to deliver a 30-point game out of nowhere. The beauty of this strategy lies in its low-risk nature. If your lottery ticket doesn't pan out, the short bench makes it an easy decision to drop him for a hot player on the waiver wire. You're not tied to your late-round picks. Take a chance on a player who could have a few huge weeks. Those are the swings that can separate you from the rest of the league. While chasing points and assists is crucial, don't forget about the defensive side of the ball. Steals and blocks — affectionately known as "stocks" in fantasy basketball — are both worth 3 points apiece. These stats can be random, but they add up quickly and can be the difference in a close matchup. Prioritizing players who contribute on both ends of the floor is a savvy move. Guards who are elite defenders, like Derrick White, are incredibly valuable. He can fill up the stat sheet with points and assists while also adding a couple of steals and a block, providing a well-rounded and high-scoring fantasy line. In the frontcourt, look for versatile defenders who can do a bit of everything. Players like the Thompson twins (Amen and Ausar) are great examples. They have the athleticism to block shots and the quick hands to rack up steals, giving you multiple avenues to score fantasy points. If you miss out on some of the top-tier offensive stars, pivoting to elite defensive players is a fantastic way to build a competitive and balanced roster, should you miss out on some of the high-volume scorers.

Title: End Of Quarter Review & What’s Next For Stocks?

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. At the end of every month, quarter, and year I like to step back and review what actually happened in the market. That helps me remain objective, review my work, look for areas where I can improve, remove my cognitive (a.k.a. emotional) biases, and helps me set the stage for what may happen next. That said, here are a few points that jumped out at me as we wrap up Q3 2025. Bulls Are In Control The big headline for me is that the bulls are in control. The stock market is trading at/near record highs and has overcome literally ever negative headline that came out this year. Big picture, that tells me the bulls are in control and, barring some unforeseen event, we are likely headed much higher. 2025 Year In Review2025 began with President Donald Trump returning to the White House for his second term. In January, few could have predicted the dramatic economic journey that would unfold over the next few months. The early days of 2025 were characterized by a palpable sense of anticipation, excitement, and a little confusion about how tariffs would impact both Main Street and Wall Street. Trump’s inaugural address signaled a return to economic nationalism, promising to redefine America’s global economic position. Investors and economists watched closely as the administration began implementing a series of bold economic policies that would send ripples through global markets. Stocks fell hard in February and March as confusion reigned supreme. President Trump unveiled the most comprehensive tariff package in modern American history. The sweeping economic measures targeted multiple global economic powers, with actions against many of our major trading partners. The tariffs were unprecedented in their scope and intensity, covering everything from technology and manufacturing to agricultural products. Stocks Fell In Q1 The immediate market reaction in February and March was pretty severe. The S&P 500 fell 20% within a few weeks, with global markets experiencing similar dramatic declines. Economists warned of a potential recession, and investors braced themselves for what seemed like an impending economic warfare. The financial world held its collective breath, wondering if this would be the moment that would unravel the global economic order. Stocks Rallied In Q2 & Q3 But the market had other plans. In a remarkable display of resilience, the stock market bottomed in April 2025 after Trump lowered and extended global tariffs. The administration dubbed it "Liberation Day." Remember, the market is a forward looking mechanism and knew that the economy was strong and we would recover. Many areas of the market and leading stocks soared over the next few months. The S&P 500 vaulted 38% from April’s low to September’s record high. Tech and AI stocks led the charge higher with investors pumping trillions of dollars into the market. Tech stocks became a primary driver of economic innovation. Breakthrough developments in AI, quantum computing, and renewable energy technologies created new economic opportunities. Domestic semiconductor manufacturing saw massive investments, signaling a strategic shift towards technological self-sufficiency which is important for President Trump. It was also very impressive to see the market race higher even after many of Trump’s tariffs went into effect in the summer. That illustrates how strong the market is right now. Fed Cuts Rates In other, but also important news, The Federal Reserve cut rates for the first time in years, even as the stock market hit fresh record highs. Inflation came down a bit and the jobs report got weaker in Q3. The fact that the Fed is cutting rates is bullish for both Main Street and Wall Street. Looking forward, the Fed said it will cut rates a few more times and, as always, it remains data dependent. Geopolitical Tensions Geopolitical tensions continued to play a significant role throughout the year. Ongoing negotiations with China, challenges in European markets, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East didn’t stop the bulls from buying stocks. Once again, the American market demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt and innovate in the face of these challenges. IPO Environment Is Improving A few years ago, the IPO market contracted and dried up. That changed in 2025, so far the IPO and startup landscape has improved and looks promising. Despite initial market turbulence, venture capital continued to flow, and more stocks IPO’d this year. Small & Mid Cap Stocks Woke Up It was also encouraging to see the rally broaden out as small and mid cap stocks began to rally in Q3, after being dormant for most of 2025. While large-cap technology stocks dominated the headlines, the small and mid-cap stocks began to wake up in Q3. They were dormant for Q1 and Q2 but they came to life in Q3 after the Fed opened the door to cut rates. The small-cap Russell 2000 index was negative and unchanged for most of the year on a year-to-date percent change basis, but it is now up 9% in 2025. Most of those gains came in Q3. The same is true for mid cap stocks. They were negative to flat for most of the year and then they came to life and rallied in Q3 2025. Looking Ahead The stock market is trading near record highs as we wrap up Q3. That is very encouraging and tells me we can easily continue to race higher. Of course, anything is possible and we can always pullback. Looking forward, we will likely have another correction at some point but as long as we remain above the 50 day moving average, the bulls remain in clear control. We are in a bull market and in bull markets surprises usually happen to the upside, not the downside.

Title: The GOOGL Stock Shareholder Jackpot

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past 10 years, Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has provided an impressive $343 billion to its shareholders through actual cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-centric approach has accelerated dramatically in 2025, with the stock delivering an exceptional 30% return year-to-date, substantially outperforming the broader market and cementing its position among the year's top-performing mega-cap technology stocks. Alphabet's evolution into a dividend-paying powerhouse reached a milestone this year when the company announced a 5% increase to its quarterly dividend in April 2025, raising the payout to $0.21 per share from the inaugural $0.20 dividend introduced in 2024 - marking the tech giant's transformation from a pure growth story to a balanced capital allocation champion. The company's commitment to rewarding shareholders was further amplified through the authorization of a massive $70 billion share repurchase program in Q1 2025, one of the largest buyback announcements in corporate history, demonstrating management's confidence in the business amid robust financial performance. During the first half of 2025 alone, Alphabet generated impressive revenue growth with Q1 revenues of $90.23 billion (up 12% year-over-year) and Q2 revenues reaching $96.4 billion (up 14% year-over-year), providing the cash flow foundation that enables both aggressive capital returns and continued investment in AI infrastructure and cloud computing expansion. Let’s examine some figures and see how this payout capability compares with the substantial capital-return entities in the market. This provides a solid summary, but assessing a stock from an investment perspective entails much more. That is precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio aims to do. It is structured to mitigate stock-specific risks while allowing for potential upside. In fact, it has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – Why MSFT Stock Is A Shareholder's Paradise? Why is the shareholder return important? Because dividends and share repurchases constitute direct, tangible capital returns to shareholders. They also demonstrate management’s confidence in the financial health of the company and its ability to generate reliable cash flows. Furthermore, more companies exhibit similar traits. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital delivered back to shareholders via dividends and stock repurchases. Interestingly, GOOGL ranks 3rd for the highest amount returned to shareholders in history. For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What observations can you make? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market cap seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as META and MSFT are experiencing much faster growth in a more predictable manner compared to others, yet they have provided a significantly smaller portion of their market cap to shareholders. That’s the trade-off associated with substantial capital returns. While they may seem appealing, it's essential to question: Am I compromising growth and solid fundamentals? With that in mind, let's examine GOOGL's performance. (Refer to Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock for further information) Nevertheless, GOOGL is not without the risk of significant declines. It dropped 65% during the Global Financial Crisis, lost roughly 44% in the inflation shock, and encountered a 31% pullback during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even more minor corrections, like in 2018, resulted in a decrease of about 23%. Strong fundamentals are essential, but during periods of volatility, even leading stocks can experience turmoil. Also, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Experiment is the only means of knowledge at our disposal. Everything else is poetry, imagination.”— Max Planck Number of the Week: Less than 10% THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW begins with comments on the EPA Endangerment Finding by Richard Lindzen and William Happer. TWTW continues with a geological paper by Leszek Mark who asserts that the current warming is largely part of a natural cycle. Then TWTW discusses an assertion in the Wall Street Journal that human emissions of carbon dioxide have made the oceans too acidic to be considered healthy. ********************* EPA Endangerment Finding: On September 22, Richard Lindzen, Professor of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Emeritus, MIT, and William Happer, Professor of Physics, Emeritus, Princeton University, submitted their comments to Administrator Lee Zeldin of the US EPA on the reconsideration of the 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards. The highly accomplished forty-plus-page document is full of scientific evidence contradicting the Endangerment Finding. TWTW cannot adequately summarize it here but will cite some sections that may be of particular interest with the footnotes omitted. After thanking Administrator Zeldin for the opportunity to comment, the opening page states: We are career physicists with a special expertise in radiation physics, which describes how carbon dioxide and other GHGs affect heat flow in Earth’s atmosphere. We are both members of the National Academy of Sciences. Our CVs are attached. Our comment focuses on your request for comments as to, “The scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding are weaker than previously believed and contradicted by empirical data, peer-reviewed studies, and scientific developments since 2009 (C-2).” In our scientific opinion, the scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding (“EF”) are fatally flawed science, for two key reasons. • It fails to consider contradictory science. • It is not based on science; it is based on unscientific evidence. Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) will endanger the public health and welfare. Furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP. Scientific details follow.” After giving a table of contents, the Introduction states: “The EPA Endangerment Finding is: ‘[T]he Administrator finds that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare. Specifically, the Administrator is defining the ‘air pollution’ referred to in CAA section 202(a) to be the mix of six long-lived and directly-emitted greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).’ * * * ‘The Administrator has considered how elevated concentrations of the well-mixed greenhouse gases and associated climate change affect public health by evaluating the risks associated with changes in air quality, increases in temperatures, changes in extreme weather events, increases in food- and waterborne pathogens, and changes in aeroallergens.’ 74 FR 66,497. At the outset it is important to understand that carbon dioxide has two relevant properties, as a creator of food and oxygen, and as a greenhouse gas (GHG). As to food and oxygen, carbon dioxide is essential to nearly all life on earth by creating food and oxygen by photosynthesis. Further, it creates more food as its level in the atmosphere increases. For example, doubling carbon dioxide from today’s approximately 420 ppm to 840 ppm would increase the amount of food available to people worldwide by roughly 40%, and doing so would have a negligible effect on temperature. As to carbon dioxide as a GHG, the Endangerment Finding is premised on the Net Zero Theory that carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions must be reduced to Net Zero and the use of fossil fuels must be eliminated by 2050 to avoid catastrophic global warming and more extreme weather. A key premise the EPA has asserted is, ‘The increased concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere and the resulting warming have led to more frequent and more intense heat waves and extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and retreating snow and ice.’ Further, a foundational premise of everything the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) does is that the ‘evidence is clear that carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main driver of climate change,’ where ‘main driver means responsible for more than 50% of the change.’ We demonstrate that the scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding and of both the EPA and IPCC premises are fatally flawed science, for two key separate and combined reasons: First, both fail to consider contradictory science, including: Second, both are not based on science, and are based on unscientific evidence. Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that GHGs will endanger the public health and, furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP. Frankly, we also demonstrate that the Endangerment Finding is a classic example of what Peter Drucker described as government subordinating science to ‘value-judgments that are the reverse of, and largely incompatible with, any criteria one could possibly call scientific.’ Further, our opinion is that science requires urgent action to repeal the Endangerment Finding and other government actions based on it because they are policies that will destroy western economies, impoverish the working middle class, condemn billions of the world’s poorest to continued poverty and increased starvation, leave our children despairing over the alleged absence of a future, and will enrich the enemies of the West who are enjoying the spectacle of our suicide march. Scientific details follow.” The comment then goes into a discussion of what is and what is not, science, which TWTW has presented in previous comments by Lindzen and Happer. Section III “The Endangerment Finding Failed to Consider Contradictory Science” begins with: The Endangerment Finding states: ‘The scientific evidence is compelling that elevated concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are the root cause of recently observed climate change. The IPCC conclusion from 2007 has been re-confirmed by the June 2009 USGCRP assessment that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.’ 74 FR 66,518 (footnote deleted). As a matter of physics, the scientific evidence cited by the Endangerment Finding from two government organizations, the IPCC and USGCRP, is false science. (Elaborated in section III.B and D).” [These sections are not presented in this TWTW.] “The five most abundant GHGs are water vapor (H2O), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3), and methane (CH4). Water vapor and clouds account “for more than 90% of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat.’ Thus, CO2 and all the other GHGs account for less than 10% of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat and warm the planet. The Endangerment Finding cites six GHGs: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. 74 FR 66,516. The warming effects of methane and nitrous oxide are also so small that they are irrelevant to climate, as are the latter three. The physics of carbon dioxide and other GHGs is that they lose their capacity to warm the planet as their concentration in the atmosphere increases because of what is called “saturation,” and according to logarithmic equations. Every doubling of CO2 causes a warming of less than 1° C, to first approximation, 0.75° C (1.4° F). The other GHGs cause only a small fraction of the warming from CO2. Focusing on the physics of CO2, it becomes a less effective greenhouse gas at higher concentrations.” Then the comment gives a chart which may be confusing without more explanation and then continues with: “Most importantly, at today’s CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of approximately 425 parts per million and higher, saturation means that CO2 has little ability to absorb heat and warm the planet. Because of saturation, doubling carbon dioxide from today’s approximately 420 ppm to 840 ppm would increase the amount of food available to people worldwide by roughly 40%, and doing so would have a negligible effect on temperature, 0.75° C (1.4° F). Saturation means that from now on, CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels and other sources will have little impact on global warming. Since CO2 at today’s level is “saturated,” for this reason alone there is no risk that the continued use of fossil fuels will cause catastrophic global warming and more extreme weather. Moreover, the mathematics of logarithms can also be applied to temperature increases since the beginning of the Industrial Age in 1750 when carbon dioxide levels were about 280 ppm. Doubling it to 560 ppm would also only cause a trivial increase in temperature, 0.75° C (1.4° F). The increase in temperature would be even less, and trivial, if carbon dioxide increased from the beginning of the Industrial Age at 280 ppm to today’s 425 ppm, a much smaller increase of 145 ppm than doubling it to 560 ppm. Saturation also explains why temperatures were not catastrophically high over the hundreds of millions of years when CO2 levels were 10 to nearly 20 times higher than they are today, shown in the chart in Part III.C covering 600 million years.” [Part II C is not discussed in this TWTW.] “More specifically, the physics of how changes in atmospheric GHGs affect radiation transfer are described by precise physical equations that have never failed to describe observations. We and Prof. van Wijngaarden applied these formulas to the enormous efforts by the U. S. and worldwide to reduce CO2 emissions to Net Zero by 2050 in a paper that we recommend to those with a technical background.” The comment then discusses US going to net zero carbon dioxide emissions will have a miniscule effect on temperatures. It discusses the difference between the smooth Planck Curve of Earth’s blackbody radiation and the jagged curve of Earth’s radiation to space. The jagged curve identifies the frequencies associated with specific greenhouse gases. This section then concludes with: “Finally, note that CO2 is not nearly as potent a greenhouse gas as water vapor and clouds (especially cirrus clouds). A radiation-blocking effect of only about 3 W/m2 could easily also be produced by changes in the size or height of cloud cover on any given day. This is a complex system, and the idea that one variable, globally average temperature, is changed primarily by one thing, manmade CO2, is baseless. As one of us (Lindzen) has explained: ‘The climate system consists of two turbulent fluids interacting with each other, [ocean and atmosphere]. They are on a rotating planet that is differentially heated by the sun. A vital constituent of the atmospheric component is water in the liquid, solid, and vapor phases, and the changes in phase have vast energetic ramifications. The energy budget of this system involves the absorption and remission of about 200 watts per square meter. Doubling CO2 involves a two percent perturbation to this budget. So do minor changes in clouds, ocean circulations, and other features, and such changes are common. In this complex multifactor system, what is the likelihood that the climate (which itself consists of many variables and not just globally averaged temperature anomalies) is controlled by a two percent perturbation in the energy budget due to just one of the numerous variables, namely CO2? Believing this is pretty close to believing in magic.’ In conclusion, since CO2 at today’s level is ‘saturated,’ and the warming effects of the other GHGs are so small they are irrelevant to climate, physics demonstrates: Physics demonstrates there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding. For this reason alone, the Endangerment Finding should be repealed.” In the interests of brevity, this TWTW skips over a great deal of important scientific and other arguments to go to the last section citing an important Supreme Court decision and the Conclusion which state [Individual words in boldface were in italics in original]: “V. The Endangerment Finding Is Arbitrary, Capricious, and thus Invalided Under the Supreme Court’s State Farm Decision. As a legal matter, we understand State Farm is a key Supreme Court case that ruled that an agency regulation is arbitrary, capricious, and thus invalid where, inter alia: The Endangerment Finding fails each of these State Farm mandates: First, Unscientific Evidence. Unscientific evidence, misrepresented as science, is all the EPA provided underlying the Endangerment Finding, demonstrated in Part IV. Congress never intended for the EPA to consider and rely on unscientific evidence in making its Endangerment Finding, as it did. Second, Contradictory Scientific Evidence Ignored. The Endangerment Finding ignored and “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,” the robust and reliable contradictory scientific evidence detailed above in Part III. Therefore, the Endangerment Finding is arbitrary, capricious, and thus invalid for either or both reasons under State Farm. CONCLUSION Accordingly, we demonstrated the Endangerment Finding is based on fatally flawed science, for two reasons: First, it fails to consider contradictory science, including:. Second, it is not based on science, it is based on unscientific sources. Thus, there is no scientific basis for the Endangerment Finding that GHGs will endanger the public health and welfare. Furthermore, it endangers the public health and welfare itself. Accordingly, it should be repealed ASAP. Finally, we repeat, urgent action to repeal the Endangerment Finding and other government actions based on it is required because they are policies that will destroy western economies, impoverish the working middle class, condemn billions of the world’s poorest to continued poverty and increased starvation, leave our children despairing over the alleged absence of a future, and will enrich the enemies of the West who are enjoying the spectacle of our suicide march.” TWTW comment: It will be very interesting to see how the lower courts treat scientific argument, based on physical evidence, given the Supreme Court’s State Farm decision in 1983 “Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).

It states that the current warming is part of a natural cycle that has been going on throughout the Holocene (starting about 11,700 years ago). The present warm interglacial epoch in the Quaternary period (starting about 2.6 million years ago) features prolonged glacial periods (Ice Ages). The abstract of the paper states: “Cyclical climate change is characteristic of the Holocene, with successive warmings and coolings. A solar forcing mechanism has steered Holocene climate change, expressed by 9 cooling phases known as Bond events. There is reliable geological evidence that the temperatures of most warming phases in the Holocene were globally higher or similar to that of the current warming period, Arctic sea ice was less extensive and most mountain glaciers in the northern hemisphere either disappeared or were smaller. During the African Humid Period in the Early and Middle Holocene, much stronger summer monsoons made the Sahara green with growth of savanna vegetation, huge lakes, and extensive peat bogs. The modern warming is part of a climatic cycle with a progressive warming after the Little Ice Age, the last cold episode of which occurred at the beginning of the 19th century. Successive climate projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are based on the assumption that the modern temperature rise is steered exclusively by the increasing content of human-induced CO2 in the atmosphere. If compared with the observational data, these projected temperatures have been highly overestimated.” As climate fluctuations, Bond events are similar to Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events, except Bond events are noted in the current warm period (the Holocene), and DO events are noted in glacial periods. The UN IPCC and its colleagues largely ignore all climate history prior to about 1850 when the Earth came out of the Little Ice Age (one of the coldest periods, if not the coldest period, in the Holocene). They have abandoned the scientific method in favor of politics. The Mark paper concludes with: “The Holocene climate change was characterized by cyclical warmings (such as: Holocene Thermal Maximum, Late Bronze Age, Roman Warm Period, MWP) and coolings (Bond Events: including Iron Age Cold Period, Dark Ages Cold Period and LIA). The IPCC claims that current warming is unprecedented in the last 2000 or even the last 125,000 years; this statement is very unconvincing, and it is not supported by the geological data. There is good evidence that both in the last 2000 years as well during the Holocene Thermal Maximum, temperatures were higher or broadly similar to the ones in the current warming period, the Arctic sea ice was less extensive and most mountain glaciers (especially in the northern hemisphere) either disappeared or were smaller. Much stronger summer monsoons in the Early and Middle Holocene made the Sahara green with savanna vegetation, huge lakes, and extensive peat bogs. The terms ‘the Holocene Thermal Maximum’ and ‘the Holocene Climatic Optimum’ are avoided by the IPCC (2021), and its popularized statements making the current warming look ‘unprecedented’ and therefore ‘unique’ are false and flatten the climate history (cf. Marcott et al., 2013). The climate is a product of complicated interdependence of many factors that have not been yet sufficiently recognized qualitatively and quantitatively. It is a great scientific challenge that requires an extensive interdisciplinary research. There is a crucial need to make climate science less political and climate policy more scientific.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Acid Oceans? The Wall Street Journal published an article entitled “The Ocean Is Now Too Acidic to Be Considered Healthy, Planetary Scientist Says.” Apparently, the reporter did not bother to double check for contrary evidence, particularly with those who understand chemistry. A 2015 paper by Roger Cohen and William Happer “Fundamentals of Ocean pH” begins with [Footnotes omitted here]: “We are often told that the CO2 released from burning fossil fuels will cause dangerous ocean acidification. Actually, the oceans will remain comfortably alkaline and hospitable to life for the foreseeable future. This brief note is a quantitative review of the physical chemistry of ocean pH. High school chemistry and algebra should provide enough background to follow the discussion. An excellent introduction to the chemistry of the oceans can be found in the book: Seawater: Its Composition, Properties and Behavior, by Wright and Colling. More details on ocean pH can be found in a recent review by Tans. 2 Alkalinity of the Unbuffered Ocean Ocean water is salty because of the weathering of the earth’s rocks by rainwater, and because of salts dissolved from the ocean floor, especially near plate-spreading boundaries. The salt water contains positive ions (cations), mainly sodium Na+, magnesium Mg2+, calcium Ca2+ and potassium K+. For clarity, we can think of the ions as coming from the strong bases NaOH, and potassium hydroxide, KOH (lye) and much less soluble magnesium hydroxide, Mg (OH)2, and calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 (slaked lime). The ocean also contains negative ions (anions), mainly chloride Cl− and sulfate SO4(^-2), which we can think of the anions as coming from the strong acids, hydrochloric acid, HCl and sulfuric acid, H2SO4. For want of a better word, we will refer to the cations of strong bases, and anions of strong acids as pH-independent ions. The concentration of pH-independent ions is unaffected by normal changes in the pH of water.” The paper then goes into some mathematics and chemistry and shows that the oceans will remain alkaline with a pH slightly less than 8, even if rainwater (carbonic acid, H2CO3) becomes more acidic with an atmosphere with a carbon dioxide concentration of 1000 parts per million in volume, more than twice the current level of CO2. The paper concludes with [Figures not shown here]: “This minimalist discussion already shows how hard it is to scare informed people with ocean acidification, but, alas, many people are not informed. For example: For the Cohen and Happer paper see link under Challenging the Orthodoxy, for the Wall Street Journal article see Article # 1 ********************* Letter to UN Food and Agriculture Organization: The Non-science notions of the UN IPPC are infecting other UN organizations. The CO2 Coalition wrote an “Open Letter to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Concerning Sustainable Livestock Development.” In part, it states: “At no point has science been a matter of majority opinion or even top-down decisions by legal authorities. We see that the FAO is running the risk of finding itself on the wrong side of history if it unethically suppresses free scientific discourse. We therefore strongly recommend that FAO returns to its original mandate of eradicating hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition, eliminating poverty and driving forward economic progress for all, based on the latest objective climate research. Appendix. Five points of criticism of the greenhouse gas-based climate narrative and the idea that livestock could be a major culprit: See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Additions and Corrections: Christopher Game pointed out an error in last week’s TWTW. It stated: “Arrhenius used the term carbolic acid, a mixture of water and carbon dioxide that exists in liquid form but does not exist as a gas in the atmosphere.” TWTW should have stated: “carbonic acid, a compound of water and carbon dioxide.” TWTW appreciates such corrections. ********************* Number of the Week: Less than 10% [H/t Lindzen and Happer] In his book, Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters, Steven Koonin writes: “Water vapor is the most important of the greenhouse gases. Of course, the amount in the atmosphere at any given place and time varies greatly (the humidity changes a lot with the weather). But on average, water vapor amounts to only about 0.4 percent of the molecules in the atmosphere. Even so, it accounts for more than 90 percent of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat. John Tyndall, the Irish physicist who was the first to study the infrared properties of gases, eloquently expressed its importance in an 1863 public lecture: ‘Aqueous [water] vapor is a blanket, more necessary to the vegetable life of England than clothing is to man. Remove for a single summer-night the aqueous vapor from the air which overspreads this country, and you would assuredly destroy every plant capable of being destroyed by a freezing temperature. The warmth of our fields and gardens would pour itself unrequited into space, and the sun would rise upon an island held fast in the iron grip of frost.’ “The next most significant greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), is different from water vapor in that its concentration in the atmosphere is much the same all over the globe. CO2 currently accounts for about 7 percent of the atmosphere’s ability to intercept heat.” [Boldface added] (pp 50, 51) [This estimate assumes cloudiness, not clear skies.] Censorship Human Rights Commission’s call to regulate debate around climate change under fire Sky News host Paul Murray has fired up over the Australian Human Rights Commission’s call for regulation to climate change debate.

Part II By John Ridgway, Climate Etc., Sep 23, 2025 In an earlier essay I explained how positive feedbacks can lead to potentially problematic scientific monocultures. I also acknowledged that poor research design and data analysis had become commonplace within the behavioral sciences, largely as a result of a ‘natural selection’, driven by the career enhancement that comes with publication. However, I did not question whether there were any reward structures within climate science that may also have led to a natural selection for bad statistical practice. Fundamentals of Ocean pH By R. Cohen and W. Happer, CO2 Coalition, September 18, 2015 (republished November 21, 2021) Entire paper: https://co2coalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2015-Cohen-Happer-Fundamentals-of-Ocean-pH.pdf Open Letter to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Concerning Sustainable Livestock Development By Gregory Wrightstone, et al., CO2 Coalition, Aug 21, 2025 Are we going to die from climate change? More summer heat deaths in 854 European cities, screams a recent ‘study’. Greek hydrologist Demetris Koutsoyiannis debunks this most recent lie of what he calls the climalarmists. “Why did the authors not wait for the “actual 2025 death counts” before studying these?” By Demetris Koutsoyiannis, CLINTEL, Sep 22, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Challenging the Orthodoxy — RIP RIP Dr. Michael Connolly (1949-2025) By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 26, 2025 In particular, in 2015, they began a very fruitful collaboration with Dr. Willie Soon – then working at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. In 2018, Michael, Ronan and Willie decided to start a new international research group, the Center for Environmental Research and Earth Sciences (CERES-Science.com). Since then, CERES have published 41 peer-reviewed scientific papers, of which Michael co-authored 15, with many more in the pipeline – see here for the current list. Defending the Orthodoxy Every Democratic senator opposes EPA plan to axe endangerment finding By Lee Ann Anderson, The Hill, Sep 22, 2025 The administration used studies authored and published by scientists who deny the existence of climate change to justify the decision. The scientists behind the studies have been trying to plant seeds of doubt about climate change among the scientific community for years, according to CNN.

The coalition includes the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin; the Cities of Chicago, New York, and Oakland; the City and County of Denver; and the Counties of Martin Luther King Jr., the City and County of San Francisco, California; and the County of Santa Clara, California. On August 29, Attorney General Bonta joined a coalition of 19 attorneys general and the City of New York in filing an amicus brief in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Environmental Defense Fund v. Wright, supporting the plaintiffs in their effort to declare the Climate Working Group’s report unlawful. Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science Unmasking Climate Action at UN By Durwood Zaelke , Paul Bledsoe, Real Clear Energy, Sep 23, 2025 Already expensive and deadly climate impacts are increasingly undermining health and public safety, even as agricultural yields are under threat, water supplies are dwindling, and outdoor work is becoming untenable in many regions due to unbearable heat. Yet most concerning is that fast-rising global temperatures, which have rocketed past 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, a key Paris Climate Agreement goal, are now risking tipping points in natural systems that would yield a hot house planet with even more destructive climate impacts. [SEPP Comment: As with medieval sailors going too far from land, we are about to sail off the edge of the earth?] Questioning the Orthodoxy Why the Met Office cannot compare the summers of 1976 and 2025 By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 24, 2025 Ray Sanders exposes just why the Met Office’s temperatures comparisons with the past are not just meaningless but deliberately misleading: Duh what is plant? By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 Also, on a far more dramatic scale, the “oxygen catastrophe” somewhere over two billion years ago when the appearance of photosynthesis, initially a great triumph for plants, led to so much green stuff devouring CO2 and belching forth oxygen (that, believe it or not, is highly and disastrously reactive) and began wreaking havoc on simple organisms and their environment. China Promises Tiny Cuts In GHG Emissions By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 26, 2025 From the Telegraph: Under the new plan, the Chinese president said his country will reduce economy-wide emissions by 7-10 per cent by 2035 relative to the year of the country’s peak emissions, believed to be 2025. From Homewood: Whatever Xi promises now can be overturned in the twinkle of an eye when he is replaced as leader. They are not worth the paper they are written on. This is how Chinese politics works. [SEPP Comment: Will China’s emissions continue rising?] The only disaster losses in Australia due to climate change, are to CSIRO’s reputation By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Sep 26, 2025 Experts are wrong: After 58 years of emissions — disaster losses in Australia stay the same Tidbits By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 Meanwhile from the “Canada pivots but doesn’t” file, the National Post’s Tristin Hopper takes a look at “all the times the Liberals said they would build an oil pipeline”. And then didn’t. As he adds, despite declaring that by his various magic powers he will make Canada an energy superpower, conventional and alternative, and repeatedly suggesting that a pipeline could well be among them, Prime Minister Mark Carney finally unveiled his first five megamassive “nation building” mighty projects and… no pipeline. But fear not. We are a rhetorical superpower. Is National Academy of Sciences Squeezing Private Endowments to Fund Climate Alarmism?

[SEPP Comment: To understand real ambitions, don’t look at what they say, but at what they do.] Social Benefits of Carbon Dioxide Claim: Climate Change is Making Amazon Rainforest Trees Fatter By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 26, 2025 Link to paper: Increasing tree size across Amazonia By Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert, et al., Nature, Plants, Sep 25, 2025 From abstract: We assessed recent changes in the structure of Earth’s largest tropical forest by analyzing 30 years of Amazonian tree records across 188 mature forest plots. We find that, at a stand level, trees have become larger over time, with mean tree basal area increasing by 3.3% per decade (95% CI 2.4; 4.1). Larger trees have increased in both number and size, yet we observed similar rates of relative size gain in large and small trees. This evidence is consistent with a resource-driven boost for larger trees but also a reduction in suppression among smaller trees. These results, especially the persistence and consistency of tree size increases across Amazonian forest plots, communities and regions, indicate that any negative impacts of climate change on forests and large trees here have so far been mitigated by the positive effects of increased resources. The effect of additional CO2 on Narrowheart Lovegrass By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 From the CO2Science archive Problems in the Orthodoxy Big Advertising Joins Banks and Asset Managers in Ditching Sustainability By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 20, 2025 Study: “… high costs and risks …” Collapsed the Net Zero Banking Alliance By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 26, 2025 Link to paper: The Rise of Investor-Driven Climate Governance: From Myth to Institution? By Rami Kaplan, David L. Levy, Regulation & Governance, Feb 25, 2025 From abstract: However, ICG [Investor-driven climate governance] practices of disclosure and emission commitments became increasingly decoupled from actions to reduce emissions due to the weak business case for decarbonizing investors’ portfolios and corporate operations; the core economic mechanism was largely a myth. Some Greens finally admit they should be protesting against renewables, but are afraid of being called climate deniers By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Sep 23, 2025 Turns out National Policy is set by Namecalling Seeking a Common Ground Some Minimum Requirements for a Proper WOTUS Rule By Daren Bakst, Cornwall Alliance, Sep 17, 2025 Link to: Final Clarifying Definition of “Waters of the United States” By Staff, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Spring 2025 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of the Army are undertaking a rulemaking to revise key topics of the waters of the United States” definition in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, 598 U.S. 651 (2023), including continuous surface connection,” relatively permanent,” and jurisdictional versus non-jurisdictional ditches. These revisions focus on clarity, simplicity and improvements that will stand the test of time. [SEPP Comment: After over 50 years of confusion following the passage of the “Clean Water Act” in 1972, clear, simple rules defining Waters of the United States are much needed. It is ridiculous to have the courts decide.] Measurement Issues — Surface Sensational New Measurements of Uncorrupted Air Temperatures Destroy UK Met Office Constant Claims of ‘Records’ By Chris Morrison, The Daily Sceptic, Sep 22, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Link to: A Datum for Assessing ‘Spikes’ in PRT Data from Meteorological Office Sites By Eric Huxter, Frayed Ends Blog, Aug 29, 2025 Changing Weather Hurricane Bloating Discovery – No Global Warming Needed By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 Link to paper: Tropical cyclones expand faster at warmer relative sea surface temperature By Danyang Wang, et al., PNAS, Sep 15, 2025 From Watts: Before this work, scientists knew that some hurricanes expanded significantly during their lifetimes while others stayed compact. But the factors behind that difference were not well understood. Wang and Chavas showed that the rapid growth of storms is tied to “hot spots” in the ocean. These are localized areas where the water is significantly warmer than the surrounding tropical waters. The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season gave a striking example of why storm size matters. Hurricane Helene expanded rapidly before making landfall, ballooning into one of the largest storms in U.S. history at an estimated width of over 400 miles and causing unprecedented damage. Germany Sees Bumper 2025 Harvest As Earlier Climate Forecasts Of A “Hellish Summer” Fail By P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Sep 20, 2025 “In many places, the fruit trees across the country are laden with fruit. In some cases, they are so heavily laden that individual branches are breaking under the enormous weight,” the DWD reports. How Unusual Was This Summer? By Cliff Mass, Weather Blog, Sep 21, 2025 So, about those non-hurricanes… By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 Aces low By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 Changing Seas #HaveItBothWays: Atlantic cod stocks By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 If you are a Canadian of a certain vintage you will remember the 1992 cod moratorium in which a 500-year-old Newfoundland fishery was brought to a sudden halt as the cod population crashed, and the government had to take drastic steps to prevent complete extinction of the species. What was supposed to be a two-year suspension became permanent, although a small cod fishery was reopened in 2024. This being the 1990s, no one thought to blame climate change for the disappearance of the fish, instead pointing to the massive fishing fleets that had been emptying the oceans of everything that moved for decades. But never ones to pass up a chance, a group of climate scientists published a paper in 2003 based on, of course, climate models not real-world data, and it warned that ocean warming would speed up the decline of North Sea cod which were already almost all gone. Unfortunately for them, though maybe fortunately for the fish, the #HaveItBothWays rule soon kicked into gear. Latest Science Further Exposes Lies About Rising Seas By Vijay Jayaraj, WUWT, Sep 22, 2025 Changing Cryosphere – Land / Sea Ice Arctic Sea Ice Refuses To Disappear (Again!) By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 For sheer persistence in getting it wrong, however, the prize must go to Professor Peter Wadhams, Professor of Ocean Physics, and Head of the Polar Ocean Physics Group in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge: Arctic Sea Ice Minimum 2025: Another Year, Another Non-Event By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 Solar cycles, ocean oscillations (such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation), and shifting wind patterns all play into the distribution and persistence of Arctic ice. Pretending this is purely about CO₂ levels is simplistic at best and misleading at worst. As NSIDC itself admits, the flattening trend is still a subject of “active debate” among scientists. Perhaps it’s time for policymakers and journalists to debate it as well — instead of pretending the science is “settled.” So, about that rebounding ice By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 As we’ve mentioned, there are several ways to draw a trend line through complicated data including the one for Arctic ice. But they are not all equally valid. Even statistics involves some art as well as science. But it should not include hocus-pocus. In this regard we continue to insist, in the face of alarmists saying it’s long-term trends that matter, that it is in fact long-term trends that matter. And we also continue to insist, in this regard, that it is the dreaded cherry-picking to lean too hard on the fact that the modern satellite record coincides with a cyclical peak in Arctic ice around 1979 that cannot rationally be ascribed to human influence, since there is no plausible argument that we were cooling the planet from the 1940s through the 1970s, though at the time it was blamed on, yes, our burning fossil fuels by people who seem to start with the verdict that our civilization is evil, rapacious and self-destructive and work backwards to an indictment that fits the short-run evidence. Changing Earth Earth’s natural CO2 vacuum cleaners By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 20, 2025 Link to paper: Earth’s silicate weathering continuum By Gerrit Trapp-Müller, et al., Nature Geoscience, Aug 7, 2025 From the abstract: Chemical weathering of silicate rocks redistributes major, minor and trace elements through coupled dissolution–precipitation reactions. These weathering processes drive shifts in ocean acid–base chemistry, modulating atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and providing a stabilizing feedback in the carbon cycle. Silicate weathering occurs in both terrestrial and marine environments, releasing (‘forward’) or consuming alkalinity (‘reverse’), but these have largely been perceived as independent and studied in isolation.

Agriculture Issues & Fear of Famine World Cereal Output Set For all-Time High By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 [SEPP Comment: Apparently the UN IPCC ignores the reports of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.] Lowering Standards National Academies go preposterous on CO2 By David Wojick, CFACT, Sep 23, 2025 You would think the National Academy of Sciences understands science, but you would be wrong. Their president just approved a report whose conclusion is scientifically impossible! The report is jointly from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). Titled “Effects of Human-Caused Greenhouse Gas Emissions on U.S. Climate, Health, and Welfare,” this squirrelly tome is a formal comment on EPA’s proposed repeal of the 2009 Endangerment Finding. Clearly NASEM is no longer fit for purpose. Ideally, Congress should revoke its charter. At the least the President should issue an executive order instructing the federal agencies not to use NASEM. It has long been standard practice for agencies launching new programs to run them by NASEM for approval. This practice should stop. STEVE MILLOY: Rigged Report By National Academies Aims To Thwart Trump Energy Agenda By Steve Milloy, Daily Caller, Sep 21, 2025 There is not enough room in this column for a comprehensive critique of the NAS report, but here is just one other egregious example. Citing an EPA graph, the report asserts that heat waves have increased since the 1960s. But the report studiously avoids another more complete EPA graph showing that heatwaves have dramatically decreased since the 1930s. The Rocky Mountain Institute’s Climate & DEI Colonialism in Africa By Ken Braun, Real Clear Energy, Sep 23, 2025 According to Our World in Data, there are 677.4 million people living without “an electricity source that can provide very basic lighting and charge a phone or power a radio for 4 hours per day.” Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa, and 156 million of these desperate souls—23% of the world total—reside in those three nations set to receive RMI’s “women energy practitioners.” But rather than bringing genuine and desperately needed energy to Africa, the Rocky Mountain Institute and its deeply deluded donors are offering unreliable renewables delivered by a women-only DEI initiative.

Claim: Aussie Climate Refugees are Moving to Tasmania By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Sep 24, 2025 So, despite the ABC’s attempt to make it look like climate change is driving a demographic shift to colder states, this is no more happening in Australia than it is in the USA. Warm lifestyle states like Queensland and Florida both enjoy strong population growth and will continue to be a favorite destination for the foreseeable future.

NPR warned of “irreversible” sea-level rise in 2023, ignoring tide gauge records that show no acceleration beyond historical norms. News outlets regularly report on “unprecedented” floods, yet data indicate no uptick in floods due to climate change. Communicating Better to the Public – Use Propaganda on Children Waves of conformism By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 Speaking of long-term trends and data, the cool kids or at this point the hot kids are all independently stampeding to attribution science, a form of hocus-pocus that bypasses evidence to get the verdict in question. For instance “Recent Canadian heat waves made much more likely by human-caused climate change” from Environment and Climate Change Canada. Which you might think means they have data proving they are happening more often. Pfft. This is attribution science, where all you only need models, not data.

Click to access britain-s-high-energy-bills_-the-permacrisis-that-keeps-on-burning-6.pdf The survey and focus groups referenced in this report and the writing of this report has been funded by Octopus Energy. More in Common has maintained, as is the case for all of our partnership work, full editorial independence when conducting this research and writing this report. The views expressed within this report are therefore the views of More in Common. From Cousins: Contrary to what critics claim, opposition to renewables is not an anti-climate science or ideological position. Green energy is capital-intensive, infrastructure-heavy, and drives extraordinary system inefficiency. Even if turbines and panels fall in price, the total bill to consumers will remain higher than the legacy model of baseload generation. Britain’s industrial disaster By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 20, 2025 Questioning Green Elsewhere Admitting the obvious By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Sep 24, 2025 We also like advocates of wind and solar thinking and talking about the physics and engineering of grid stability. If they really can make it work, if they can overcome problems of scale and distribution and battery technology leaps forward and so on, we could be persuaded that wind and solar have a bright future. But we really do need to see the practicalities acknowledged and analyzed. Including the very basic point that, when you get down to such things, it’s complicated, especially given the ways in which subsidies distort the picture. And that one thing that’s certainly complicated, for them anyway, is that the “green energy transition” at least coincided with, if it did not cause, a vast surge in the cost of power.

Judicial Limits on Glyphosate and Climate ‘Jackpot Justice’ Litigation Narrowly defined decision provides guidance on ‘evidence’ for alleged cause of harm By Paul Driessen, WUWT, Sep 23, 2025 Although the US Supreme Court frequently overrules it, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (covering California, eight other western states and two US territories) deserves applause for its recent Engilis v. Monsanto decision. The Fallacy of ‘Exxon Knew” (Part II) By Robert Bradley Jr. Master Resource, Sep 24, 2025 Part I, Sep 23, 2025 Bradley: This memo from certain employees never made it to a company position for cause. Global cooling was the bigger concern back then, and the above memo did not investigate the SO2 offset, much less the benefits from CO2 fertilization and incremental warming. Peak Oil and Peak Gas was the intellectual/practical concern of this era. [SEPP Comment: The memo is dated October 16, 1979. The administration of President Carter (1977 to 1981) and Congress passed laws advocating the use of coal to replace oil and natural gas, which, based on faulty models, Washington feared would soon be exhausted.] Subsidies and Mandates Forever Congressional testimony reveals the hidden causes behind America’s looming $38 billion energy rate hikes: ‘If things keep going like this, [bills] are gonna be higher next year’ “The U.S. is falling far behind global competitors.” By Kristen Lawrence, The Cool Down, Sep 16, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] On top of all these reasons for soaring energy rates, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is making electricity more expensive by phasing out tax credits for clean energy, such as solar and wind power, resulting in slower construction of renewable projects and restricting the supply of affordable power. [SEPP Comment: If wind and solar are low cost, why are subsidies needed?] Offshore windfarm receives £2bn subsidies in just six years Press release, Net Zero Watch, Sep 26, 2025 As a result, Hornsea 1 is currently receiving a guaranteed £200 per megawatt hour for its power, nearly three times current market prices. Energy Issues – Non-US New LCCC Dashboards By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 23, 2025 They cover CfDs [Contracts for Difference] and Capacity Market stuff amongst other things. I’ll have a play around, but it seems they avoid an awful lot of legwork and analysis which I have been doing on spreadsheets. I’ve shown below a typical CfD graph, which shows subsidy costs by quarter, and the quarterly market price. I would recommend using it to convince doubters, as it is the official source. London Array Subsidies Hit £300 Million Last Year By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 At current prices, London Array has been paid £3.6 billion in subsidies since it opened in 2013.

Batteries cannot supply any power, as power is generated somewhere else first. That electricity still has to be paid for in addition to the costs of the battery storage. The “BESS” DELUSION: Why battery storage is a FANTASY By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 22, 2025 [SEPP Comment: Video about Eastern Australia going wind and solar – 12 million MWh of battery storage needed? At what cost?] Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Vehicles Porsche delays new electric car after demand slump By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 20, 2025 Carbon Schemes Pouring Money Down The CO2 Drain By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Sep 25, 2025 The Government has just announced two more carbon capture projects: It goes without saying that spending taxpayer money on non-jobs, that create no added value for the economy, will act as a brake on economic growth in the long run. I cannot think of anything more stupid than to dig a big hole and bury money in it! California Dreaming California’s Latest Climate Theater: Newsom Signs Another Expensive Illusion By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 21, 2025 The core of the package is an extension of the cap-and-trade program—rebranded “cap-and-invest”—all the way to 2045. That rebranding glosses over that the structure is largely the same: companies must either reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, buy emission allowances, or invest in offsets. The revenues from auctioning allowances are then redistributed (some), invested (many), or spent (often). In recent years, those auctions have raised between $3 billion and $4.3 billion annually. These revenues fund programs ranging from wildfire prevention to transportation, housing, and utility credits. California Dems Scramble To Boost Oil Production After Running Refiners Out Of Town By Audrey Streb, Daily Caller, Sep 19, 2025 “After years of pushing radical climate policies that punished working families, Governor Newsom is finally waking up to what Californians need, he’s now scrambling to secure the very fossil fuels he tried to eliminate,” CEO of the American Energy Institute Jason Isaac told the Daily Caller News Foundation previously. “This sudden embrace of petroleum isn’t leadership, it’s survival. California’s energy future depends on realism, not green delusions.” The Cost and the Upside of the “Big Gulp” By Edward Ring, What’s Current, Accessed Sep 25, 2025 Link to study: A New Approach to Accounting for Environmental Water: Insights from the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta By Greg Gartrell, Public Policy Institute of California, November 2017 Click to access r_1117ggr.pdf Other Scientific News NASA, NOAA Launch Three Spacecraft to Map Sun’s Influence Across Space By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Sep 25, 2025 Over the next few months, the spacecraft will make their way to their destination — a location between Earth and the Sun, about a million miles from Earth, called Lagrange point 1 (L1). They should arrive by January and, once their instrument checkouts and calibrations are complete, begin their missions to better understand space weather and protect humanity. Forest Composition and Fire History In Light of New Evidence By Don Healy, WUWT, Sep 25, 2025 Link to paper: The North American tree-ring fire-scar network By Ellis Q. Margolis, et al., Ecosphere, 2022 From the abstract: The historical influence of Indigenous and non-Indigenous human land use on fire regimes varies in space and time. A 20th century fire deficit associated with human activities is evident in many regions, yet fire regimes characterized by frequent surface fires are still active in some areas (e.g., Mexico and the southeastern United States). From Healy: Implications for Fire Management – The paper likely argues for integrating Indigenous fire stewardship into contemporary land management—not just as a cultural restoration, but as an ecological necessity. – It challenges dominant narratives that treat fire as inherently destructive, instead reframing it as a regenerative force when guided by traditional ecological knowledge.

Public health departments warn against lone star ticks and AGS, and scientists are working to develop an inoculation to AGS. Herein, we argue that if eating meat is morally impermissible, then efforts to prevent the spread of tickborne AGS are also morally impermissible. Quit Promoting Mad Schemes, New York Times, Blocking the Sun is a Dangerous Climate Gamble By Anthony Watts, Climate Realism, Sep 25, 2025 In The New York Times’ (NYT) op-ed, “Turns Out Air Pollution Was Good for Something,” Zeke Hausfather and David Keith argue that because sulfur particles from past industrial pollution once cooled the planet by reflecting sunlight, policymakers should now consider a deliberate version of that process. They suggest aircraft could inject sulfur into the upper atmosphere to mimic the cooling once provided by dirty smokestacks, pointing to volcanic eruptions such as Mount Pinatubo in 1991 as evidence the method would work.

Reading a new biography of Mark Twain. When he was 60 (I think in 1995) he started a world tour where he’d give talks on stage. It started with a train ride across the northern states of America with some stops in Canada. Along the entire trip- everyone was complaining about the smoke from Canadian forest fires- and the “extreme” heat. But… but… I thought bad weather and huge forest fires only started after WWII! /s nit pick: NaOH (sodium hydroxide) is commonly known as Lye, not KOH as stated above.
