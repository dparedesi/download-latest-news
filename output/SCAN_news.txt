Investing Home Depot (HD) could benefit whether buyers remain locked in homes (driving renovations) or rates drop (spurring purchases). Lennar and other homebuilders now offer mortgage buydowns and free upgrades as elevated rates compress margins and deter buyers. Home Depot and Lowe’s (LOW) face potential upside if the lock-in effect drives homeowners to invest in upgrades instead of moving. Sending You to Google News in 3 © saweang.w / Shutterstock.com As we kick off a new year, the thought process many investors may have is which sectors or areas of the economy will be the places to invest. After all, various macro dynamics have changed a great deal in recent months, and this year is shaping up to be much different than 2025 in a number of ways. Aside from the ongoing geopolitical turmoil we’ve seen, as well as concerns around inflation driven by quickly-changing tariff and trade policies, the direction of monetary policy coming out of the Federal Reserve could be the hot topic many will be watching very closely. Given president Trump’s views on interest rates (namely, that they’re way too high right now), a pressure campaign is still being waged on the Fed to drop rates, and do so quickly. I’m not so sure the president will have as much say on interest rates as overall economic developments will. But one thing I will be watching that will likely determine monetary policy decisions will be the labor market, which has been weakening at a rapid pace. For those who think interest rates are likely to come down because of (or in spite of) president Trump’s rhetoric, here’s why the construction sector is one to watch this year. Interest rate visual With three consecutive 25 basis point (0.25%) interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve to end fiscal 2025, plenty of investors may be looking at interest rate-sensitive areas of the economy to put some capital to work in, come the New Year. It think construction-related companies could be among the biggest beneficiaries of this trend. Indeed, home sales continue to slow, as prices remain high (but look to be coming down in some key metropolitan markets across the country). In order for these trends to reverse, and for buyers to come off the sidelines, many experts have suggested that interest rates would need to come down to a 5-handle to encourage greater activity. For new home builders, interest rates have become the key headwind for profitability and earnings growth in recent quarters. Builders are now having to resort to providing builder financing, or buying down mortgage rates, to entice new homebuyers to take on their inventory. What that’s led to is an interesting dynamic where, in certain markets, new homes are now selling for effectively less than existing homes – something that generally shouldn’t be possible, considering the depreciating value of hard assets such as real estate. That said, if Trump’s new pick for Fed chair does indeed follow his lead and lower interest rates aggressively at the front end of the curve (whether spurred by further economic weakness or not), it will be interesting to see if long bonds (mortgage rates generally follow the 10-Year Treasury yield, not short-term overnight rates set by the Fed) will follow. For those who think they will, this is a trade potentially worth putting on. Real estate agent passing keys to a new homebuyer New supply of homes are coming on the market, with many homeowners who are looking to lock in the gains they saw following a pandemic-driven frenzy seemingly wanting to do so before prices drop. In some areas of the real estate market (such as condos in key metropolitan areas in Florida and other states), prices are falling. So, the time to offload some inventory (either for individual homeowners or builders) appears to be closing. That said, despite this new supply, the reality that prices remain elevated compared to historical income standards, in mortgage rates are still near the highest levels they’ve been in a decade, has led to an affordability crisis where few homeowners are willing to buy. This has depressed margins for new homebuilders such as Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and others, who are being forced to offer significant incentives such as mortgage rate buy downs and free upgrades to get buyers to pull the trigger. That said, I think despite slightly softening prices across the board, we could be due for a reasonably solid year for homebuilders and other companies tied to the construction trade. Retailers like Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOWE) could see a resurgence of business, if those who feel locked into their homes are willing to put the necessary upgrades in to maintain their place of residence. The lock-in effect is real, but if we’re all going to be locked into our place for years to come, I think the recent declines these stocks have seen may provide a buying opportunity for those thinking long-term. Judge banging his gavel on a desk The reality is that the housing market is a very difficult and complex animal to analyze. Broad supply and demand metrics are a good starting point. But this market is made up of millions of individuals, each making the best decisions for them and their families. With that in mind, I think investors may be looking too closely at the macro data, and not enough at home homeowners are actually making their purchase decisions. If home buying activity slows down, home renovation stocks like Home Depot and Lowe’s could be screaming buys. But if interest rates come down, that’s a broad-based catalyst for all stocks in this space, providing the rising tide that should lift all boats. Overall, I’m looking most closely at Home Depot in particular of the three stocks I mentioned in this article as a potential winner in 2026. That’s because no matter what happens, I think this is a retailer with upside potential that’s not being priced in presently. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Investing SoFi (SOFI) gained 85% in 2025 and hit an all-time high of $32.73. The stock now trades at $27.46. SoFi reported Q3 revenue of $950M (up 37.7% year over year) and added 35% more users to reach 12.6M members. SoFi launched SoFi Crypto in November as the first chartered bank enabling crypto transactions. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Courtesy of Social Finance, Inc. Stocks have had a wild ride in 2025. While it wasn’t a smooth year, the stock market remained resilient despite the ups and downs. With the onset of the new year, there’s an opportunity for you to take a look at your portfolio and consider the changes you need to make. If you’re willing to add new stocks to your portfolio, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) is one fintech stock worth considering. SoFi Technologies is one of the most disruptive names in the industry. It has attracted young users and become a ‘one-stop shop’ for all things money. Users can save, invest, spend, and budget on the SoFi app. 2025 has been the best year ever for SoFi Technologies, as its shares hit an all-time high of $32.73. The fintech stock gained 85% in 2025 and is now trading below its all-time high at $27.46. It started in 2025 at $14 and ended the year at $26. Is more upside possible? Should you buy the stock while it is below $40? Here’s why I think SOFI is one of the top fintech stocks to own this year. SoFi has gone beyond the traditional business of consumer lending and has now built impressive technology and infrastructure capabilities that steadily attract users. The company has been growing across different metrics, and its management has ensured consistent expansion of the ecosystem. The company first beat revenue expectations in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the market believes that it will continue doing so in 2026. Further, in the fourth quarter results, SoFi will inch closer to the milestone of $1 billion in quarterly sales. It has delivered strong financials for the third quarter. SOFI recorded a 35% jump in the number of users and a 36% year-over-year jump in the number of products. Since the number of products has surpassed the number of users, it shows that SOFI continues to sell services to existing customers. It reported an EPS of $0.11 and a revenue of $950 million, up 37.7% year over year. The net income came in at $139 million, and it ended the quarter with a record 12.6 million members. For the full year, the management now expects to add about 3.5 million new members. Its financial services segment revenue saw a 76% year-over-year jump, while the technology platform segment saw a 12% jump, and the lending segment saw a 25% rise. Analysts expect SoFi to generate a revenue of $985 million in the upcoming fourth-quarter results. The company is set to announce results on January 30. SoFi is expanding into the digital assets segment and launched SoFi Crypto in November, the first chartered bank that allows consumers to make transactions using crypto assets. Further, in December, it launched SoFiUSD, a stablecoin space. One of the biggest reasons to buy SOFI is the strong leadership and management execution. Everything has gone right for the company since 2023, and it consistently beats Wall Street forecasts. The management continues to boost guidance, strengthening its market position and showing that it has massive potential for the long term. SashaMagic / Shutterstock.com SOFI has been trading between $25 and $30 over the past few months. However, a strong fourth-quarter report could boost the stock and push it beyond $30. SOFI has the potential to deliver extraordinarily and beat market expectations quarter after quarter. The company is in growth mode and on the cusp of significant gains. While the stock is valued at a premium, there is a strong chance of steady upside. If you already own SOFI shares, it will be worth holding on to them for the long term. The stock has the potential to double your money. If you’re interested in riding the fintech wave, do not wait for a bottom in the stock. SOFI could have another impressive run in 2026.

Title: SpaceX, Private Ventures Fuel Elon Musk’s Trillion-Dollar Dreams
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/elon-musks-private-ventures-pave-path-toward-trillionaire-status/
Time Published: 2026-01-04T05:01:00Z

Tesla’s sleek cars and futuristic trucks have defined Elon Musk’s public image, but SpaceX is the real engine behind his growing net worth. Jennifer Ablan Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Elon Musk, often described as a modern-day Thomas Edison, may soon add an unprecedented title to his résumé: the world’s first trillionaire. Tesla’s sleek cars and futuristic trucks have defined his public image, but SpaceX is the real engine behind his growing net worth. The buzz around a potential IPO valued at as much as $1.5 trillion for the high-flying government contractor has emerged as the primary swing factor in the entrepreneur’s net worth at the same time that Tesla shareholders have approved a massive, performance-based compensation package that could significantly expand his stake in the electric-car maker. Together, these developments have shifted Musk’s path to extreme wealth from incremental gains to a handful of high-stakes corporate milestones. Musk’s net worth has surged nearly 50% year over year to an estimated $645 billion. In October, he became the first individual to surpass a $500 billion net worth, propelled by rising private-market valuations for SpaceX and renewed confidence in Tesla’s long-term strategy. If Musk meets the aggressive performance targets tied to his Tesla compensation plan, and if SpaceX continues on its current trajectory, he could break the trillion-dollar barrier. Such an accomplishment would test the upper bounds of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, created and named when the idea of a trillionaire still seemed unfathomable and absurd. Now, it no longer does. Already, Musk has been cast front and center, most recently by Forbes, as the maestro of this era’s wealth creation. SpaceX, which has invested aggressively in reusable rockets, launch infrastructure, and satellites, is the single largest lever in the trillionaire equation. Musk owns an estimated 42% of the private rocket and satellite company, which recent secondary share transactions have valued at $350 billion to $800 billion in private markets; that makes his stake worth roughly $136 billion to more than $300 billion on paper today. The real upside comes from long-term growth and the potential for a public offering; if SpaceX lists at valuations some analysts forecast (up to about $1.5 trillion), Musk’s stake alone could exceed $600 billion, reshaping his net worth significantly. Indeed, Starlink has rapidly become the financial backbone of SpaceX. The satellite internet service has added 1 million new customers in under seven weeks, bringing its total to more than 9 million active users across 155 countries and territories, according to the company, implying a growth rate of more than 20,000 new users per day since early November. That momentum caps an explosive year. In December 2024, SpaceX reported 4.6 million Starlink customers; by August 2025, the figure had climbed to 7 million, before accelerating sharply in recent months. The service now operates on a constellation of more than 9,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites, enabling broadband connectivity in rural, maritime, aviation, and defense-critical regions beyond the reach of traditional networks (For my part, I can now use Wi-Fi on routes to and from New York and Hawaii, even over the Pacific Ocean — something that was previously impossible — because of Starlink.) Musk has said Starlink is now “by far” the largest driver of SpaceX’s revenue — a distinction that has materially altered how investors assess the company. While SpaceX and Starlink represent the transformational upside, Tesla remains a critical component of Musk’s wealth trajectory. His 2018 compensation package, revived after the Delaware Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that had voided it, entitles Musk to acquire stock options tied to ambitious operational and market-capitalization milestones. Most of those milestones have already been achieved, giving Musk the right to purchase roughly 304 million Tesla shares at deeply discounted prices, currently valued at approximately $139 billion. Adding to this, Tesla’s shareholders have also approved a new performance-based pay plan, further increasing Musk’s potential upside and consolidating his control over the company. If fully realized, these packages could add hundreds of billions in theoretical value, though the actual gain depends on hitting aggressive targets and on public-market conditions. All told, the new performance plan positions Musk to unlock value as Tesla begins monetizing AI-driven initiatives, including full self-driving, autonomous fleet operations and robotics. In this framework, Tesla serves as an accelerant rather than the primary driver of Musk’s net worth. Its gains are meaningful but incremental, constrained by stock performance, earnings multiples and investor sentiment. SpaceX, by contrast, offers the potential for sudden, transformative gains: an IPO, Starlink expansion or secondary-market repricing could add hundreds of billions almost overnight. “Heading into 2026, this marks a monster year for Tesla and Musk as the autonomous and robotics chapter begins,” analyst Dan Ives writes in his latest report on Top 5 Names to Play the AI Revolution into 2026. “The AI valuation will start to get unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next six to nine months has now begun, with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla’s installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose for Musk & Co. We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year, and in a bull-case scenario, $3 trillion by the end of 2026.” Beyond Tesla and SpaceX, Musk holds stakes in several ventures that extend both financial upside and strategic influence, positioning him across AI, social platforms, neurotechnology and infrastructure: In true “Musk fashion,” the venture was inspired when Musk was stuck in LA traffic. Since the 1980s, Citgo Petroleum has operated as the US-based subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil and gas company. The official unveiling of Nvidia’s new chip architecture, dubbed the Vera Rubin, wasn’t expected until later this spring. Bitcoin ETFs just notched $697 million worth of inflows on Monday, their biggest gain since early October. Artificial intelligence-powered bots’ big presence at CES belies the tech industry’s expectations to turn a profit on them. Greg Abel earned Warren Buffett’s trust and, eventually, his job. Here’s what you need to know about Berkshire Hathaway’s new, lower-key CEO. Bitcoin, the No. 1 crypto by market cap, hasn’t recovered from a flash crash, chopping more than $1 trillion from the broader sector’s value. With an estimated half a million workers needed to fill the construction industry’s labor shortages, AI investments this year may get stalled. US automakers General Motors, Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) and Ford are bracing for slowing sales in 2026 amid rising unemployment. The last three months of 2025 are only the start of a downturn for EV sales: The pace is expected to keep slowing next year. Despite initial concern from motorists, robotaxi services are finding plenty of passengers as they expand across the country. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs proved they’re still the go-to middlemen for Wall Street deals amid a near-record $4.8 trillion global M&A bonanza Forecasters predict gold’s rally will stretch through December 2026, although one analysis says there’s reason for caution. © 2026 The Daily Upside
