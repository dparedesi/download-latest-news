Manage your account ... The 2025-26 NBA season is almost here, and with it comes my position-by-position fantasy basketball tiers, starting with the guards. This guide is points-league focused but includes insights for category formats as well. [Join or create a fantasy basketball league for the 2025-26 NBA season] Let's kick it off with two players who will drive much of the MVP conversation this season. Editor's note: Players are listed based on their primary position from last season or projected role this year. Luka Dončić, Los Angeles Lakers Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder Luka Dončić: Luka enters his first full Lakers season healthy and in shape, ready to deliver close to a nightly 30-point triple-double. Even in a down year, he dropped 28-8-8. His blend of usage, shot volume and all-around production makes him one of the safest fantasy picks available. With efficiency improvements and better conditioning, he could push for a top-three finish across formats. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: SGA and Luka were the only guards to average over 50 FPPG last season. After a legendary season finishing as the scoring leader, MVP, Finals MVP and champion, SGA's floor is top five across all formats. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves Cade Cunningham, Detroit Pistons Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks Devin Booker, Phoenix Suns Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers James Harden, Los Angeles Clippers Anthony Edwards: Edwards continues his ascent as Minnesota’s offensive centerpiece, combining highlight-reel finishes with steady statistical growth. His scoring is already elite, but his rebounds and assists have begun to rise, too. With another leap in efficiency, Edwards could join Tier 1 next season. Cade Cunningham: There's a chance Cunningham can sneak into the elites. He averaged 48 FPPG last season, so another leap forward for him and the Pistons in a weaker Eastern Conference can push him into 50 FPPG territory. Devin Booker: The only thing preventing Booker from being a savage offensively is a possible late-season tank. I don't see it happening, so expect Booker to put up top-tier points and assist numbers. Trae Young: Trae’s elite assists and scoring floor make him one of the best points-league guards. Turnovers and poor shooting don’t impact his value as much, so bank on him being one of the few players getting at least 24 points and 10 assists a night. Tyrese Maxey: I'm higher on Maxey than the consensus. Maxey posted the sixth-most FPPG among guards last year. Those numbers are going up with Joel Embiid and Paul George undoubtedly missing games. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors De’Aaron Fox, San Antonio Spurs Jalen Brunson, New York Knicks LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets Donovan Mitchell, Cleveland Cavaliers Stephen Curry: I'd draft Curry higher in category leagues than points because his 3s and high FT% are more statistically relevant. Still, he'll likely be a top-10 scorer in the NBA who also generates enough counting stats elsewhere to warrant an early pick in points leagues. De’Aaron Fox: Fox gets a full offseason to prepare to play with Victor Wembanyama, so an uptick in assists as the primary creator elevates his value. He finished in the top 10 in FPPG among guards last season, averaging 41 FPPG. Jalen Brunson: The engine for the Knicks has one of the safest floors for a guard. He'll likely go in the first three rounds of drafts, but be aware that the minutes are likely to dip under new HC Mike Brown. LaMelo Ball: Injuries always hold him back, and it's reflected in his ADP. When healthy, though, Ball is capable of being a top-10 scorer amongst guards in FPPG. Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies Tyler Herro, Miami Heat Josh Giddey, Chicago Bulls Jamal Murray, Denver Nuggets Amen Thompson, Houston Rockets Desmond Bane, Orlando Magic Derrick White, Boston Celtics Brandon Miller, Charlotte Hornets Ja Morant: Few guards are as explosive as Morant, capable of putting up 25/7/5 lines on any given night. The risk is obvious — injuries and off-court issues — but the reward is massive if he plays 65+ games. He’s a swing pick with league-winning upside. He's way better for points formats since you can ignore the poor FT shooting, turnovers and lack of 3s. Josh Giddey: He inked a new contract, plus was one of three players to average at least 8.0 rebounds and 7.0 assists per game last year. The other two? Luka and Nikola Jokić. Giddey can push for over 40 FPPG this year. Amen Thompson: With Jalen Green gone, Thompson steps into a bigger role in Houston’s offense. His rebounding and defensive stocks make him an unusual fantasy guard with multi-category upside. If his jumper stabilizes, it'll more than justify a third-round selection, even for points leagues. Desmond Bane: Bane is a solid 30-35 FPPG scorer, but he'll be in a new environment, playing alongside Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner. I prefer Bane in category leagues, but he'll have the counting stats to warrant a pick around the fourth or fifth round. Jalen Green, Phoenix Suns Cam Thomas, Brooklyn Nets Darius Garland, Cleveland Cavaliers Austin Reaves, Los Angeles Lakers Jordan Poole, New Orleans Pelicans Zach LaVine, Sacramento Kings Dyson Daniels, Atlanta Hawks Coby White, Chicago Bulls Fred VanVleet, Houston Rockets Anfernee Simons, Boston Celtics Jalen Green: Green gets a huge bump after getting traded to the Suns. Volume is king for points leagues and he'll get plenty of opportunities as the secondary option to Booker. He's much better for points than category leagues. Cam Thomas: Thomas still hasn't signed his qualifying offer with the Nets. We'll have to wait and see how long his contract situation plays out. Thomas and Michael Porter Jr. are going to have a ton of scoring opportunities playing for Brooklyn. Darius Garland: Garland should be a tier higher, but he underwent surgery on his toe in June with a recovery timeline of 4-5 months. I don't expect to see him in uniform until November. When fully healthy, he should average north of 35 FPPG. Dyson Daniels: The NBA's Most Improved Player took a massive step forward last season. However, Jalen Johnson was hurt for the majority of the season, and the team wasn't as equipped as it is now. I'm expecting some regression despite Daniels averaging 37 FPPG in 2024-25. Fred VanVleet: FVV loses value in points leagues because his 3s, steals and FT% don't carry as much weight. Still, he's a useful PG capable of putting up at least 30 FPPG. Immanuel Quickley, Toronto Raptors Andrew Nembhard, Indiana Pacers Jalen Suggs, Orlando Mag Payton Pritchard, Boston Celtics CJ McCollum, Washington Wizards Bennedict Mathurin, Indiana Pacers Norman Powell, Miami Heat Bradley Beal, Los Angeles Clippers Shaedon Sharpe, Portland Trail Blazers Christian Braun, Denver Nuggets Immanuel Quickley: Quickley is looking to bounce back from an injury-riddled campaign. He averaged 31 FPPG when he played, so it's something to build off of playing with Scottie Barnes, Brandon Ingram and Jakob Poeltl. Andrew Nembhard: Nembhard is one of my favorite breakout candidates with Tyrese Haliburton being ruled out for the season. His skill set fits better with category leagues, but I'd also consider getting shares in points leagues. CJ McCollum: McCollum's ADP is just outside the top 100 over the past seven days on Yahoo. He's becoming a value, especially for points leagues. I think he'll play a lot of minutes for the Wizards until a mid-season trade likely sends him to a contender. Shaedon Sharpe: Sharpe’s athleticism pops every night, and he’s starting to find consistency as a scorer. Portland is giving him freedom to develop, which means more usage. He's on the verge of becoming a 20-point scorer in this League. Kevin Porter Jr., Milwaukee Bucks Keyonte George, Utah Jazz D’Angelo Russell, Dallas Mavericks Jaden Ivey, Detroit Pistons Stephon Castle, San Antonio Spurs Brandin Podziemski, Golden State Warriors Ayo Dosunmu, Chicago Bulls Davion Mitchell, Miami Heat Isaiah Collier, Utah Jazz Quentin Grimes, Philadelphia 76ers Malik Monk, Sacramento Kings Keyonte George: George had growing pains last year, but his court vision and scoring style — reminiscent of Jordan Clarkson — make him worth the gamble. If his efficiency stabilizes, he could jump to Tier 6 quickly. Brandin Podziemski: Podziemski is one of the rare guards who rebounds like a forward. Golden State trusts him with meaningful minutes, which ensures a solid floor. If Curry misses time, his value skyrockets. Stephon Castle: Castle will start at SG and offers some nice counting-stat potential heading into his second NBA season. He's a better asset for points leagues because his efficiency and lack of 3s remain an issue. Davion Mitchell: Once he was traded to the Heat last year, he was finally able to carve out a meaningful role. His defense is infectious and he looked far more comfortable shooting the ball and acting as a primary facilitator than he did with the Kings and Raptors. He's one of my sleepers whom I'll be selecting in the later rounds of drafts. Scoot Henderson, Portland Trail Blazers Cason Wallace, Oklahoma City Thunder Jared McCain, Philadelphia 76ers Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Atlanta Hawks Reed Sheppard, Houston Rockets Tre Johnson, Washington Wizards Anthony Black, Orlando Magic VJ Edgecombe, Philadelphia 76ers Rob Dillingham, Minnesota Timberwolves Bub Carrington, Washington Wizards Scoot Henderson: Henderson’s early career journey has been volatile. Bringing in Jrue Holiday likely puts him back on the bench. Perhaps a sixth-man role could pan out. Either way, he's better for points leagues than category if he continues getting 27 minutes a night. Cason Wallace: Wallace thrives as a low-mistake, high-efficiency rotation guard. OKC trusts him in high-leverage minutes, which locks in his role. I think we'll see his role expand this season, making him a fantasy asset in more category leagues than points leagues. Tre Johnson: Outside of Cooper Flagg, Johnson has a legitimate shot at Rookie of the Year. The injury to Bilal Coulibaly should expedite his fantasy impact as well. Rob Dillingham: The second-year guard looked great at Summer League. Mike Conley is getting older and Nickeil Alexander-Walker left in free agency, so they'll need Dillingham's speed and scoring punch off the bench. He's a bucket who will emerge as a points league guy this year. Russell Westbrook III, Free agent Donte DiVincenzo, Minnesota Timberwolves T.J. McConnell, Indiana Pacers Chris Paul, Los Angeles Clippers Jrue Holiday, Portland Trail Blazers Klay Thompson, Dallas Mavericks Collin Sexton, Charlotte Hornets Alex Caruso, Oklahoma City Thunder Caris LeVert, Detroit Pistons

Title: Can Natera Stock Reach $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/can-natera-stock-reach-500/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T14:00:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Let's start with something remarkable. Natera (NASDAQ: NTRA) just marked its 10th anniversary as a public company, and what a journey it has been. The stock has delivered nearly 10x returns, rising from its $18 IPO price to around $170 today. Even more impressive, revenues have also expanded about 10-fold from $190 million to $2 billion. And the momentum hasn’t slowed — revenue growth over the last twelve months was a stellar 44%. So, what’s fueling this growth? It comes down to one word: intelligence — specifically, medical intelligence. Natera has placed itself at the forefront of molecular diagnostics, especially in cancer detection and monitoring. Think of them as medical detectives, helping doctors detect issues at the genomic level before they become life-threatening emergencies. The company focuses on three main areas: women’s health, oncology, and organ health. Their flagship product, Signatera, is a game-changer. This personalized tumor-informed test uses a simple blood draw to detect circulating tumor DNA and monitor for molecular residual disease across multiple cancer types, including breast, lung, ovarian, colorectal, and bladder cancers. This isn’t just an incremental improvement — it’s a revolutionary technology transforming how oncologists monitor their patients. But what makes their technology stand out? Its beauty lies in its simplicity and precision. Rather than invasive procedures, patients undergo a simple blood draw — a liquid biopsy. But this isn’t an ordinary blood test. Natera’s platform can detect tiny fragments of tumor DNA circulating in the bloodstream, offering doctors unprecedented insight into cancer progression and recurrence risk. Beyond Signatera, Natera also offers Altera for genomic profiling and Empower for hereditary cancer screening — creating a comprehensive suite that covers the entire cancer care spectrum. Before we dive into Natera stock’s specific metrics, it’s worth noting an important reality: investing in high-growth companies like Natera comes with volatility. While the upside can be significant, the ride is often bumpy. If you want high-quality growth with lower volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark — a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes — with returns exceeding 91% since inception. This diversified approach provides exposure to high-quality growth names while managing single-stock risk. On a separate note, see – What’s Happening With ABBV Stock? Now, let’s explore why Natera’s story is so compelling. Here’s where things get exciting. In the latest quarter, Natera processed over 850,000 tests, generating $546.6 million in revenue. About 22% of these tests were oncology-related, and this segment is growing at 50% year-over-year. This is the key engine driving future growth. Let’s zoom out. Cancer recurrence is every survivor’s worst fear, yet traditional monitoring often leaves patients waiting months for clarity. Nearly 19 million U.S. cancer survivors live in constant uncertainty between scans. They need better tools to track their cancer status, representing a massive market that will require sophisticated monitoring for decades to come. Now, we believe Natera can sustain 25% annual revenue growth over the next few years. That would boost revenue from about $1.7 billion last year to around $7 billion in 2030 — a 4x increase. For context, they’ve grown revenue at an average of 40% over the past three years, so 25% is actually not that aggressive. You might ask — is there room for a company this size to keep growing? Absolutely. The cell-free DNA testing market — which includes what Signatera does — is expected to almost double from $11 billion today to around $20 billion within five years. [1] Natera isn’t just riding this wave — they’re helping shape it. Consider the competition: Roche leads diagnostics with $16+ billion in revenue, followed by Danaher at $10 billion and Abbott at $9 billion. Natera’s $2 billion shows they’re still in the early innings of their growth story. The growth path breaks down into several key areas: How could $7 billion in revenue translate to a $500+ stock price? The math is compelling. If Natera hits $7 billion while maintaining its current price-to-sales multiple of 13x, the stock could reach about $700. Even with multiple compressions to 10x, that’s still well above $500. This assumes minimal dilution, which is reasonable given its cash-generation potential at scale. Yes, the company is currently loss-making, but as revenue grows, margins should turn positive. Natera’s net income margin has improved from -75% in 2021 to -13% now. Diagnostic market penetration takes time. For Natera to be valued at $50B, $100B, or even $200B (vs. $23B today), investors must think long-term — 2030 and beyond — with billions of tests processed annually worldwide. By 2035, liquid biopsies could be as routine as cholesterol tests. Still, several factors must align: Despite the opportunity, key risks remain: Natera is a genuine growth story driven by breakthrough technology addressing massive markets. It has scaled impressively while sustaining momentum that most CEOs would envy. The path to $500+ per share is mathematically feasible — but execution must be flawless. For risk-tolerant investors, this offers high growth with meaningful upside — balanced by real execution and market risks. For a more diversified approach, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has outperformed its benchmark of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000. Its quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap names has delivered strong returns while cushioning losses in down markets (RV Portfolio metrics). The opportunity is real — the question is whether Natera can execute and whether investors can stomach the volatility for what could be a rewarding ride. 1.

Title: Solana Price Prediction: SOL Price To $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/solana-price-prediction-sol-price-to-500/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T13:30:57Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Solana has been on a remarkable run lately. The price of SOL has surged by about 80% over the past six months and is now trading well above all its key moving averages. This impressive performance is supported by strong momentum, including its total value locked (TVL) reaching a record $13.22 billion and a surge of institutional investment. But the big question is—what would it take for SOL to double from here and surpass the $500 mark? Let’s explore what could drive that move. That said, if you are looking for upside potential with less volatility than holding an individual stock or token, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of more than 91% since inception. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Explosive rallies like this may seem extreme, but they are not uncommon in the crypto space. Here are some recent examples: With these catalysts lining up, could Solana be on the brink of its next big move? We’ve discussed the upside, but what about the risks? No investment is without challenges, and Solana is no exception. Here’s what could hold it back: While the outlook seems positive, such rapid growth is never guaranteed. The crypto market is highly volatile, and success depends on Solana’s continued execution and favorable market conditions. Alternatively, consider exploring the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 indices) to deliver strong returns. Why? The RV Portfolio’s quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks enables it to capture market gains while limiting downside in weaker conditions, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics. So, can Solana really hit $500? The fundamentals are compelling. With record TVL on the network and major investors piling in, the stage is set. Catalysts like a potential ETF approval and Solana’s booming ecosystem could drive a massive rally. Still, investors should carefully weigh the risks.

Title: S&P 500 Set To Surge 30%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/sp-500-set-to-surge-30/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T10:00:48Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In what's shaping up to be a pivotal week for global markets, the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to meet on September 16-17. Most analysts expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. While that’s the prevailing expectation, the Fed has a history of surprising markets. If they cut rates by 50 basis points instead of 25, it would be an unexpected move. Looking at past events, such surprises can serve as powerful catalysts for major market rallies. Our analysis shows that a move like this could potentially boost the market by 30%. That said, for investors looking for growth potential with lower exposure to the volatility of individual equities, consider the High Quality Portfolio. Since its inception, this portfolio has built a strong track record, consistently outperforming its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with cumulative returns exceeding 91%. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Recent history shows how impactful unexpected Fed moves can be. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, the Fed made two emergency rate cuts in March 2020 totaling 150 basis points. The first was a 50 basis point cut on March 3rd, followed by an even larger 100 basis point cut on March 15th that brought rates to near-zero. While markets initially dropped to around 2,237 on March 23, 2020, the aggressive action helped stabilize confidence. This sparked a massive rally, with the S&P 500 climbing to around 4,797 by January 2022—a gain of about 115% in under two years. Similarly, the 2019 rate cut cycle demonstrated the power of surprise. Beginning in July 2019, the Fed made three 25 basis point cuts, some of which were partly unexpected. These came after a period of rate hikes and helped fuel a major rally. From its low of about 2,346 in December 2018, the S&P 500 surged to around 3,393 by February 2020, a 45% gain in just 14 months. These examples show a clear pattern: when the Fed acts more aggressively than expected, it can ignite strong, sustained rallies. The current market setup is unique. The S&P 500 is trading near all-time highs around 6,584, unlike past rate-cut cycles, which often came during economic crises. The market has already priced in a 25 basis point cut, so a bigger move would be a major surprise. Adding complexity is political pressure from the Trump administration for deeper rate cuts. This could influence the Fed’s decision and the market’s response. Based on historical trends, the size of a surprise cut correlates directly with the rally potential. For perspective, the 45% rally starting in 2019 followed a total of 75 basis points in cuts, while the 115% rally from 2020 came after 150 basis points in emergency cuts. So a 50 basis point cut likely wouldn’t drive a rally on that scale, but a 30% gain is a realistic possibility. History shows that surprises can be powerful catalysts. There are compelling reasons for the Fed to go for an aggressive 50 basis point cut. The biggest is the element of surprise—since markets don’t expect it, such a move would be a strong signal. Lower rates also add liquidity, fueling growth and supporting multiple expansion as investors pay more for earnings. There’s also political pressure from the Trump administration, which could hint at more cuts to come. Of course, the Fed might do something else unexpected, like holding rates steady and maintaining its hawkish stance. That would likely hit markets hard. A lack of action could send the S&P 500 index down by as much as 8%. Inflation fears are real. See – Will Inflation Data Crush The S&P 500? – for more details. Even with the potential for a rally, there are key risks to consider. The upcoming Fed meeting is high stakes, and any deviation from the expected 25 basis point cut could spark big market moves. The consistent market swings after Fed meetings since 2019 highlight the importance of risk management. For instance, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 while avoiding much of this Fed-induced volatility, delivering cumulative returns of over 91% since inception—far better than broad market indices. A surprise 50-basis-point or larger Fed rate cut could still trigger a significant rally for the S&P 500, potentially 30% in the medium term based on historical precedent. However, the 2019 cycle offers a better comparison than the crisis-driven 2020 response, suggesting any rally would be more moderate but still substantial.

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Financial markets have already had an unusual year, but recent price action lately has been especially bizarre, according to Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. In a Substack post on Tuesday titled “Super weird markets since Jackson Hole,” he traced the path of key assets since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door to rate cuts in a speech at the annual central bank symposium last month. “You’d have thought that would weigh on the Dollar, lift the S&P 500 and boost commodity prices across the board. But that hasn’t happened,” Brooks wrote. “The only thing that’s moved is gold, with a massive price rise of almost 10 percent.” To be sure, stocks have rallied since his post as benign inflation data cleared the way for Fed rate cuts when policymakers meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. Gold prices have also marched higher, setting fresh highs along the way and closing Friday at $3,680.70 per ounce. But the bond market has behaved more unexpectedly. Brooks noted the 30-year Treasury yield didn’t fall right after Powell’s speech but only turned lower after another bad jobs report was released two weeks later. “The fact that the 30-year Treasury yield didn’t fall immediately is weird and worrying,” he added. “It took very weak payrolls to finally do that.” In addition, while the dollar index has had some ups and downs, it has returned to about where it was before Powell’s speech, with Brooks calling that “counterintuitive” as expectations for Fed easing would typically bring it lower. Meanwhile, bitcoin sold off after Jackson Hole but is also back where it started, even though cryptocurrencies have generally acted like risk assets in the past and previously rallied on rate-cut hopes. “What does all this mean? Recent market moves suggest gold is the ultimate safe haven,” Brooks said. “Bitcoin is proving too volatile and speculative, so — as political pressure on the Fed mounts — markets gravitate to gold.” Fears of a debt crisis in France and the U.K. have jolted global bond yields higher in recent weeks. Political gridlock in France in particular has dimmed hopes that Paris will rein in deficits anytime soon. On Friday evening, Fitch downgraded France’s credit rating from AA- to A+, the lowest level ever for the eurozone’s second-largest economy, saying a major shift to fiscal discipline is unlikely. It’s possible the crisis in France sent more investors looking for a safe haven toward the dollar, potentially explaining why the greenback has been stable, Brooks said. After his post, other global events have stirred more geopolitical concerns that may also favor the dollar. Israel attacked Hamas leaders in Qatar, a close U.S. Mideast ally, sparking sharp backlash in the region and sending oil prices higher. And Russian drones entered Polish airspace, forcing NATO allies to activate air-defense systems and deploy fighters jets that shot down the aircraft. “The bottom line is that there’s a lot of things in markets that don’t currently hang together well at all,” Brooks said. The key question is whether the rise in gold prices is sign that the dollar is losing its reserve currency status, though he thinks it’s just temporary noise and sees a reversion to the mean eventually. In a note on Tuesday, Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, also noticed the odd market moves that have been going on. But he said “the tell” is the dollar’s 10% decline year to date against other global currencies, which stems from President Donald Trump’s efforts to weaken Fed independence, worsen deficits, and reorder the global trading system. “When you take all that into account, those market moves suddenly start to make a lot more sense,” Brown added. “Yes, the correlations are unusual. But, so is the macroeconomic environment, and so are the policy choices that continue to be made, as government spending runs away with itself across DM, rate cuts resume stateside, inflation risks remain tilted to the upside, and a potential economic re-acceleration looms now the initial trade/tariff uncertainty has (largely) been navigated.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.
