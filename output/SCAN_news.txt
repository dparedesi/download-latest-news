On the domestic front, India is eyeing tax relief and industrial reforms. The group of ministers (GoM) on health and life insurance is set to recommend exempting individual insurance premiums from GST, which currently attracts an 18% levy, according to Bihar Deputy CM and GoM convener Samrat Choudhary. Simultaneously, the government is evaluating new measures to strengthen manufacturing competitiveness amid U.S. tariff pressures. Proposals under discussion include interest subventions, new manufacturing clusters near infrastructure hubs, and incentives to attract private capital. On the trade front, India and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) comprising Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan signed terms of reference (ToR) on Wednesday to begin free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations. Bilateral trade reached $69 bn in 2024, up 7% YoY, and the pact is expected to unlock untapped potential, boost investment flows, and deepen economic ties. Finally, India’s core sector output showed modest growth of 2% in July, slightly below June’s 2.2%. Weakness in coal, crude oil, natural gas, and refinery products weighed on overall performance, though steel and cement output surged on the back of government capex and strong housing demand. Looking ahead, analysts expect growth to rebound to around 5% in August. Asian market Asia markets mostly rose as investors assessed the four-day losing streak for the S&P 500, led by declines in tech stocks. Overnight in the US, two of the three key benchmarks ended the session in declines as tech stocks dragged the market lower.

(Analysis by Barclays) The minutes of the August RBI MPC meeting suggest that the members found it prudent to pause amid heightened global uncertainty and keep space should the drag on growth amid unfolding trade and tariff talks become more visible. [ On Wedneday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released the minutes of the August Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, at which it decided unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 5.5% and the monetary policy stance at “neutral.” ] While the external members of the MPC were mostly dovish, RBI internal MPC members were relatively neutral. Below are the three key takeaways from the minutes: 1) Heightened global uncertainty around tariffs and particularly the protracted India-US trade talks were widely cited as a key monitorable. The evolution of these risks would determine policy space and guide the policy path in upcoming meetings. 2) The very welcome and sharper-than-expected CPI disinflation resulted in a sizable downward revision to the CPI forecast by the RBI. It emanated largely from lower food inflation, which is known to be volatile. This concentrated disinflation lessens the RBI’s confidence around its durability. Accordingly, rather firm core CPI inflation and 4% + forecasts for H1 2026 weighed on their decision making, making a strong case for a pause. 3) All the members lauded the pace of transmission but acknowledged that it was best to wait and see how this permeates to the real economy, given the sizable and front-loaded 100bp repo rate cut.

Vikram Jeet Singh, Partner at BTG Advaya “The Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 was tabled in Parliament today. This bill seeks to ban “online money gaming”, which is the “depositing of money” for “winning money or other stakes”. This impacts games such as rummy, poker, etc., where winning money is possible. Under Indian law games of skill are legal, and games of chance are considered gambling and prohibited. Wagering money on games of skill was legal until now. The bill in Parliament follows a regulatory trend against RMG even in games of skill – the Madras High Court in June 2025 had upheld restrictions on Real Money Games in Tamil Nadu. Now, pursuant to these new regulations, even games of skill that involve real money can be banned. Advertising RMG will be prohibited and promoting this may lead to sanction for advertisers as well. One reason that has been suggested for this ban is the alleged use of RMG for money laundering activities. India’s online gaming market is valued at almost USD 4 billion, which will take a hit following from this - banning RMG may also have an impact on people employed in the gaming sector. Gaming companies have been subject to a 28% GST levy, in the past. But the bill indicates a move from regulating to banning, when it comes to RMG.” “ We appreciate the government’s suggestion to abolish GST on life and health insurance premiums, as this progressive step will render protection solutions much more affordable and accessible to millions of Indians. Insurance is not just a product, it is an essential safety net that enables people and families to face life with confidence. By abolishing the GST tax, the government has made a customer-centric move that will induce more families, particularly from middle-class and underprivileged sections, to get themselves covered with the proper insurance. This change is also part of the overall dream of ‘Insurance for All’ by 2047, driving greater penetration in urban and rural India. Affordability is a major driver, but we also think it is essential that we tackle some of the structural issues like the inverted duty structure that still affects industry efficiency and margins. A balanced” Godrej Properties Ltd. (GPL), (BSE scrip id: GODREJPROP), one of India’s leading real estate developers, today announced that it has participated in an e-auction conducted by the Telangana Housing Board (TGHB) for Residential Group Housing, where GPL has emerged as the highest bidder for ~ 7.825 acre land parcel in Kukatpally (KPHB), Hyderabad, with a total combined bid value of INR 547.75 crore, according to the bid status intimation email issued by e-auction facilitator MSTC Limited. TGHB shall issue the allotment letter after following the due process. The land parcel is strategically located in a prime location in Kukatpally, in close proximity to HITEC City, and will offer an estimated revenue potential of ~INR 3,800 crore* comprising premium residential apartments of varied configurations. This acquisition builds on the success of GPL’s recent launches in Hyderabad, including Godrej Madison Avenue at Kokapet and Godrej Regal Pavilion at Rajendranagar. With this new project, GPL has further strengthened its presence in one of India’s most dynamic real estate markets. Kukatpally is recognized as one of Hyderabad’s most established and resilient residential corridors. The neighbourhood has set benchmarks for premium housing and is supported by a robust social ecosystem comprising reputed educational institutions, healthcare facilities, retail, and commercial hubs. Its connectivity to HITEC City, one of Hyderabad’s largest employment centers, further enhances its residential appeal. Gaurav Pandey, MD & CEO, Godrej Properties, said, “As Hyderabad continues to strengthen its position as a dynamic real estate market, Kukatpally represents a strategic location that aligns with the city’s growth trajectory. Building on the strong response to our recent launch, Godrej Madison Avenue at Kokapet, our presence here allows us to bring national-scale expertise while designing future-ready developments that create long-term value for our residents.” Eternal, the parent company of Zomato and Blinkit, has indeed made waves with its market cap hitting ₹3.15 lakh crore, surpassing Nifty 50 giants like Wipro (₹2.72L Cr), Tata Motors (₹2.52L Cr), Asian Paints, Nestle India, and Coal India (₹2.40L Cr). This milestone reflects a remarkable 460% stock rally since its IPO in 2021 at ₹116 per share, cementing its status as a new-age powerhouse. Apple is reportedly set to manufacture all four iPhone 17 models (iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max) in India for the US market before their September 2025 launch. This marks the first time Apple will produce all new iPhone variants, including the Pro models, in India from the outset. The production is spread across five factories, including new plants operated by Tata Group in Tamil Nadu and Foxconn near Bengaluru. This shift is part of Apple’s strategy to reduce reliance on China due to geopolitical tensions and tariff risks, with Tata expected to handle nearly half of India’s iPhone output within two years. iPhone exports from India reached $7.5 billion from April to July 2025, reflecting the country’s growing role as a manufacturing hub. According to ICRA, India’s GDP growth for Q1 FY2026 (April-June 2025) is projected at 6.7%, surpassing the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) estimate of 6.5%. However, this growth is lower than the 7.4% recorded in Q4 FY2025. The Gross Value Added (GVA) is expected to ease to 6.4% from 6.8% in the previous quarter. The services sector is anticipated to drive growth, reaching an eight-quarter high of 8.3%, up from 7.3%, supported by robust government spending. Central government capital expenditure surged 52% year-on-year to ₹2.8 trillion, and non-interest revenue expenditure grew by 6.9%. The combined non-interest revenue expenditure of 24 state governments also rose by 10.7%. However, industrial growth is projected to slow to 4.0% from 6.5%, and agriculture to 4.5% from 5.4%, though it remains strong compared to 1.5% in Q1 FY2025. Net indirect taxes are expected to grow in double digits, driven by an 11.3% increase in government indirect taxes, though subsidy contraction slowed to 7.3%. The gap between GDP and GVA growth is projected at 30 basis points, down from 62 in Q4 FY2025. New project announcements nearly doubled to ₹5.8 trillion, and project completions reached ₹2.3 trillion. ICRA notes that improved monetary easing and GST rationalization could boost urban consumption ahead of the festive season, but tariff uncertainties may limit GDP growth to 6.0% for FY2026.

Title: AVAX price outlook: SkyBridge Capital to tokenize $300M on Avalanche blockchain
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/avax-price-outlook-skybridge-capital-to-tokenize-300m-on-avalanche-blockchain/
Time Published: 2025-08-20T08:51:21Z
Full Content:
While cryptocurrencies retreated from their recent peaks, Anthony Scaramucci’s alternative investment company, SkyBridge Capital, supercharged Avalanche’s (AVAX) fundamentals. According to the latest press release, SkyBridge plans to tokenize hedge funds worth $300 million on the Avalanche network. Under this initiative, SkyBridge’s Legion Strategies Ltd. and Digital Macro Masfer Fund Ltd. will tokenize on AVAX’s network through leading financial service providers Apex Group and Tokeny. Commenting on the move, SkyBridge’s CEO and founder, Anthony Scaramucci, stated: Tokenizing our funds on Avalanche, supported by the technology and operational infrastructure of Tokeny and Apex Group, represents a significant step forward in modernizing the alternative investment landscape. We look forward to bringing our hedge funds into the digital, on-chain era, improving transparency, liquidity, and accessibility for our investors. The news renewed sentiments around AVAX’s potential amidst the ongoing broad market bloodbath. Digital assets trade in the red as Bitcoin falls below $114,000. Nevertheless, analysts remain bullish, perceiving the current correction as a healthy one after BTC’s surge to all-time highs of around $124,000. With large-cap altcoins in the traders’ radar after the recent Ethereum rally, this article checks AVAX’s potential comeback once market sentiments improve. The real-world assets (RWAs) sector is experiencing significant growth momentum as DeFi and TradFi converge. Hedge fund tokenization will enrich Avalance’s ecosystem, as it already hosts tokenized credit, stocks, private equity, venture, and MMFs. Avalanche already hosts tokenized MMFs, private equity, credit, stocks, venture & now hedge funds. Tokenization on Avalanche is bridging TradFi and DeFi with new distribution channels and programmable products. 🔺 This is where capital connects. https://t.co/vEZbo1c4ft — Avalanche🔺 (@avax) August 19, 2025 SkyBridge decision sets AVAX for impressive performance in the coming sessions. The price chart supports a bullish case, pointing to a potential AVAX recovery to $32. That would mean an over 45% gain from the altcoin’s current price. Financial institutions are never random when venturing into crypto. Avalanche’s EVM compatibility, near-instant finality, and scalability likely attracted SkyBridge. The $300 million initiative unlocks the AVAX platform for large-scale tokenization. According to Tokeny co-founder Danie Coheur: SkyBridge’s tokenization on Avalanche proves that with the right technology, trusted operators, and regulatory clarity, tokenization at scale is not just possible, it’s happening. While the tokenization updates strengthen Avalanche’s fundamentals, broad market weakness weighs on AVAX’s performance. The alt hovers at $22 after losing around 1.80% in the past 24 hours. AVAX remained relatively calm as markets crashed ahead of Powell’s anticipated speech. Meanwhile, Avalanche looks poised to lead the next leg up, fueled by institutional interest, especially if SkyBridge succeeds in its plans. Such a narrative aligns with the bullish chart pattern. The Elliot Wave analysis shows that AVAX is finalizing a wave two correction. This setup phase often precedes a massive wave three rally. The structure highlights possibilities of recoveries to the $32 ceiling. That would be an approximately 45% surge from AVAX’s market price. However, improved broader market sentiments remain vital to support the upside. Failure to overcome the obstacle between $26 and $27 will likely delay the projected AVAX recovery.

Title: These Dirt Cheap Dividends Pay 4x-9x The Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/08/17/these-dirt-cheap-dividends-pay-4x-9x-the-market/
Time Published: 2025-08-17T12:15:00Z

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The market-at-large is expensive by historical metrics. So let’s look past the pricey, low-yielding ETFs in favor of cheap dividends. That’s right, good ol’ value investing bargains. With high yields too! We’re talking about divvies of 5%, 8% and even 11% that we’ll discuss in a moment. The spring market dip sure was brief, wasn’t it? The S&P 500 sank into near-bear territory in roughly a month, then snapped back just as quick. In doing so, Mr. and Ms. Market took valuations to high levels. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.1 remains in rarefied air, last reached during the COVID rebound, and before that, the dot-com bubble. Which is fine. We’ll leave the 22 P/Es to the vanilla investors while we focus on bargains with respect to two “cash is king” metrics: Let’s start with Virginia-based electric utility AES Corp. (AES, 5.5% yield), which we recently discussed as a low-beta name. This means AES, being a safe, stodgy utility, is more insulated from market pullbacks than run-of-the-mill dividends. AES also has upside potential. Its renewable energy-selling business gives it growth potential that many utility stocks don’t have. It’s also cheap. AES trades at a cheap 5 times cash-flow estimates, as well as a 0.6 PEG that implies it’s also cheap compared to its growth estimates. (Remember: A PEG under 1.0 signals that a stock is inexpensive.) The stock yields more than 5%, to boot, which is better than the already generous utility sector. Edison International (EIX, 5.9%) is another utility company—this one more typical of the sector. It’s the parent of regulated utility Southern California Edison (SCE), which serves more than 15 million customers and generates much of its electricity from renewable sources including solar, wind, and hydro. It does, however, have a second business—Trio (formerly Edison Energy), a global energy advisory firm that serves large commercial, industrial and institutional organizations. Unlike other utilities, however, EIX is a bit more “exciting.” It spent years in court fighting litigation over wildfire damage and ended up having to pay multiple billion-dollar-plus settlements. And the legal drama has returned in 2025. Shares have lost more than a quarter of their value, with most of that coming in January amid Los Angeles County wildfires, including the massive Eaton Fire, which prompted multiple suits against SCE over allegations that the company had “violated public safety and utility codes and was negligent in its handling of power safety shut-offs.” SCE is also being investigated in connection with the Hurst Fire. If, for a minute, we closed our eyes and ignored all that, there’s a lot to like about Edison. It’s expected to generate decent top-line growth and a significant snap-back in profits over the next couple years. The big drop in shares has launched EIX’s yield to nearly 6%. It trades at just 3 times cash-flow estimates. And its PEG, which at fractionally under 1 suggests the stock is only mildly underpriced, is substantially down from the nearly 3 it traded at when I evaluated the stock a couple years ago. But we can’t ignore the fire liabilities—they’re why EIX’s valuations are so low. That makes Edison a much bigger high-risk, high-reward gamble than the average utility. Amcor (AMCR, 5.2% yield) is technically a cyclical stock, but it acts defensively. That’s because, as a packaging specialist, it’s in the business of—well, other business’s business. It makes everything from high-barrier paperboard trays for beef and meats to glass dressing bottles to overwrap for home and personal care. And its applications go far beyond the grocery store: Amcor’s products are used in garden and outdoor products, agriculture, pet care, healthcare, even building and construction. So Amcor is simultaneously a play on the broader economy and all the businesses it supports, but it also fills a vital need across a diversified set of companies. AMCR stands out for a few reasons: Kodiak Gas Services (KGS, 5.2% yield) is an energy services firm that provides natural gas compression services, mostly in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. Its compression units are critical to upstream and midstream natural gas firms, so it’s able to secure multiyear, fixed-revenue contracts. There’s nothing novel about the business model, though. Like other energy services firms, if natural gas/liquefied natural gas (LNG) is in demand, Kodiak will be in demand, so the fact that global LNG demand is expected to grow over the next few years bodes well for KGS. That’s in large part because Kodiak is extremely well-positioned to capture that growth. In late 2023, KGS announced it would acquire CSI Compressco LP to create the industry’s largest compression fleet. Kodiak’s fleet is young, too (read: less maintenance and replacement costs). There’s not much stock history to examine, however. Kodiak is a relatively new issue that went public just a few months before the CSI announcement. But the company has started a dividend and raised it twice since then, including a nearly 10% improvement announced in April 2025. Meanwhile, its yield has wafted up to over 5% amid energy’s weakness this year—and left shares relatively cheap. KGS trades at roughly 6 times cash flow estimates and a low PEG of 0.13. Atlas Energy Solutions (AESI, 8.4% yield) is another Permian Basin energy equipment and services firm, this one providing transportation and logistics, storage solutions, and contract labor services to oil and natural gas E&P firms, as well as other oilfield services companies. Its most important offering is mesh frac sand used in hydraulic fracturing (fracking). I had been keeping tabs on it because of its unorthodox streak of dividend hikes, but that streak stopped earlier this year. It’s not ideal. Nor is the fact that AESI shares have been hammered to the tune of 45% this year. Again, energy services haven’t had a great 2025, but Atlas has been downright miserable amid slower-than-expected U.S. completion activity and droopy frac-sand prices. If there’s any silver lining to that, it’s that AESI shares now trade at just 5.7 times estimates for cash flows, as well as an attractive PEG of 0.75. The dividend at least appears to be safe, too. While things look bad from an adjusted earnings perspective ($1.00 in dividends annually vs. forecasts for just 25 cents this year), Atlas has more than enough FCF to cover the payout. Example: Last quarter, it generated $48.9 million in adjusted FCF while paying out $30.9 million. Those cash flows are substantial because AESI is a low-cost operator—crucial for survival in this industry. But like any energy services provider, Atlas needs commodity prices to cooperate. It’s unusual for a blue-chip stock like United Parcel Service (UPS, 7.5%) to yield north of 7%, but it’s also rare for a blue-chip stock like UPS to have its shares hemorrhage so much without a recession or broader bear market. Lower-margin e-commerce volumes, higher costs because of its unionized workforce, and a weak freight environment hampered the company in 2024. Then in early 2025, it spooked investors with a weak 2025 forecast and announced that—in hopes of shifting away from those lower-margin volumes—it would drastically reduce its business with Amazon (AMZN), which accounted for roughly 10%-12% of annual UPS revenues. The April tariff announcement also hit shares hard. The result? UPS shares have lost nearly half of their value in just two years. The upshot? UPS trades at roughly 8 times cash-flow estimates and has never offered a better yield in its 26 years of trading. Is UPS a dividend trap? Perhaps. The company pulled its full-year revenue and profit forecasts in April, and didn’t bring them back in its late July report. Meanwhile, Wall Street is expecting a roughly 15% drop in adjusted earnings, to $6.61 per share. That specific number matters: UPS has a target dividend payout ratio of approximately 50% of prior-year adjusted EPS. It currently pays $6.56 across four quarterly dividends. (That’s 99%!) CEO Carol Tomé continued to signal commitment to the dividend in the earnings call—“UPS is rock-solid strong and so is our dividend. The UPS dividend is backed by solid free cash flow and a strong investment-grade balance sheet,” she said—but if the delivery giant continues to struggle, simple numbers might force management’s hand. Western Union (WU, 11.3% yield), somehow, is still in business. Payment apps like PayPal, Venmo and Zelle have been taking business from the “OG” of money transfer. WU boasts a big yield but for the wrong reason—its divvie looks big because shares are (deservedly) way down! WU, to its credit, has launched an initiative called “Evolve 2025” in which it’s rolling out new products, improvements and an operational efficiency program. It’s also expanding its digital wallet offerings in Mexico and Singapore. And its latest move, announced just a couple days ago, is the $500 million acquisition of Miami-based International Money Express (IMXI), aka Intermex, which serves some 6 million customers who send money from the United States, Canada, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany to more than 60 countries. But c’mon man—this dog is dead. The business trades for 4x cash flow and a sub-5 forward P/E, but who cares? Not me. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.
