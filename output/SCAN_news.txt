ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. VTI and VOO both offer excellent low-cost access to U.S. equity markets, but their different ... More approaches create distinct risk and return profiles. When it comes to broad market exposure through exchange-traded funds, two Vanguard offerings consistently dominate investor conversations: VTI and VOO. Both funds have garnered massive followings among retail and institutional investors alike, yet they represent fundamentally different approaches to capturing U.S. equity market returns. While both ETFs offer low-cost access to American stocks, their structural differences create distinct risk profiles that become particularly pronounced during periods of market volatility. Understanding how these two popular funds respond to market turbulence requires examining their underlying compositions, diversification strategies, and historical performance patterns. This analysis will examine the nuanced differences between VTI's total market approach and VOO's S&P 500 focus, enabling investors to determine which fund better aligns with their risk tolerance and investment objectives during uncertain market conditions. Before diving into risk analysis and volatility comparisons, it's essential to understand the core characteristics that define each fund. While both VTI and VOO are Vanguard products that track U.S. equity markets, their methodologies and scopes differ significantly, creating unique investment profiles that appeal to different investor preferences and market outlooks. VTI seeks to track the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, representing nearly 100% of the investable U.S. stock market across all capitalization segments. Launched on May 31, 2001, this fund has grown to become one of the largest ETFs globally, with net assets exceeding $1.81 trillion. The fund employs a sampling strategy to closely match its benchmark index, which includes large-, mid-, small-, and micro-cap stocks across all sectors of the American economy. The fund's broad mandate means it holds thousands of individual securities, with its top 10 holdings representing just 26.5% of total assets. Apple leads at 5.58%, followed by Microsoft at 4.93%, demonstrating how even the most prominent companies maintain relatively modest weightings within the total market context. This diversification extends across sectors, with technology commanding the largest allocation at 23.78%, followed by healthcare at 14.10% and financial services at 13.54%. VOO tracks the S&P 500 Index, focusing exclusively on the 500 largest publicly traded U.S. companies by market capitalization. Launched on September 9, 2010, this fund has accumulated approximately $1.4 trillion in net assets, making it one of the most popular large-cap equity investments available. The fund's benchmark represents roughly 80% of the total U.S. stock market by value, concentrating on established, profitable companies that meet specific criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500. The fund's top 10 holdings carry more weight than VTI's, representing 30.78% of total assets. Apple dominates with a 6.57% allocation, followed by Microsoft at 5.80%. This higher concentration reflects the market-cap weighted nature of the S&P 500, where the most prominent companies naturally command greater influence over fund performance. Sector allocation mirrors VTI's general distribution but with slight variations, including technology at 24.46% and healthcare at 14.48%. The most significant difference between these funds lies in their market capitalization exposure breadth. VTI includes small- and mid-cap stocks that VOO excludes, providing exposure to approximately 4,000 securities compared to VOO's 500. This broader scope means VTI captures the entire spectrum of U.S. public companies, from micro-cap startups to mega-cap giants, while VOO focuses exclusively on large-cap established enterprises. Weighting methodologies also create subtle but important distinctions. While both funds use market-cap weighting, VTI's inclusion of smaller companies means large-cap stocks have slightly less influence on overall performance compared to VOO. This difference becomes particularly relevant during periods when small- and mid-cap stocks outperform or underperform their large-cap counterparts, creating performance divergence between the two funds despite their substantial overlap in holdings. Examining how VTI and VOO respond to market volatility requires analyzing multiple risk dimensions, from historical price movements to sector concentration effects. While both funds track U.S. equity markets and share similar long-term return profiles, their different approaches to market exposure create distinct risk characteristics that become apparent during periods of market stress and uncertainty. Historical analysis reveals subtle but meaningful differences in how these funds handle market turbulence. VTI's broader market exposure typically results in slightly higher volatility compared to VOO, particularly during periods when small- and mid-cap stocks experience heightened price swings. Over the past decade, VTI has demonstrated a marginally higher standard deviation in monthly returns, reflecting the additional volatility contributed by its exposure to smaller companies. Risk-adjusted returns, as measured by metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, indicate that both funds perform similarly over extended periods. However, VTI occasionally edges ahead during market cycles that favor smaller companies. The fund's 10-year annualized return of 13.0% compares to VOO's 13.7%, reflecting periods where large-cap stocks outperformed; however, these differences often reverse during different market cycles. Beta measurements relative to the broader market indicate that VTI typically exhibits slightly higher market sensitivity due to its small-cap component. Both funds face similar sector concentration risks, with technology representing their largest allocation. However, subtle differences in sector weightings create varying exposure to sector-specific volatility. VOO's slightly higher technology weighting at 24.46% compared to VTI's 23.78% means greater sensitivity to technology sector movements, which can amplify both gains and losses during tech-focused market cycles. Diversification benefits emerge more clearly when examining VTI's broader sector representation. The fund's inclusion of smaller companies provides access to niche sectors and subsectors that may not be represented in the S&P 500, potentially offering some protection against concentrated sector downturns. This broader exposure can help cushion portfolio performance when specific, large-cap-dominated sectors experience significant declines; however, it also means exposure to potentially more volatile, smaller-company sectors. The most significant risk differential between these funds stems from their market capitalization exposure profiles. VTI's inclusion of small- and mid-cap stocks introduces additional volatility, as these companies tend to experience more pronounced price swings during market stress periods. Small-cap stocks often face greater liquidity constraints during market downturns, potentially amplifying losses compared to their large-cap counterparts. Conversely, VOO's focus on large-cap stocks provides inherent stability advantages during turbulent periods. Large companies typically possess stronger balance sheets, more diversified revenue streams, and better access to capital markets, helping them weather economic storms more effectively. This stability comes at the cost of potentially missing upside opportunities when smaller companies outperform, but it provides more predictable performance during uncertain market conditions. The diversification strategies employed by VTI and VOO represent different philosophies toward risk management and return optimization. While both funds offer broad U.S. market exposure, their approaches to diversification create distinct advantages and limitations that investors must consider when building portfolios designed to weather various market conditions. VTI's comprehensive market coverage provides several diversification benefits that can enhance portfolio resilience during specific market conditions. The fund's exposure to mid- and small-cap stocks offers access to companies in earlier growth stages, potentially capturing value creation that occurs before companies reach S&P 500 inclusion criteria. This broader exposure means investors participate in the full spectrum of American business success stories, from emerging growth companies to established market leaders. The fund's reduced single-stock risk represents another significant advantage. With thousands of holdings compared to VOO's 500, VTI provides greater protection against individual company failures or sector-specific downturns. This diversification becomes particularly valuable during periods of market rotation, when different segments of the market experience varying performance patterns. The fund's structure also means that no single company or small group of companies can disproportionately impact overall performance, providing more balanced exposure to market movements. VOO's concentration on S&P 500 companies offers distinct advantages through its bias toward quality, established enterprises. These companies have demonstrated sustained profitability, met specific financial criteria, and possess the scale necessary to compete effectively in their respective markets. This quality focus can provide more predictable performance patterns and reduced volatility compared to broader market exposure that includes smaller, potentially less stable companies. The fund's lower exposure to small-cap volatility represents a significant benefit for risk-averse investors. Small companies often experience more dramatic price swings due to limited liquidity, higher business risk, and greater sensitivity to economic cycles. By excluding these companies, VOO provides smoother performance patterns that may be more suitable for investors seeking steady, predictable returns without the additional volatility associated with smaller company exposure. The choice between VTI's broad diversification and VOO's focused approach involves important trade-offs that depend on market conditions and investor objectives. VTI's broader exposure can provide superior returns during periods when small- and mid-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks, but this same exposure can amplify losses when smaller companies underperform. Historical analysis shows these performance cycles can persist for extended periods, making timing considerations important for investors choosing between these approaches. VOO's focused strategy offers more predictable performance but potentially sacrifices upside opportunities available in the broader market. During periods of economic expansion when smaller companies benefit from growth opportunities, VOO investors may miss significant returns available through broader market exposure. However, during economic contractions or periods of market stress, VOO's large-cap focus often provides better downside protection, making it potentially more suitable for conservative investors or those approaching retirement. Dividend income represents an essential component of total returns for both VTI and VOO, though their different market exposures create subtle variations in yield characteristics and dividend sustainability. Understanding these differences helps investors evaluate which fund better aligns with their income generation objectives and risk tolerance regarding dividend payments. Both funds currently offer similar dividend yields of approximately 1.2%, reflecting the overall yield characteristics of the U.S. stock market. However, the composition of these yields differs due to their distinct market exposures. VOO's focus on large-cap stocks typically provides more consistent dividend payments, as larger companies often maintain more established dividend policies and possess greater financial resources to sustain payments during challenging periods. VTI's broader market exposure encompasses companies across the dividend spectrum, ranging from high-yielding, mature companies to growth-oriented firms that pay minimal or no dividends. This diversity can create more variable dividend income over time, as the fund's yield may fluctuate based on the relative performance and dividend policies of different market segments. Historical analysis reveals that both funds maintain relatively stable yields over extended periods, although VTI occasionally experiences slightly more yield volatility due to its broader company exposure. The dividend growth characteristics of both funds reflect the policies of their underlying holdings. Large-cap companies in VOO often demonstrate more predictable dividend growth patterns, with many maintaining consistent annual increases over extended periods. VTI's dividend growth may be less predictable due to its inclusion of smaller companies that may initiate, suspend, or dramatically alter dividend payments based on business conditions and growth opportunities. Dividend sustainability analysis reveals important differences between these funds' income generation capabilities. VOO's concentration on S&P 500 companies provides exposure to dividends from financially stable, profitable enterprises with established track records of maintaining payments through various economic cycles. These companies typically possess diversified revenue streams, strong balance sheets, and access to capital markets that support dividend continuity even during challenging periods. VTI's broader exposure includes companies with varying dividend sustainability profiles. While the fund benefits from the same large-cap dividend payers as VOO, it also includes smaller companies that may have less predictable dividend policies. Some smaller companies may offer higher yields but face greater risk of dividend cuts during economic downturns, while others may pay no dividends at all, focusing instead on growth investments. Sector exposure impacts dividend reliability differently for each fund. VOO's slightly higher weighting in technology stocks, which traditionally pay lower dividends, may result in lower overall yield but potentially higher dividend growth as these companies mature. VTI's broader sector exposure includes more traditional dividend-paying sectors but also encompasses growth-oriented sectors where dividend payments may be less prioritized, creating a more complex dividend sustainability profile. Cost considerations play a crucial role in long-term investment performance, with both funds offering exceptionally low expense ratios that minimize the impact of fees on returns. VTI charges an expense ratio of 0.03%, and VOO maintains an identical 0.03% fee structure. These ultra-low costs reflect Vanguard's commitment to providing cost-effective index investing solutions and represent significant advantages over actively managed alternatives. Tax efficiency represents another important consideration for taxable account investors. Both funds demonstrate excellent tax efficiency through their index-based strategies and Vanguard's management approach. VTI's broader diversification and lower turnover rate of 4% compared to typical actively managed funds helps minimize taxable distributions. The fund's structure allows for efficient tax management through in-kind redemptions and careful portfolio management practices. VOO similarly demonstrates strong tax efficiency characteristics, with its focus on S&P 500 companies providing stable, predictable holdings that require minimal trading activity. Both funds typically generate most of their taxable distributions through qualified dividends rather than capital gains, providing favorable tax treatment for most investors. The funds' similar tax efficiency profiles mean that cost considerations alone are unlikely to drive investment decisions between these two options. Understanding how VTI and VOO perform across various market conditions provides crucial insights for investors seeking to optimize their portfolio allocation based on economic expectations and market outlook. Historical analysis reveals distinct performance patterns that can help guide investment decisions during different market environments. During bull market periods, the performance differential between VTI and VOO often depends on which market segments lead the advance. When small- and mid-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks, VTI typically demonstrates superior returns due to its broader market exposure. This outperformance can be particularly pronounced during the early stages of economic recoveries when smaller companies benefit from improving business conditions and increased risk appetite among investors. Technology sector performance significantly influences both funds during bull markets, though VOO's slightly higher technology weighting can amplify gains when tech stocks lead market advances. Historical analysis shows that during sustained bull markets, both funds tend to perform similarly over extended periods, with short-term performance differences often evening out as market cycles progress. VTI's broader exposure may provide additional upside during periods of broad-based market strength when smaller companies participate fully in market gains. Growth expectations during bull markets often favor VTI's approach, as smaller companies typically offer higher growth potential compared to their large-cap counterparts. This growth premium can translate into superior returns during optimistic market periods when investors are willing to pay higher valuations for growth prospects. However, VOO's focus on established companies can provide more sustainable gains during later stages of bull markets when quality and profitability become more important than pure growth potential. Bear market performance reveals more significant differences between these funds' risk characteristics. VOO's focus on large-cap stocks typically provides better defensive characteristics during market downturns, as larger companies often possess stronger balance sheets and more diversified revenue streams that help them weather economic storms. These companies also tend to have better access to capital markets and more established relationships with lenders, providing additional financial flexibility during challenging periods. VTI's broader market exposure can amplify losses during bear markets, particularly when small- and mid-cap stocks experience disproportionate declines. Smaller companies often face greater liquidity constraints, higher borrowing costs and more concentrated business risks that can lead to more severe price declines during economic contractions. This vulnerability can result in VTI experiencing deeper drawdowns compared to VOO during significant market stress periods. Recovery patterns following bear markets often favor VTI's broader exposure, as smaller companies may rebound more dramatically once economic conditions improve. However, this recovery potential comes with the trade-off of potentially experiencing more severe initial declines. VOO's more stable large-cap focus may provide better downside protection but potentially slower recovery rates compared to the broader market exposure offered by VTI. Choosing between VTI and VOO requires careful consideration of individual investment objectives, risk tolerance and portfolio context. Risk tolerance alignment is a crucial factor, with VTI's broader market exposure potentially suiting investors who are comfortable with additional volatility in exchange for more comprehensive market participation. Conservative investors or those approaching retirement may find VOO's large-cap focus more appropriate for their stability requirements. Time horizon considerations also influence fund selection decisions. Longer investment horizons may favor VTI's broader diversification, as extended periods allow investors to benefit from the full spectrum of market opportunities while weathering short-term volatility. Shorter time horizons might benefit from VOO's more stable large-cap focus, which can provide more predictable performance patterns over limited periods. Portfolio context plays an important role in fund selection, particularly for investors holding other investments alongside their core equity allocation. Investors with existing small-cap exposure through other funds might prefer VOO to avoid overweighting smaller companies, while those seeking comprehensive market exposure through a single fund might favor VTI's total market approach. The choice often depends on overall portfolio construction strategy and the role each fund plays within the broader investment framework. Financial analysts and investment professionals generally view both VTI and VOO favorably, recognizing their roles as core portfolio holdings for different investor types. Many experts appreciate VTI's comprehensive market coverage, noting its ability to provide complete U.S. equity exposure through a single, low-cost investment vehicle. This total market approach receives praise for its simplicity and effectiveness in capturing broad market returns without requiring investors to make complex allocation decisions between different market segments. VOO receives similar expert endorsement for its focus on quality large-cap companies and its role as a stable core holding. Analysts often recommend VOO for investors seeking predictable large-cap exposure without the additional volatility associated with smaller companies. The fund's track record and its benchmark's long history of representing the core of the U.S. stock market contribute to its widespread professional acceptance and recommendation. Bottom Line VTI and VOO both offer excellent low-cost access to U.S. equity markets, but their different approaches create distinct risk and return profiles. VTI provides broader diversification through total market exposure, potentially offering superior long-term returns at the cost of increased volatility from small- and mid-cap holdings. VOO focuses on large-cap stability and quality, providing more predictable performance with potentially lower upside during periods favoring smaller companies. The choice between these funds ultimately depends on individual risk tolerance, investment timeline, and preference for comprehensive market exposure versus focused large-cap stability. Both represent solid core holdings that can serve as foundation investments for well-diversified portfolios.

Title: The Latest 20VC + SaaStr: Meta’s $1B Talent Raid, the End of Triple-Triple-Double-Double, and Why AI Laggards Are Getting Left Behind
URL: https://www.saastr.com/the-latest-20vc-saastr-metas-1b-talent-raid-the-end-of-triple-triple-double-double-and-why-ai-laggards-are-getting-left-behind/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T21:09:24Z
Full Content:
by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts Three Big Things This Week: Jason’s Directness: “It will be the biggest issue of 2026, I think, in B2B AI is just the inability to recruit talent… If you think your answer is to go hire a VP of AI that wears a tie and is studying things like just shut the startup down.” The AI talent war will separate winners from losers more brutally than any previous technology cycle. Rory’s Reality: “The truth is there’s a small number of things that are working really well, and everything else looks dull in comparison… So if you start to pull ahead, provided you continue to execute, it’s very hard to catch up.” Market dynamics now favor extreme concentration of success, making early leads nearly insurmountable. Harry’s Honesty: “If you don’t want to embrace [AI], you are going to make this ship sink… If you need a week for rediscovery week, I promise you, you’re not going to work.” The AI adoption window has closed – adapt immediately or become irrelevant. The venture capital and SaaS landscape is experiencing seismic shifts that will fundamentally reshape how companies compete, hire, and operate. In the latest episode of the 20VC podcast, three industry leaders dissected the most critical developments defining 2025’s market dynamics. The business world was stunned when Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman, two of Silicon Valley’s most respected figures, abandoned their $1.1 billion venture fund NFDG to join Meta. The mathematics behind this decision reveal the extraordinary economics reshaping the industry. According to the podcast analysis, NFDG had deployed roughly $500 million of their fund and achieved a 4x return in just two years – generating approximately $1.5 billion in gains and $300 million in carried interest for the partners. Despite this stellar performance, Meta’s offer was compelling enough to walk away from an additional $1.5 billion in investable capital. NFDG: The $1.1B VC Fund That 4X’d in Two Years—Then Got Acquired by Meta The Strategic Implications This wasn’t just an acqui-hire; it represents Meta’s systematic approach to building an “AI talent magnet.” As Jason Lemkin noted, “The best want to work for the best… and the tough thing is they want to work for the prominent best in many cases.” Meta’s strategy mirrors what worked at X (formerly Twitter) under Elon Musk – creating a “mega mecca for talent” that attracts top performers who refuse to settle for anything less than excellence. This approach is becoming essential because, as the speakers emphasized, struggling companies can’t attract great talent regardless of their growth metrics. Perhaps the most sobering discussion centered on the emerging talent crisis in B2B AI. The numbers are staggering: companies are now offering $800,000+ annual packages plus RSUs and guarantees to secure top AI engineering talent. One founder shared that he’s giving away 0.5-1% equity stakes to each AI engineer – unsustainable math at scale. The success of companies like Cursor is creating ripple effects throughout the industry. As one multi-billion dollar company founder told Lemkin, “My single biggest challenge today is cursor… they’re just paying insane amounts of money for everyone.” This creates an existential question for SaaS companies: How do you compete when you can’t afford the talent war? The speakers identified several harsh realities: One of the most fascinating discussions revealed how dramatically investor expectations have shifted. The traditional SaaS growth trajectory of “triple, triple, double, double” (tripling revenue for two years, then doubling for two years) is no longer exciting in today’s market. Why Traditional SaaS Metrics Are Losing Their Luster Rory O’Driscoll explained the new mathematics: “If there’s two games and one of them has that embedded 10% chance of amazing, like 20 billion, a cursor outcome, and one of them just doesn’t… there’s no price at which you’ll do it.” This creates a painful reality for solid, profitable SaaS companies growing at 20-25% annually. They’re caught in a valley between: The Toma Bravo acquisition of Olo (a profitable, $320M ARR company) for $2 billion at 6.5x revenue exemplifies this dynamic. It’s a “meat and potatoes deal” that provides decent returns but doesn’t generate life-changing wealth for investors. OpenAI’s revelation that stock-based compensation exceeded 119% of revenue last year highlights a critical issue facing high-growth companies. While the accounting can be misleading (based on 409A valuations rather than actual dilution), the trend signals dangerous territory for many startups. The Churchill Principle As Jason Lemkin eloquently put it: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, did you bring World War Two in on budget? They just said, did you win World War II? When it becomes existential, you do what you have to do to win.” This philosophy is driving companies to prioritize market dominance over financial efficiency, leading to unsustainable compensation inflation that will impact venture returns for years. CoreWeave’s $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific demonstrates sophisticated use of inflated stock prices. By converting rental expenses into equity dilution, they’ve reduced fixed costs while maintaining upside exposure to data center demand. This move shows how companies with high-multiple stocks can strategically de-risk their business models. Canva’s “AI Discovery Week” – requiring all 5,000 employees to pause regular work and learn AI – represents a gentler approach to what many see as an inevitable reckoning. The speakers were divided on this approach: The underlying message is clear: companies can’t afford to carry employees who resist AI adoption. The podcast’s analysis of recession probabilities and market dynamics revealed sophisticated thinking about current risks: The discussion reveals several critical strategic imperatives: Perhaps most sobering was the discussion of venture capital’s current challenges. Deal volume has hit an eight-year low while spectacular successes capture all attention and capital. This creates a “flight to consensus” where: The speakers agreed that most VCs are spending their time managing disappointing portfolio companies from 2020-2021 that are growing at 10-30% rather than the explosive rates initially projected. The conversation painted a picture of an industry in transition, where traditional rules no longer apply: The overarching theme is clear: we’re witnessing the emergence of a two-tier market where AI-enabled companies with top talent operate in a different league from traditional businesses. For SaaS leaders, the choice is stark – transform or risk irrelevance in an increasingly AI-driven world. Jason on talent reality: “I was with the founder this morning of a multi-billion dollar company… they said my single biggest challenge today is cursor… cursor’s just paying insane amounts of money for everyone.” Harry on employee expectations: “If you need a discovery week for AI, you have people who aren’t curious enough to want to progress and running their job… I said you fire them.” Rory on the Churchill principle: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, did you bring World War Two in on budget? They just said, did you win World War II? When it becomes existential, you do what you have to do to win.” Rory on recession probability: “Booms don’t die of old age… just because it’s been great for six or seven years doesn’t mean that it has to die in the eight.” Companies that act decisively on talent, AI adoption, and strategic positioning will thrive, while those clinging to old playbooks risk being left behind in what promises to be the most transformative period in business software history.

Edited excerpts: Your views on the broader markets? In terms of broader market performance, we are in a volatile phase with low returns over the past year. Although markets have rallied over the last couple of months, if we look at the last one-year returns, it’s a low single-digit number. One can attribute this to expensive valuations and a slowdown in the economy. We didn’t see a massive correction, which typically happens when markets are expensive, as, structurally, India stays one of the most preferred markets from a long-term perspective. India, being the fastest-growing economy, has fiscal checks in place, and even if one looks at the corporate sector, we are seeing one of the lowest levels of debt/equity. Even the banking sector is at its lowest levels of NPAs. This gives confidence to the investors from a long-term perspective. With stronger balance sheets, fiscal stability and liquidity measures from the RBI, the growth should recover, leading to double-digit earnings growth over the next two-three years. Given the current high valuations in the Indian market, do you see room for further upside? Where are the opportunities? Despite the current expensive valuations, we believe the Indian market still holds significant upside in the longer term. We are likely to see a return to double-digit earnings growth, driven by strong corporate balance sheets, robust asset quality in the banking sector and positive liquidity measures from the RBI. The credit growth, which was in the high teens last year, has come down to a high single-digit number now. While we might experience sideways movement in the near term, the structural factors supporting the economy make the market attractive for long-term investors. How is Tata Asset Management positioning its equity portfolios given the global uncertainties — geopolitical risks and rate movements? Given the global uncertainties, the markets have remained volatile. While the Indian market has had sideways movement and low returns over the past few quarters, we continue to see India as an attractive investment destination. This is because of the strength of the banking sector, the stability of corporate balance sheets and fiscal policy measures that are in place. The RBI has also been injecting a lot of liquidity into the system to propel credit growth, which was seeing some slowdown. Despite these short-term challenges, these structural factors support a long-term positive outlook. Have you observed any notable shifts in investor preferences — for example, increased appetite for passive funds or international exposure? The focus is on long-term market potential. Investors should consider India’s growth trajectory when making investment decisions, and with the attractiveness of India as an investment destination, we can assume there may be a growing appetite for exposure to Indian equity markets, including potentially through passive funds. Passive is becoming one of the choices for investors along with active funds. One of the funds you handle is pharma & healthcare... How do you see tariffs or threat of tariff from the US impacting this sector? How prepared are you? When one analyses the India pharma exports from the US perspective, India has a very strategic presence, with: the highest number of USFDA-approved plants in India, creating such a large eco-system can take multiple years; a large volume share in the US oral pharma market today — can be pegged anywhere between 60 and 75 per cent. But when we look at it from India’s perspective, Indian companies selling in the US market are not generating remarkably high ROE/ROCEs in their generic supplies, except for a few one-time opportunities, which may not last long. Hence, any significant pressure on the margins of Indian companies due to the tariff might push them to calibrate their US market strategy. In our pharma fund, we have moved towards higher exposure to healthcare names, given the comfort on growth and outlook. Pharma stocks, at the same time, have seen a decent run over the last year and the valuations are trading higher vs the long-term average. You largely handle sectoral themes. Throw some light on that. I manage diversified funds as well as a technology theme fund. The IT sector has seen a sharp correction over the last six months, due to concerns in the US economy. Enterprise in the US had cut on the discretionary spends since 2022 due to higher inflation, increasing interest rates and the fear of a slowdown in the macros in the US. These concerns are continuing due to the tariff uncertainties, leading to the third year of lower growth for the IT services companies. However, the correction has driven the valuation to a reasonable level, and the sector can see some re-rating if the growth outlook improves. From a sell-side analyst to buy-side, how is your transmission now? I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to work for esteemed organisations in the industry, both on the buy side as well as the sell side. A sell-side role helps you with building deep expertise in specific industries and sharpening analytical skills, while on the buy-side, it helps with adding more dimensions to these skills by looking at multiple sectors instead of focusing on any single industry. The buy-side industry also helps build critical thinking and decision-making capabilities. Published on July 10, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: JPMorgan Will Become Trillion-Dollar Company Amid Adoption of ‘Most Transformational Technology,’ According to TD Cowen – Here’s When

The investment banking arm of TD Bank believes the market cap of JPMorgan will soar to $1 trillion as it leverages artificial intelligence (AI). In a new CNBC interview, TD Cowen bank analyst Steven Alexopoulos says investors are currently positioning in tech stocks to capture the upside potential of AI. The analyst notes that investors are likely underexposed to stocks that he thinks will rally once AI becomes widely adopted for commercial use. “When you think about where we are right now with AI, we’re at the builder level. The focus is Nvidia, the focus is OpenAI, the builders. I believe we’re inside of two years, maybe one, where the focus will widen out from the builders to who is going to use this technology to unlock massive economic value. That’s exactly what we saw on the internet. As the internet was being built, the focus was on Cisco, IBM, and as the layer was built, it moved to Google with search and Amazon selling commerce. When you think about the S&P 493… You need to focus on sectors that are reliant on people, knowledge workers, that is what will be disrupted by artificial intelligence.” According to the TD Cowen analyst, banks are poised to be major beneficiaries of AI advancements, with JPMorgan expected to lead the charge. Alexopoulos says that while JPMorgan’s head of consumer banking, Marianne Lake, expects the division’s headcount to decline by about 10% over the next five years, he believes that projection is conservative and anticipates a 20% reduction instead. According to Alexopoulos, JPMorgan’s growth will continue despite the significant drop in employee count. “[JPMorgan] is only richly valued relative to history, and that history did not include the most transformational technology of our lifetimes. Banks will break to a new valuation paradigm… By the end of next year, [JPMorgan] will be a trillion-dollar market-cap company.” As of Monday’s close, JPMorgan’s market cap stands at $811 billion.

Title: WOLF Stock To $20?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The Wolfspeed, Inc. logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, United ... More States, on January 3, 2025. (Photo Illustration by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) While Wolfspeed faces severe financial challenges, recent developments suggest a potential turnaround story that could deliver exceptional returns for risk-tolerant investors willing to bet on the company’s survival and recovery. The appointment of Gregor van Issum as CFO sparked immediate investor confidence, driving the stock price up 2x following the announcement. Van Issum brings substantial semiconductor industry experience from his previous roles at ams-OSRAM and NXP, two respected players in the sector. His track record suggests he understands the complexities of semiconductor operations and financial management. Now, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process has already delivered significant improvements to Wolfspeed’s financial structure. The company expects to eliminate nearly $4.6 billion in debt (70% reduction) and cut annual interest payments by 60%, dramatically improving its cost structure and cash flow dynamics. Wolfspeed operates in the silicon carbide semiconductor space, which offers superior energy efficiency compared to traditional silicon chips. This technology is increasingly critical for electric vehicle applications, positioning the company in a high-growth market segment. However, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than a single stock, you might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, garnering >91% returns since its inception. Additionally, check out – MSFT Stock To $1,000? If Wolfspeed successfully navigates its financial restructuring and executes its turnaround plan, the upside potential is substantial: The Wolfspeed turnaround story represents a classic high-risk, high-reward investment scenario. While the potential upside is substantial if the company successfully executes its restructuring and capitalizes on the growing silicon carbide market, the probability of success remains uncertain given the company’s operational challenges and competitive pressures. Investors considering this opportunity should view it as a speculative position suitable only for those who can absorb complete loss while recognizing that successful turnarounds in distressed technology companies can generate exceptional returns for those willing to accept the substantial risks involved. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
