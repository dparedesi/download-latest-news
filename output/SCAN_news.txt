Title: High tariffs give Trump less room for error in Iran | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The US economy needs the fragile ceasefire President Donald Trump brokered in the Middle East to hold. If the pause in fighting between Israel and Iran fails and major hostilities resume, oil prices would likely spike again. And surging gasoline prices are the last thing the US economy needs right now. Inflation is already expected to heat up this summer because of Trump’s massive tariffs on imports. An oil shock would make matters worse — perhaps much worse. “It would be a bit of a double-whammy. First there’s the stagflationary shock from tariffs. And then a potential oil shock,” Alan Blinder, economics professor at Princeton University and a former top Federal Reserve official, told CNN in a phone interview. In many ways, Trump’s trade war gives him less margin for error in the Middle East. He can’t afford another world event that causes inflation to rear its ugly head again and further delays rate cuts from the Fed. “The economy is vulnerable to anything that could go wrong, and this certainly qualifies,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. That’s why investors are breathing a huge sigh of relief in recent days. Stocks have popped and oil prices have plunged in one of the biggest sell-offs in years. Iran’s response to US strikes on nuclear sites was far more limited, and symbolic, than feared. Not only that, but the ceasefire between Israel and Iran eases fears that vital energy infrastructure in the region will get caught in the crossfire. The nightmare scenario had been that Iran would try to close the Strait of Hormuz, the most critical oil chokepoint on the planet. Analysts have warned that if this waterway shut down, oil prices could easily spike beyond $100 or $120 a barrel, causing a return of $4 to $4.50 gas in the US. As of Sunday, the odds of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz spiked to about 60% on prediction platform Polymarket. But by Tuesday, the odds plunged to just 17% as investors bet the worst in the Israel-Iran crisis may be over. Observers have noted that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be counterproductive for Iran, which relies on the waterway to get its own oil to customers, mostly in China. “They would be shooting themselves in the foot,” Blinder said, “but countries have been known to do that.” Critics of Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs warn that they will backfire, too. However, inflation has cooled in recent months even as Trump has lobbed tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum and imports from most countries. Yet many economists say this is the calm before the storm, with tariff-fueled price hikes on the way. Some items exposed to tariffs like appliances, toys and electronics have already become more expensive. “In many ways, the past few months may be transitory low inflation before the price effect of tariffs hit,” Bob Elliott, CEO of alternative investment firm Unlimited, told CNN in a phone interview. “No serious economist would look at inflationary trends and forecast they will exist into the future.” Unless tariffs get dramatically scaled back, Elliott said inflation is likely to heat up by 1% to 1.5% from current levels. “That’s not going to be acceptable for the Fed,” said Elliott. In testimony before Congress Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank’s wait-and-see stance, telling lawmakers: “I wouldn’t want to point to a particular meeting. I don’t think we need to be in any rush because the economy is still strong.” If the situation in the Middle East does turn south again, it would create a potential boost to energy prices. “It would be a tricky combination,” said Elliott, a former executive at hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates. Oil shocks can be very inflationary because energy prices feed in to many parts of the US economy. Not only that, but there can be a psychological effect given how closely Americans follow gas prices. And it’s only been three years since gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon for the first time ever after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Inflation skyrocketed to four-decade highs and the Fed was forced to put the fire out by dramatically lifting borrowing costs. “People look at prices at the pump as a litmus test for inflation broadly,” said Zandi, the Moody’s economist. For now, gas prices appear to have stabilized. The national average price of regular gas was flat at $3.22 a gallon on Tuesday, according to AAA. That’s up from $3.13 a gallon when Israel attacked Iran earlier this month. However, it’s still lower than $3.45 a gallon a year ago. In a speech on Tuesday, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack noted oil prices “bear watching” given the recent price swings from geopolitical events. “The pain of large increases in energy prices still weighs on consumer spending,” Hammack said, while noting that the US is less exposed to oil shocks than in the past. “Recent increases in oil prices pose an upside risk to the stability of inflation expectations.” The scars of $5 gasoline in 2022 loom large. For now, investors are hoping the ceasefire in the Middle East means there won’t be a repeat today. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: HIMS Stock To $25?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/03/31: In this photo illustration, the Hims & Hers Health logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Hims & Hers Health (NASDAQ: HIMS) experienced a devastating 35% stock crash on June 23, 2025, after Novo Nordisk abruptly terminated their brief partnership. The dramatic sell-off reflects not just the immediate loss of a key business relationship, but fundamental questions about the company’s long-term viability in the weight-loss drug market. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception. On a separate note, see – Is Iran Bluffing While Readying An Attack? The collaboration between HIMS and Novo Nordisk, which began in April 2025, was supposed to be a game-changer for the telehealth company. The partnership promised direct access to Wegovy, Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight-loss drug, through HIMS's platform. This arrangement had fueled much of HIMS's remarkable 150% stock surge earlier this year, as investors bet on a clear pathway to sustained revenue growth. However, the partnership lasted barely two months. Novo Nordisk cited concerns over what it called "illegal mass compounding and deceptive marketing" by HIMS, specifically pointing to the company’s continued sales of personalized, compounded versions of semaglutide (Wegovy’s active ingredient) rather than focusing solely on the branded medication. The dispute highlights a fundamental tension in the weight-loss drug market. Following the FDA’s declaration that the semaglutide shortage had ended, compounding pharmacies technically lost their legal justification to produce copycat versions of the drug. Yet HIMS continued marketing personalized versions of the treatment, which Novo Nordisk viewed as undermining their branded product and potentially violating regulatory requirements. This strategic misstep by HIMS reveals a deeper problem: the company appeared to prioritize its existing compounded drug business over nurturing the partnership that investors had priced as its future growth engine. The decision to continue selling personalized versions while simultaneously partnering with Novo Nordisk created an untenable conflict of interest. The stock crash, while severe, may still not fully reflect HIMS’s diminished prospects. Even after the 35% decline, HIMS trades at approximately seven times trailing revenues— more than double its five-year historical average of three times revenues. This elevated multiple made sense when investors expected the Novo Nordisk partnership to drive explosive growth, but that rationale has now evaporated. If HIMS were to revert to its historical valuation multiple of three times revenues, the stock would fall to around $25 — representing another 40% decline from current levels. This suggests the selling may not be finished, particularly as investors reassess the company’s growth trajectory without its key partnership. HIMS can theoretically continue selling personalized obesity treatments, but this approach faces multiple headwinds. The regulatory environment remains uncertain, with the FDA potentially intervening if it determines that companies are abusing compounding loopholes rather than providing genuinely personalized medicine. The loss of Wegovy’s direct sales potential also eliminates what could have been a massive revenue stream from the company's existing member base. The question now becomes whether HIMS’s remaining business model can generate sufficient growth to justify any premium valuation. The company's personalized approach may serve a niche market, but it's unlikely to match the scale that direct Wegovy sales could have provided. The HIMS situation represents a classic case where investors should resist the urge to "buy the dip." While the stock’s 35% decline appears dramatic, the fundamental investment thesis has now been altered. The company has lost its clearest path to significant revenue growth and faces an elevated risk profile regarding regulatory compliance. For now, the prudent approach is to wait and observe how the situation develops. HIMS may find alternative pathways to growth, but without the Novo Nordisk partnership, those routes are far less certain and likely less lucrative. The market's brutal reaction to the partnership termination sends a clear message: when a company's primary growth catalyst disappears overnight, even a 35% decline may not be enough to restore attractive risk-adjusted returns. Now, regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. 1.
