UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 28 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research.

Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: The Shattered Mirror of Globalisation: Unveiling the Consequences for the Electricity Industry

Time Published: 2025-02-27T23:33:44Z

This group brings together the best thinkers on energy and climate. Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going. Post Germán José Manuel Toro Ghio, son of Germán Alfonso and Jenny Isabel Cristina, became a citizen of planet Earth in the cold dawn of Sunday, May 11, 1958, in Santiago, capital of southern Chile.... Workart fully right of Germán & Co America stands at a fateful energy crossroads, echoing past cycles of crisis and retrenchment. From the 1970s oil shocks that spurred calls for independence to later complacency when oil was cheap, U.S. energy policy has repeatedly swung between urgency and inertia (Browner, 2010). Now climate change amplifies the stakes, making this moment a critical turning point. A new development came on January 20, 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending Inflation Reduction Act funding disbursements—particularly those referred to in Section 2 of the order. Nicknamed “Terminating the Green New Deal,” it also pauses Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act spending, effectively freezing billions allocated for clean energy and manufacturing projects (Magill, 2025). While the White House clarified that only certain segments of the law are affected, federal agencies face a 90-day deadline to review and propose new spending recommendations. One path still doubles down on fossil fuel dominance, promising short-term economic gains and energy security but locking in climate chaos and potential geopolitical liabilities (Reuters, 2024). The other path fully commits to renewable energy, delivering innovation and long-term sustainability. Yet overcoming powerful fossil fuel lobbies and reliance on foreign-made critical minerals remains challenging (Sayki and Cloutier, 2023). The U.S. stands at a high-stakes juncture—continuing the status quo risks climate disaster and missed technological leadership, while bold action could secure economic vitality for generations. Introduction: The United States has long fluctuated between prioritizing traditional energy sources (oil, gas, coal) and renewable energy in its national strategy. These shifts are rarely accidental; they reflect a complex interplay of industry ties, economic factors, and policy preferences among leaders. When policy leans toward traditional fossil fuels, it often correlates with strong lobbying influence and short-term economic arguments, whereas pushes for renewables tend to follow environmental concerns, innovation booms, or global agreements. This analysis examines: (1) historical swings in U.S. energy policy, (2) the economic impacts of fossil fuels vs. renewables (jobs, stability, subsidies), (3) how fossil industry lobbying shapes policy, (4) geopolitical implications of favoring traditional energy (security, trade, diplomacy), and (5) the environmental consequences of pivoting away from renewables. U.S. energy policy has see-sawed over the decades, with periods of innovation and renewable investment often followed by returns to oil, gas, and even coal. Key shifts include: 1970s – Crisis and Alternatives: The 1973 oil embargo and energy crisis jolted policymakers into reducing dependence on foreign oil. The government funded the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, while also investing in renewable fuels and R&D (ethanol, biodiesel, solar, wind) for the first time (Choices Article - Evolution of Renewable Energy Policy). Conservation took hold: Congress enacted fuel economy standards, and Americans embraced energy efficiency, briefly curbing demand growth (Choices Article - Evolution of Renewable Energy Policy). 1980s – Return to Oil: With oil prices stabilizing in the mid-1980s, momentum for renewables waned. Federal tax credits for solar and wind established in the late ‘70s expired, and President Reagan famously removed solar panels from the White House roof, signaling a policy reversion to traditional energy. Domestic oil and gas production and deregulation were again emphasized, while nascent renewable programs stalled (no major new federal mandates in this era). 1990s – Mixed Signals: Low energy prices kept renewables on the policy back-burner for much of the 1990s. However, concerns about energy security resurfaced when global demand pushed oil prices up in the late ‘90s (Choices Article - Evolution of Renewable Energy Policy). The 1992 Energy Policy Act and other laws introduced some incentives for alternative energy (e.g. wind production tax credit in 1992) and required federal fleets to use alternative fuels, but fossil fuels still dominated the agenda. 2000s – Energy Security vs. Climate: The early 2000s saw industry influence at a peak. In 2001, Vice President Dick Cheney’s Energy Task Force—stacked with oil executives—drafted a policy focused on expanding fossil production. (The task force met at least six times with Enron and other energy company executives behind closed doors (Big GOP contributor advised administration's energy task force – Center for Public Integrity), spurring lawsuits over the secrecy and undue influence (Big GOP contributor advised administration's energy task force – Center for Public Integrity).) President George W. Bush, himself from the oil industry, nonetheless supported some renewables for energy security – the 2005 energy law established a renewable fuel standard for ethanol, and his administration promoted biofuels to reduce oil import dependence (Choices Article - Evolution of Renewable Energy Policy). By contrast, states like California began adopting aggressive renewable portfolio standards. Late in the decade, President Obama’s 2009 stimulus injected billions into clean energy and efficiency, marking a strong pivot toward renewables and climate policy (e.g. subsidies for solar, wind, electric vehicles, and the beginnings of EPA carbon regulations). 2010s – Transition and Pushback: Under Obama, the U.S. joined the Paris Climate Agreement and implemented the Clean Power Plan to shift electricity from coal to wind, solar, and gas. Renewable generation surged, while coal plant closures accelerated. However, the 2016 election ushered in a sharp reversal. President Donald Trump made a “America First Energy Plan” to revive coal and expand oil and gas the centerpiece of his agenda. He withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and rolled back Obama-era regulations, justifying a “robust emphasis on fossil fuels” and a scaling back of renewable programs as necessary for lower energy prices and “energy dominance” (Trump has big plans for climate and energy policy, but can he implement them?). This meant more federal land drilling, faster pipeline approvals, and attempts to bail out coal plants. Despite this traditional energy push, market forces (cheap natural gas, falling renewable costs) kept driving a renewables rise through the late 2010s. 2020s – Climate Priorities Return: In 2021, the pendulum swung again. The Biden administration rejoined the Paris accord and passed unprecedented clean energy investments (the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 alone put $369 billion toward clean energy). Even so, debates continue: global events like the 2022 war in Ukraine prompted calls for more U.S. oil and gas production to secure allies’ energy supply, showing the constant tension between short-term energy security goals and long-term climate/renewable goals in U.S. strategy. Economic considerations are central to energy policy decisions. Politicians often weigh the job creation potential, market stability, and subsidies of fossil fuels against those of renewables – and these factors can cut both ways: Jobs and Industry Growth: Traditional energy sectors (oil, gas, coal) have historically been major employers, but clean energy now leads in job creation. By the late 2010s, U.S. clean energy jobs already outnumbered fossil fuel jobs roughly 3-to-1 (). For example, solar panel installers and wind turbine technicians became some of the fastest-growing occupations. One report found over 3.3 million Americans were employed in clean energy (renewables, energy efficiency, electric vehicles) in 2018, far exceeding fossil fuel extraction and generation jobs (). These trends continued into the 2020s as solar and wind capacity expanded. In contrast, coal mining jobs have steadily declined for decades due to automation and competition, and even oil/gas employment can swing with commodity prices. Renewable energy investments tend to produce more jobs per dollar because they are more labor-intensive during construction and installation (e.g. building a wind farm employs many workers even if operating it later is low-labor). This makes the “jobs” argument for shifting back to fossil fuels weaker over time, except in specific regions (e.g. coal country) where fossil jobs are concentrated. Market Stability and Energy Costs: Fossil fuel markets are inherently cyclical and volatile – oil and gas prices boom and bust based on global supply, conflict, and OPEC decisions. This volatility can destabilize the broader economy: in fact, spiking fossil energy prices were responsible for about one-third of the 9.1% U.S. inflation at the peak of 2022 (Fossil Fuel–Driven Price Volatility Demonstrates the Need for a Renewable Transition - Roosevelt Institute). Renewables, by contrast, have stable and declining costs over time (once a solar farm is built, the “fuel” – sunlight – is free). Greater adoption of renewables can insulate the economy from oil price shocks. A recent analysis argues that relying on fossil fuels poses a “persistent threat” to price stability, and that shifting to renewable electricity would help tame long-term inflation fluctuations (Fossil Fuel–Driven Price Volatility Demonstrates the Need for a Renewable Transition - Roosevelt Institute). However, opponents of rapid renewable adoption point out short-term reliability and integration costs – e.g. the need for grid upgrades and storage – which can affect energy prices during the transition. Still, on a per-unit cost basis, wind and solar are now often the cheapest new sources of power in the U.S., even beating natural gas in many regions (especially when volatility is factored in). Government Subsidies and Support: Fossil fuels have enjoyed generous government support for decades, far more than renewables until very recently. Tax breaks and subsidies for oil, gas, and coal date back as far as the early 20th century (and even the 1800s in the case of coal tariffs) A historical review noted that federal support for renewables has been “minimal compared with the past government investment in coal, gas, oil, or nuclear,” which helped those traditional industries grow ([Long-History-US-Energy-Subsidies Even today, the U.S. tax code provides oil and gas producers deductions for drilling costs, depletion allowances, and other incentives that effectively subsidize fossil energy. In addition, external costs like climate change and pollution are not priced into fossil fuels (another implicit subsidy). Renewables also receive subsidies (e.g. federal wind and solar tax credits, state renewable mandates), but these only scaled up significantly in the 2000s-2010s. By the 2020s, federal policy began leveling the field – the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 created long-term tax credits for clean energy worth hundreds of billions, aiming to spur domestic manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, etc. The economic debate often centers on which sector deserves public support: proponents of fossil fuels argue they provide reliable energy and tax revenues, while clean energy advocates note that investment in renewables yields future industries and avoids environmental damages. Notably, studies show renewable investments generate good-paying jobs and innovation without the long-term environmental liabilities of fossil fuels. In summary, short-term economic arguments for sticking with traditional energy (existing jobs, immediate infrastructure) are weighed against long-term gains from the growing, more stable clean energy economy. The trajectory of U.S. energy strategy cannot be understood without acknowledging the power of the fossil fuel lobby. Oil, gas, and coal companies have deep ties in Washington, built over a century of political spending and networking, which they use to shape policy in their favor. Key aspects of this influence include: Lobbying Expenditures and Campaign Funding: The fossil fuel industry is one of the top spenders on lobbying federal officials. In 2022 alone, the U.S. oil and gas industry spent about $124.4 million lobbying Congress and the executive branch (Oil and gas industry spent $124.4 million on federal lobbying amid record profits in 2022 • OpenSecrets). This money funds armies of lobbyists who advocate for permits, tax breaks, and favorable regulations for drilling and mining. Moreover, industry trade groups like the American Petroleum Institute amplify this influence (API spent over $4 million on lobbying in 2022) (Oil and gas industry spent $124.4 million on federal lobbying amid record profits in 2022 • OpenSecrets). The industry also pours tens of millions into campaign contributions, predominantly to politicians who oppose aggressive climate policies. Over the 2000s, fossil-fuel-linked political action committees and donors outspent renewable energy advocates by a wide margin – one analysis found that anti-climate lobby groups and PACs outspent climate advocacy by 27-to-1 from 2008 to 2018 (Oil and gas industry spent $124.4 million on federal lobbying amid record profits in 2022 • OpenSecrets). This financial clout translates to access: lawmakers reliant on campaign funds are more likely to vote against carbon taxes or to support oil subsidies. The result is often policy gridlock or rollback on clean energy initiatives whenever fossil interests are threatened. Revolving Doors and Policy Capture: Beyond money, fossil fuel companies have secured influence by positioning allies in government. It’s common for oil executives and lobbyists to rotate into top energy policy jobs (and vice versa). For example, in the early 2000s, Vice President Cheney (a former oil-services CEO) convened an energy task force that met secretly with industry executives to craft national energy policy (Big GOP contributor advised administration's energy task force – Center for Public Integrity). The task force’s recommendations closely mirrored oil and gas industry wishes, highlighting how direct input from industry insiders can steer policy. More recently, during the Trump administration, several key officials had oil industry ties – from the Secretary of State (ex-ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson) to Interior Department appointees who had worked for extractive industries. These ties often led to regulatory appointments of individuals skeptical of renewable energy or climate science, and decisions like opening more public lands to drilling or weakening methane emission rules. In short, the fossil lobby’s influence permeates all levels: writing legislation, guiding agency rules, and even shaping public narratives (through funding of think tanks and advertising). By contrast, the renewable energy lobby and environmental groups, while growing in influence, have historically had far fewer resources. This imbalance helps explain why U.S. policies have sometimes been slow to embrace renewables despite their technological viability – incumbent industries use political power to delay the transition. Energy policy is not just a domestic issue; it has far-reaching geopolitical effects. Emphasizing traditional fossil fuels in U.S. strategy carries a mix of benefits and risks for national security, global markets, and diplomacy: Energy Security and Independence: A key argument for boosting domestic oil, gas, and coal is to improve U.S. energy security – ensuring the nation isn’t overly reliant on foreign suppliers. In the past 15 years, the U.S. shale revolution dramatically increased domestic production, making the U.S. the world’s largest producer of petroleum and natural gas by the mid-2010s (Geopolitical implications of U.S. oil and gas in the global market). Greater output at home means less dependence on unstable regions: for example, U.S. imports of oil have fallen from over 60% of consumption in 2005 to roughly 25% by 2019. A fossil-focused “energy dominance” strategy leverages this boon – using abundant U.S. oil and gas to supply both domestic needs and allies abroad. Indeed, expanding LNG (liquefied natural gas) exports has given the U.S. a tool to help Europe diversify away from Russian gas. However, true energy independence remains elusive. Even at record production, the U.S. still imports about 10 million barrels of oil per day, and domestic prices are tied to the volatile global market (Geopolitical implications of U.S. oil and gas in the global market). Prioritizing fossil fuels may increase production, but it cannot fully shield the U.S. from global price shocks or supply disruptions (e.g. a war in the Middle East can still send U.S. gasoline prices soaring). By contrast, a more renewable-based system would source energy from domestic wind, sun, and other inexhaustible resources, reducing vulnerability to international supply swings once the infrastructure is in place. In sum, boosting traditional energy offers short-term security via supply abundance, yet it keeps the U.S. tethered to a volatile global fossil market in the long run. Trade Dependencies: The choice between fossil and renewable emphasis also affects trade relationships and dependencies. Relying on oil often entangles the U.S. with petrostates (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Venezuela) to secure supply or stabilize prices. Conversely, pursuing renewables can create new dependencies on clean technology supply chains – notably, minerals and manufacturing dominated by China. For instance, China today accounts for nearly 85% of global solar panel production (Regional distribution of solar module production | Statista) and is a leading supplier of lithium-ion batteries for energy storage and electric vehicles. If the U.S. forgoes investing in renewables now, it might later find itself buying solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries from abroad, ceding industrial leadership to rivals. We already see this in the solar sector: China’s massive scale and control of raw materials have given it a near-monopoly in solar manufacturing. Thus, a fossil-centric path could swap one dependency (oil from OPEC) for another (clean tech hardware from Asia) as the world eventually transitions. From a trade perspective, there is also a risk that U.S. goods could face carbon tariffs in the future from regions like the EU if America is viewed as not doing its share on emissions. On the positive side, maintaining robust oil and gas capacity allows the U.S. to be an energy exporter. In recent years the U.S. became a top LNG exporter, strengthening trade ties with gas-importing allies (Europe, Japan) and undercutting adversaries who use energy as coercion. In summary, geopolitics cuts both ways: traditional energy dominance can bolster U.S. influence in hydrocarbon markets, but a lagging clean tech sector could leave the U.S. dependent on foreign renewable technology in the future. Diplomatic Strategy and Global Leadership: Energy policy sends a powerful signal about U.S. global priorities. Emphasizing fossil fuels domestically often goes hand-in-hand with a retreat from international climate initiatives, which can strain alliances with countries prioritizing climate action. A vivid example was the Trump administration’s decision to quit the Paris Climate Agreement and champion coal at UN climate forums, which isolated the U.S. from European allies and undermined U.S. credibility in global environmental diplomacy (Trump has big plans for climate and energy policy, but can he implement them?). Countries in the EU, as well as emerging powers vulnerable to climate impacts, generally want the U.S. engaged in the clean energy transition. If U.S. policy swings back to traditional energy, it may gain favor with other petro-states (creating closer ties with countries like Saudi Arabia or Russia on energy matters) but at the cost of diplomatic capital with a much larger group of nations committed to carbon reduction. Moreover, climate change is increasingly at the center of international security discussions; a U.S. that downplays renewables may be seen as not leading on one of the defining issues of the century. On the other hand, being a major fossil fuel producer does give the U.S. certain strategic advantages: it can impose oil sanctions on adversaries (as it did on Iran and Venezuela) with less fear of domestic shortages, and it can use energy exports as a foreign policy tool (for instance, offering shipments of LNG to friends in need). Ultimately, prioritizing traditional energy provides short-term geopolitical leverage in a fossil-fuel-driven world, but it runs the risk of diminishing U.S. leadership in the inevitable global shift toward clean energy. Many experts note that the energy transition will redraw geopolitical maps – countries that lead in renewable technologies may gain influence, while those clinging solely to fossil fuels could see their power wane as demand for oil declines in the long run. The U.S. faces a strategic choice in that regard. Perhaps the most profound impact of favoring fossil fuels over renewables is on the environment and climate. The scientific consensus is clear that burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global climate change, and that a rapid transition to clean energy is needed to avoid catastrophic impacts. The environmental stakes of the policy reversal are high: Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Fossil fuel combustion (for electricity, transportation, and industry) accounts for the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Renewables, by contrast, produce little to no direct emissions. For example, a wind turbine or solar panel emits essentially zero CO₂ in operation, whereas a coal plant releases roughly 1 ton of CO₂ per MWh. If the U.S. slows its renewable energy build-out and burns more coal, oil, and gas, its emissions trajectory will worsen. This would undermine national targets to cut emissions (the U.S. pledged a 50% reduction by 2030 under Paris) and make global climate stabilization harder. Recent progress illustrates the difference policy can make: U.S. energy-related carbon emissions had been declining in part due to coal-to-gas switching and renewable growth (US Energy Policy: A Changing Landscape) (US Energy Policy: A Changing Landscape). But a resurgence of coal use or expanded oil consumption could reverse that decline. In short, shifting away from renewables means higher emissions, jeopardizing climate goals. One analysis projects that if clean energy transition stalls, U.S. emissions would only drop modestly by 2035 – far below what’s needed to limit warming. Beyond CO₂, increased fossil fuel use also elevates emissions of methane (from natural gas systems) and other pollutants. Pollution and Public Health: Traditional fossil fuels have significant environmental footprints beyond climate change. Coal-fired power plants and diesel engines emit pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and mercury, which degrade air quality and cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in the population. Oil drilling and coal mining can contaminate water supplies and destroy natural habitats. A policy shift favoring these sources would extend such impacts. By contrast, renewable energy has a much smaller environmental footprint. As a Department of Energy factsheet notes, the current U.S. fossil-heavy energy mix is linked to issues like acid rain, air pollution, and water contamination, whereas renewables can meet energy demand with far fewer of these side effects (U.S. Renewable Energy Factsheet | Center for Sustainable Systems). In 2018, it was estimated that air pollution from fossil fuels cost the global economy $2.9 trillion in health and environmental damages – costs that would fall dramatically in a cleaner energy scenario. Thus, stepping back from renewables carries an opportunity cost in lost health benefits. Additionally, fossil fuel infrastructure (pipelines, refineries, mines) often impacts vulnerable communities, raising environmental justice concerns if those are expanded. Climate Resilience and Environmental Sustainability: Ironically, doubling down on fossil fuels can make the U.S. less resilient in the face of climate change. As global warming accelerates, extreme weather (hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves) threatens energy infrastructure and reliability. A renewable-based, distributed energy system with energy storage is seen by experts as more adaptable and resilient to such disruptions (for example, rooftop solar with batteries can keep lights on during grid outages). If policy shifts focus back to centralized fossil power plants and a high-carbon system, the U.S. may face greater long-term costs from climate adaptation and disaster recovery. Moreover, the environmental momentum loss is significant: scaling back support for renewables could slow the improvement of technologies like energy storage, smart grids, and electric vehicles – all crucial for sustainability. In contrast, maintaining a renewable trajectory yields positive feedback: as solar, wind, and battery tech improve and scale up, they get cheaper and more efficient, accelerating emissions reductions further. A halt or reversal would delay that virtuous cycle. In summary, the environmental consequences of favoring traditional energy are unequivocally negative: higher greenhouse emissions driving more severe climate change, more air and water pollution harming public health, and a missed chance to mitigate and adapt to climate risks. Every year of delay in the renewable transition locks in additional CO₂ in the atmosphere that will persist for centuries. This is why many scientists and economists argue that the long-term environmental costs of reverting to fossil fuels far outweigh any short-term economic gains. Renewable energy, while not impact-free, offers a path to sustainable growth that fossil fuels simply cannot match in environmental performance (renewables produce far less greenhouse gas and pollution in operation (Environmental Impacts of Renewable Energy Sources | ADEC ESG)).

Before we delve into the core issues, we must recognize a communications software firm in Stockholm. Their digital cluster has been instrumental in conducting rigorous hypothesis testing and minimising biases. This acknowledgement is particularly crucial in today's world, where geopolitical connections are increasingly unusual, disruptive, and strained across two hundred partnerships. Moreover, we find ourselves in an era devoid of clear ideological principles. One prominent thinker, Peter Wason, suggested that what seems illogical can be logical. Given our limited computing resources, the software company's collaborative spirit has been essential in navigating these complexities. Wason's work, particularly the Wason selection task, highlighted: ¨how human reasoning can often be counterintuitive and influenced by context, showing that logical structures can appear illogical depending on their presentation... At the break of dawn, Spanish newspapers with global reach announced the passing of Mexican singer Francisca Viveros Barradas, known as Paquita la del Barrio, at the age of 77. Her powerful contralto voice, rebellious persona, and extraordinary ability to channel the depths of heartbreak made her a beacon of what could be called a culture of heartache and disillusionment. Through fiery lyrics of betrayal, confusion, and sorrow—forever immortalized in the now-iconic phrase “¿Me estás oyendo, inútil?” (“Are you listening to me, you useless man?”)—Paquita gave voice to those who felt wronged or discarded. Her song “Rata de dos patas,” composed by Manuel Eduardo Toscano and featured on the 2001 album ¨Taco Placero¨, transcended Mexican cantinas, becoming an anthem of empowerment and emotional catharsis worldwide. Connecting such intensely personal themes to broader global affairs may seem unlikely. Yet, Paquita’s raw, impassioned ballads resonate in a world grappling with profound upheaval—where betrayal and shattered trust extend beyond the personal realm to societal and political dimensions. In hidden corners of large cities, amid bustling avenues and unpaved streets where crises simmer and injustice thrives, her unwavering spirit reminds us that from the ashes of heartbreak can spring the drive for transformative change. One anecdote even recounts culture ministers from across the Americas and the Caribbean, after a day of diplomacy, belting out Paquita’s rancheras in a famed venue called “El Munich,” shouting, “Are you listening to me, you useless man?” in unison—a testament to the universality of heartbreak and frustration. Such sentiments of accumulated grievances, deep-seated mistrust, and the urgent need for collective catharsis are also mirrored in the complexities of the energy sector. To understand the current state of the electrical industry, we must trace its evolution nearly a century back. Some researchers argue it was shaped by the interwar period, when rising nationalism and propaganda paved the way for Nazism and global conflict. Others, such as Mr. Steven Bannon, point to more recent events—particularly the 2019 Wuhan crisis—as pivotal in this historical trajectory. Among the primary challenges in our research was establishing a historical period as a baseline and identifying manifest variables as triggers. Consequently, we compared wealth distribution, electricity consumption, and pricing between the affluent “Champagne Cup Society” of the 1980s and today’s billionaire, technology-driven era. We introduced multiple data points into various analytical models to examine how disruptive shifts in global markets have eroded accountability in the energy industry. We also explored the political dilemma of balancing stable governance and rotating leadership—a core principle of democracy—against the sudden disruptions that can destabilise institutions in fragile developing nations. Trust is central to sustaining institutional stability and credibility, a variable we identified as indispensable. Interestingly, our initial findings uncovered “structural imbalances reminiscent of those in a fractured relationship.” But where exactly do these imbalances reside? Among nations, institutions, social groups, or individuals? Who stands to gain, and who is left vulnerable? These questions highlight how deeply economic and political power imbalances can mirror the raw emotional discord Paquita so hauntingly captured. In love and global energy policy, trust is the central issue—its breach leading to heartbreak, upheaval, and an urgent call for systemic change. Earthjustice. (2024). Two Years Ago, We Passed the Biggest Climate Spending Bill Ever. Here’s What It Has Achieved. *Earthjustice*. In recent years, global observers have drawn parallels between deep-rooted economic frictions and the dynamics of a fractured relationship. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the structural imbalance primarily between China and the United States, driven by stark contrasts in trade flows and economic policies. China’s export-driven growth model, reinforced by low labor costs and state-led industrial strategies, clashes with the United States’ significant trade deficit and reliance on imported goods. Add to this divergence in currency regimes—China’s tightly managed yuan versus the freely traded U.S. dollar—and tensions surrounding intellectual property rights create the potential for a protracted trade conflict. These persistent discrepancies fuel broader geopolitical rivalries, evidenced by tit-for-tat tariffs, fierce negotiations, and looming threats of decoupling (Krugman, 2020). The second, more pressing question is whether the global trend genuinely favours renewable energy or pays lip service to it. The underlying challenge relates to “systemic inertia,” the entrenched structures of power and profit that remain heavily invested in coal, oil, and gas (IEA, 2022). While many nations are implementing policies to promote wind farms, solar parks, and battery storage, fossil fuel dependence is immense. Breaking free requires more than technological feasibility; it demands dismantling century-old financial and geopolitical frameworks built upon hydrocarbons. One analysis note, “Fossil fuels are not merely energy commodities; they form the bedrock of modern economies, geopolitical leverage, and global oil empires” (Bridge & Le Billon, 2017). This fundamental truth underscores why any shift towards renewables necessitates a deeper reconfiguration of global power hierarchies—challenging the states and corporations whose influence, capital, and infrastructure are intertwined with fossil extraction and trade. Herein lies the paradox: while new technologies and growing environmental imperatives advocate for decarbonisation, powerful actors defend fossil fuel interests under economic stability, energy security, and job protection. For instance, oil majors invest significantly in lobbying to extend drilling permits, while some governments hesitate to curtail their coal assets due to immediate revenue needs (Rystad Energy, 2022). Even in China—rapidly becoming a world leader in renewables—coal remains a substantial part of its energy matrix, attesting to the complex balance between growth targets and green initiatives (World Bank, 2023). Ultimately, the so-called “war” over energy sources runs more profound than the physical dominance of fossil fields. It is a battle over global order—deciding who writes the rules, who reaps the profits, and whose voice commands the conversation in the age of climate change. A mere pivot to solar panels and wind turbines is insufficient if underlying structures, from financial systems to political alliances, remain tethered to fossil paradigms. This clash could culminate in a genuine clean energy revolution—or a prolonged stalemate that tests the resilience of international cooperation. The fate of the planet’s climate, global prosperity, and geopolitical stability hinges on how swiftly or reluctantly these imbalances are resolved.I The global shift toward green energy has been monumental: trillions of dollars have poured into wind farms, solar installations, electric vehicle infrastructure, and emerging technologies such as hydrogen and advanced battery storage. These funds, sourced from banks, trade unions, and government subsidies, represent not merely a financial bet but a collective commitment to curbing the existential threat of climate change. Yet, the fate of these vast investments hinges on several critical factors that will determine whether green energy continues to flourish or stall under shifting political winds. First, policy stability remains paramount. While many governments set ambitious climate targets and enacted incentives for renewable energy, these policies can swing dramatically with leadership changes. A supportive administration may provide grants, tax breaks, and regulatory backing for new wind farms or solar arrays, only for a successor to scale back or freeze that funding. This inconsistency creates uncertainty for investors, raising the perceived risk of renewable projects. Strong, bipartisan policy frameworks are thus essential for long-term market confidence (IEA, 2023). Second, technological innovation is expanding at breakneck speed, driving down the cost of green energy. Solar and wind power are no longer fringe options; they are increasingly competitive with fossil fuels on a levelized cost basis (IRENA, 2022). Meanwhile, advancements in battery technology and hydrogen fuel cells address intermittency concerns, enabling greater grid flexibility. As new breakthroughs emerge—such as next-generation nuclear, carbon capture solutions, and energy-dense batteries—the green sector could become even more cost-effective, displacing the final barriers to widespread adoption. This virtuous cycle of innovation can, in turn, attract even more capital to the sector. Third, financial sector enthusiasm has shifted. In the past, renewable projects were regarded as niche or high-risk ventures. However, increasing climate awareness and pressure from stakeholders—from trade funds to institutional investors who are mindful of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues—have changed this perception criteria—and have propelled major banks and pension funds to commit billions to green portfolios. The rise of green bonds and sustainability-linked loans provides further evidence that capital markets now view clean energy as a viable, profitable sector (BloombergNEF, 2021). Still, market appetites can change rapidly: a technological stock downturn, a global recession, or geopolitically driven fossil fuel price manipulation could redirect investment flows. Finally, global cooperation plays a pivotal role. Climate change is an international crisis demanding coordinated action. If geopolitical rifts deepen—evidenced by trade wars and resource nationalism—supply chains for wind turbines, solar panels, and battery components could fragment. Such fragmentation would raise costs, hamper innovation, and slow deployment. Conversely, collaboration through treaties, research partnerships, and aligned industrial policies can expedite progress, ensuring that these trillion-dollar investments yield substantial environmental and economic returns (IPCC, 2023). In the end, the green energy sector stands at a critical inflection point. Trillions have already been invested, and many signs—from plummeting technology costs to growing public demand—are optimistic. Yet the sector’s future hinges on stable policy, technological breakthroughs, secure financing, and genuine global cooperation. Should these elements falter, the world risks squandering financial capital and a historic chance to mitigate climate change and reshape the global energy landscape. Rare earth elements (REEs)—a group of 17 metallic elements—have quietly become a decisive factor in the global balance of power [1]. Their unique properties render them essential for advanced defence systems, high-tech industries, and clean energy technologies, fostering intense competition among nations for secure access. [2]. This analysis of the strategic importance of REEs evaluates former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed mineral deal with Ukraine, explores the role of fossil fuels in the evolving world order, and considers how control over key resources might reshape global alignments among the United States, China, and Russia, disrupting all order in every regard. REEs are indispensable to modern economies. They power high-performance magnets in military hardware, electric vehicles, and wind turbines, essential for smartphones, computers, and other digital devices [2]. Although not geologically “rare,” REEs are costly to extract and refine, partly due to their chemical complexity and environmentally damaging byproducts [1]. This makes them strategically vital yet vulnerable to supply shocks. China dominates the global rare earth supply chain, accounting for roughly 90% of global processing capacity [6]. Through state-led investment, low labour costs, and relaxed environmental standards, China undercut other producers in the 1990s and 2000s, forcing mines elsewhere—including the U.S. Mountain Pass facility—to send ore to Chinese refineries [2]. Beijing has demonstrated a willingness to use export controls as a geopolitical lever, briefly suspending supplies to Japan in 2010 and threatening similar measures during trade tensions with the U.S. [7]. Such moves underscore the immense leverage conferred by rare earth dominance. Alarmed by China’s grip, the U.S. and Russia have accelerated efforts to expand domestic output. The U.S. invoked the Defense Production Act to finance new Texas separation facilities while promoting “friend-shoring” with allies like Australia and Canada [4]. Russia, holding sizable reserves of its own, is investing over a billion dollars to develop large deposits in Siberia in hopes of becoming the world’s second-largest producer [3][4]. Despite these efforts, China’s entrenched position remains a formidable obstacle, and shifting the balance will require years of sustained investment and policy coordination [1]. Strategic Significance of Ukraine’s Deposits Ukraine claims to hold up to 5% of the world’s “critical” raw materials, including several promising rare earth sites such as Novopoltavske [1]. This could bolster U.S. energy security and reduce reliance on China [2]. However, much of Ukraine’s mineral data stems from outdated Soviet-era surveys that lack modern feasibility assessments [1]. Many deposits lie in conflict zones, and the country’s energy infrastructure has been severely compromised by war [2][5]. Viability and Obstacles Rare earth extraction demands vast capital, advanced refining processes, and long development timelines—often exceeding a decade [2]. Even if Ukraine confirmed substantial reserves, building the necessary processing infrastructure would be prohibitively expensive, especially amid ongoing hostilities [2][5]. S&P Global deems Ukraine’s REE deposits potentially unprofitable in the short term given high costs, security risks, and logistical barriers [1]. Deal Terms and Friction President Trump’s proposed agreement sought preferential access to Ukraine’s raw materials—potentially claiming 50% of future state-owned resource revenues—without offering Ukraine firm security guarantees [1]. This arrangement alarmed Ukrainian officials, who viewed it as ceding strategic assets without ensuring their defense needs. Negotiations stalled, reflecting the transactional approach favored by the Trump administration and underscoring Ukraine’s precarious position as both a beneficiary of Western support and a potential resource colony [1][2]. In parallel with its global push, China recently signed a deal to develop 280,000 hectares for rare earth mining in Nicaragua [11]. The venture expands Beijing’s reach in Latin America, mirroring similar overseas investments aimed at consolidating control over strategic minerals. Although initial surveys suggest significant REE potential, these deposits' quality and economic viability remain untested [11]. Should they prove profitable, China’s dominance in the sector could grow further, complicating Western efforts to diversify supply chains and secure alternative sources of critical materials [2]. While REEs capture headlines in high-tech sectors, fossil fuels remain a cornerstone of economic and geopolitical power [8]. Central proven oil and natural gas reserves in regions like Canada, China, Venezuela, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Iran, Turkey, Norway, various African nations, and the Arab world continue to shape alliance patterns and trade flows [8][9]. For instance, OPEC+ production decisions can ripple global markets, influencing everything from inflation rates to diplomatic leverage [9]. According to BP’s latest estimates, the world’s proven natural gas reserves could sustain consumption for approximately 50 years [9]. This abundant yet finite supply underpins critical industries and strategic relationships; countries blessed with rich hydrocarbon deposits often wield substantial influence in multilateral negotiations [10]. Even as the clean energy transition accelerates, oil and gas demand remains robust, particularly in emerging markets. Yet balancing hydrocarbon revenues with climate goals has become a significant policy challenge. Governments across the globe—whether in oil-exporting states like Saudi Arabia or gas-rich regions of Africa—face mounting pressure to diversify their economies and reduce dependence on fossil exports [8]. Conversely, consumer nations weigh energy security against environmental obligations, seeking stable supply while pursuing carbon neutrality targets [9]. This tension makes fossil fuels an integral part of the new global order, where traditional energy superpowers and rising renewable champions must navigate a complex interplay of markets, regulations, and diplomacy [10]. Just as oil shaped 20th-century geopolitics, control of REEs could define global power in the 21st century [6]. Nations with stable rare earth supply chains will lead in high-tech manufacturing and defence capabilities, while those lacking access risk economic and security vulnerabilities [7]. China, by maintaining dominance in REE processing, wields a potent tool of economic statecraft that can deter adversaries. Global demand for REEs is surging, fueling fears of “resource wars.” Although outright military clashes over REEs remain unlikely, coercive trade measures and zero-sum resource grabs may escalate tensions [3][6]. Nations holding large, untapped deposits could become flashpoints if foreign investors and local governments clash over extraction rights [5]. In response to China’s near monopoly, the U.S. and its allies have formed initiatives like the Minerals Security Partnership to develop new sources and processing plants in friendly nations [5]. This evolving landscape might result in a bifurcation of supply chains: one led by China (potentially partnered with Russia), and another by the U.S., EU, and allied states [4]. Long-term recycling and substitute materials innovation could mitigate these tensions by reducing dependence on virgin REEs [2][7]. Rare earth elements have shifted from obscure commodities to a focal point of 21st-century geopolitics [6]. The U.S.-China-Russia triangle underscores that REE access equates to strategic power, influencing diplomatic leverage, defence readiness, and industrial competitiveness [1][7]. Meanwhile, fossil fuels continue to undergird many global alliances, with vast oil and natural gas reserves shaping economic resilience and foreign policy [8][9]. As seen in President Trump’s contentious attempt to secure Ukrainian resources, these dynamics can strain alliances and reorder global alignments [2]. Whether the competition evolves into deeper conflict or spurs cooperative innovation depends on the major powers' political choices now. Both rare earths and fossil fuels remain at the heart of a new world order, one defined by resource security, technological leadership, and the delicate balance between national interests and global cooperation.

Energy infrastructure—the pipelines, power grids, ports, railways, and undersea cables that keep modern society running—has become a new battlefield in a surreptitious conflict. Across the globe, state and non-state actors alike engage in espionage, sabotage, and militarized manoeuvres to secure or disrupt energy lifelines. This “dirty war” in the electricity sector echoes past colonial contests over resources and yields far-reaching consequences for international stability and trust. Once seen as purely commercial or civilian, energy facilities are increasingly under military watch. Authorities fear disruptive attacks on power grids, gas terminals, and pipeline routes. In Poland, for example, the government approved legislation in 2023 granting the navy the authority to sink hostile vessels threatening the Baltic Pipe gas link from Norway. Such protection extends to ports, LNG terminals and undersea cables deemed vital to national security. NATO and the European Union similarly fortify undersea pipelines and cables amid heightened awareness following recent sabotage incidents. What was once the domain of engineers and private industry has become a critical theatre of state-level defence strategies. The wave of sabotage illustrates the vulnerability of energy infrastructure. The Nord Stream gas pipeline explosion in the Baltic Sea in September 2022 marked one of the most publicized acts of sabotage in recent history. Investigators concluded it was a deliberate operation but have not definitively attributed blame. The impact was immediate and disruptive, underscoring energy’s central role in geopolitical conflicts. Beyond pipelines, undersea cables carrying internet and electric power also face increased risk. In 2023 and 2024, submarine cables were mysteriously severed in the Baltic Sea, severing communication and potentially threatening energy transfers. While some incidents, such as the Balticconnector rupture between Finland and Estonia, were traced to accidental damage, others remain suspected. Such intrusions often involve “grey-zone” tactics that fall short of open war but are strategic tools to weaken opponents. Cyber threats are equally concerning: hackers linked to various state actors regularly target power grid control systems. The 2015 Ukraine power grid hack, which briefly disrupted electricity for hundreds of thousands, demonstrated the potential devastation of cyber sabotage. Similar tactics could be deployed elsewhere with equally dramatic effects. Today’s contest for energy infrastructure mirrors the 19th-century scramble for colonies, though focused on pipelines, ports, and undersea routes rather than territories. The United States continues its longstanding policy of maintaining a strong military presence in the Middle East to secure key oil shipping lanes. Control of these corridors confers substantial leverage over energy-importing rivals. China, in turn, is investing heavily in overseas infrastructure through the Belt and Road Initiative. Ports, pipelines, and refineries built under this framework enhance Beijing’s global reach. Western observers warn that these ostensibly commercial projects could become dual-use facilities, providing strategic advantages reminiscent of colonial-era imperial bases. Meanwhile, Russia has also wielded energy resources as a strategic lever, sometimes cutting off supplies to influence neighbors politically. Even a seemingly peripheral event can have broader implications. For example, Taiwan’s recent detention of a Congolese-flagged ship crewed by Chinese nationals is seen as a microcosm of more prominent rivalries. The vessel was allegedly involved in cutting an undersea cable, highlighting covert attempts at crippling opponents’ communications or power links without resorting to overt hostilities. While countries pledge transitions to cleaner energy, the immediate economic and political stakes tied to fossil fuels remain huge. The war in Ukraine demonstrates how disruptions in fossil fuel supply reverberate globally. For instance, Europe’s scramble to replace Russian gas sent prices soaring, placing vulnerable economies at risk and prompting wealthier nations to secure supplies first. Alongside oil and gas, rare earth elements—like lithium, cobalt, and other critical minerals—fuel geopolitical competition. These resources underpin electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines, and other green technologies crucial to modern economies. China’s dominance in rare earth processing grants it an outsized influence. In response, the U.S., EU, and partners are exploring mining options in Australia, Brazil, and Africa. Competition in this domain has the potential to mirror the 20th-century battles over oil concessions, further straining international relations. The normalization of sabotage erodes trust between nations, complicating collaboration efforts on shared challenges like climate change. Sabotage incidents require time-consuming investigations, generate widespread suspicion, and complicate negotiations. For instance, the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines continues to strain relations among implicated countries, fueling uncertainty over possible future attacks. Moreover, sabotage and cyber intrusions carry economic consequences, from price surges to disruptions in consumer supply. Countries that host strategic infrastructure may be coerced into choosing sides, intensifying blocs and rivalries. Such hostility drives further militarization, creating a feedback loop of suspicion, escalation, and potential open conflict. Despite these challenges, some international frameworks show promise. NATO and the EU have bolstered joint defences of undersea critical infrastructure, and there is growing dialogue on establishing new norms akin to arms-control treaties—albeit for underwater cables and pipeline security. Multilateral cooperation on traceability and accountability in cyberspace could also mitigate risks. Yet these measures remain nascent, and powerful states often flout rules when national interests are at stake. In this era of heightened energy competition, pipelines, grids, and undersea cables play outsized roles in shaping national security. As major powers bolster infrastructure defenses, employ covert sabotage tactics, and jockey for resources, the potential for larger-scale conflict grows. Without robust international cooperation and updated regulatory frameworks, the “dirty war” in the electricity sector will persist, imperilling modern life's networks. To avoid further destabilization, nations must recognize the shared vulnerability of critical energy infrastructure and commit to mutual restraint—lest these clandestine hostilities endanger the entire global system.

The recent and abrupt foreign policy shift by the United States—signalled most starkly by a vote against Ukraine and an unexpected alignment with countries like Cuba, China, Iran, Nicaragua, and North Korea—has upended the carefully woven tapestry of transatlantic cooperation. Observers worldwide describe an “upside-down world” where once-stable alliances appear inverted. Two centuries of collaborative legacy between Europe and America now risk unraveling, raising questions about the durability of a relationship that has shaped modern international structures. Historically, the United States and Europe have shared deep-rooted political, economic, and cultural ties. In the early nineteenth century, a convergence of ideas on democracy, free markets, and liberal governance cultivated trust across the Atlantic. Over time, bilateral trade expanded, and intellectual exchanges accelerated the adoption of shared values, particularly during watershed moments like the Enlightenment’s final echoes in Europe and the US’s pioneering experiments in republican governance. By the early twentieth century, cooperation deepened further with the United States’ decisive entry into World War I, setting the stage for broader strategic alignment. The bond grew even more robust during and after World War II. Europe and America jointly confronted fascist powers, leading to an era of sweeping multilateralism. The Marshall Plan, conceived under President Harry Truman, funnelled critical financial support to a devastated Europe, spurring economic recovery and forging unbreakable political friendships. NATO, also formed under Truman’s watch, symbolized collective security, ensuring that any threat to one nation would be met with a united response from all allies. These initiatives turned shared ideals into tangible structures that anchored global affairs. Throughout the Cold War, this Western alliance stood as the first line of defense against Soviet expansion. European nations, often with heavy American investment and military backing, maintained strong institutions that safeguarded democratic freedoms. The eventual collapse of the Eastern Bloc seemed to validate transatlantic unity, offering a blueprint for how shared sacrifices and diplomatic coordination could bring about systemic change. In recent years, however, subtle fractures emerged, often attributed to disagreements over trade tariffs, differing stances on climate commitments, and questions of burden-sharing in NATO. Yet nothing prepared the world for the scale of the latest pivot in Washington. The United States, once a stalwart supporter of Ukraine, has broken from tradition and aligned itself with regimes historically at odds with Western values. This move has confounded European capitals, questioning the reliability of an ally that once championed democracy worldwide. Economic repercussions loom as well, since regulatory frameworks and trade agreements have become closely intertwined with mutual defense obligations. Politically, a departure from the established consensus on renewable energy further exposes these rifts. Europe has pioneered large-scale green initiatives, counting on American support for a global push toward sustainability. Now faced with an inconsistent U.S. approach—one moment endorsing climate action, the next favoring resource deals with authoritarian regimes—European leaders worry about long-term cooperation. The potential collapse of critical transatlantic projects jeopardizes not only the symbolic unity of the West but also practical collaboration on technological innovation and ecological resilience. Despite the unpredictability in Washington, the history binding Europe and America remains profound. Together, they weathered numerous crises, from the Napoleonic aftermath to the World Wars and the bipolar Cold War standoff. These cumulative experiences underscore a resilience that might yet withstand current upheavals. Recalling the spirit of Truman’s transformative initiatives, voices on both sides of the Atlantic urge for renewed diplomatic engagements. Joint policy statements, multilateral gatherings, and grassroots cultural exchanges could serve as anchors, reminding policymakers of the immense value embedded in two centuries of collective achievements. In an era fraught with crises—geopolitical tensions, energy uncertainties, and emerging global threats—this partnership’s future hinges on a delicate balancing act. If the rift widens, the world may face an even more fragmented international order, prone to regional power plays and ideological competition. Conversely, a recommitment to democratic principles, economic synergies, and security cooperation could reinvigorate the ties that have, for so long, maintained relative global stability. Whether these bonds endure will depend on leaders' willingness, on both sides of the Atlantic, to remember the legacy of 200 years and find the foresight to preserve it. Freedman, L.

However, beyond its bold and defiant lyrics, some cultural commentators point to a significant political backstory tied to the “Solidaridad” (Solidarity) program introduced by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988–1994). This initiative was initially promoted as an innovative strategy to combat poverty by channeling resources into marginalized regions, developing infrastructure, and fostering community participation in Mexico and throughout the Americas. At first, Solidaridad was lauded for its apparent promise. Schools, clinics, and roads were to be built in rural and impoverished areas, raising hopes for tangible economic and social progress. Over time, dissenting voices grew louder, alleging that the program operated more as a political tool than a true path to development. Accusations of clientelism and misappropriation of funds further tarnished Solidaridad’s reputation. According to critics, this supposedly “wonderful” program quickly revealed itself as an empty mirage, concealing a web of corruption that ultimately undermined its lofty rhetoric. In this context, the piercing anger of “Rata de dos patas” takes on fresh significance. Beyond capturing the bitterness of romantic betrayal, the song reflects a broader sense of disillusionment and outrage among communities that felt hoodwinked by a government claiming to champion their needs. The biting insult of “rat” fits neatly with the sentiment of being deceived: just as the unmasked illusions of Solidaridad laid bare the administration’s failings, Paquita’s lyrics call out false promises and moral bankruptcy. Consequently, “Rata de dos patas” not only stands as a cultural emblem of spurned love but also underscores the depth of collective frustration when political promises implode under their weight, revealing a stark reality of broken trust and unmet expectations. The song's impact on political science is profound, as it highlights the emotional resonance of political betrayal. It serves as a reminder that political promises, when unfulfilled, can lead to deep-seated mistrust and disillusionment among citizens. This mistrust can have far-reaching consequences, affecting voter turnout, civic engagement, and overall confidence in democratic institutions. The lyrics of “Rata de dos patas” tap into a universal sentiment of feeling let down by those in power, making it a potent symbol of political discontent. Moreover, the song's enduring popularity underscores the importance of cultural expressions in political discourse. Music and art often reflect societal sentiments more vividly than academic analyses, providing a lens through which to view the emotional undercurrents of political events. In this way, “Rata de dos patas” becomes a tool for understanding the emotional landscape of political disappointment and the challenges faced by governments in maintaining public trust. In an era fraught with crises—geopolitical tensions, energy uncertainties, and emerging global threats—this partnership’s future hinges on a delicate balancing act. If the rift widens, the world may face an even more fragmented international order, prone to regional power plays and ideological competition. Conversely, a recommitment to democratic principles, economic synergies, and security cooperation could reinvigorate the ties that have, for so long, maintained relative global stability. Whether these bonds endure will depend on leaders' willingness, on both sides of the Atlantic, to remember the legacy of 200 years and find the foresight to preserve it. The legacy of “Rata de dos patas” serves as a cautionary tale for political leaders, emphasizing the importance of transparency, accountability, and genuine commitment to the welfare of citizens. It reminds us that political actions have emotional consequences that can resonate deeply within society, shaping public perception and trust in governance. As such, the song stands as a testament to the power of cultural expressions in reflecting and influencing political sentiments, highlighting the need for integrity and honesty in political leadership.

Let’s dive deeper—where should we explore next? 🚀📊🔍 The world faces an unprecedented convergence of global risks, many of which stem from resource competition, geopolitical realignments, climate change, and emerging energy vulnerabilities. These risks threaten stability, economic prosperity, and long-term security. The growing demand for fossil fuels, rare earth elements (REEs), and critical minerals has heightened tensions between major economies, exacerbating geopolitical rivalries and increasing the potential for direct military confrontations. The dominance of China in rare earth processing (controlling over 90% of the global market) has led to strategic stockpiling by Western nations and efforts to diversify supply chains. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Canada are racing to develop their own mining and refining capacity, while Russia is expanding rare earth mining in Siberia to counterbalance Western influence. Countries that control these resources gain technological and defense advantages, shaping the next global power struggle. The Nord Stream pipeline explosions in 2022 marked a turning point in the security of global energy infrastructure, demonstrating how critical pipelines and undersea cables remain vulnerable to cyberattacks, sabotage, and geopolitical disruptions. More recently, mystery attacks on Baltic gas pipelines and power cables (2023–24) have raised alarm over covert hybrid warfare tactics used to destabilize nations. Energy grids, telecommunications infrastructure, and key shipping routes (such as the Panama Canal and the Strait of Hormuz) have become primary targets in a new era of energy-based conflicts. The fracturing of global alliances and the erosion of diplomatic trust pose serious risks. U.S.–China tensions over trade, technology, and REEs have led to a strategic decoupling of supply chains. Meanwhile, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Western sanctions have redrawn global trade routes, forcing Moscow to pivot energy exports toward China and India. The European Union’s push for energy independence from Russia has reshaped global LNG markets, while Iran’s renewed oil trade with China has further divided global energy alliances. These shifting relationships highlight structural imbalances reminiscent of those in a fractured relationship, where major powers increasingly act unilaterally rather than cooperatively. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and water shortages are accelerating the need for a global energy transition. However, this transition is being delayed by political divisions over fossil fuel dependency, with some governments prioritizing energy security over climate commitments. The U.S., EU, and China continue to invest in renewables, but OPEC nations and fossil fuel-dependent economies resist rapid shifts. Climate-driven resource conflicts—such as disputes over drought-stricken river basins, desertification, and access to lithium deposits—are emerging as new flashpoints in global stability. Together, these risks underscore the fragility of modern energy, trade, and security networks, highlighting the urgent need for resilience strategies. The global energy sector is at a crossroads, with two competing pathways: Continuation of Fossil Fuels Many governments prioritize short-term energy security by extending the life of oil, gas, and coal, particularly in response to geopolitical disruptions and energy crises. The ongoing war in Ukraine, rising tensions in the Middle East, and U.S. policy shifts under a second Trump administration could see increased fossil fuel production and deregulation. Gradual but Unstoppable Rise of Renewables Technological breakthroughs in solar, wind, energy storage, and hydrogen will continue, driven by declining costs, corporate net-zero pledges, and public demand for clean air. However, major challenges remain: scaling battery production, securing REE supplies, and overhauling outdated grid infrastructure to accommodate intermittent renewables. Automation, AI-driven energy management, and advanced smart grids will be crucial for integrating these energy sources efficiently. Additionally, the race to secure critical minerals for electric vehicle (EV) batteries—including lithium, nickel, and cobalt—will reshape global trade relationships. In the near future, most nations will rely on hybrid energy systems, integrating renewables with traditional baseload power (natural gas, coal, nuclear). The continued reliance on gas-fired power plants will ensure stability, especially as grids adapt to variable wind and solar generation. Over time, improved battery storage, decentralized grids, and advanced transmission technologies will allow renewables to supply the majority of global electricity demand. Regions investing in offshore wind, advanced geothermal, and next-generation nuclear reactors will lead the transition. The global energy mix will remain diverse but will vary based on policy and technological advances: Fossil Fuels: Oil and gas remain dominant in transportation, heavy industry, and power generation, especially where energy security concerns outweigh climate commitments. Renewables: Wind, solar, and geothermal continue to grow, with government incentives and falling technology costs driving adoption. Nuclear: Some countries (France, Canada, China) are reinvesting in nuclear power for stable, low-carbon electricity, though waste management and safety concerns remain barriers. Hydrogen: Green hydrogen could replace natural gas in industrial applications, but cost reductions and infrastructure development are needed before mass adoption. Despite political setbacks (such as U.S. policy reversals under Trump), long-term trends still favor renewables. Key drivers include: Cost-competitiveness: Wind and solar power are now cheaper than fossil fuels in many regions. Government incentives: Policies such as Europe’s Green Deal and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provide billions in subsidies for clean energy projects. Corporate demand: Tech giants and multinational corporations are shifting to 100% renewable energy, driving investment. International commitments: Even amid political uncertainty, nations are increasingly bound by climate treaties and emission reduction goals. While the U.S. has the resources and market size to sustain itself economically, losing Europe as a trade partner and geopolitical ally would weaken its global influence. A transatlantic split could lead to: Stronger EU-China cooperation on trade and clean energy technology. U.S. energy and defense industry setbacks, as Europe seeks alternative suppliers. Weakened NATO cohesion, making global security more volatile. Europe, in turn, would face challenges in replacing U.S. military and economic cooperation, potentially accelerating its move toward strategic autonomy. Financial markets are increasingly favoring clean energy investments, but uncertainty remains. Banks may: Limit funding for high-risk renewable projects in regions with unstable policies. Favor fossil fuel expansion if policy shifts suggest stronger government backing. Increase green financing options in response to carbon-neutral pledges. No. Energy transitions, infrastructure projects, and supply chain realignments take decades, not years. While short-term policies can set the direction, achieving meaningful transformation within a three-year window is unlikely. A second Trump administration could take a more pragmatic stance toward Russia, prioritizing energy trade and negotiations over sanctions. However, geopolitical tensions—especially over Ukraine—could limit any potential rapprochement. If Western support declines, Ukraine could face increased vulnerability. However, continued EU and NATO backing may sustain its long-term defense. The war’s outcome will depend on Western resolve, Russia’s strategy, and potential diplomatic settlements. While unlikely under current treaties, the U.S. remains invested in securing global shipping routes. Increased Chinese influence in Latin America could prompt greater U.S. military and economic involvement in Panama, but direct control is improbable. U.S. & Europe: Strained over energy policies, trade disputes, and NATO commitments. China: Dominates REE supply chains, escalating U.S.–China trade tensions. Iran: Expanding energy ties with China and Russia amid sanctions. Russia: Redirecting oil and gas sales to non-Western markets. Resolution of these disputes will require new diplomatic alignments, resource diversification, and long-term trust-building. The world is undergoing a seismic energy and geopolitical transition, shaped by competition over resources, technology, and climate policies. Despite setbacks, clean energy remains on an upward trajectory, while fossil fuel politics remain deeply entrenched. The next decade will determine whether nations successfully navigate these shifts—or descend into further conflict and economic fragmentation.

Canada is one of the most resource-rich countries on Earth, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Arctic coasts. Its vast territory—home to forests, mountains, plains, and a lengthy coastline—has produced an abundance of natural resources, including energy (oil, natural gas, hydropower), minerals (gold, copper, nickel, potash), forest products, fisheries, and agricultural land. (1) Economic Growth: They generate revenue, support exports, create jobs, and stimulate investment. Regional Development: Resource-based industries are the economic backbone for many rural and remote communities. Trade: Canada is a major global exporter of energy, minerals, lumber, and agricultural commodities. (2) Oil Sands: Alberta’s oil sands represent the third-largest oil reserves in the world. Extraction primarily occurs around Fort McMurray (Athabasca oil sands), along with deposits at Peace River and Cold Lake. Conventional Oil: Found in parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and offshore fields near Newfoundland and Labrador. Natural Gas: Abundant in Western Canada (primarily Alberta and British Columbia). Key deposits are in the Montney and Duvernay Formations. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG): Coastal British Columbia is expected to become a critical hub for LNG exports. (3) Canada ranks among the world’s largest producers of hydroelectricity. Provinces like Québec, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Newfoundland & Labrador host significant hydro infrastructure. Prominent examples include the James Bay Project (Québec), the W. A. C. Bennett Dam (BC), and the Churchill Falls Generating Station (Labrador). (4) Wind Energy: Rapid expansion in Ontario, Québec, Alberta, and the Maritime provinces. Solar Energy: Growing in Ontario and Alberta but remains a relatively small share of total energy production. Present potential in specific regions but remains niche compared to hydro and wind. (6) Precious Metals: This includes gold (in Ontario, Québec, BC, Nunavut), silver (often a by-product of base metal mining), and platinum group metals (in Ontario and Québec). Base Metals: Significant deposits of copper (BC, Ontario, Québec), nickel (Sudbury Basin, Voisey’s Bay, Thompson), and zinc/lead (New Brunswick, Québec, Manitoba). Iron Ore: Large mines operate in the Labrador Trough near the Quebec–Labrador border. Potash: Saskatchewan is the world’s largest potash producer, essential for fertilizer. Diamonds: Discoveries in the Northwest Territories (Ekati, Diavik) and northern Ontario (Victor Mine) have placed Canada among the world’s leading diamond producers. Uranium: The Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan hosts some of the highest-grade uranium deposits globally. (7) Canada boasts approximately 9% of the world’s forests, featuring vast boreal forests stretching from Yukon to Newfoundland and Labrador, alongside coniferous and mixed forests in British Columbia, Ontario, and Québec. The forestry sector—which includes lumber, pulp and paper, and engineered wood products—employs many Canadians and supports significant exports. Most of Canada’s lumber is produced in British Columbia, Québec, and Ontario. (8) Boasting the world’s longest coastline along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans, Canada’s marine fisheries have traditionally been significant (e.g., Atlantic cod, until its collapse in the early 1990s). Today, major fisheries include lobster, snow crab, shrimp, salmon, and shellfish along both coasts. Freshwater fisheries contribute on a smaller scale, whereas aquaculture (salmon, mussels) is expanding in BC and the Maritimes. (9) Prairie Provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba): Known for extensive fields of wheat, canola, barley, and other grains. Saskatchewan leads in canola production. Fruit and Vegetable Production: Ontario’s Niagara region, BC’s Okanagan Valley, and select areas nationwide have thriving horticultural sectors. Livestock: Alberta is renowned for beef, while Québec and Ontario are strong in dairy; Manitoba is a key hog producer. (10) Exports: Energy (oil, gas), minerals (like gold, potash), and forestry products form pillars of the export economy, with the U.S. as Canada’s largest trade partner. Employment and GDP: These sectors employ hundreds of thousands of Canadians. Alberta’s economy leans heavily on oil and gas, while forestry is a mainstay in many rural BC and Québec communities. Regional Development: Resource wealth spurs infrastructure improvements, population growth, and broader economic development in remote locales, such as mining towns in Northern Ontario. (11) Oil Sands: Criticized for high greenhouse gas emissions. Both producers and government bodies have aimed to lower extraction’s carbon footprint, yet international concerns persist. Forestry Management: Canada’s sustainable forest policies support reforestation and best practices, although old-growth logging in BC remains contentious. (12) Many resource-rich regions overlap with lands historically used or claimed by Indigenous peoples. Modern treaties, impact-benefit agreements, and consultation frameworks strive to ensure that Indigenous communities have meaningful input on projects and share in potential benefits. (13) Large projects—oil pipelines, mines, hydro dams—undergo federal or provincial reviews. While provinces manage natural resources, federal rules apply to fisheries, navigable waters, GHGs, and interprovincial or international initiatives. (14) Pipeline proposals—such as Trans Mountain, Keystone XL, and Energy East—highlight tensions between economic benefits and environmental/climate responsibilities. (15) Canada is diversifying its energy mix (hydro, wind, solar) and reducing emissions with a national carbon tax and clean energy investments. Clean-tech innovation is crucial for long-term competitiveness in the global market. (16) Continued Global Demand: As global markets seek materials—particularly critical minerals (nickel, lithium, cobalt)—Canada can expand responsibly to meet EV and renewable energy demands. Sustainability: Heightened environmental awareness, climate goals, and Indigenous rights obligations mean stricter scrutiny of resource developments. Economic Diversification: Provinces reliant on hydrocarbons (e.g., Alberta) explore petrochemicals, renewables, and high-tech. Meanwhile, forestry and mining firms are investing in greener, value-added processes. Technology and Innovation: Automated systems, AI, and advanced exploration methods transform resource sectors. Carbon capture in the oil sands, sustainable forestry, and precision agriculture lead Canada’s resource evolution. Global Geopolitics: Demand for stable, responsibly sourced commodities may benefit Canada, known for political stability and strong regulations. However, competition and commodity price volatility remain ongoing challenges. (17) Canada’s vast oil, gas, mineral, forestry, and water assets power its economy and exports. Economic Significance: Energy and mining lead export revenues, while forestry and agriculture remain lifelines for rural areas. Environmental Balancing Act: Mitigating climate change, conserving habitats, and honoring Indigenous rights are central to managing these resources. Policy and Innovation: Stricter regulations, carbon pricing, and advancing tech (clean tech) guide the transformation of Canada’s resource sectors. Global Role: Rising global demand—particularly for critical minerals—positions Canada as a potential leader in the shift toward a low-carbon future. Canada’s natural resources have played a central role in shaping its history, economy, and national identity. From Alberta’s vast oil sands and northern mineral deposits to its abundant forests and rich fisheries, the country’s resources are a cornerstone of its development. However, Canada's main challenge is how to harness these resources sustainably in an increasingly uncertain global environment. Striking a balance between economic growth, environmental responsibility, and collaboration with Indigenous communities is crucial for the future of Canada’s resource-driven industries. In addition, Canada is a major producer and exporter of natural gas, with much of its exports traditionally focused on the U.S. market. However, with the growing interest and development of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports, Canada is now positioning itself to tap into broader global markets. The following section will explore Canada's natural gas exports in detail and delve into key industry considerations. (18) Canada is one of the world’s top natural gas producers. Most of its output originates in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB)—spanning Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan. Alberta remains the foremost producer, yet British Columbia’s share has surged thanks to shale developments such as the Montney. By 2023, BC generated about 6.7 Bcf/d of gas (36% of the country’s total). Saskatchewan’s volumes (~0.3–0.4 bcf/d) have declined, and offshore Atlantic production ended in 2018. Canadian marketable gas production reached approximately 17.9 Bcf/d in 2023, reflecting technological strides such as horizontal drilling and fracking. (19) The United States continues to be the prime market for Canadian natural gas. Historically, nearly all Canadian exports have flowed south through pipelines. In 2023, Canada exported about 3.1 Tcf of natural gas—100% of which was directed to the U.S. Canada remains the most significant external gas supplier to the United States, reflecting deep North American market integration. However, the U.S. “shale revolution” significantly increased American gas production, reducing demand for Canadian imports. Although Canadian shipments have decreased from their mid-2000s peak, and the U.S. now exports some gas northward, it still buys about half of Canada’s production, emphasizing the “one-customer story.” (20) Canada’s pipeline network is extensive. The Nova Gas Transmission Limited (NGTL) system in Alberta gathers gas for multiple corridors: Western Corridor (to the U.S. West Coast): Includes Foothills Pipeline to Kingsgate (BC–Idaho) and Westcoast (Enbridge BC) to Sumas (BC–Washington). Midcontinent/Midwest Corridor: Alliance Pipeline, Foothills system at Monchy (SK–Montana). Great Lakes/Northeast Corridor: TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline extends through SK and MB to ON, then crosses into U.S. markets at Emerson (MB–MN), Sarnia/Detroit, and Niagara/NY. (21) Although Canada is a major producer, it lacked large-scale LNG export capacity for years. While the U.S., Australia, and Qatar rapidly grew LNG exports, Canada has only now begun major LNG projects in British Columbia: LNG Canada (Kitimat, BC): A CAD $40-billion venture led by Shell. Phase 1 aims for ~14 Mtpa (~1.8 Bcf/d) starting exports by 2025, potentially doubling later. Woodfibre LNG (Squamish, BC): About 2.1 Mtpa (~0.3 Bcf/d), powered by hydro, targeting niche Asian markets. Cedar LNG (Kitimat, BC): Using hydropower, a floating LNG facility led by the Haisla First Nation, ~3 Mtpa (~0.4 Bcf/d). Other projects remain in planning, including East Coast LNG proposals (e.g., Goldboro in Nova Scotia, conversion of Canaport) that focus on Europe, though these remain uncertain. (22) Canada’s gas export trends have shifted over the past decade. After peaking near 10 Bcf/d in the early 2000s, exports fell to ~6–7 Bcf/d by the mid-2010s as U.S. domestic production surged. By 2021, Canada shipped about 2.8 Tcf (~80 Bcm), accounting for half of its total production, almost entirely to the U.S. This heavy reliance on one buyer makes Canada vulnerable to U.S. market changes. Economically, revenue from these exports has fluctuated with price cycles—historically high in the early 2000s, then lower through much of the 2010s, and rebounding during the 2021–2022 price spikes. Natural gas is vital to Canada’s energy GDP and trade balance. (23) Despite being a major producer, Canada’s global gas trade has been modest, as nearly all exports are directed to the U.S. With new LNG capacity, Canada could emerge as a top ten LNG exporter, selling to Asia or Europe. Advantages include shorter shipping routes to Northeast Asia than the U.S. Gulf Coast and abundant, stable reserves. Challenges involve competition from established exporters (U.S., Qatar, Australia, Russia) and the necessity for efficient, timely development. (24) Federal Regulation: The Canadian Energy Regulator oversees interprovincial pipelines and LNG export licensing. Provincial Responsibilities: Alberta and BC manage royalties, environmental standards, and upstream rules. Climate Commitments: Federal carbon pricing, methane reduction, sectoral emissions caps. Export Market Approach: While British Columbia and Alberta advocate for LNG expansions, the East Coast's approach to LNG has been met with scepticism. Overall, Canada aims to support gas development consistent with its climate policies. (25) Environmental and Climate Concerns: GHG footprint, habitat impacts, and protests from communities and Indigenous groups. Infrastructure Bottlenecks: High-cost pipelines and LNG megaprojects, remote conditions (e.g., Arctic), regulatory hurdles. Market Competition & Volatility: The global gas sector is competitive; prices can swing sharply, affecting profit margins for costly projects. Regulatory Delays: Complex federal/provincial reviews and possible legal disputes over jurisdiction. Indigenous & Community Opposition: Earning local support (social license) is essential; many oppose or demand stringent conditions for resource projects. (26) If these obstacles are handled effectively, Canada’s gas exports can: Growing LNG Capacity: Projects like LNG Canada, Woodfibre, Cedar tap into Asian markets. Maintain U.S. Pipeline Trade: The U.S. remains a core customer, though overshadowed by domestic shale. Boost Economic and Industrial Growth: Expand upstream production, foster Indigenous partnerships, adopt new technologies. Potential Transition to Hydrogen: Longer-term pivot to low-carbon gas/hydrogen could diversify exports further. (27) In short, Canada's natural gas export sector presents significant opportunities but faces substantial challenges. Transitioning from a pipeline-reliant domestic supplier to a globally recognized LNG exporter represents a challenging evolution in Canadian energy policy. While the U.S. market remains crucial, developing LNG infrastructure in British Columbia, and potentially on the East Coast, will facilitate access to Asian markets and beyond. The potential benefits include considerable revenue generation, job creation, and enhanced geopolitical influence. However, navigating this pathway necessitates addressing climate commitments, respecting Indigenous rights, adhering to stringent regulations, and competing internationally. With strategic planning and effective collaboration, Canada has the potential to become a leading global supplier of cleaner energy, aligning economic growth with climate-conscious policies. (28) Under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Canada recognised the People’s Republic of China in 1970—years before the U.S. This established a lasting framework for bilateral trade, investment, and cultural exchanges. However, episodes of tension have arisen over human rights issues and politicised arrests (e.g., the Meng Wanzhou case and the detention of the “Two Michaels”). (29) China stands as Canada’s second-largest trading partner. Canadian exports to China include natural resources (lumber, minerals, canola) and educational services; imports typically encompass consumer goods and electronics. In 2018–2019, China’s temporary ban on Canadian canola highlighted the risk of heavy reliance on one market. Canada additionally contends with China’s opaque regulatory practices and IP theft concerns. Ø Human Rights: Ongoing concerns about Xinjiang (Uyghurs), Hong Kong’s freedoms and civil liberties. Ø Espionage & Interference: CSIS repeatedly warns of Chinese attempts to influence Canadian institutions, elections, and controversial detentions (Meng Wanzhou, Two Michaels). Ø Arctic & Sovereignty: China’s declared status as a “near-Arctic state” alarms Canada about sovereignty threats in the far north. Ø Belt and Road Initiative (BRI): Canada remains outside the BRI, wary of China’s strategic and economic influence globally. (30) Canada, a close U.S. ally, generally aligns with Washington on key security policies (e.g., banning Huawei from 5G). Simultaneously, Ottawa seeks to maintain constructive relations with Beijing for trade purposes. Striking a balance between protecting Canada’s national security interests and taking advantage of China’s vast market remains an ongoing challenge. (31) Canada maintained diplomatic ties with the USSR from 1942, aligning with NATO against Soviet expansion after WWII. Despite political hostility, limited commerce (like wheat exports) persisted. Following the USSR’s collapse, Canada supported Russia’s market transition and welcomed it into the G8, collaborating on nuclear disarmament and Arctic initiatives. Relations deteriorated by the late 2000s. (32) Both countries assert overlapping claims in the Arctic, submitting extended continental shelf documentation. Although there was previously cooperation in the Arctic Council, Russia’s military buildup and Canada’s expansions in Arctic patrol capabilities signal wariness on both sides. (33) Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea spurred Canada to join allies in imposing sanctions and cooling trade and diplomatic contacts. Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine led Canada to escalate sanctions, prohibit Russian energy imports, and enable the seizure of sanctioned Russian assets to aid Ukraine’s reconstruction. (34) Under Operation REASSURANCE, Canada leads the NATO battlegroup in Latvia, contributing troops, fighter jets, and warships to bolster Eastern Europe’s defenses. Politically, Canada decries Putin’s aggression and closely coordinates with G7 partners to isolate Russia on the world stage. (35) Canada is home to over a million citizens of Ukrainian descent—making it one of the largest Ukrainian diasporas. It was one of the first countries to recognise Ukraine’s independence in 1991. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress wields influence to maintain strong political and humanitarian support for Ukraine. (36) POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC SOLIDARITY Canada consistently upholds Ukraine’s sovereignty. Prime Minister Trudeau has visited Kyiv several times to reaffirm Canada’s “unwavering support.” Canadian MPs have passed motions endorsing Ukraine’s democratic path and condemning Russian incursions. Operation UNIFIER: Since 2015, Canadian forces have trained over 33,000 Ukrainian personnel, helping modernize Ukraine’s military. Post-2022 Invasion: Canada has committed more than CA$ 4.5 billion in defence aid, including artillery, armour, air defence, training, and intelligence-sharing. The scale of this assistance surpasses what might be expected from a country of Canada’s size. (37) Canada has provided billions in loans and direct financial assistance to the Ukrainian government, and considerable humanitarian aid. By mid-2023, over 165,000 Ukrainians had sought refuge in Canada under the Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel (CUAET). (38) Ottawa plays an active role in broad sanctions against Russia and endorses Ukraine’s aspiration toward NATO and EU membership. Ukrainian leaders often praise Canada as one of their staunchest allies. (39) Donald Trump’s presidency offered contradictory signals on Ukraine—public sympathy toward Russia (e.g., “Crimea is Russian”) alongside the official continuance of sanctions. His freezing of Ukrainian military aid in 2019 (seeking political concessions) alarmed Canada, underscoring its potential vulnerability if U.S. policy shifted drastically. As of February 2025, President Donald Trump's administration's policy toward Ukraine has undergone significant shifts, marked by a departure from previous strategies and a move toward direct negotiations with Russia. (40) Ø Direct Negotiations with Russia: President Trump has initiated direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, aiming to negotiate an end to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. These discussions have notably excluded Ukraine and European allies, raising concerns about potential concessions to Russia and the implications for Ukraine's sovereignty. Ø Economic Partnership Proposal: The Trump administration has proposed an economic partnership with Ukraine, focusing on U.S. investment in key sectors such as natural resources and infrastructure. This initiative is designed to stimulate Ukraine's economic growth and ensure that generated revenue supports long-term reconstruction. The partnership emphasizes transparency and aims to align American and Ukrainian interests. Ø Criticism of Ukrainian Leadership: President Trump has openly denounced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, branding him a "dictator" and alleging that he misled the U.S. into funding an unwinnable war. This rhetoric has strained relations and raised concerns about future U.S. support for Ukraine. (41) Ø Reaffirmation of Support for Ukraine: Considering recent U.S. policy shifts, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has reiterated Canada's steadfast support for Ukraine. Trudeau highlighted that Ukraine's struggle is crucial not only for its sovereignty but also for global stability. Ø Diplomatic Engagements: Prime Minister Trudeau has discussed the conflict in Ukraine with President Trump, aiming to address concerns over the evolving U.S. stance and its potential impact on NATO unity and European security. (42) Canada fears a sudden U.S. retreat from Ukraine. In response, Canada might strengthen ties with European allies to preserve sanctions and military aid, possibly clashing with Washington if a new “peace” deal compels Ukraine to surrender territory. (43) Canada adheres to “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” It would oppose any imposed settlement that rewards Russian aggression, coordinating diplomatically with allies to shape potential negotiations and retain sanctions until Ukraine’s sovereignty is honored. (44) Canada’s natural gas export sector offers significant promise but faces considerable challenges. Transitioning from a pipeline-dependent continental supplier to a globally recognized LNG exporter marks a crucial turning point in Canadian energy policy. While the U.S. market remains crucial, developing LNG infrastructure in British Columbia (and potentially on the East Coast) will create new routes to Asia and beyond. Potential rewards are substantial: revenue, job creation, and enhanced geopolitical standing. However, the path ahead requires addressing climate obligations, Indigenous rights, strict regulations, and international competition. With strategic planning and prudent collaboration, Canada could emerge as a key global supplier of cleaner energy, harmonizing economic growth with climate-conscious policies. Canada’s relationships with China, Russia, and Ukraine highlight its middle-power balancing act: combining economic pragmatism with unwavering support for democratic principles. Relations with China have deteriorated due to concerns over human rights issues., alleged espionage, Arctic ambitions, and economic leverage. Relations with Russia collapsed after its 2014 action in Crimea and sank further when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, prompting Canadian sanctions and a strong NATO presence. Meanwhile, Canada’s partnership with Ukraine—rooted in historical diasporic links—has reached new heights via intense military and humanitarian aid. Canada must reconcile its strategic and economic needs with promoting human rights and global norms in all three relationships. During Donald Trump’s presidency, Canada remained steadfast in sanctioning Russia and supporting Ukraine, even as U.S. signals wavered. Another Trump administration could pose further challenges, possibly requiring Canada to bind closer to Europe if the U.S. scaled back its support for Ukraine. Still, Canada’s overall foreign policy trajectory remains constant: upholding the rules-based international system, sanctioning aggressors, and championing allied nations under threat. Belief in the sanctity of territorial sovereignty underpins Canada’s Ukraine stance and shapes its approach to Russia. Concurrently, Canada seeks practical economic ties with China yet stands ready to defend its core interests. Domestically, Canada’s resource-driven economy—and especially its natural gas sector—is evolving to tackle environmental concerns, Indigenous reconciliation, and global competition. Internationally, Canada’s firm stance on democracy and stability endures. The coming years will test how effectively Ottawa can maintain cohesion with its partners—including an unpredictable U.S.—while pursuing its own national aims in a rapidly transforming geopolitical setting.

Workart is fully part of Germán & Co. Iran has abundant natural resources, notably its vast oil and gas reserves. It holds the world’s second-largest natural gas reserves and fourth-largest proven oil reserves (1), making hydrocarbons a cornerstone of its economy. Other resources include significant mineral deposits (like copper and iron ore), agricultural land across various climates, and fisheries along the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf. These resources play a crucial role in Iran’s economy by generating export earnings and supporting industries, although international sanctions have constrained full utilization. Energy Resources: Oil and Natural Gas are Iran’s flagship resources. The country has an estimated 209 billion barrels of oil (about 12% of global reserves) and over 1,200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas (about 17% of global reserves) (2). It was OPEC’s 5th-largest oil producer in 2021 and the world’s 3rd-largest gas producer. (3) Most oil fields lie in the southwest (Khuzestan) and offshore in the Persian Gulf, while the giant South Pars gas field in the Gulf (shared with Qatar) drives gas output. Iran also has some hydropower dams and is exploring renewables (solar and wind) given its sunny deserts and windy plains, but fossil fuels dominate its energy mix. Minerals: Iran boasts 68 types of minerals with large reserves of copper, iron ore, zinc, lead, chromite, and others. (4) It is among the world’s top 10 in copper and zinc reserves and is a leading producer of steel and cement in the region. Major mining centres (e.g., Sarcheshmeh for copper) feed domestic and export industries. A recent notable find is a massive lithium deposit (~8.5 million tons) in Hamedan, which, if verified, would be the world’s second largest and could position Iran in the global battery supply chain. (5) Forestry: Iran’s forest cover is limited (around 6–7% of its land). The most significant forests in the north are the Caspian Hyrcanian forests, harbouring hardwood species. Elsewhere, forests in the Zagros Mountains and other areas are sparse due to arid climates. Timber production is modest and primarily for domestic use, with strict controls on logging to prevent desertification. Fisheries: Iran has a longstanding fishing industry, with coastlines on the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, and Caspian Sea. The Persian Gulf yields shrimp and fish, while the Caspian was once famed for sturgeon and caviar. Fisheries and aquaculture contribute to the food supply and employ coastal communities, though their share of GDP is relatively small. Agriculture: Iran’s varied climate supports a diverse agriculture sector on its arable lands (about 30% of land area). Key staples include wheat (strategically important for food security) and rice in the north. Iran is a leading global producer of specialty crops like pistachios, saffron, and dates. Other major products are fruits (pomegranates, citrus), nuts, cotton, and livestock (notably sheep and goats). Agriculture accounts for roughly 10–13% of GDP and over 15% of employment), (6) making it vital for rural livelihoods even as oil dominates exports. Natural resources underpin Iran’s economy, primarily through hydrocarbons. Oil and gas have traditionally provided a large share of government revenue and export earnings – in 2021, they still made up an estimated 45% of government budget revenues. (6) When sanctions allow, crude oil exports (historically 2–2.5 million barrels per day) bring in hard currency, primarily from Asian markets. The energy sector’s impact on GDP is significant (oil/gas ~25% of GDP in some years, though volatile), and it drives downstream industries like refining and petrochemicals. The mining sector is a growing contributor: Iran’s metals and minerals (iron, copper, steel, etc.) form a key part of “non-oil” exports, earning about $8.8 billion in 8 months of 2024. (7) Agriculture, while only ~10% of GDP, remains vital for employment and food self-sufficiency, and Iran exports high-value crops (pistachios, fruits) to earn foreign exchange. Resource industries also spur regional development – for example, oil operations have urbanized parts of Khuzestan, and mining has boosted cities in Kerman and Yazd. However, Iran’s over-reliance on oil makes the economy vulnerable to price swings and sanctions-induced export drops (8), leading to volatile growth and inflation. Iran faces a balancing act between resource extraction and environmental stewardship. Oil and gas operations contribute to greenhouse emissions, and Iran has one of the highest CO₂ output levels globally. The government has set modest climate targets under the Paris Agreement, but economic pressures often override emissions cuts. Domestic energy is heavily subsidised, leading to inefficient use and urban air pollution. Gas flaring (burning off excess gas) in oilfields is an ongoing issue, wasting resources and emitting pollutants, though there are efforts to curb it. Water scarcity is a critical environmental challenge – decades of damming and overuse for irrigation have led to drying wetlands and groundwater depletion. This issue came to a head with protests over water in farming regions. Regulatory oversight exists (e.g., an Environmental Protection Organization), but enforcement is uneven. High-profile incidents, like the 2019 oil pipeline leak in the south or industrial waste in rivers, have raised public concern. Iran is taking steps in renewables – installing wind farms and solar parks – as sustainable supplements to its energy mix, partly to free up more oil for export and reduce urban smog. On the social side, local and Indigenous community rights are increasingly part of the conversation. While Iran doesn’t use the term “Indigenous” in the same way as some other countries, there are ethnic communities (e.g. Arab minorities in oil-rich Khuzestan or Baluch farmers in the southeast) voicing grievances that resource projects haven’t benefited them proportionately. The government has tried directing more oil revenue to provincial budgets and offers compensation for land in mining areas, but tensions remain. Policy reforms like the “Resistance Economy” strategy encourage diversifying away from raw oil exports – for example, by investing in petrochemical plants (adding value to oil/gas) and expanding the mining value chain (more metal processing domestically). Sanctions have pushed Iran to pivot its trade: more oil is being processed into petrochemicals for export and bartered with neighbours and China for needed goods (9). Environmental impact assessments are required for big projects. Still, activists argue for more transparency and stricter protections, especially as Iran eyes new projects (like developing that significant lithium find) in ecologically sensitive areas. International trade of resources is both an opportunity and a challenge for Iran. Oil is the dominant export commodity. Iran can export >2 million barrels/day of crude oil when unconstrained, and it has historically sold to Asia (China, India, South Korea, Japan) and Europe. However, US and UN sanctions over the past decade sharply curtailed Iran’s access to markets; exports plunged after 2018, though China continues to import Iranian oil (often via intermediaries). (10) To circumvent restrictions, Iran has increasingly traded via barter deals with regional partners – for instance, swapping oil and gas with neighbours like Iraq or trading energy for goods from China and Turkey. Its natural gas exports are limited (despite huge reserves) due to sanctions and infrastructure bottlenecks – small volumes go by pipeline to Turkey and Iraq. Iran is a founding member of OPEC and the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), aiming to coordinate and bolster hydrocarbon prices. Iran’s strategic geography influences its energy transit. It sits on the Strait of Hormuz, a choke point through which ~20% of global oil passes – Tehran has sometimes threatened closure, unsettling markets. (11) Domestically, an extensive pipeline network distributes oil and gas, and Iran has built pipelines to export gas to Turkey and plans to Pakistan (though the latter is stalled). The lack of LNG terminals means Iran cannot quickly ship gas globally, which is a long-term gap it wants to fix. Beyond hydrocarbons, Iran exports minerals and metals, mainly to Asia. China is a major buyer of Iranian copper, iron and semi-finished steel. Trade partners: China has emerged as Iran’s top trade partner (for oil, petrochemicals, and minerals), followed by other Asian economies; the UAE and Turkey serve as re-export hubs for Iranian goods. Before sanctions, the EU was a significant oil and Persian carpets market, but that has diminished. Iran relies on China, Russia, and Turkey to import machinery, consumer goods, and grain. Infrastructure development continues despite challenges: Iran is expanding the Chabahar port (with Indian investment) to boost mineral exports from its east and improving rail links to move bulk goods to ports. The country’s inclusion in China’s Belt and Road Initiative may further integrate its trade routes. Pipelines also feature in regional geopolitics – Iran has proposed pipelines to deliver gas to India (undersea) or deeper into Iraq/Syria, though sanctions impede financing. In sum, Iran’s trade in natural resources is marked by adaptation to sanctions (greater self-reliance and regional barter) and the search for new markets, all while maintaining a strong OPEC voice in managing oil prices. Iran’s resource sector faces an uncertain but potentially transformative future. Sanction relief (or continuation) is the most significant swing factor: if a nuclear deal emerges and sanctions are lifted, Iran could rapidly ramp up oil production and attract foreign investment into ageing oilfields and massive untapped gas fields. (12) This would boost GDP and government revenue but also bring pressure to diversify to avoid the “resource curse.” Conversely, if sanctions persist, Iran will deepen ties with countries like China and Russia, continue smuggling oil at discounts, and lean on mining and agriculture for incremental growth. The country is also eyeing a pivot to new resources. The reported lithium discovery in 2023 is seen as a future “white gold” opportunity – Iran could become a player in lithium for batteries, provided it secures extraction technology and investment. (13) Similarly, “critical minerals” like rare earth elements (needed for electronics and renewable energy) present an untapped domain; Iran’s varied geology hints at potential deposits that strategic surveys may confirm. Domestic demand trends will shape the resource mix. Iran’s young population and industrialization efforts mean rising energy needs. Yet, the government aims to reduce domestic oil consumption (through subsidy reform and replacing oil-burning power plants with gas or renewables) to export more oil. The large natural gas reserves could be used for petrochemicals, electricity, and possibly LNG exports if technology and capital become available. In fact, Iran plans to dramatically increase gas output for both domestic use (to stop winter shortages) and future export infrastructure. On the environmental front, Iran is likely to feel increasing impacts of climate change – severe droughts (like the one that shrank Lake Urmia) threaten farming and hydropower, and extreme heat strains the power grid. This may force stronger water conservation policies, investment in climate-resilient agriculture, and a slow shift toward renewable energy sources. Iran has set a goal to install several gigawatts of solar and wind capacity; these projects may accelerate if costs drop and financing can be arranged, especially to electrify remote areas and free up more fossil fuel for export. Geopolitically, Iran’s resources will keep it in a position of leverage. Global demand for oil and gas is forecast to plateau or decline by mid-century as renewable energy rises. Still, in the medium term (this decade), markets remain thirsty – Iran’s ability to supply could moderate global prices, giving it bargaining power if sanctions negotiations recur. Its integration into new blocs (e.g. SCO, a potential BRICS member) could create alternative trade frameworks for its commodities, bypassing Western-centric channels. In summary, Iran’s rich natural resource base will remain the foundation of its economy. In the coming years, efforts will be made to modernize and expand capacity (significantly if sanctions ease), diversify within the sector (more value-added petrochemicals, mining products, and possibly lithium), and mitigate environmental strains. The challenge will be leveraging these resources for sustainable development rather than short-term gain, by investing in technology, engaging with global markets on better terms, and ensuring local communities’ benefit. This balance will determine Iran’s economic resilience in the future.

Mexico is a country of wide-ranging natural wealth, from hydrocarbons under the Gulf of Mexico to rich mineral belts and fertile agricultural lands. It has significant (though declining) oil and gas reserves, extensive metallic minerals (the world’s leading silver producer, along with gold, copper, and zinc mines), vast forests, productive fisheries in two oceans, and a robust agricultural sector. While Mexico’s economy has diversified toward manufacturing and services, natural resources still contribute substantially to exports, regional employment, and energy security. The nation’s geographic diversity – mountains, deserts, coastlines, and tropics – gives rise to a broad array of resources that have shaped its development and trade relationships. Energy Resources: Mexico has been a major oil producer for decades, with resources both onshore and offshore. The majority of oil is sourced from the Gulf of Mexico (specifically the Bay of Campeche fields, such as Ku-Maloob-Zaap and Cantarell), managed by state-owned Pemex. Oil reserves are approximately 17 Tcf proven (1), and Mexico imports a significant amount of gas (primarily via pipeline from the U.S.) to meet its demand. Coal is present (especially lignite and some bituminous in Coahuila), used mostly for domestic power generation, but Mexico is not a major coal exporter. In recent years, renewables have grown: hydropower dams (like Chicoasén) are longstanding, and wind farms in Oaxaca and solar plants in the north have expanded under clean energy goals. By 2023, about 23% of Mexico’s electricity came from “clean” sources (including hydro and nuclear) (2). A notable development is Mexico’s discovery of a sizable deepwater oil province in the Gulf and the nationalization of lithium in 2022, reflecting intent to tap emerging energy resources (the lithium deposits in Sonora could be strategic for batteries, with an estimated 1.7 million tons of lithium resources. Mineral Wealth: Mexico is exceptionally rich in minerals. It is the world’s largest producer of silver – traditional mining districts like Zacatecas and Chihuahua have yielded silver for centuries. The country also ranks in the top 10 globally for gold production and has significant output of copper, lead, zinc, and iron ore. Northern states (Sonora, Chihuahua) host large gold and copper mines, while central Mexico (Zacatecas, Durango) is famous for silver. Mexico also holds 90% of the world’s known borate (boron) reserves and is a top producer of fluorspar and celestite. Non-metallic minerals are important too: Mexico exports substantial cement, limestone, and marble. In total, the mining sector is diverse – in 2022, about half of the value of mining production came from precious metals, 40% from base (non-ferrous) metals, and the rest from industrial minerals. (3) Forestry: Around one-third of Mexico’s land is forested (4) ranging from coniferous forests in the Sierra Madre to tropical jungles in the Yucatán and Chiapas. The country’s forests provide timber, resin, and other products, with major logging of pine and oak in temperate areas. States like Durango and Chihuahua are known for commercial forestry, and Mexico produces wood pulp, paper, and furniture woods. However, deforestation (often for agriculture or pasture) has been a concern – Mexico loses tens of thousands of hectares of jungle each year. (5) The government and communities manage some forests sustainably (community forestry in Oaxaca is a success story). Forestry is a smaller contributor to GDP, but in rural economies it’s meaningful and forests underpin biodiversity and carbon sequestration efforts. Fisheries: With extensive coastlines on the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico/Caribbean, Mexico has rich marine fisheries. The Pacific coast, especially the Gulf of California, teems with commercial species – tuna, sardines, shrimp, and squid are among top catches. The state of Sinaloa leads in Pacific fisheries (shrimp farming is also significant). In the Gulf of Mexico, fisheries include shrimp, snapper, and grouper. Mexico’s fishing industry supplies both domestic markets and exports (for example, shrimp and tuna exports to the US and Asia). Aquaculture (fish and shellfish farming) is growing as wild stocks face pressure. While not a top-tier global fishing nation, Mexico is a leading fisheries producer in the Americas, and fishing is crucial for many coastal communities. Agriculture: Mexico’s varied climates support a wide array of agriculture. In the northwest (Sonora, Sinaloa), large-scale farms produce wheat, tomatoes, vegetables and irrigated crops for export (this “breadbasket” feeds winter produce to North America). The Bajío region grows corn, sorghum, strawberries, and other crops, while tropical states (Veracruz, Chiapas) cultivate sugarcane, coffee, and tropical fruits (mangoes, bananas). Mexico is the world’s #1 producer of avocados and limes, and a dominant exporter of berries, peppers, and tomatoes to the U.S. It also leads globally in beverage crops like blue agave (for tequila). Livestock farming is significant – northern ranches raise cattle (Mexico is a top beef exporter), and there’s substantial poultry and dairy in central Mexico. Agriculture (with forestry and fishing) contributes around 3.8% of Mexico’s GDP (6) but employs about 12–13% of the workforce It’s vital for rural incomes and a source of foreign exchange through exports of high-value produce. (7) Natural resources have a mixed but noteworthy role in Mexico’s economy. Historically, oil was a pillar – in the 1980s, oil revenues underwrote a large share of the national budget. Today, oil and gas still matter: the oil sector accounts for ~4–5% of GDP and about $110 billion in export revenue in 2021 (8), representing roughly 10% of total exports. This is lower than in past decades due to the growth of manufacturing exports and a drop in oil output, but petroleum remains Mexico’s largest single export commodity (crude and refined products). The state oil company Pemex is a major employer and contributor to public finances (though heavily indebted), and regions like Campeche and Tabasco rely on the oil industry. The mining sector, while smaller (non-oil mining ~1–2% of GDP), is significant in certain regions and for exports. Mexico’s mineral exports were about $17.6 billion in 2022 (9), led by silver, gold, copper, and zinc. Mining is a key employer in rural areas of Sonora, Zacatecas, Coahuila, etc., and draws considerable foreign investment (Canadian firms, for example, operate many mines). Resource extraction has spurred the development of infrastructure like roads and power in remote areas. Agriculture, at ~3–4% of GDP, punches above its weight in trade: Mexico is a net exporter of produce and beverages (sending billions of dollars of goods to the U.S. under NAFTA/USMCA). It also underpins food security and price stability, as maize (corn) is a staple of the Mexican diet and supporting farmers is socioeconomically important. However, many small farmers struggle with productivity and drought, prompting government support via subsidies and price guarantees. One major way natural resources influence Mexico’s economy is through export earnings and the trade balance. Oil exports have long been a top foreign currency earner, but as oil export volumes fell and the country became a net importer of gasoline, the benefit lessened. Meanwhile, manufactured goods (cars, electronics) surged to ~90% of exports, diluting the share of raw resources. Still, in 2023, high oil prices led to a windfall for Pemex and helped offset the cost of importing refined fuels. Similarly, high metals prices benefit Mexican mining companies and local economies. Natural gas imports (mostly from the U.S.) have cut electricity costs and enabled industrial growth, linking resource access to broader economic activity. At a regional level, resources drive development: for example, in the Gulf coast states, the oil industry provides high-paying jobs and infrastructure (ports, refineries), whereas in states like Michoacán and Jalisco, avocado farming has created rural wealth. Tourism in some areas even ties into natural bounty – e.g. Sportfishing on Baja’s coasts or eco-tourism in jungles – blending resource use with service sectors. The Mexican government also uses resource revenue as a tool for social programs; e.g. oil income has funded welfare initiatives. Thus, while not as dominant as in some countries, natural resources remain a strategic economic asset, contributing to exports, employment, and regional development in Mexico. Mexico faces the challenge of exploiting its resources while protecting the environment and communities. Oil and mining operations have environmental impacts – there have been notorious incidents like oil spills (the Ixtoc I well blowout in 1979, and more recently smaller leaks) and mining waste spills (e.g., a 2014 sulfuric acid spill from a copper mine in Sonora) that contaminated rivers. The government mandates environmental impact assessments for major projects, but enforcement has sometimes been weak, leading to conflicts with local populations. Climate policy: Mexico has committed under the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse emissions and in 2022 updated its pledge to cut GHG 35% by 2030 (unconditional). (10) It also aims for net-zero by 2050. In practice, there’s tension: Mexico is investing in renewable energy (one of Latin America’s largest solar parks opened in Chihuahua, and wind capacity has grown in Oaxaca and Tamaulipas), yet the current administration has also promoted fossil fuels. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) has emphasized energy sovereignty, supporting Pemex and the state electric utility (CFE) even if that means extending life for oil refineries and coal plants. This has slowed some private renewable projects. Still, laws like the Energy Transition Law set a target for 35% of electricity from clean sources by 2024. As of 2023, clean generation was around 23% (11), so efforts are ongoing (including new hydro renovations and a push for geothermal, where Mexico has potential). Deforestation and land use: Agricultural expansion and illegal logging have made Mexico one of the countries with significant deforestation. Policies (often in partnership with local ejidos/communities) try to incentivize reforestation and sustainable forestry. Mexico has several UNESCO biosphere reserves protecting forests (e.g., the Monarch Butterfly Reserve), and it participates in REDD+ programs to reduce emissions from deforestation. Water resources are also a concern: northern Mexico is arid, and water-intensive farming (and now mining like lithium extraction) raises sustainability issues. The government has enforced water use limits in some basins and negotiated with the U.S. on cross-border rivers as climate change brings more droughts. Community and indigenous rights: Mexico recognizes indigenous peoples’ rights to consultation (ILO Convention 169) for projects on their lands. In practice, conflicts have arisen – for example, indigenous Yaqui communities in Sonora protested over water diversion for mining, and Maya communities in Yucatán have raised concerns about a planned large-scale solar farm and the Tren Maya project affecting the environment. Mining projects in states like Guerrero and Chiapas have sometimes led to social conflict and even violence, prompting calls for stronger safeguards and benefit-sharing with locals. On the other hand, some communities do welcome projects that bring jobs. The balance is evolving: recently, a Mexican court suspended a mining project in Puebla due to lack of adequate indigenous consultation, indicating the growing legal weight of community voices. Regulatory landscape: In 2013–2014, Mexico enacted a major Energy Reform that opened the oil, gas, and power sectors to private and foreign investment after decades of state monopoly. (12) This led to new oil blocks auctioned to companies like Shell and BP and contracts for private renewable energy generators. However, since 2018, policy has shifted – AMLO’s government halted new oil bid rounds and passed reforms favoring CFE in electricity dispatch. A 2023 reform of the Mining Law reduced concession terms and put stricter environmental rules, (13) aiming to prevent speculation and require water sustainability in mining. While intended to protect resources and communities, some investors see it as increasing uncertainty. The government also nationalized lithium by law, creating a state company for lithium (LitioMx) and limiting private extraction of this strategic resource. Environmentalists have welcomed measures like these and the cancellation of a mega airport partly to protect a lake, but critics worry about transparency and efficiency of state-led projects. In summary, Mexico’s policies seek to ensure resources benefit the nation (resource nationalism is strong) while gradually improving environmental oversight. Implementation is key – from reducing gas flaring and refinery emissions to enforcing mine remediation and boosting renewables integration. Public awareness of environmental issues is rising, as seen in protests against pollution and the demand for climate action from youth movements. Mexico’s challenge will be to strengthen its regulatory institutions so that economic development from natural resources does not come at the cost of irreparable environmental damage or community marginalization. Mexico’s natural resources figure prominently in its trade profile, though overshadowed in value by manufactured exports. Oil exports traditionally went almost entirely to the United States; even today the U.S. Gulf Coast is the main buyer of Mexican crude (Maya blend heavy crude). However, with the U.S. itself producing more oil, Mexico has diversified slightly – exporting some crude to Europe and Asia when opportunities arise. Paradoxically, Mexico imports a large volume of refined fuel from the U.S., especially gasoline, because its own refineries can’t meet domestic demand. This energy trade across the border is facilitated by a dense network of pipelines (for oil products and natural gas) and maritime tankers. Recent infrastructure moves include building a new refinery (Dos Bocas) and upgrading others to reduce fuel imports and process more of its own crude. Meanwhile, pipelines like Los Ramones and cross-border connectors have made the U.S. the source of ~70% of Mexico’s natural gas supply in 2022, (14) linking the two countries’ energy markets closely. In mining, Mexico is a major player in global supply chains: it exports raw and refined silver to markets like India and electronics industries worldwide; gold primarily to refineries in the U.S. and Switzerland; and copper concentrates to smelters (some domestically and in Asia). Trade agreements (USMCA, and various FTAs with Europe and Asia) generally allow minerals to flow with low tariffs. The U.S. relies on Mexico for certain minerals – for instance, fluorspar (for chemical industries) and graphite are imported from Mexico to the U.S. (15) Conversely, Mexico imports some mineral inputs it lacks (like potash fertilizer, or steel coal). Supply chain integration is evident in sectors like automotive: Mexican mines provide metals, which go into parts manufactured domestically, which are then exported as cars. Agricultural trade is heavily intertwined with NAFTA/USMCA partners. Mexico exports billions of dollars of produce (vegetables, fruits) and beer to the U.S., and imports large quantities of yellow corn, soybeans, and grains from U.S. farmers for its livestock sector. This exchange has made Mexico one of the top export markets for U.S. agriculture and vice versa. Additionally, Mexico exports specialty crops globally – for example, it’s a top exporter of sugar and coffee to the EU and of avocados to Europe and Asia. Trade infrastructure like cold storage at border crossings and the port of Veracruz (for tropical crop exports) supports this flow. The 2020 USMCA maintained zero tariffs on ag trade but introduced sanitary standards that Mexico works to comply with to keep access. A current issue is Mexico’s ban on genetically modified corn for human consumption, which may affect imports from the U.S. and is being negotiated. Fisheries exports include shrimp (to U.S., Europe) and tuna (often processed domestically then exported). Coastal states benefit from trade via seaports like Mazatlán and Veracruz, which handle seafood shipments. Energy infrastructure is positioning Mexico as a potential transit hub as well. The government has floated plans for LNG export terminals on the Pacific (to ship U.S. gas to Asia via Mexico) and a gas pipeline connecting to markets in Central America. Mexico already hosts the end of the Pan-American oil pipeline system (the Tapline) and the massive Cactus-Reynosa gas pipeline that feeds into Texas. Ceyhan – sorry, (Ceyhan is Turkey; here, Coatzacoalcos and Salina Cruz) – The country even has an isthmus rail/pipe corridor project (Trans-Isthmus) to move oil and goods between the Gulf and Pacific, leveraging its geography for global trade. Major trade partners: The United States is overwhelmingly number one, given proximity and NAFTA – it receives ~80% of Mexico’s total exports. For resources, the U.S. buys most of Mexico’s oil (historically) and mining output, and supplies most of Mexico’s natural gas and gasoline. Canada also imports Mexican minerals (and Canadian firms invest in Mexican mines). Other significant partners include China (Mexico sells some oil and minerals to China; China sells Mexico machinery and increasingly invests in sectors like lithium), and Europe (which imports some Mexican oil, tequila, and produce, and in turn is a source of investment and technology). Within Latin America, Mexico exports refined fuels to Central America and imports some agricultural commodities from South America. Trade dynamics are also shaped by policy shifts: the 2013 Energy Reform allowed private companies to export oil and gas for the first time in decades (before, only Pemex could). Some foreign oil companies that won exploration blocks may eventually export oil if they produce successfully. However, the current government’s nationalist stance means Pemex regained a dominant role in exports. Similarly, mining export growth might slow if regulatory burdens rise, though high commodity prices will encourage continued output. In summary, Mexico’s natural resource trade is characterized by deep integration with North America, a mix of imports and exports in energy (export crude, import fuels/gas), strong agricultural export performance, and an attractive mining sector for global markets. Infrastructure – from pipelines and ports to highways – is continually being developed or upgraded to streamline this trade, while policy aims to maximize the value Mexico gains (for instance, via refining oil domestically rather than exporting crude, or requiring local purchases in mining). Mexico’s natural resource sectors are poised for both opportunities and challenges ahead. Oil and gas production is at a crossroads: legacy oil fields are depleting, yet Mexico has untapped potential in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the recently discovered Ixachi onshore gas field and Sakakemang (if developed). The government’s strategy is to bolster Pemex with investment to slightly increase oil output (targeting ~2 million barrels per day) while using new refinery capacity to end gasoline imports. In the next 5–10 years, we may see Pemex partnering with more private firms (out of necessity for capital and tech) despite the current political hesitance – especially if oil prices are high and there’s urgency to replace declining fields. The Sakarya-like gas find in the Gulf of Mexico is not yet in hand for Mexico, but exploration continues and any major discovery would be a game-changer. Also, by 2025 the large Deer Park refinery (jointly owned with Shell in Texas) and the new Dos Bocas refinery are expected to be fully operational, potentially making Mexico a net exporter of some refined fuels. Conversely, global trends toward decarbonization put a question mark on long-term oil demand. Mexico’s heavy reliance on oil revenue could be further alleviated by its growing manufacturing base, but regions dependent on oil (Tabasco, Campeche) will need economic diversification as the world transitions to electric vehicles and renewable energy. Mexico is well positioned to benefit from the EV supply chain shift: it has announced plans for EV battery factories and lithium processing in Sonora (leveraging the lithium deposit). By investing in downstream industries for lithium (battery production) and copper (for wiring and components), Mexico could turn its resources into industrial growth. The creation of a state lithium company suggests government intent to control this “resource of the future,” but successful exploitation will require partnerships for technology. Renewable energy outlook is bright in Mexico: it has some of the world’s highest solar irradiance in Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts and excellent wind corridors (Oaxaca’s Tehuantepec Isthmus is world-class). If policy shifts to encourage more private investment (which may happen under a different administration post-2024), there could be a renewable boom. Already, meeting the 40% by 2030 renewables target (16) will drive installation of new wind/solar farms and grid upgrades. This creates a new “natural resource” opportunity – abundant clean energy – which Mexico could even export (there are proposals to send solar power via HVDC lines into the U.S. or wind power to Baja’s grid). Mining future: Mexico will likely remain a top metals producer. The global push for critical minerals (e.g., copper for electrification, lithium for batteries) means Mexican mines and unexplored areas will be in focus. The government’s tighter mining laws might slow new permits, but also encourage maximizing existing sites. Expect more exploration in underexplored regions (lithium in clay deposits in Sonora beyond the main find, rare earth elements in Baja California’s deposits, and continued gold/silver finds e.g. in Oaxaca’s emerging mines). Environmental and community scrutiny of mining will increase, prompting companies to adopt better practices and benefit-sharing to secure social license. Agriculture and climate: Mexico’s agricultural future must contend with climate change – higher temperatures and water stress, especially in the north, could reduce yields of water-intensive crops. This is pushing innovation in water-saving irrigation, drought-resistant seed varieties, and shifting crop patterns. Mexico might expand greenhouse farming (already used for tomatoes/peppers) to adapt to climate extremes. The country is also well placed to grow crops for biofuels (like agave for bioethanol or jatropha for biodiesel) if policies favor them, potentially creating new resource markets. Agricultural exports will remain strong if Mexico continues to capitalize on off-season production for Northern markets, though it must manage soil health and competition for land (urbanization is eating into farmland around booming cities). On the environmental front, Mexico is likely to take a more active role. Popular sentiment and international pressure could result in stronger enforcement of environmental laws. We may see higher penalties for oil spills, a phase-out of fuel oil burning in power plants (benefiting air quality), and possibly the closure of older coal plants as gas and renewables fill the gap. The country’s vast biodiversity (one of the world’s megadiverse nations) might spur growth in eco-tourism and conservation jobs, integrating natural resource preservation with economic benefits. Geopolitically, Mexico’s resource sector could benefit from “near-shoring” and shifting supply chains. For instance, as the U.S. and allies seek to rely less on Chinese minerals, Mexico could be a preferred source given the trade agreement and proximity – we might see investments in Mexican mining of graphite, lithium, rare earths, etc., with processing facilities built in North America (including Mexico). Energy security concerns in the region mean Mexico’s role as a gas transit route (moving U.S. gas south or potentially Venezuelan gas if that market opens) might grow. Mexico has even discussed building a gas pipeline to the Yucatán and on to Central America, exporting its excess U.S.-sourced gas further – such projects could materialize in the 2030s, making Mexico a regional energy hub. In short, Mexico’s natural resource future will involve modernizing traditional sectors (making oil, mining, and agriculture more efficient and sustainable) and embracing new opportunities (renewables, lithium, and possibly hydrogen production from abundant solar). Policy stability and investment in technology and infrastructure will be key to harnessing these resources for inclusive growth. If managed well, Mexico can continue to reduce its historical over-reliance on oil while ensuring its rich array of natural resources contributes to long-term prosperity and environmental resilience.

Title: Sticky Inflation Means Gold Will Keep Rising

By Byron King PostedFebruary 25, 2025 How much gold do you own? The correct answer is: “Not enough.” Don’t you wish you had some of these? This is a $20 gold coin from 1914, the first year of the Federal Reserve. And back then, just over 110 years ago, gold was $20 per ounce. U.S. $20 gold coin, St. Gaudens, minted 1914. Courtesy U.S. Treasury Dept. Today’s gold price is over $2,900, which means that the purchasing power of a dollar over the past century-plus has shrunk by a factor of 145x. In other words, a single dollar back in 1914 is the equivalent of $145 today. This is why people and institutions (certainly central banks) are buying gold. And it’s why gold deserves a place in every portfolio. Let’s dig into what’s happening with gold, what it means, and how to deal with it. On Jan. 20, 2025, when Donald Trump was inaugurated, an ounce of gold was quoted at $2,740. Now, a month into Trump’s second term, that same metal will set you back over $2,900, a rise of not quite 7% in just a few weeks. But don’t blame the rising gold price on Trump. Hey, after only a month in the Oval Office, this is not (yet) Trump’s economy. Many Biden administration legacies still cast shade, along with a long, deep history of federal-level misallocation of the nation’s economic power, if not the country’s money. Although yes, for sure, Trump or not, the price movement of gold foretells continuous inflation, so be prepared. The underlying problem is that inflation is embedded in the monetary system. It’s structural, or call it “sticky” inflation, to use an economic term made famous by no less than the Fed itself. And by many indicators, inflation is not going away any time soon. Looking back over just the past few years, inflation and gold prices have been rising. Here’s a chart to illustrate: Gold Price, past five years. Courtesy JM Bullion. As you can see, the price of gold began its recent, upward breakout in mid-2023 during the Biden administration. And gold has been on an uptrend ever since. So, by the beginning of this year the price of gold was already headed north. And we can only imagine how much higher the price of gold might be right now if Trump had not won the November election. Meanwhile, recall the inflation of the Biden era, aka “Bidenflation.” In truth, it was stagflation, meaning the mix of a stagnant economy and elevated inflation. Here’s a chart of those “sticky,” monthly price index moves over the past four years to remind you of what happened, courtesy of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. Sticky price levels, five-year chart. Courtesy FRED. From 2021 onward, price levels went up consistently. Now, we’re living with all that cumulative inflation, a long-term hit to your purchasing power that exceeds 20% over the past four years. Stated another way, if you feel poorer, the chart above illustrates how your dollars don’t go as far at the grocery store. For the past four years, inflation shrank the value of what’s in your wallet and bank account. What’s worse is that official statistics tend to understate the reality of inflation. Government number adder-uppers often fudge towards the low end. Still, whatever numbers you follow, it’s clear that we’ve had inflation in the 3%–5% range for a while, and it feels like it when you buy a pound of bacon, or new tires, or get a quote to fix the roof. The U.S. economy finished 2024 with an official rate of inflation about 3.5%. Yet the Fed’s target goal for inflation has long been 2%, so it’s clearly not under control. There’s inflation momentum out there, with more hits yet to come. Again, keep in mind that all these inflation numbers are before Trump has submitted his first budget proposal. In fact, the federal government is running on last year’s continuing resolution to spend-spend-spend. Trump has nothing to do with it, although he and his new bestie Elon Musk are scouring the budget for items to cut and people to lay off. Trump doesn’t get a complete pass, however. Look back to the blowout federal spending in 2020 under Trump 1.0, during the first year of the pandemic. The President took some very bad advice, to be sure; but he was still the captain of the ship and went so far as to insist that U.S. Treasury checks bear his signature. So, Trump owns a chunk of past spending and current debt. But then in 2021, along came the Biden administration which opened the Treasury spigots even wider, and a flood of dollars spilled into a contracted economy. And that was the monetary kill-shot, some might say. Consider how, by 2021, unemployment was widespread and productivity was down. Likely, you recall shortages at every stage of supply chains, problems with just about everything. Remember the empty store shelves? How about the lack of toilet paper? The list is endless. Foolishly, Biden injected about two trillion dollars of vaporware Fed-bucks into this very contracted economy, which truly lit the flame of inflation. There was too much money chasing too few goods and services. Now, we have President Trump and his tenacious assistant Elon Musk, busily draining the federal swamp, ripping like a tornado through the massive federal bureaucracy in Washington. And hey, they’re getting things done! Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Courtesy Truth Social. Team Trump is on a roll, cutting budgets and closing down entire departments. This is exactly what Trump campaigned on, and he’s off to a fast start. However, the bulk of government spending is on relatively fixed expenses like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Yes, waste can be cut from these programs but there’s only so much which can realistically be cut. But let’s get back to gold, the price of which is controlled by events far beyond the powers of even the Mighty POTUS. The price of gold is set by supply and demand. As for availability, the supply of physical gold is metal above ground plus whatever new metal gets mined each year. Rising gold prices reflect the growth of money supply, an economic term for the amount of currency issued by central banks. The gold price mirrors inflation caused by central banks. Thus, it’s clear why wealthy people and deep-pocketed institutions, especially central banks, have been buying gold. They want to preserve wealth. Thus, demand is rising. Which brings us to the point that, for the past three years, many central banks have bought gold. No, the U.S. Fed wasn’t buying, sad to say. That hidebound institution disdains monetary gold. But over the past years, other central banks bought gold big time and are still in the market. For example, the central banks of Russia, China, India, Turkey, Indonesia, the Philippines and many more. In the words of the World Gold Council in 2024, “central banks continued to vacuum up gold at an eye-watering pace.” Kitco News explains that “central banks look to diversify away from the U.S. dollar.” Bones of contention with the dollar include a lack of confidence in the Fed’s interest rate manipulations, continuing inflation, and overall geopolitical instability. More and more, central banks are accumulating gold as a long-term store of value and inflation hedge. Gold is an effective portfolio diversifier with no default risk to physical holdings. Now, let’s get closer to home, meaning our portfolios. I believe it’s important to own gold in different forms: physical metal, ETFs, royalty companies, and gold miners. Physical speaks for itself. Store where you can find a safe site. This should be a multi-decade program for building generational wealth. You simply buy and hold and only spend when it’s truly necessary. Gold miners are also an attractive way to get exposure. And right now, I believe they’re cheap compared to bullion. You see, central banks are the primary buyers in today’s gold market, and they only buy bullion, not miners. There’s a big opportunity here we’ll be exploring further in the coming weeks. The entire precious metals sector is dramatically under-owned by investors today. Gold and silver investments account for less than 1% of global assets. The thinking appears to be, why buy a gold miner when you can buy soaring tech stocks? There is far too much money chasing overbought sectors like tech. If just a small amount of frothy market cap rotates into precious metal and mining shares, we’ll see massive upswings. The average investor has almost zero exposure to gold and silver, and that means prices have abundant upside potential. So no, it’s not too late to get into the gold space. Not even close.
