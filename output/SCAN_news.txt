Title: The Next Big Energy Boom: How the Green Scam Collapse Is Driving a Historic Bull Market

Editor Economy International Man, Nick Giambruno “It was the single most important financial event of my career.” My friend and resource investing legend Rick Rule once shared this with me, reflecting on his experience in the uranium market during the last bull cycle—where extreme supply and demand imbalances triggered massive booms and busts. Rick was referring to Paladin Energy, a uranium stock that skyrocketed during uranium’s last bull market from less than one cent ($0.007) Australian dollar (AUD) per share at its bottom in April 2003 to AUD $9.57 at its peak in April 2007. It was a peak gain of over 130,000%—a greater than 1,000-fold increase. In other words, a $1,000 investment could have exploded into more than $1 million—had someone picked the bottom and top perfectly. Of course, that is not realistic, but as we can see in the chart below, even being within a year of the absolute bottom and top would have been enough to generate some phenomenal returns. Other uranium stocks also multiplied their share prices during the last bull market. However, Paladin was a rare and unique example. It was the best-performing company in the industry during the previous cycle. However, as stunning as Paladin’s performance was, it’s important to remember that past performance does not indicate future results—for any investment. I suspect it won’t be long before Western governments turn to nuclear energy in a big way. There are indications they are already doing that. In short, the Green Scam delusion is an enormous market distortion—a blessing in disguise. Distortions in the market allow shrewd speculators to get positioned for big potential profits as they collide with reality. It’s making uranium’s already attractive supply/demand situation even more appealing. Uranium mining stocks stand to be a primary beneficiary of this trend. In short, it is difficult for producers to ramp up production while uranium demand is rising. It often takes years for them to catch up. As a result, price is the only way for the market to resolve itself. That’s why the uranium price can have extraordinary spikes. However, the uranium market often doesn’t just settle into equilibrium during these periods. The uranium price often overshoots where it needs to go to balance the market, creating an enormous bull market. It’s a cycle that has played out three times before, and I think it will occur again soon. Looking at the Big Picture for uranium, I see a precarious supply situation, a long lead time to develop new mines (roughly ten years), dwindling inventories, and an unstable geopolitical situation in which countries are scrambling to secure their energy supplies. Yet, at the same time, there is growing (inflexible) demand for new nuclear power plants. With supply shrinking and demand rising, I think the stage is set for uranium prices to overshoot to the upside, just as we saw in the previous three bull market cycles with similar dynamics. The energy markets aren’t the only place where massive disruptions are unfolding. A dangerous combination of sky-high debt, relentless money printing, and deep cultural and political shifts is creating unprecedented economic instability. We are entering an era of volatility unlike anything we’ve seen in modern history—and those who fail to prepare could see their wealth and freedom evaporate.

Title: Travel Back in Time to 2009… and Buy Tech

Time Published: 2025-02-20T23:00:14Z

By Adam Sharp PostedFebruary 20, 2025 In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2009, I was obsessed with the risk of a “double-dip” recession. The outlook was bleak. The banks all seemed to be failing, stocks had crashed, housing was belly-up, and the Fed was printing money like mad. So instead of gobbling up cheap tech shares, I was primarily focused on hoarding my (meager) stash of precious metals and preparing for an armageddon which never came. The gold and silver investments worked out fine, and I’m extremely bullish on gold and silver going forward. But let’s be honest. I would have been better off if I had diversified and bought fast-growing U.S. tech companies at huge discounts. For example, in January of 2009 Amazon (AMZN) shares traded as low as $2.38 (split-adjusted). Today it trades at $222, nearly 100x higher. That opportunity has passed. But what if there was a similar setup to the Nasdaq in 2009 available today? I think I’ve found it. But be forewarned, some of you are going to hate it. I’ve been reluctant to write about it for a while now, but simply can’t hold it in any longer. It’s… Chinese tech. Over the past few years, China’s massive real estate bubble has popped. Our own Jim Rickards nailed this event, writing in July of 2021 that China was a Fragile Giant. China also confronts an insolvent banking system and a real estate bubble. Up to half of China’s investment is a complete waste. It does produce jobs and utilize inputs like cement, steel, copper and glass. But the finished product, whether a city, train station or sports arena, is often a white elephant that will remain unused. The Chinese landscape is littered with “ghost cities” that have resulted from China’s wasted investment and flawed development model. It was an incredible call by Jim. In the years following that article, the KraneShares China Internet ETF (KWEB) crashed 80% from its all-time high. KWEB is China’s equivalent to the Nasdaq 100. So this was China’s version of America’s 2008 bubble crash, on steroids. Fast forward to today, however, and I believe the bottom is finally in for Chinese tech firms. KWEB still trades about 66% below its all-time high. Here’s a 5 year KWEB chart: As you can see, China’s tech sector is still far below all-time highs. If this is the beginning of a new bull market, it’s still quite early. Importantly, today DeepSeek has changed the narrative around Chinese technology. Whether we like it or not, they’re making major progress in areas such as AI, nuclear, fusion, electric vehicles, phones, satellites, semiconductors, and even planes. There are certainly problems in China, such as overcapacity and ruthless competition eroding profit margins. And needless to say, the communist government structure isn’t ideal for tech firms. Nevertheless, China’s tech sector is cheap, hated, and in an uptrend. That is typically a recipe for gains. This morning Alibaba (BABA) beat earnings and jumped more than 10% in early trading. As I write this it’s still up around 7% at midday. Alibaba is the “Amazon of China”. It’s the country’s largest online retailer, and the largest cloud computing provider (just like Amazon). You could also call the company the “Paypal of China”, due to its 33% stake in Ant Group, which owns the all-encompassing Alipay payment app (think Paypal meets Visa). Alibaba is also one of the top 3 AI companies in China, and its leading AI model, Qwen Max 2.5, is competitive with ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Google’s top models. Alibaba has soared 80% over the past year. But it has huge amounts of room to run to get back to all-time highs. Here’s a 5-year chart of BABA: So… why did Alibaba shares crash, anyways? The first factor was the real estate bubble popping, which we covered above. But there’s more to the story. Back in 2021 and 2022, Alibaba was dominating in China a little too much. President Xi and the CCP didn’t like that. Alibaba’s subsidiary Ant Group was making big moves in the financial space, threatening to cut in on state-owned banks and other financial businesses. So the Chinese government laid the smack down on Alibaba, issuing huge fines and cancelling the IPO of Ant Group (Alipay). This is a real risk of investing in China. The government has too much power over business matters. But I think that risk has mostly passed. Today Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma have paid their fines, and their dues. A meeting with President Xi this week sealed the deal. Jack Ma and BABA are suddenly back in polite society. President Xi and the government have signaled support for the private sector, and are stimulating the economy with QE and cheap loans (as we did in 2009). To be clear, I don’t think Alibaba will deliver 100x returns from here. It’s already too large for those types of gains. But I think it still has a very nice run ahead of it. The Ant Group (Alipay) IPO could happen in the near future, which would be a major catalyst for the stock. In full transparency, over the past 7 months I’ve been buying Alibaba (BABA), Xiaomi (XIACY), and BYD (BYDDY). These are some of China’s hottest tech firms. I also recently added a China small-cap ETF (ECNS) and PGJ (China internet ETF). I plan to hold these positions for at least five years, if not longer. This week President Trump posted the following message on his Truth Social platform. Source: Truth Social Some of you may be surprised by President Trump’s friendly tone here. I am not. We need to make a trade deal with China, and soon, as we discussed last month. It’s in both countries’ interests. If a trade deal with China does go through, that should throw gas on the fire beneath Chinese tech stocks. Uncertainty around trade wars and tariffs has been a major factor holding back the sector. Overall I strongly believe the global trade wars are just beginning, but we may see some progress soon on the China front. To conclude, I believe the setup in Chinese tech today is quite similar to the Nasdaq in 2009. I may be wrong, but am willing to take that chance given the potential upside. It’s not very often we get a chance to buy fast-growing tech at a 66% discount. I’m not going to miss the opportunity this time, even if it means investing in a communist country. If some of you can’t stomach that, however, I completely understand. It’s not the hand I would’ve chosen, but it is the one we’ve been dealt. I believe China’s tech sector is in for a lucrative bull market ahead. Phew, it feels good to have that off my chest. Disclosure: Of the companies and funds mentioned in this article, the author owns Alibaba, Xiaomi, BYD, PGJ, and ECNS.

Title: New Crypto to 10X as Saylor’s Strategy Plans to Add $42B to Its $BTC Stash

Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is now one step closer to adding another $42B worth of Bitcoin ($BTC) to its balance sheet by 2027. Most importantly, all of the raised funds will go toward $BTC purchases. Strategy’s $BTC bet is paying off, as evident from its stock performance, so more institutional investors may add crypto to their portfolios soon–and not just $BTC. We share the best new crypto to benefit from the upcoming bull run. Strategy currently holds $45.88B worth of $BTC. On February 10, the company bought 7.6K $BTC for $742.4M at roughly $97K per coin. This brought Strategy’s BTC Yield, a KPI that measures the change in $BTC-to-diluted-share ratio over time, to 4.1%, up 1.2% from January 27. In an official statement, Strategy explained its new convertible notes will not accrue interest, so their principal amount is fixed. Investors, too, retain the option to recall their notes at face value from March 1, 2028, or if the company undergoes a fundamental corporate transformation. MSTR price barely reacted to the news–in fact, it dipped 1.1% since yesterday. However, MSTR’s yearly growth of 373% proves Saylor’s strategy is working. Growing institutional demand for $BTC is the main factor that drives a broader crypto rally this year. However, not all established altcoins and new crypto on presale will feel the effects equally. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the best meme coins that could explode when $BTC hits a new all-time high (ATH). When $BTC reaches the $150K and $200K price targets, BTC Bull Token will reward its community with $BTC airdrops. All you need to get free $BTC is to hold $BTCBULL in the Best Wallet app. Another massive airdrop, this time, of $BTCBULL tokens, will happen when $BTC hits $250K. The presale raised $2.3M in just a week, showing strong momentum. One $BTCCBULL now costs $0.00237, but the price is growing fast as more investors join the movement. Solana is now the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystem–the cumulative market cap of its tokens surged 9X in 2024. Unfortunately, the network struggles to handle the influx of new apps and users. This leads to congestion and, sometimes, failed transactions. Solaxy ($SOLX) introduces a Layer-2 solution that speeds up processing, lowers fees, and prevents network outages by offloading part of transactions from Solana mainnet to its side chain. It relies on the tried and tested Ethereum’s rollup architecture and thus is reliable for high-throughput applications like AI agent tokens and DeFi protocols. Solaxy’s native token, $SOLX, now costs $0.00164 on presale. Early adopters invested $22.2M into the project so far, and the next price uptick will happen when the project crosses the $22.8M milestone. After the $SOLX token launches on exchanges, it could reach $0.032. The much-anticipated deployment of Solaxy’s Layer-2 chain should support this momentum and help $SOLX hit $0.2 by the end of 2026. It might be time for Dogecoin ($SOGE) to retire, as another dog now dominates the meme coin sector–Broccoli. Broccoli is the dog of Binance’s founder Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ. Zhao received the dog as a gift from his Dubai-based friend and has since bonded strongly with the Belgian Malinois pup. CZ didn’t launch any tokens himself but promised he’d support top Broccoli-themed tokens on BNB Chain with extra liquidity. This triggered an influx of Broccoli coins to the market. FirstBroccoli ($BROCCOLI) is the original and best-performing Broccoli token. It hit the ground running the next day after CZ posted about his dog on X and already reached a $70M market cap. This morning, $BROCCOLI hit a new ATH of $0.0881 but has since corrected to $0.07, which might present an appealing entry opportunity for those who believe the token will see more upside. Strategy’s $42B $BTC expansion plan shows strong confidence in the $BTC-first, $BTC-only approach that made MSTR one of the best-performing US stocks. But for real investors, smaller-cap new crypto like $BTCBULL and $SOLX could offer greater returns due to their lower entry points. However, remember that the crypto market is volatile, and no gains are guaranteed, even with $BTC. Always DYOR and diversify your portfolio to offset potential losses.
