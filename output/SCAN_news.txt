ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rigetti Computing's stock has soared 2,000% over the past year. Why? It’s been a perfect storm of catalysts. There’s been intense hype around quantum computing and significant capital flowing into the space, which energized investor sentiment. Add the massive AI boom, and many market participants began grouping quantum names like Rigetti into that broader narrative. With only a handful of publicly traded quantum companies, RGTI became a scarce—and therefore hot—stock to own. On top of that, large institutional investors started building positions, lending further credibility. The result was powerful momentum, with retail investors piling in for fear of missing out and pushing the price even higher. Here’s the catch: quantum may be the future, but widespread commercial adoption is still years away. Today’s use cases are limited, with most work concentrated on simulating chemistry and physics. Look at RGTI's fundamentals: We agree, quantum stocks hinge on future growth—and we’ve already explored the upside potential. But have you weighed the downside risks? We cover them below. That said, if you want upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – Oracle Stock To $900. Markets don’t trend in one direction forever—as we’ve seen recently—and quantum computing remains years from broad commercialization. There are several risks that could derail Rigetti’s growth narrative. When sentiment sours, speculative stocks don’t just dip—they get hammered. This isn’t theoretical. In 2022, high inflation spurred rate hikes, and the market fell roughly 25% from its peak. Do you know how much RGTI sank? It was a whopping 96% decline from $9 to $0.40. What could trigger the next collapse? What’s the realistic downside for RGTI from around $16? If history rhymes, it’s under $2. Are you ready for that? The 2022 slide wiped out 96% of RGTI’s value. Even a “moderate” 75–80% correction implies $3–4. Given the speculative setup and weak fundamentals, a return to sub-$2 isn’t just possible—it has precedent. This analysis isn’t bearish for its own sake; it’s about recognizing risk. The probability may be uncertain, but the magnitude is high, and anyone holding RGTI should be prepared for potentially severe drawdowns. For investors seeking growth exposure without the extreme swings of speculative single names, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 indices) to deliver strong returns. Why? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks adapts to strong markets while limiting downside when conditions deteriorate, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics. Remember: in speculative growth stocks, the same momentum that fuels spectacular gains can drive equally spectacular losses. The question isn’t whether RGTI will be volatile—it’s whether you can withstand what the downside might look like.

Title: S&P 500 To Crash 40%?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Inflation numbers are scheduled for release on Thursday, September 11, 2025. We are concerned. Why? Back in 2022, surging prices forced the Federal Reserve into aggressive rate-hiking mode, sending the S&P 500 tumbling 25%. High flyers like Amazon lost more than 50%. Correct, $100 turning into $50 in Amazon stock. This recent history reminds us just how brutally inflation spikes can demolish market confidence. The scary part? Current market conditions mirror some of the warning signs we saw before that 2022 crash, only this time the underlying economic pressures might be even more baked in. The point is, if inflation continues its upward trend, similar to what we’ve seen in recent months, it will likely prevent Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates. When that reality hits, equity markets – especially the S&P 500 – could get hammered. And if the "sticky inflation" narrative really takes root? We could see some truly violent market reactions. Persistent, sticky inflation is what scares us. Clearly, the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the Fed view persistent, “sticky” inflation as a massive threat – and rightly so. The concern is rooted in historical precedent; look at the period from 1972 to 1974, when similar inflationary pressures contributed to an almost 50% drop in the S&P 500. In the current environment, AI, job cuts, and unemployment are top of every investor’s mind – add high inflation pressures – not 3-4%, but 7% or more, like we saw in 2022, and the Fed has no choice but to fight inflation hard with rapid and large increases. The Federal Reserve faces an additional complication not present in previous cycles: the sheer size of government debt means aggressive rate hikes could trigger a sovereign debt crisis alongside inflation concerns. This puts Powell in an impossible position – fight inflation aggressively and risk financial system stability, or remain accommodative and lose credibility on the Fed’s inflation mandate. The current inflationary environment stems from three forces – tariffs, immigration, and taxes – that have created an uncomfortable environment for the S&P 500: When you combine these three factors, it becomes more likely than not that prices will rise, creating persistent inflationary pressure. For context on how severe market downturns can become, our dashboard – How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash – captures how key stocks fared during and after the last seven market crashes, providing insight into potential recession scenarios. In such environments, positioning your portfolio is key – market timing is tricky – the High Quality (HQ) portfolio has outperformed its benchmark – a combination of S&P 500, midcap, and Russell, with >91% cumulative return since inception, and many investors choose to add downside protection to HQ. The point is simple – performance with preservation – as evident in HQ performance metrics. The fundamental reason inflation hurts equity valuations is straightforward. The value of growth assets, especially equities, is derived primarily from future cash flows that are expected to grow significantly over time. For example, cash flows for companies like Microsoft or Amazon are projected to grow by two to three times, or even more, in the next three to five years. However, if inflation remains high and the Fed maintains or even raises interest rates to combat it, those future cash flows will be discounted at a higher rate, making them worth less in today’s terms. High rates mean a dollar tomorrow is worth even less. What else? Higher interest rates attract capital away from growth-oriented and riskier assets, redirecting it toward safer investments that offer a steady yield – that 5% yield on your savings account starts looking pretty good when the markets drop 10% in a week – right? For the S&P 500, this means money flows out of stocks and into bonds, creating downward pressure on valuations. There’s more! You’ve got these automated trading systems that are programmed to react to bad news. If inflation data comes out hotter than expected, they’ll all start selling at the same time, which can trigger a flash crash. Then, there are a lot of people who just recently started investing and haven't been through a real bear market. They might get spooked and panic-sell right when things are at their worst. Finally, because many people have been using borrowed money to invest in everything from stocks to crypto, we could see a ton of forced liquidations. This could create a domino effect, sending prices tumbling across the board. See – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? – for the index’s performance post-Fed’s disappointments in the recent past. Many economists continue to view inflation as a significant risk to S&P 500 valuations. The risks are mounting, and the S&P 500 is vulnerable. If the inflation remains “sticky,” fundamentals won’t matter much to the investors. In fact, fundamentals take a back seat when investors get spooked by the outlook, and even great stocks can take a beating. To reduce stock-specific risk while getting exposure to upside, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large, mid, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. The S&P 500 is currently at a critical juncture. If Thursday’s inflation data confirms that price pressures are persistent, the market could face significant headwinds. The combination of policy-driven inflationary forces creates a perfect storm that could derail the bull market we have grown accustomed to.

Title: Oracle Stock Up 94% On Growth Forecast. Learn Whether To Buy $ORCL

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Oracle's stock soared after a report of a cloud contract with OpenAI and an optimistic forecast for its AI-driven cloud infrastructure.The company projects aggressive eight-fold growth in cloud revenue by FY30, leveraging its unique database and networking advantages for AI training and inference services.Key risks include high market expectations, intense competition, significant capital expenditure, and the potential for AI spending to slow. Oracle shares have soared 99% since the beginning of 2025 – with more than half of that gain coming in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Why did this happen? After all, the Austin-based tech company announced results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026 that fell short of expectations. What sent Oracle stock soaring another 54 percentage points was the company’s outlook for the future of its cloud infrastructure business, according to CNBC. The future didn’t take long: The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday afternoon that Oracle and Open AI agreed to “one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed," worth a reported $300 billion over five years. Will Oracle stock keep rising? The answer depends on whether the tech giant can beat investor expectations and raise guidance in future quarters. I think there is more upside to the stock for two reasons: However, over the longer-term, Oracle stock may plunge if companies stop investing so heavily in artificial intelligence. That could happen unless more of them reap economic benefits – such as faster revenue growth and considerable boosts in productivity. Oracle envisions very fast growth in its cloud infrastructure business. "We expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year — and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years," CEO Safra Catz in a statement. The OpenAI deal is a big a step in that direction. Oracle’s results for the quarter fell flat while the company’s growth forecast generated an outpouring of enthusiasm. Here are the key numbers: The question for investors is whether Oracle’s bullish growth forecasts suggest a continued rise in its stock. Here’s the bull case: Oracle’s latest earnings report suggests growth in demand and much higher revenue driven by companies seeking to benefit from AI. Oracle’s backlog is likely to grow even more. "We signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1," Catz said in a statement. Oracle expects to contract with several additional multibillion-dollar customers and for its RPO to exceed half a trillion dollars, Catz added. "We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who’s who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, and many others," Catz said in investor call featured by Yahoo! Finance. Oracle is targeting two related AI markets – services for training large language models and for inference – generating content from a trained AI model. “Millions of customers are using those AI models to run businesses and governments,” Oracle co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison said in the investor conference call featured by the Wall Street Journal. “AI inference will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic greenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug designs,” he added. Oracle’s unique advantage for AI inference is its databases that store private business data. The company’s “new AI database will make it easy for those businesses to query or ask questions of their private data, all of which adds to the bill for Oracle’s AI inference services,” Ellison said, according to the Journal. Oracle is also investing in AI agents – which help people to achieve specific goals such as selecting, booking, and paying for flights and hotels for a journey, as I described in my book Brain Rush. “The new [applications] that we’re building, they’re nothing other than a bunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow,” he added. Oracle enjoys another advantage over cloud services rivals. “I know some of our competitors, they like to own buildings,” Catz said, according to CNBC. “That’s not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique technology, the unique networking, the storage — just the whole way we put these systems together,” she added. However, this potential comes with significant risks. The stock’s premium valuation reflects high market expectations – if the market shifts money out of big tech companies or Oracle fails to beat and raise every quarter, its stock could fall. Moreover, the high capital expenditure required to fund its expansion could reduce cash flow and highlights the financial risks involved in its ambitious plans. In addition, Oracle faces significant competition from AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. While the urge to spend more on AI is currently powerful, if the economy goes into a recession, companies who buy cloud services may need to cut costs quickly to preserve cash. And since AI has yet to generate enough of a payoff to justify the investment, as I wrote last month in a Forbes article, such spending could be curtailed if the economy contracts. Last September, generative AI was looking to me like a big dud. While people were using ChatGPT to help them draft emails and reports, there was no killer app – akin to what the iTunes store did for the iPod or the electronic spreadsheet did for personal computers, I wrote in the Boston Globe. Last month, MIT reinforced this point with hard numbers. "Despite $30B-$40B in enterprise investment into generative AI, this report uncovers a surprising result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return," according to a study – based on 150 interviews with professionals, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments – from MIT’s NANDA Institute featured by SeekingAlpha. The main problem appears to be integrating AI into the enterprise. "Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable profit and loss impact," noted the MIT NANDA Institute report. If companies find ways to make AI pay over the next four years, Oracle’s cloud services rapid growth could continue. Analysts are mostly enthusiastic about Oracle’s prospects: One note of caution came from D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. While Lauria said Oracle’s projected cloud revenue figure was “absolutely staggering,” according to CNBC, the business is coming from Microsoft and Google who are “offloading their capacity to other data center providers. These are not organic customers to Oracle,” he added. While Wall Street is optimistic, 35 analysts who cover the stock set a price target of $263.93, according to TipRanks – meaning Oracle stock is 25% over-valued. I see the stock continuing to rise – at least until the company’s next earnings report.

Title: Oracle Stock To $900: Its Simple Math
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/10/oracle-stock-to-900-its-simple-math/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Oracle’s meteoric rise continues to defy expectations. With a 30% surge in extended trading following its latest earnings and a cumulative 3x gain since early 2023, the enterprise software giant is rewriting the playbook for cloud transformation. But here’s the million-dollar question: Can Oracle realistically triple again from current levels to reach $900 per share? The numbers suggest it's not just possible—it might be inevitable. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – JNJ Stock To $250? Oracle just dropped a bombshell that caught even the most bullish analysts off guard. The company’s remaining performance obligations (RPO) exploded 359% year-over-year to $455 billion from the previous quarter's $138 billion figure. What does this actually mean? Think of RPO as Oracle’s locked-in revenue pipeline—contracts already signed and sealed, just waiting to be delivered. This isn't wishful thinking or ambitious projections; it's money already committed by customers. Oracle didn’t just report numbers—they laid out a clear trajectory for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue that reads like a growth investor's dream: Here’s what makes them credible: most of this revenue is already baked into the reported RPO. Oracle isn't gambling on future demand—they're simply executing on contracts already in hand. Why is everyone suddenly throwing money at Oracle’s cloud? The AI revolution requires massive computational infrastructure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has positioned itself as a premier destination for AI workloads. As companies race to implement AI solutions, they need reliable, scalable cloud platforms—something that Oracle provides. The timing couldn’t be better. While competitors face capacity constraints and pricing pressures, Oracle is expanding aggressively and capturing market share in the highest-growth segments. Let’s break down the path to a $900 stock price with simple, conservative assumptions: Assuming Oracle maintains its operational leverage and margins improve modestly with cloud scale: From today’s levels, that represents a roughly 3x upside. Is a 40x P/E reasonable for 2030? For a company growing cloud revenue at a projected 34% average annual rate with locked-in contracts extending years into the future, a 40x multiple seems conservative, especially in a market that regularly assigns higher multiples to companies with less predictable growth. Note that tech stocks like Microsoft and Amazon currently trade at 35-40 times trailing earnings. Look at Oracle’s Valuation Ratios for more details. No investment thesis is complete without acknowledging potential headwinds. Oracle faces several challenges that could derail this optimistic scenario. Competition intensifies as cloud becomes table stakes. Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud aren’t sitting idle. They have deeper pockets and broader ecosystems. Oracle’s advantage in AI infrastructure could erode if competitors aggressively price or innovate their way back into contention. Economic headwinds could pressure enterprise spending, and companies might delay cloud migrations or renegotiate contracts. While Oracle’s RPO provides some insulation, large enterprise deals can still be postponed or downsized during tough times. Execution risk on this massive scale-up. Growing from $59 billion to $200 billion in annual revenue requires flawless execution across hiring, infrastructure buildout, and customer delivery. Any stumbles could shake confidence in these ambitious projections. Multiple compressions could be more severe than expected. As Oracle matures further, the market might assign lower multiples than our 40x assumption, particularly if interest rates remain elevated. Our separate analysis focusing on the downside risk for Oracle offers more details. Oracle’s latest results represent more than just a good quarter—they signal a fundamental shift in the company’s trajectory and market position. With $455 billion in locked-in future revenue and a clear path to $200 billion in annual sales by 2030, the case for $900 per share is surprisingly straightforward. That said, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the Trefis High-Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So is this a slam dunk? Not quite. Execution risks are real, competition is fierce, and market conditions can change rapidly. But for investors willing to bet on Oracle’s ability to capitalize on the AI-driven cloud boom, the risk-reward equation looks compelling. The 30% after-hours pop might actually be the conservative reaction. When a company provides this level of revenue visibility with this kind of growth trajectory, a 3x move over the next four to five years starts looking less like speculation and more like inevitability. The question isn’t whether Oracle can reach $900—it's whether investors have the patience to ride the journey.

Gold prices have risen 40% this year, above $3700 (~Rs 110,000), after a 27% surge in 2024, thanks to dovish monetary policy, a soft dollar, robust central bank stockpiling, and increased global concern. · In the 12 months ending in March, the U.S. economy probably created 911,000 fewer jobs than previously thought, the government said Tuesday, indicating that employment creation was already faltering prior to the strong import tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. · Additionally, last week’s release of U.S. nonfarm payroll statistics indicated deteriorating labour market conditions, which further cemented the argument for a rate cut by the Fed next week. · For additional clues on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate trajectory, attention will now turn to U.S. producer price inflation data, which is scheduled for later today, and consumer price inflation data on Thursday.

(Negative) Gold – Glinting & Blazing and approaching $4000 US Federal Reserve Policy Outlook, Central Bank Accumulation, Geopolitical Tensions, ETF and Institutional Flows remains the key drivers behind the rally. US inflation hasn’t been fully caged with FED independence remaining under pressure and geopolitics also adding sparks. This may not last forever, but the near-term tide and current is in favor of gold. Gold is turning out to be the main course, serving hot, in one’s portfolio. New highs are in the face of a fresh political crisis in France, Japan and the US sanctions against Russia. Rate cuts bets have intensified after a weaker-than-expected US jobs report last Friday. Generally risk and refuge (Stocks & Gold) do not rally together but this cycle seems diƯerent with lingering inflation, US federal reserve rate cuts and tariƯ driven backdrops. Gold rallying is not a speculative froth but a diversification game by the Central Banks from dollar monopoly to gold. Traders might view it as a hot money chase, but the Central Banks preservation leads to built up in the gold vault and pulling it oƯ the market, creating a scarcity premium. Just an arithmetic of 1% movement from treasuries into bullion could lead to a gold rise beyond $4000 an ounce, or even more. Headwinds Bullish moves may be challenging on growing skepticism over the impact of the Supreme Court verdict (October 14th) on Trump’s plea on the tariƯ matter. US inflation data for August is due this week with an expected upside due to tariƯs, which may have a bearing on the US Fed rate cut decisions. Markets are on a close watch. Levels On any eventuality of a gold correction, immediate support is seen at $3616 and $3578. Up to 16th Sept’25 the gold volatility could witness rally beyond $3700 for a $3781 target which acts as a stoploss for the shorts targeting $3422. In the short-term gold seems to be overbought, but the broader trend is still positive. Weaker numbers of the US inflation data this week could boost gold further.

Meanwhile, gold’s rally is also being supported by safe-haven demand amid geopolitical risks, US tariff concerns, and strong central bank buying. The metal is up 39% year-to-date. On Tuesday, the 10Y benchmark (6.33 GS 2035) opened 1 bps lower at 6.46% vs 6.47% tracking the fall in US Treasury yields as the sharply lower US non-farm payrolls data induced traders to fully factor in a 25bps rate cut by the Federal Reserve on Sep 17 policy. However, the fall was short lived, and yields surged to end at 6.49% as market participants booked profits amid lack of fresh triggers. Market participants now await India’s CPI inflation data due to be released on Sep 12, Friday for further directions. The cut-offs for SDL auction amounting ~$1.69 Bn (INR 149 Bn) was in line with the expectations. The latest system liquidity stands in surplus of ~$26.8 Bn (~INR 2360 Bn). >>> INR local credit: Yields were steady across the curve, with the 10Y point closing at 7.19%. Australia – Home prices seen rising on expected rate cuts, but affordability remains a concern. China – Consumer prices fall at fastest pace in 6 months, though producer deflation eases. United States – Labor market weaker than thought after job revisions; small-business optimism improves despite labor concerns. United Kingdom – Finance Minister Reeves urges ministers to back BoE in fighting inflation. South Africa – Growth quickens but remains sluggish. India – August consumer inflation likely rose as base effects faded; rupee faces choppy path, bond yields may ease. Japan – PM Ishiba resigns, casting doubt on BOJ rate hikes; manufacturers’ sentiment best in three years post tariff deal. Taiwan – August exports hit record high despite tariff pressures. Thailand – Foreign visitors fall 7% YoY in 2025. Indonesia – Central bank buys longer bonds to stabilize market; new finance minister plans liquidity push, but minister’s removal unsettles rupiah. France – Debt burden deepens, heightening fiscal risks. Global/Markets – Stocks rise and dollar strengthens on weaker US jobs outlook; hedge funds sustain positive returns in August. Brazil – Petrobras offshore tests seen satisfying regulators, Lula signals approval. Europe (autos) – Truckmakers hit EU climate targets via diesel tweaks; campaigners warn hybrids not a CO2 solution. Canada – TSX hits record high on mining sector deal. Middle East – Oil prices climb after Israeli attack on Qatar; Trump tariff stance on Russia adds to volatility. US Energy/Policy – Power demand seen hitting records in 2025–26; Chevron boosting Vaca Muerta output; EPA fast-tracks AI infra permits; LNG expansion approved. Source: Reuters 1.

The deceleration in growth is due to a slowdown in government capex (fiscal consolidation and execution limits in key sectors) and due to heightened caution in the private sector (muted near-term demand, tariffs, etc.). While high growth (20%+) seen post COVID-19 is unlikely anytime soon, we believe ~10-11% growth in capex is very much achievable and sustainable given the continuing policy focus (central govt capex is up sharply YTD), very strong power-related capex (which should continue for the next several years), solid balance sheets, strong cash flows, and healthy capex intentions of corporates. A 10% growth environment offers pockets of opportunity for healthy earnings growth – we prefer industrial names with stronger tailwinds and optionality (CG Power), strong and diversified end markets (Cummins India), and the possibility of an uptick in margins (Thermax). We initiate coverage of ABB India at Neutral, and of Siemens and BHEL at UW. Our order of preference in industrials is L&T, CG Power, Cummins India and Thermax. Stick to growth and visibility: Prefer L&T, CG Power, Cummins and Thermax – L&T remains our top pick with its attractive valuation (24x core FY27E P/E) with high RoCEs (30%+) and EPS growth (18%+). In this report, we initiate coverage of: 1) CG Power at OW (strong growth, supported by expanding transformer capacity and optionality from OSAT), 2) Cummins India at OW (demand visibility, strong margin performance), 3) Thermax at OW (margin tailwinds as low margin projects end). We also initiate coverage of ABB India and Praj at Neutral, and Siemens and BHEL at UW.

Also, the price is now above both 21- and 50-day moving averages. While the price action shows that the stock has been flat in the past few sessions, the breakout remains valid, and we expect it to soon see another leg of uptrend.

Title: Thinking more broadly: Bonds beyond vanilla
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/09/thinking-more-broadly-bonds-beyond-vanilla/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T23:09:18Z
Full Content:
Traditionally, the job description for a core bond manager was numbing: (1) show up for work, (2) buy a bunch of Treasury bonds and some investment grade intermediate corporates, (3) celebrate the trading coup that allowed you to buy the same bond as everyone else but for a quarter basis point less – woohoo!, (4) go home and enjoy a fiber-rich dinner and small glass of red wine. In reality, managers added negligible value. Over 10 years (through August 2025), the core bond fund trailing 75% of its peers returned 1.7% annually, the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (a proxy for “the market”) returned 1.8% annually, and a fund leading 75% of its peers returned 2.2%. Net difference between cellar and penthouse: 0.5% per year. (Source: MFOPremium calculations, Lipper Global Datafeed data.) And that’s pretty typical for other trailing periods. As a result, relative returns were highly dependent on efficiency: very large funds with very low expense ratios, able to place bids on very large lots of very efficiently priced bonds, had a nearly unbeatable structural advantage. 10-year performance difference between the top quartile and the bottom quartile Core bond: 0.5% annually (per MFO Premium) Core stock: 1.6% annually (per Morningstar) In a world where US Treasury bonds are the world’s safest investment and among its most reliably profitable, it was an unbeatable recipe. We might be leaving that world behind, which suggests we might need to consider possibilities where diversification and manager judgment might add substantial value. That implies the possibility of considering an ongoing stake in credit rather than just investment grade, in international rather than just U.S., in special situations rather than just vanilla auctions, and in shorter durations. For intelligent investors—regardless of whether financial analysis is a daily habit or a distant interest—it’s becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the mounting alarm bells surrounding the United States’ fiscal outlook. In mid-2025, the national debt stands at over $37 trillion, a sum now greater than the entire American economy. This staggering figure reflects years of budget deficits and a political climate where policy decisions often appear driven more by ideology, self-interest and brinkmanship than any rational economic strategy. Even major investors, once reliant on U.S. Treasury bonds for security, are beginning to question how much longer the world’s largest borrower can sustainably fund its needs without consequence (Drew Desilver, “Key facts about the US national debt,” Pew Research, 8/12/2025). (Sources: Historical Debt Outstanding, US Treasury; Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, 9/2025) These fiscal realities are not happening in isolation. As the U.S. government takes on more debt, with rising costs just to pay interest, confidence in federal bonds has begun to erode. Recent episodes of political gridlock over spending caps and the debt limit have highlighted just how reactive and unpredictable U.S. fiscal policy has become. The practical effect is a new era of vulnerability for traditional income portfolios anchored almost solely on U.S. Treasuries and investment-grade corporates. Investors are seeing the value of home-country assets increasingly shaped by fiscal risk and short-term fixes rather than predictable economic fundamentals. In contrast, a growing number of foreign markets not only boast more attractive valuations but also signal ripening opportunities as non-U.S. economies chart their own paths out of stagnation. Diversification, therefore, isn’t simply about chasing higher yields or speculating abroad—it’s emerging as a necessary hedge against the potential excesses of U.S.-centric fiscal and market dynamics. One measure of that changed dynamic is Research Affiliates’ estimates of the risks and returns, given a series of uniform economic assumptions, of dozens of asset classes. The following table gives the 10 highest Sharpe assets plus the US bond aggregate. Categories in black are fixed income (seven of 11), and blue are equity. (Source: Research Affiliates, Asset Allocation Interactive, 9/2025) By contrast, the three asset classes with negative expected 10-year Sharpe ratios are US Large-Cap stocks (-0.03), Developed Markets Large Growth stocks (-0.06), and US Large Growth stocks (-0.12). Bottom line: investors need to consider looking for core exposure, not just 5% nibbles, in areas beyond the common. The bad news is that many of the most intriguing income investments are not easily accessible to most investors: closed-end interval funds such as RBC Blue Ray Destra International Event-Driven Credit (CEDIX) or Carlyle Tactical Private Credit (TAKNX), often have high minimums and limited brokerage access. Others, such as SEI Opportunistic Income (SIIT) Fund and GMO Emerging Country Debt, are institutional. Those structural quirks – the ability to use leverage and to lock large investments in place by denying investors the chance to redeem at will – give those managers exceptional advantages. That said, there are intriguing options available to regular investors. We searched the MFO Premium database for funds that met six criteria: And, finally, they had to be purchasable. Sixteen funds survived the cut. The funds are sorted by Sharpe ratio. How to read that chart: The first three columns are easy. Name, Lipper fund category, and average yearly return over the past four years. Down capture is the percentage of the US bond market’s downside that the fund captured. A negative down capture means the fund tended to rise when the US bond market fell. The R-squared (R2) measures the degree of correlation between the fund and the US bond market: 100 means that the fund marches in lockstep with the bond market; 0 means the fund is completely independent of it. Finally, visual represents of three performance metrics: a maximum drawdown rating (how far the fund fell relative to its peers), downside deviation rating (called “bad deviation,” it’s a measure of how much a fund routinely falls relative to its peers) and Ulcer rating (our favorite: a measure of how far a fund falls and how long it takes to recover; deep fall + long recovery = massive investor ulcers). In each case, a blue cell signals top 20% performance. MFO does not make “sell now!” or “buy now!” calls, much less predictions about “the 10 funds you absolutely must own!” Those calls are easy to make, impossible to make reliably. Our argument is simpler: we are in the midst of a fiscal mess, which is likely to get messier and messier. It would be prudent, before any panic sets in, to examine the question: are there ways to reduce my exposure to emerging risks and still earn a decent return? The funds above have made money over the past five years; the US bond market has not. Those funds uniformly aim to provide high current income with admirably low exposure to the traditional income markets. And it reminds us, again, of the consistent independence and excellence of the CrossingBridge folks who are responsible for the two highest-rated funds on the list (CrossingBridge Low Duration and RiverPark Strategic Income). We will try to profile three of these funds each month during the last three months of 2025. David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts). Cofounder, lead writer.

Title: Ethereum bet jumped 11x in 5 years — from $1,000 to $11,145, should investors still bet on ETH today?

Ethereum has quietly been one of the most rewarding bets in crypto. A $1,000 investment made just five years ago in 2020 would now be worth around $11,145, an 11x jump despite wild swings along the way. But with ETH trading around $4,327 this September, investors are asking the real question: is Ethereum still worth buying after such explosive gains, or is the big money already made?

Despite GST 2.0's reforms aiming to boost consumption and corporate earnings, FIIs continue selling Indian stocks, driven by Trump's tariff concerns and global uncertainties. A significant FII exodus, reaching ₹1.4 lakh crore in 2025, persists despite domestic investor support. High valuations and the lure of cheaper markets further fuel the foreign investor skepticism.
