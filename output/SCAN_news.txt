Full Content:
On 8 October 2024, famed global macro hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry posted a thought-provoking message on the social media platform X, discussing Bitcoin’s place in the broader financial landscape and warning of potential dangers in traditional financial markets. Hendry’s commentary compared Bitcoin’s market capitalization to that of major tech stocks, highlighting the potential instability in financial markets tied to those assets. Hendry opened by calling Bitcoin “everyone’s phantom, good or bad,” suggesting that while Bitcoin is often a topic of debate, its overall impact on the current financial conversation is relatively small due to its size. He explained that Bitcoin’s total market capitalization, standing at around $1 trillion, is dwarfed by the $42 trillion valuation of tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq 100 (represented by QQQ). He said that this vast discrepancy in size means that Bitcoin doesn’t hold significant sway in current financial market dynamics, but it does possess a unique attraction for potential upside growth due to its smaller relative size. In Hendry’s analogy, he likened Bitcoin’s role in financial markets to Newton’s Cradle, where mass is a crucial factor in determining how forces move through the system. In this case, traditional large-cap tech stocks—such as those in the so-called “Mag-7,” worth about $13 trillion—are the key players in today’s financial landscape. These stocks carry tremendous influence due to their size, making them the focal point of Hendry’s concern. He warned that if these tech stocks falter, the implications could be disastrous for the broader market, leading to margin calls and a cascade of financial disruptions. A major part of Hendry’s caution stemmed from his discussion of “moneyness,” or how close an asset’s value is to the perceived safety of a U.S. Treasury bill (T-bill). In his view, tech stocks, despite their current valuations, are far more volatile than T-bills and could lose significant value in a relatively short time frame. He noted that T-bills are highly stable and are not subject to drastic devaluations—unlike stocks, which have, in the past, lost as much as 83% of their value in an 18-month period. Hendry’s concern focused on the use of these overvalued tech stocks as collateral for loans. He warned that banks may need to reevaluate the true worth of this collateral in the event of a downturn. He believes that if these stocks lose value, the credit market could unravel, causing massive margin calls and liquidity issues throughout the financial system. In response to this risk, Hendry suggested that banks should reduce their exposure to these assets as a protective measure, though this would be challenging due to the market’s dependence on liquidity. Finally, Hendry hinted that he and financial analyst David Levenson are closely monitoring the growth and deceleration of these major assets. He concluded with a sobering thought: if these financial “beasts” cannot grow, they will eventually collapse.

The previous YSR Congress Party Government in the state led by Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy never opposed the proposal to privatise VSP during 2019-24 and now had `no moral right’ to criticise the NDA Government in the State on the issue, he added.

Britannia Bel Foods, a key player in India’s cheese market, has taken a significant step in its growth journey by announcing the inauguration of its new cheese factory in Ranjangaon, Maharashtra. This facility will locally produce “Britannia The Laughing Cow” cheese products, deepening the joint venture between Britannia and France’s Bel Group, which began nearly two years ago. The plant represents a investment of approximately ₹220 crores and aims to produce 10,000 tons of high-quality cheese annually to meet the increasing demand from Indian consumers. An Independent Investigation Committee (IIC) constituted by the Board of Directors of ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEE), has found no irregularities in the functioning of the company. “The Committee also noted that the transactions (under investigation) did not adversely affect the Company or its shareholders. The mentioned transactions were found to be a part of normal course of business, and no material irregularities were reported within the same,” said a press release. In the order released on August 14 2023, SEBI confirmed that Goenka along with his father Subhash Chandra will not be allowed to hold the position of a Director or a KMP in ZEEL or any of its subsidiaries, while the market regulator completes its investigation on the matter. The order by the capital markets regulator came on the back of an investigation into allegations related to the appropriation of certain fixed deposits of Zee by Yes Bank for squaring off loans of related entities of Essel Group ‘ Listen to your employees. Listen to your customers Shut... the ef up. And do what they tell you.’ This was the mantra adopted by the maverick CEO of T-Mobile USA - John Legere, in delivering one of the most remarkable transformations of a company in corporate history. When he took the reigns of T-Mobile USA in 2012/13 it was a weak fourth player in USA with around 34 million wireless subscribers in an industry dominated by two giants – AT&T and Verizon with 78 and 98 million wireless subscribers respectively. The third player Sprint Nextel too had a wide lead over T-Mobile USA with 55 million subscribers.

However, the six-member monetary policy committee (MPC), which has three new external members, chose by a majority of 5 out of 6 members to hold the policy repo rate steady at 6.50 per cent as the pace of disinflation has been slow and uneven. Only the newly appointed Nagesh Kumar voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points.

Title: Utility Stocks Come Down From AI-Driven Highs

Shares of power generators Constellation Energy (CEG), NRG Energy (NRG), and Vistra (VST) posted some of the steepest losses in the S&P 500 on Wednesday. The declines came after all three stocks ended last week with record highs on enthusiasm about opportunities to benefit from growing energy demand for data centers to support artificial intelligence (AI). The retreat for the red-hot electric utility stocks came as several analysts expressed concerns about the sustainability of their valuations following massive AI-driven gains this year. Although many analysts remain bullish about the upside potential for companies like Constellation, NRG, and Vistra as they could help meet the large energy demand needed to power AI, BTIG analysts suggested utilities could be set for a correction of around 7% to 10%. According to BTIG's analysis, the sector's valuation appears "stretched" relative to its historical levels, and utilities tend to drop off following periods of outperformance versus the broader markets. SentimenTrader's Jason Goepfert echoed that utility stocks have a history of reversing their momentum after strong runs, and added any cracks in the "new narrative about AI" could hit confidence in returns. Constellation Energy was the weakest performer of any S&P 500 stock Wednesday, plunging 6.1%. NRG Energy shares dropped 5.3%, while Vistra stock slipped almost 3%. Despite the declines, all three stocks remained solidly in positive territory for 2024. Constellation shares have more than doubled in value since the start of the year, while NRG stock is up more than 70%. Vistra, meanwhile, remains the S&P 500's top-performing stock this year, having more than tripled in value over the period.

Title: 2 Big Dividends To Buy As Inflation Returns

Inflation Graphic to illustrate strong rising inflation. 3D illustration Another day, another sign the economy is heading straight for that “no-landing” scenario I’ve been talking about for weeks now … … and yet another sign the two dividends we’re going to discuss today are better buys than they’ve been in months. (One of these staunch payers kicks out a rich 8% divvie. The other has grown its dividend a ridiculous 425% in the last five years. A buy back then would be kicking out a sweet 6.2% dividend today, thanks to that breakneck growth!) When you hear “no landing,” your first impression might be that it sounds like a good thing, right? After all, it implies the economy will keep humming along, and that recession we’ve been worrying about since, well, 2020, will keep being pushed back. All good. Except here’s the rub: Inflation comes back. I mean, when you have a federal government spending nearly $2 trillion more than it’s taking in, it’s easy to see how this monetary inflation could seep into consumer price inflation. And there’s no way an extra $2 trillion dropping into the system isn’t going to juice the economy! No matter who wins the election, I think we can all agree that this spending is unlikely to be tamed. The opposite, in fact—fueling inflation even more. A quick look at the headlines brings more warnings of a potential resurgence of inflation: An expanding war in the Middle East, for example, has been pushing up oil prices. And even though the port workers’ strike has been settled, it reminds us how easily our supply chains can be disrupted. And of course we had last week’s blowout jobs report, which showed continued strong wage growth. Jay Powell seems to see this inflationary wave rolling in. Last week, he tamped down expectations of more jumbo rate cuts, like the 50-pointer the Fed dropped last month. Futures markets agree—they now point to just 75 basis points in cuts between now and the Fed’s last meeting of the year, on December 18. So where does that leave us? We’re looking to buy dividends that ride this growing economy while profiting from inflation’s return. That setup points straight to one sector: natural gas stocks. There are two other reasons to buy “natty” stocks now, too. First, there’s the massive stimulus plan China announced a little over a week ago. That’s likely to spur gas demand, as China is the biggest importer, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The other factor working in our favor is gas’s tendency to hit its $2 “price floor” and bounce—exactly what it’s doing now. A price that’s bottomed and has momentum? That’s typically a great time to buy. So let’s dive into those two dividends I mentioned off the top, starting with our 8% payer. At times like these, with energy prices still low but moving up, we look to the 8% dividend kicked out by the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP Alerian MLP ETF ), which holds the shares of energy infrastructure companies. These firms—master limited partnerships (MLPs), to be exact—collect tolls on the oil and gas that moves through their lines and sits in their storage tanks. MLPs make money in all energy seasons, but it’s much better to own them when prices are at least steady or better yet rising, to snag price upside and sweet dividend payouts. When oil and gas prices (and shipping volumes) rise, the pipeline stocks AMLP owns boost their dividends. That’s resulted in a steady grind higher for the fund’s payout: AMLP Dividend Best of all, AMLP’s rising payout pulls its price up—a phenomenon I call the “Dividend Magnet.” The pattern is unmistakable: AMLP Dividend Magnet So where does that leave us? With an 8% “starter” yield that’s set to grow on a buy made today, as our “no-landing” setup pushes commodity demand (and prices) higher. Oh, and a share price poised to ride right along with it, too. By the way, buying MLPs through AMLP also eliminates one of the headaches of buying MLPs “direct”: complicated tax reporting. AMLP’s top holding, Plains All-American Pipeline LP (PAA), kicks you a fussy K-1 form at tax time, which is a hassle for you or the pro who files your taxes. (Trust me, I once got a firm talking-to from my accountant after buying MLPs a few years ago.) But buy through AMLP and voila, no K-1! Just a normal 1099 showing your dividends received. Which, of course, dishes that elite 8%. When natural gas is in the early stages of a rally, EQT Corp. (EQT) is my “go to” stock. The company boasts nearly 4,000 drilling locations—and the lowest breakeven costs in the industry. (Names hidden in the chart below to protect the less profitable!) FCF Breakeven The prices above indicate at what level the company’s gas is profitable to drill. Notice that EQT leads the pack overall. What’s more, the company is tightening its grip on the prolific Appalachian Basin through its recently completed $14-billion acquisition of Equitrans Midstream, its former midstream business, which adds 3,700 miles of pipeline, plus storage assets. EQT sees the move resulting in $425 million in cost savings (The firm also recently cut its workforce by 15%). It also nicely positions EQT as it moves to boost production after last winter no-showed in large parts of the country, hitting gas prices. Remember, too, that natural gas is the least offensive of the fossil fuels, which gives it long-term upside as a “transition” fuel as the world shifts toward renewables. NatGas Demand Growth Which brings us back to the Dividend Magnet. For months and even a few years, tickers can meander independently of their dividends. But eventually, they do follow their payouts higher like a puppy dog. EQT’s dividend has leaped above its stock, putting a strong pull on its price: EQT Dividend Magnet Even if I’m wrong with my “no-landing” call, all signs point to this one winning anyway. The stock is still well off its 2022 peak, its dividend is on a tear, and natgas production is about to ramp up, thanks in part to surging power demand from energy transition. That makes now a great time to buy EQT—and its charged-up Dividend Magnet. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: EM Currencies Fall for Fifth Day as Traders Temper Fed Bets

(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market currencies declined for a fifth consecutive session on Monday as traders scaled back bets on another big interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve amid signs of a resilient US economy. The MSCI Inc. gauge for developing-nation currencies was down 0.3% as of 12:10 p.m. in New York, posting its longest streak of losses since July. The Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian rupiah were among the worst performers in a basket of currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Oil prices rose as investors remain nervous about increased tensions in the Middle East. Traders have been rethinking the path for the Fed’s policy easing since the release of stronger-than-expected US jobs data on Friday. US Treasury 10-year yields rose to hover the 4% level as traders pared wagers on another half-point cut by the US central bank. “The repricing of the US easing cycle is likely to keep EMFX under pressure in the short term,” said Luis Estrada, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Bearish bets on the US dollar are being dismantled, while some investors are also buying dollars to hedge their constructive wagers on EM rates, he said. JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists cut their recommendation on EM local-currency debt last week, citing the “big upside surprise” in payrolls and risks stemming from the US presidential election in about a month. That comes after EM local bonds posted their biggest quarterly advance since 2020. The benchmark for emerging-market equities rose for a second day, mostly driven by gains in shares of Asian semiconductor companies. A subindex for Latin America stocks retreated. Optimism about stimulus measures has sparked a massive rally in Chinese stocks. Exchange-traded funds that buy the nation’s equities have seen billions of dollars in inflows. China’s top economic planner will hold a press briefing on Tuesday to discuss a package of policies aimed at boosting economic growth. Details on potential fiscal policy stimulus will be key in determining whether the momentum of the current rally can continue or whether the relief might be only temporary, according to Nenad Dinic, an equity strategist at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich. “In the short term, EM ex-China stocks may continue to underperform China due to rotational shifts in capital flows,” Dinic said. In credit markets, El Salvador’s notes jumped after the government launched a tender offer for several debt instruments. Bonds maturing in 2050 rose as much as 2.8 cents on the dollar, according to indicative pricing collected by Bloomberg. Ghana bonds also rose after the nation received “overwhelming” backing of bondholders to restructure $13 billion of eurobonds. --With assistance from Srinivasan Sivabalan.

Title: 5 Stocks To Own For The 2024 Elections & Beyond!

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections. With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!

More Info Last weekend, we warned readers that according to the latest data from Goldman Sachs, a massive short squeeze in energy stocks was on deck. Specifically we noted that at a time when funds were the most short oil on record, the broader energy space "was the most net sold sector" on the Goldman US Prime book, "driven entirely by short sales, which outpaced long buys (6.4 to 1)." And here, we said, was "the hint to the next mega squeeze" as the recent short selling in energy was the largest in over 5 years. Last weekend, we warned readers that according to the latest data from Goldman Sachs, a massive short squeeze in energy stocks was on deck. Specifically we noted that at a time when funds were the most short oil on record, the broader energy space "was the most net sold sector" on the Goldman US Prime book, "driven entirely by short sales, which outpaced long buys (6.4 to 1)." And here, we said, was "the hint to the next mega squeeze" as the recent short selling in energy was the largest in over 5 years. What happened next was for the history books, as Brent crude soared the most in almost two years on the back of what was a historic market imbalance with record shorts suddenly starting to run for cover... ... with the Kamala lackeys at Bloomberg going so far as to mock those who actually did the right thing and trade ahead of the inevitable squeeze as "tourists", when in reality the only tourists here are those who expected the ridiculous plunge in oil prices to persist despite Cushing approaching tank bottoms (Bloomberg's message is loud and clear: keep shorting oil unless you want to be branded a "tourist", especially since a spike in oil - and gas - prices may adversely impact its favorite presidential candidate). Unfortunately for Bloomberg, the squeeze in energy is just getting started, and not just due to fundamentals. Crude oil soared last week as a result of the rapidly deteriorating situation in the middle east. On Tuesday, spot month WTI and Brent rallied >5% from the lows on the initial headlines from the White House that an Iranian attack was imminent. Goldman's research desk noted on Tuesday that the jump in oil prices reflected a moderate risk premium as actual production disruptions have been limited and spare capacity remains elevated. The energy complex jumped again Thursday on news that the US was considering whether or not to support Israel’s potential retaliatory attacks against Iranian energy infrastructure. Then, over the weekend, the bank's commodity analysts published a new report (available to pro subs) in which they tried to calculate the impact on the price of oil should Iran oil output be "limited" by Israel, to wit: But it's not just fundamentals: Goldman's Prime Brokerage wrote in its latest weekly must-read note (also available to pro subs) that "after heightened geopolitical tensions and rising crude oil price, HFs reversed course and net bought US Energy stocks for the first time in 7 weeks, driven almost entirely by short covers." As a result, the US Energy long/short ratio increased +5% – the largest weekly increase in nearly 5 months – to 1.36, which is in the 69th percentile vs. the past year and 14th percentile vs. the past five years." That said, the short overhang in energy remains staggering, and hints at a far more brutal unwind once the upward momentum persists for another week, and not only in energy stocks where the short flow on Goldman's Prime Broekrage is just shy of record highs... ... but also in the oil patch, because after oil short interest hit a record two weeks ago as traders turned the most bearish on oil they have ever been, the amount of short covering was virtually non existent, and net managed-money (i.e., hedge fund) exposure across the 4 main oil contracts (Nymex and ICE WTI, Nymex and ICE Brent), is barely above its record lows! Putting it all together, Goldman Energy specialist Ryan Novak writes that "energy led to the upside on the week after we exited the prior week with aggressive PB selling/short selling that flipped this week, managed money positioning remains short - at all-time lows and tensions across the Middle East escalating with Israel beginning its ground invasion. E&Ps led on the week +7%. All eyes on any incremental news regarding any attack on Iranian energy infrastructure which would pose further upside risk to the commodity and equities." Bottom line: with record shorts now painfully squeezed as upward momentum has been ignited across the energy sector, and the risk of a flashing red headline that Israel has leveled Kharg Island looming, unwind of what until a week ago was a record short position in oil and energy stocks is just getting started. And that's without Israel even doing anything. Should Israel however take the plunge and either take out Iran's oil infrastructure or, worse, target its nuclear industry, then the coming explosion in oil will make the Volkswagen short squeeze of 2008 seem like quaint amateur hour.

Investing.com -- The recent stimulus announcements out of China have left investors raising questions about how to position themselves in case Beijing unleashes a more aggressive economic boost—a so-called “bazooka” stimulus. In a Tuesday note, Barclays analysts acknowledge that this is not their base case, but they emphasize that investors should prepare for such a scenario due to its potential to significantly impact global markets. Despite the recent rally in Chinese equities, the broader market reaction has been relatively subdued, leaving room for opportunities in other asset classes. Chinese equities have shown some of their largest movements in history, with the CSI 300 posting a staggering 1-week sigma move of +17.6. “The magnitude of these moves suggests that investors were unprepared for such announcements, and also that technicals, such as positioning, may have acted as a tailwind,” Barclays analysts noted. “Additionally, it also indicates that while there may be further room for upside, the bulk of the move in the near-term may be over.” The rally has largely been confined to Chinese equities and their proxies, such as European miners, but Barclays believes the real impact could come if China unveils a massive fiscal stimulus plan, like a CNY10 trillion package over two years. In such a scenario, the effects could spill over into global markets, creating opportunities in non-Chinese assets. “Notably, in a 'bazooka' scenario stimulus would likely have more farreaching effects on global assets, making upside opportunities on non-Chinese assets more attractive, given less extended moves and cheaper vol.,” analysts continued. They outlined several strategies to capitalize on this potential, focusing on oil, industrials, and U.S. stocks with high exposure to China. Among those, analysts discussed buying U.S. Oil Fund (USO (NYSE:USO)) calls, conditional on a stronger euro against the dollar, as oil is particularly sensitive to positive surprises in Chinese demand. A second opportunity lies in industrials, where Barclays advises buying hybrid XLI (Industrials) vs. SPY (S&P 500) call spreads. The Chinese credit cycle has historically been a strong leading indicator for industrials' performance, and a major stimulus could give this sector a significant boost. Finally, for investors looking for direct exposure to U.S.-China trade, Barclays screens for companies with high Chinese sales exposure and attractive volatility profiles. Top candidates include Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), which could see significant gains if China’s economy rebounds on the back of stimulus.
