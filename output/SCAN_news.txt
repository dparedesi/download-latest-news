Edited excerpts: Your views on the broader markets? In terms of broader market performance, we are in a volatile phase with low returns over the past year. Although markets have rallied over the last couple of months, if we look at the last one-year returns, it’s a low single-digit number. One can attribute this to expensive valuations and a slowdown in the economy. We didn’t see a massive correction, which typically happens when markets are expensive, as, structurally, India stays one of the most preferred markets from a long-term perspective. India, being the fastest-growing economy, has fiscal checks in place, and even if one looks at the corporate sector, we are seeing one of the lowest levels of debt/equity. Even the banking sector is at its lowest levels of NPAs. This gives confidence to the investors from a long-term perspective. With stronger balance sheets, fiscal stability and liquidity measures from the RBI, the growth should recover, leading to double-digit earnings growth over the next two-three years. Given the current high valuations in the Indian market, do you see room for further upside? Where are the opportunities? Despite the current expensive valuations, we believe the Indian market still holds significant upside in the longer term. We are likely to see a return to double-digit earnings growth, driven by strong corporate balance sheets, robust asset quality in the banking sector and positive liquidity measures from the RBI. The credit growth, which was in the high teens last year, has come down to a high single-digit number now. While we might experience sideways movement in the near term, the structural factors supporting the economy make the market attractive for long-term investors. How is Tata Asset Management positioning its equity portfolios given the global uncertainties — geopolitical risks and rate movements? Given the global uncertainties, the markets have remained volatile. While the Indian market has had sideways movement and low returns over the past few quarters, we continue to see India as an attractive investment destination. This is because of the strength of the banking sector, the stability of corporate balance sheets and fiscal policy measures that are in place. The RBI has also been injecting a lot of liquidity into the system to propel credit growth, which was seeing some slowdown. Despite these short-term challenges, these structural factors support a long-term positive outlook. Have you observed any notable shifts in investor preferences — for example, increased appetite for passive funds or international exposure? The focus is on long-term market potential. Investors should consider India’s growth trajectory when making investment decisions, and with the attractiveness of India as an investment destination, we can assume there may be a growing appetite for exposure to Indian equity markets, including potentially through passive funds. Passive is becoming one of the choices for investors along with active funds. One of the funds you handle is pharma & healthcare... How do you see tariffs or threat of tariff from the US impacting this sector? How prepared are you? When one analyses the India pharma exports from the US perspective, India has a very strategic presence, with: the highest number of USFDA-approved plants in India, creating such a large eco-system can take multiple years; a large volume share in the US oral pharma market today — can be pegged anywhere between 60 and 75 per cent. But when we look at it from India’s perspective, Indian companies selling in the US market are not generating remarkably high ROE/ROCEs in their generic supplies, except for a few one-time opportunities, which may not last long. Hence, any significant pressure on the margins of Indian companies due to the tariff might push them to calibrate their US market strategy. In our pharma fund, we have moved towards higher exposure to healthcare names, given the comfort on growth and outlook. Pharma stocks, at the same time, have seen a decent run over the last year and the valuations are trading higher vs the long-term average. You largely handle sectoral themes. Throw some light on that. I manage diversified funds as well as a technology theme fund. The IT sector has seen a sharp correction over the last six months, due to concerns in the US economy. Enterprise in the US had cut on the discretionary spends since 2022 due to higher inflation, increasing interest rates and the fear of a slowdown in the macros in the US. These concerns are continuing due to the tariff uncertainties, leading to the third year of lower growth for the IT services companies. However, the correction has driven the valuation to a reasonable level, and the sector can see some re-rating if the growth outlook improves. From a sell-side analyst to buy-side, how is your transmission now? I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to work for esteemed organisations in the industry, both on the buy side as well as the sell side. A sell-side role helps you with building deep expertise in specific industries and sharpening analytical skills, while on the buy-side, it helps with adding more dimensions to these skills by looking at multiple sectors instead of focusing on any single industry. The buy-side industry also helps build critical thinking and decision-making capabilities. Published on July 10, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: JPMorgan Will Become Trillion-Dollar Company Amid Adoption of ‘Most Transformational Technology,’ According to TD Cowen – Here’s When
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/08/jpmorgan-will-become-trillion-dollar-company-amid-adoption-of-most-transformational-technology-according-to-td-cowen-heres-when/

The investment banking arm of TD Bank believes the market cap of JPMorgan will soar to $1 trillion as it leverages artificial intelligence (AI). In a new CNBC interview, TD Cowen bank analyst Steven Alexopoulos says investors are currently positioning in tech stocks to capture the upside potential of AI. The analyst notes that investors are likely underexposed to stocks that he thinks will rally once AI becomes widely adopted for commercial use. “When you think about where we are right now with AI, we’re at the builder level. The focus is Nvidia, the focus is OpenAI, the builders. I believe we’re inside of two years, maybe one, where the focus will widen out from the builders to who is going to use this technology to unlock massive economic value. That’s exactly what we saw on the internet. As the internet was being built, the focus was on Cisco, IBM, and as the layer was built, it moved to Google with search and Amazon selling commerce. When you think about the S&P 493… You need to focus on sectors that are reliant on people, knowledge workers, that is what will be disrupted by artificial intelligence.” According to the TD Cowen analyst, banks are poised to be major beneficiaries of AI advancements, with JPMorgan expected to lead the charge. Alexopoulos says that while JPMorgan’s head of consumer banking, Marianne Lake, expects the division’s headcount to decline by about 10% over the next five years, he believes that projection is conservative and anticipates a 20% reduction instead. According to Alexopoulos, JPMorgan’s growth will continue despite the significant drop in employee count. “[JPMorgan] is only richly valued relative to history, and that history did not include the most transformational technology of our lifetimes. Banks will break to a new valuation paradigm… By the end of next year, [JPMorgan] will be a trillion-dollar market-cap company.” As of Monday’s close, JPMorgan’s market cap stands at $811 billion.

Title: WOLF Stock To $20?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/08/wolf-stock-to-20/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. While Wolfspeed faces severe financial challenges, recent developments suggest a potential turnaround story that could deliver exceptional returns for risk-tolerant investors willing to bet on the company’s survival and recovery. The appointment of Gregor van Issum as CFO sparked immediate investor confidence, driving the stock price up 2x following the announcement. Van Issum brings substantial semiconductor industry experience from his previous roles at ams-OSRAM and NXP, two respected players in the sector. His track record suggests he understands the complexities of semiconductor operations and financial management. Now, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process has already delivered significant improvements to Wolfspeed’s financial structure. The company expects to eliminate nearly $4.6 billion in debt (70% reduction) and cut annual interest payments by 60%, dramatically improving its cost structure and cash flow dynamics. Wolfspeed operates in the silicon carbide semiconductor space, which offers superior energy efficiency compared to traditional silicon chips. This technology is increasingly critical for electric vehicle applications, positioning the company in a high-growth market segment. However, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than a single stock, you might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, garnering >91% returns since its inception. Additionally, check out – MSFT Stock To $1,000? If Wolfspeed successfully navigates its financial restructuring and executes its turnaround plan, the upside potential is substantial: The Wolfspeed turnaround story represents a classic high-risk, high-reward investment scenario. While the potential upside is substantial if the company successfully executes its restructuring and capitalizes on the growing silicon carbide market, the probability of success remains uncertain given the company’s operational challenges and competitive pressures. Investors considering this opportunity should view it as a speculative position suitable only for those who can absorb complete loss while recognizing that successful turnarounds in distressed technology companies can generate exceptional returns for those willing to accept the substantial risks involved. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Analyst Unveils Crypto Catalysts for ‘Jubilant July,’ Says Altcoins Will Likely ‘Cook’ for Next Few Weeks

A crypto strategist with a history of timely Bitcoin (BTC) calls believes that the digital asset market will flourish this month. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 868,800 followers on the social media platform X that he sees the crypto markets rallying this month amid a slew of bullish catalysts. “It’s the start of a new quarter and a new month. It’s also Jubilant July. I gotta say. I feel extremely refreshed for the first time in a long time with all the positives happening. Stablecoin legislation is moving forward. More rails are being connected with traditional finance, banks and consumers. Crypto will continue to grow as a focus in global markets. Let’s also not forget the fiscal and monetary tailwinds that are coming.” As for the fiscal tailwinds, the analyst says that the US is positioning to ease monetary policies to stimulate economic growth, while Bitcoin and US equities are in a strong uptrend. “If you’re bearish, consider this. The market has, for now, failed to prove a bullish bias to be incorrect. When there is FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), it V reverses into new highs each time. No matter how extreme the FUD. Market structure is intact on high time frames. BTC and stocks are at or around all-time highs. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing outgrowing its debt by spending more. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing lowering interest rates, which in this instance would likely stoke both inflation/growth. If the market proves these ideas to be incorrect, then you can pivot. I see no reason to be bearish on markets with this in mind.” Turning to altcoins, Pentoshi says he’s keeping a close eye on the OTHERS chart, which tracks the total market capitalization of crypto, excluding the 10 largest digital assets and stablecoins. The analyst predicts that OTHERS will soar close to $400 billion, indicating massive upside potential for altcoins. “I do think many alts will likely cook for the next few weeks. Just feels like… sellers have run out of momentum. Many of them look better than they have in quite some time. I think you could essentially use last week’s lows as a point we shouldn’t lose on most of these… I think we see others play out something like drawn below.” At time of writing, OTHERS is trading at $229 billion.
