Title: Sabotaging Bitcoin

I'm David Rosenthal, and this is a place to discuss the work I'm doing in Digital Preservation. In When the AI bubble pops, Nvidia becomes the most important software company overnight, Tobias Mann speculates about the aftermath of the AI crash, when the world will be awash in data centers full of Nvidia GPUs not doing AI. The sub-head is:"Want to survive the crash? Find another way to make money with GPUs"This leads me to wonder what the hash rate of a 1GW data center full of Nvidia's finest chips would be, and whether this might make the outsider attack feasible. Let's guess that they'd be half as efficient as Bitmain's, so you'd need 19 of these data centers. That's probably more than are going to get built before the crash, so the answer is no.

Title: Strategy stock bleeds as MSCI verdict nears – What next for MSTR?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/strategy-stock-bleeds-as-msci-verdict-nears-what-next-for-mstr/
Time Published: 2025-12-30T09:45:08Z
Full Content:
MSCI delisting fears and stock dilution drags MSTR lower. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, saw its stock drop to a fresh yearly low. Following a broader tech sell-off on the 29th of December, MSTR stock dropped by 2.15% to a record 2025 low of $155.32. From its 2024 high of $543, MSTR has crashed by 71%, presenting several Wall Street bears with a windfall opportunity. Although some bears began unwinding short positions in November to realize their gains, MSTR’s free fall did not slow down. At press time, the stock was back within the 2024 price range of $100-$180. Source: MSTR, TradingView One of the factors driving bearish sentiment over the past few weeks has been the risk of MSCI index delisting MSTR and other crypto treasury firms. Although the Strategy founder, Michael Saylor, has defended the firm as an operational company that should remain on the global index, prediction site Polymarket was pricing a +75% chance of delisting in early 2026. JPMorgan analysts warned that such a move would drive $8 billion in outflows from the stock. Some even speculated that the delisting would force liquidation of its Bitcoin holdings, but market expectations for such a BTC sell-off remained low. The MSCI decision in mid-January could offer the needed clarity for the stock’s next direction. Additionally, the ongoing dilution through MSTR stock sales to fund Bitcoin [BTC] purchases may have contributed to the stock’s pressure. According to analyst Novacula Occami, Strategy sold $4 billion worth of MSTR despite its BTC holdings trading below its enterprise value, or mNAV, being below 1. “Since that July announcement, they’ve issued $4.9 billion of $MSTR common with $4 billion of that issued at a common mNAV below 1 (in Nov and Dec).” Source: X The firm had earlier stated that it wouldn’t sell the common stock (MSTR) if the mNAV fell below 2.5x, then changed it to 1x. Overall, Strategy has spent $22.5 billion to buy Bitcoin in 2025. This was nearly half of its +$50 billion investment in BTC since 2020. Source: CryptoQuant This has been funded by MSTR and preferred stock sales, as well as debt. In fact, the latest $108 million BTC buy was wholly funded by MSTR stock sales. Strategy now owns 672,497 BTC. That said, despite the massive dump in 2025, Wall Street analysts were still bullish on MSTR stock. There were 13 buy ratings in the past month, with price targets ranging from $465 to $485, implying a 170%-200% upside potential.

Indian markets are poised for a stronger financial year, with improving macros, low inflation, and reviving earnings growth expected to drive equities. Investors are reallocating between assets, with a focus on bottom-up stock selection and sectoral tailwinds. Opportunities are seen in financials, industrials, and defensives, while rate-sensitive segments and CDMOs offer further potential. Overall, Sonthalia believes FY27 could reward disciplined investors who focus on valuations, sectoral tailwinds and bottom-up stock selection rather than chasing crowded themes.
