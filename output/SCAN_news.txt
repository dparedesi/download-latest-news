Title: College basketball rankings: Top 100 And 1 transfers to know entering the 2024-25 season

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Transfer rankings go out the door once everyone steps onto campus, but it's clear as day that the hits (and misses) from the bonkers 2024 portal cycle will make or break numerous clubs that have championship expectations. Let's dive into 100 and 1 transfers to know this season. Factors like talent (duh), fit into the new roster and the scheme that they will be playing were heavily weighed. Transfer from: Seton Hall Richmond might never be a knockdown catch-and-shoot sniper, but his positional size is a cheat card on both ends of the floor. St. John's has the bones of an excellent defensive club with Richmond's nastiness and versatility at the forefront. Richmond, a 6-foot-6, 205-pound bowling ball, put up enormous numbers (15.7 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 5.1 apg) in a slow-paced, Seton Hall system last season. Rick Pitino is going to ramp up the tempo to lightning-strike levels, so Richmond is in an eruption spot. Transfer from: Florida Atlantic From Derrick Rose to Rob Dillingham and numerous ballers in between, John Calipari annually hands the keys to a lead guard and lets 'em cook. That formula won't change in Arkansas. Davis is poised to be the Razorbacks' new alpha. The Florida Atlantic transfer is armed to score with every tool in the shed. Ball screens, post-ups, transition, drives or handoffs? You name it, Davis can get buckets with it. Transfer from: Drake The 6-7, 210-pound forward is an elite three-level scorer. DeVries is truly a big guard. He makes high-difficulty shots look way too easy from the midrange and downtown. DeVries' off-movement shooting sets up everything about his game. He's so big and can create space so effortlessly. But he can also use his frame as a bootyball weapon in post-ups. He didn't get to the rim a ton, but he shot over 67% when he got there. DeVries is just an all-around star who passes it well, rebounds well, plays defense and gets to the free throw line religiously. He was a star for his dad, Darian, at Drake. He'll be a star for his dad at West Virginia. Transfer from: Wisconsin Storr would carry Wisconsin and occasionally, shoot the Badgers out of games. He'd terrify both coaching staffs. But his strengths are so obvious. The big, explosive wing is a brutally tough cover when he gets the rock on an empty side, rips it and gets downhill. Storr can put anybody on a poster, even Mount Edey. Storr has the most juice of anybody in Kansas' wing corps. If Storr embraces cutting with a purpose, Bill Self could spoon-feed him four points a game with brilliant halfcourt sets. If he embraces running the floor hard in transition, that's another easy six points a game with Dajuan Harris or Hunter Dickinson whipping bullet, look-ahead passes. Storr could saunter to 20-point nights in this scheme without breaking a sweat. If it coalesces properly, Storr could be Kansas' best player and an All-American candidate. Transfer from: Duke Roach-to-Baylor is one of the rare high-floor, high-ceiling additions in the 2024 portal cycle. The Duke transfer will waltz into Baylor's starting lineup and give Scott Drew a veteran who has played a variety of roles over the years. He can be a go-to scorer. He can be an initiating point guard. He can be a spot-up shooter. Baylor is also getting the best version of Roach. He shot 43% from 3-point range, 40% on midrange jumpers and 56% at the rim last season. Baylor can lean on Roach to go create a bucket for himself or others in late-clock situations. Maybe most importantly, Roach doesn't block any of Baylor's talented freshmen. If intriguing freshman point guard Rob Wright III is ready to go, Roach can slide to an off-ball role. If five-star VJ Edgecombe is ready to be a freshman sensation, Roach can shift to a secondary role, but Roach is a sleeper Big 12 Player of the Year candidate in this scheme. Transfer from: Indiana State Few bigs are as skilled as Avila. The former Indiana State star smartly stuck with his guy, Josh Schertz, who took the Saint Louis job. Schertz helped turn Avila into a star, and the duo should be up to their old tricks again in the Atlantic 10. Avila has established himself as one of the best small-ball bigs in the country. His skill is off the charts, both as a passer, low-post threat and a true floor-stretching big man. Saint Louis smartly added athletic forwards like Kalu Anya and AJ Casey to cover up some of Avila's deficiencies on the defensive end. He's not a shot-blocker, but Avila is a cheat code offensively, so that makes up for it. Cue the Cream Abdul-Jabbar or Larry Nerd jokes. Transfer from: Miami Playing with a ridiculous motor can make up for a lot. Omier, a 6-7, 240-pound forward, doesn't have elite height, but he plays so hard. Omier has turned himself into one of the best players in the country. Omier eats rebounds for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He will sprint the floor whether he's getting the ball or not. He sets good screens and plays with toughness and physicality. The little stuff is a constant. The intangibles are glorious. But Omier added an extra layer to his game with his 3-ball. Omier shot 35% on 68 attempts from downtown last season. Omier at the 5 will be a cheat code for a Baylor offense that didn't need much help. Five-shooter lineups will be a staple and the paint will be cleared for Baylor's guards to get to the tin. Baylor's offense has been awesome without a five-out option. Now it has one. Look out. Transfer from: Illinois Kansas State paid up to win the Coleman Hawkins sweepstakes, and Jerome Tang's next priority is getting the Dug McDaniel-Hawkins, pick-and-pop game humming right away. McDaniels' speed and Hawkins' deep range should open the floor up for Kansas State's offense, but Hawkins, the creator, might be more important than Hawkins, the shooter. His ability to carve up defenses as a passer and a handler will be a wrinkle that few other big men possess. Tang is also one of the best defensive coaches in the sport, and a now-healthy Hawkins gives Tang so much lineup versatility because he can switch onto guards and pester big wings. Hawkins has some of the best hands in the country. He should be a deflection machine for a K-State defense that usually wants to take the ball away. Transfer from: Utah State Danny Sprinkle is bringing Osobor with him again to a new job. This time with way more fanfare and a whole lot more NIL money. Osobor is one of the best small-ball centers in the portal who may have to downshift to the 4 if Franck Kepnang can ever get healthy. You would feel that duo. Osobor can play with anybody thanks to his rim pressure and playmaking. He flirted with some triple-doubles last season at Utah State, and Washington will need him to make great decisions if it wants to compete in a gauntlet of a Big Ten. There's optimism that Osobor can expand his jumper out to the perimeter but that hasn't happened yet. He's a career 64% free throw shooter. Sprinkle would be overjoyed if he can crack the 70% range because he could lead the Big Ten in free throw attempts next season. Transfer from: Washington State Indiana's pitiful pick-and-roll offense needed a life raft, and Rice will team up with Stanford transfer Kanaan Carlyle to be the solution. The vibrant point guard waltzes into a new-look backcourt with a real chance to be The Man. Rice is a jitterbug with the ball in his hands. An explosive first step helps Rice navigate into the paint left and right. Washington State played two non-shooting bigs so often last season, so IU's crowded paint won't be anything new to Rice. He's a capable shooter but he wasn't efficient last season because he was often Washington State's late-clock, bail-out guy. He makes up for it with a barrage of finishes and proficient reads in the ball-screen game. Rice is also an awesome point-of-attack defender who more than held his own for a Washington State defense that finished second in the Pac-12 in league play. Rice, simply, refuses to get screened. That's a skill. Rice can be a first-team, All-Big Ten player next season. Transfer from: Tennessee Aidoo was one of the few no-brainers in the portal. Aidoo is a plug-and-play big man who can do it all. He can protect the rim, uncork soft-touch jumpers, post up, run the floor, pass a little bit and convert his free throws. There's just so much to like about his game, and the table is set for Aidoo to be a top-two option at Arkansas. He'll be the outlet for Arkansas' electric backcourt. If his engine is revving non-stop, Aidoo can be one of the best big men in the country. Transfer from: Rutgers Alabama's rim defense went from a major strength in 2022-23 to a major weakness last season. Omoruyi's presence should single-handedly make Alabama a vicious rim defense again. The Rutgers transfer is an excellent drop-coverage defender who has an insane wingspan that he uses on both ends. The offensive ecosystem at Alabama is so much better than it was last season at Rutgers. Omoruyi as a legit lob threat who can loom in the dunker spot will be more effective than heavy post-up reps. Omoruyi is also one of the best raw athletes in the country. His dunks will shake the rim for days. Transfer from: USC Johnson is expected to be a massive piece of this UCLA team. He's one of the best all-around defenders in the country, and under Mick Cronin's guidance, he could transform into a Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year frontrunner. Playing with a point guard like Isaiah Collier was supposed to help Johnson's offensive game, but he regressed big-time as a shooter. There's still plenty of reason for cautious optimism of a bounceback in that regard. Johnson's slashing and defense give him such a high floor. He doesn't have to be a star for the Bruins, but fresh scenery could unlock his full bag. Johnson-to-UCLA is pound-for-pound as good a fit as anyone in the portal. Transfer from: Duke Mitchell was a piece for Duke, but he will be the piece for Mizzou. It's an excellent bet by both sides. Mitchell could give Dennis Gates a Kobe Brown-like, jumbo initiator who can be the centerpiece of an offense. His drives can be nasty, especially when an opposing center is guarding him. A top dawg role at Missouri should help him play with more confidence and assertiveness, two attributes that started to dissipate at Duke down the stretch. Mitchell can be a terrific two-way piece for the Tigers, and he's positioned to put up career-best numbers in his new home. Transfer from: BYU A hint of familiarity is just so huge for a new coach. Robinson had a breakout season under Mark Pope at BYU, and he smartly chose to run it back. This time he'll don the Kentucky threads. Robinson demands so much attention because he's a legit 6-7 shooter who never stops moving and can elevate over just about every defender. Robinson was also one of the top transition scorers in college basketball last season, despite only shooting 28% on his transition 3s. Some positive regression is coming in that department. As he continues to grow as an on-ball creator, Robinson's game will reach new heights. But he's a darn good college basketball player right now and could lead the SEC in 3-point shooting. .@Robinsonjaxx starting off HOT 🔥🥵19 PTS (7-12 FG, 5-9 3FG) | 3 REB pic.twitter.com/5l5Z9dGPFn Transfer from: Saint Mary's Mahaney is the only player on this UConn roster who has been the No. 1 option on the scouting report in college. That'll be invaluable. The 6-foot-3 junior guard has all the qualities that Hurley wants. He's tough. He's a winner. He's reliable. He's smart. Oh, and he can shoot it. Mahaney shot 38% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers as a sophomore and 46% as a freshman. Per Synergy, no high-major team generated a higher percentage of open catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season than … UConn. Mahaney should fit like a glove in this backcourt, and he's a killer in late-clock scenarios. UConn should maximize his strengths and cover up the warts in his game. Transfer from: East Carolina Small and DeVries give West Virginia a 1-2 punch that can play with anybody. Small was one of the top pick-and-roll scorers in the portal, but playing next to a stud scorer like DeVries should open up more spot-up opportunities for Small. That should be money in the bank. Small was a bad catch-and-shoot weapon at East Carolina, but he worked tirelessly to make it a strength. He splashed 47% of his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season at Oklahoma State. Small was a good No. 1 option for Oklahoma State last season. He should be a great No. 2 option for WVU in 2024-25. Transfer from: Indiana State Xavier scored the fifth-most points off handoffs last season, per Synergy. It added one of the best shooters in the portal who excelled on … handoffs. Only 15 players in the country made more 3-pointers off handoffs than Conwell last season. Conwell's shot profile is all 3-pointers or stuff at the rim. Conwell splashed over 42% of his catch-and-shoot triples and also shot over 62% at the rim. He was one of the best shooting guards in the country last season, and he's going to a scheme that excels at letting snipers cook. Conwell only has one season under his belt where he was a plus-shooter, but if that sticks (as expected), he can be one of the best players in the Big East. Transfer from: FAU New Michigan coach Dusty May did not get his entire FAU band to follow him to Michigan, but he did land maybe the most important one. Goldin can be one of the Big Ten's best big men next season. He's a complete load in the paint, but his improved mobility and touch around the basket has helped him become a much better target in the ball-screen game. Goldin isn't super fluid but he's so powerful. When he stays under control, he's a monster. Goldin is not some Nikola Jokic-like distributor, but he'll make the simple reads if he's doubled or on the short roll. He has real high-major size, so Michigan can play him one-on-one against just about anybody defensively. Goldin should be highly productive at Michigan. Transfer from: Arizona Indiana's rebounding was not a strength last season, but Ballo can single-handedly raise that floor significantly. The 7-foot, 260-pound center is impossible to move, and he's become one of the best rebounders in the sport, period. Ballo is an outstanding play-finisher in pick-and-rolls and should set bone-crushing screens for IU's ball-handlers. Ballo will seal his man and finish in the paint efficiently with post-ups. He also offers a solid interior defense. Arizona's top-10 defense was fantastic with Ballo on the floor, but he's pretty much limited to just drop coverage and teams will try to exploit that. Big men like Ballo are usually a cheat code for regular-season success, but he needs to get fully healthy. THE POWER. 😤@OumarBallo32 | #IUBB pic.twitter.com/oRjMj5nEgH Transfer from: Michigan No one scored more points in pick-and-rolls last season than McDaniel. Now, he's headed to the Octagon of Doom where short kings like Markquis Nowell (and Tylor Perry to a lesser extent) have put up numbers. McDaniel has legit defensive questions, but he's such a tough cover due to his speed, deep jumper and nifty floater. Kansas State's funkily-built roster is dependent on McDaniel being a superstar. His usage rate should be ridiculously high. He will put up numbers. Will it impact winning? Transfer from: Utah Smith's speed, competitiveness, defense and court vision should be everything Pitino craves from his point guards. The fit between Richmond and Smith has been questioned from the start. Both high-usage guards aren't high-volume, 3-point shooters. But Richmond is more of a halfcourt hub and Smith is awesome in transition. That push-pull should add some diversity to St. John's profile. Smith's ability to bend defenses and create long closeouts for Richmond to attack is the way for this duo to thrive together. Transfer from: Virginia Tech Pedulla is just an all-around great player. The 6-1 guard is a flamethrower shooter who gets to the free-throw line and is very unselfish. His efficiency numbers might have been better without numerous late-clock heaves that litter his Virginia Tech tape, but Pedulla is a real three-level scorer. He quickly assimilated to various roles at Virginia Tech, and that should pop up in a more-talented Ole Miss roster. If Ole Miss needs Pedulla to score, he will. If Ole Miss needs Pedulla to be a pass-first guy on some night, he'll do that, too. Pedulla's ability to play on or off the ball gives Chris Beard real flexibility with his lineup construction blueprints. Transfer from: New Mexico Texas Tech is a haven for former Mountain West Freshman of the Year winners. Last season, it was Darrion Williams. This year, it's Toppin. The 6-foot-9, 210-pound big man should slot in as Texas Tech's starting 4-man, and he can be one of the most impactful defenders on the roster. Toppin can slide those puppies on the perimeter while offering legitimate rim protection. Toppin was a stocks (steals and blocks) machine last season at New Mexico, and he's a junkyard dawg on the glass. Toppin has to grow as a shooter, both from downtown and from the free throw line, but Elijah Hawkins should generate so many open looks for Toppin to eat around the rim. Transfer from: Xavier Claude is the best addition for new USC coach Eric Musselman. The 6-foot-6, 207-pound guard will be the No. 1 option for this Trojans' club. Claude will be an impact defender from the jump, but USC will rely on him to be a late-game closer, too. Claude has outstanding positional size, and Xavier put him in a ton of ball screens. Expect more of the same at USC. Claude should take another step as a shooter which could help him become a true three-level scorer. If that happens, he can be one of the best players in the Big Ten. Don't be stunned if he flirts with some triple-doubles eventually. Jumbo-sized initiators have thrived under Musselman in the past. Claude is up next. Transfer from: South Florida The fifth-year senior is an utter deadeye on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. Youngblood drained 40% of his treys for three straight years. Why would that change next year in one of the best offensive systems in the country? But Youngblood shouldn't be painted as just a specialist. The South Florida transfer was well-coached into a well-rounded hooper. He's a broad-shouldered, thick veteran who isn't afraid to post up against smaller guards and rack up fouls. It's a good strategy when you're a career 82% free throw shooter. His pull-up jumper is so, so silky. Youngblood-to-Alabama is one of the best fits in the transfer portal. Transfer from: Harvard Mack is a shifty point guard who can break down defenses left and right and uncork two-handed, frozen ropes or one-handed, live-dribble whips to shooters. The sophomore's playmaking is why he's the jewel of this Georgetown transfer haul. Mack has all the physical tools to be one of the better point guards in the Big East. Transfer from: North Florida Lanier was one of the coveted guards in this transfer cycle because of his silky-smooth jumper that he can get to off the catch or off the bounce. His mechanics are a little funky. Sometimes his knees nearly touch the basketball on his gather and load, but he's able to get it off. Tennessee will likely play him off the ball and run him off a ton of floppy actions for 3-pointers, similar to what it did with Dalton Knecht. Tennessee's horde of nasty defenders should cover up some of Lanier's perceived deficiencies on that end. Transfer from: Oklahoma Uzan is a plug-and-play starting point guard for Kelvin Sampson who will provide an outstanding feel for the game and get the ball where it needs to go. Uzan finished with a two-to-one, assist-to-turnover ratio last season, but it can be way better at Houston. Uzan has loads of outstanding play-finishers that he can find along with two absolute net-shredders like LJ Cryer and Emanuel Sharp to keep the floor spaced properly. Uzan can manipulate the defense and find cutters or shooters at the very last second, and he's a willing, active defender. The jumper will be the swing skill set. Uzan can shoot it. He proved that as a freshman when he shot over 38% from downtown in Big 12 play. But he regressed last season. If he can get back to the mid-to-high 30s to go along with his fabulous floater, terrific court-mapping and well-rounded defense, Uzan can be a massive piece for a Houston club that has its sights set on a national championship run. Transfer from: Belmont Tyson was such a necessary addition to a UNC offense that so badly needed a big, rangy shooter. Tyson does not create much offense for himself off the bounce, but that could be another wrinkle to add to his game this offseason. Being able to attack smaller matchups with post-ups (similar to what Harrison Ingram did) would be a huge boost for Tyson's NBA stock. At minimum, Tyson is a plug-and-play sniper who was efficient from downtown, the midrange and at the rim, but Tyson is far from a finished product. Transfer from: James Madison Edwards should make everything easier for Louisville's rebuild. The James Madison veteran transfer is a true two-way player who was asked to do a little bit of everything. Edwards owned one of the highest pick-and-roll usages last season, and he's got lots of counters in his bag. He owns a tight spin move to get to the rim or to his soft-touch floater. Edwards has grown a ton as a shooter, but he's still at his best when he hits attack mode and seeks out the creases. Edwards is slated to earn a heavy usage rate when he's on the floor, and Louisville's decision to load up on big men who can stretch the floor should open the paint for Edwards' defense-bending drives. Transfer from: Ohio State Gayle has a real shot at being the jewel of Michigan's transfer haul. Gayle has all the qualities of a pass-dribble-shoot guard who also happens to be hellacious defensively. Being able to attack space off the bounce is essential in May's drive-and-kick offense. Gayle does all of that. He shot over 60% at the rim on enormous volume. Nearly 43% of Gayle's shot attempts were at the rim last season. He is a walking paint touch, and Gayle should continue to be a staple at the free throw line. Gayle's 3-point jumper is streaky and the mechanics are a bit iffy at times. But it's not unsolvable. There's All-Big Ten upside here one day with room for even more. 🪣🪣 pic.twitter.com/5L00SQVAnV Transfer from: Arizona Boswell, a Champaign native, is coming home to adopt the biggest role of his career. Boswell had an 18% usage rate last season at Arizona. He could sniff the 25% range at Illinois. Underwood pitched Boswell on an expanded offensive role, but Illinois certainly needs Boswell to buff up its perimeter defense. When dialed in, Boswell can be a difference-maker at the point of attack. Illinois landed prized international freshman Kasparas Jakucionis to handle most of the true point guard reps, which should allow Boswell to slide into a score-first, off-ball role. Boswell is a knockdown 3-point sniper, but he did not get to the rim often last season and barely shot any free throws. Attacking the rim is a massive priority for Underwood. It has to be a point of emphasis for Boswell. Transfer from: Alabama Griffen shot over 39% on 146 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season at Alabama. He's exactly the type of sidekick this Kansas roster needed to accentuate Hunter Dickinson and Dajuan Harris. But he's so much more than just a shooter. Griffen is a comfortable secondary handler who flashed pockets of nifty decision-making. Griffen could be an elite 3-and-D wing once the D catches up to the 3-point shooting. He's shown flashes on that end, but it's time to level up. Kansas is banking on it. Transfer from: Oklahoma McCollum is a stud. He was one of the top pick-and-roll scorers in the country last season for an undermanned Oklahoma club. McCollum is so dynamic off the bounce, and he can operate as Georgia Tech's lead guard or as a spot-up assassin next to emerging sophomore Nait George. McCollum's 31% 3-point mark is a bit deceiving. McCollum often had to operate as Oklahoma's late-clock, bail-us-out option. He shot just 4-for-24 on 3-pointers with less than four seconds left on the shot clock. McCollum can be one of the best offensive guards in the ACC with a few subtle tweaks in his game. Transfer from: Texas Tech Greg McDermott has a long history of maximizing his best offensive players. Isaacs should be up next to jump on Creighton's jetpack joy ride. Isaacs' jumper last season was hit-or-miss, partially due to a hip injury and some iffy shot selection. But he's fearless and hard to contain off the bounce. Isaacs shot just 43% at the rim as a freshman, but that improved slightly to 48% last season. Is another spike coming? Isaacs will be Creighton's best late-clock option and his pick-and-roll chemistry with Kalkbrenner should be on full display. Isaacs is an easy pick to lead this Bluejays team in scoring. Transfer from: Oregon State Bilodeau is a huge get for a UCLA offense that needed fixin' in the worst way. UCLA was one of the worst layup-shooting teams in the country last season. Bilodeau was automatic around the rim. He finished with the sixth-highest offensive efficiency rating in Pac-12 play, per KenPom. He shot over 71% at the rim, and he's a legitimate floor-spacer. Bilodeau should give point guard Dylan Andrews his first real pick-and-pop threat. He's such a big offensive upgrade over what UCLA trotted out last season in its frontcourt, but Cronin will demand more out of him defensively. Transfer from: Kentucky Wagner was outshined by Reed Sheppard and Rob Dillingham at Kentucky, but his freshman year wasn't nearly as bad as some would lead you to believe. Wagner is good, and he can put opposing perimeter defenders in hell with his drives. Wagner is excellent at attacking the top foot and getting his defender off balance. The drives were impactful but Wagner has to improve finishing around the rim. That's arguably more important than continuing to progress as a shooter. Arkansas should give Wagner the runway to be a huge piece of this backcourt, but there are questions about his fit next to ball-dominant guards like Davis and freshman Boogie Fland. Maybe last season's experience next to Sheppard, Dillingham and Antonio Reeves will help Wagner find the sweet spot at Arkansas. Transfer from: Miami Poplar is really good at what he does. The 6-5 guard is a proven, high-level shooter who splashed over 37% of his treys in each of the past two seasons. He's also capable of attacking the rack with a vengeance for some monster posters, and Poplar will stick his face in the fan on the glass. He's been a productive role player, but Poplar transferred to Villanova to show he can be more than just a spot-up guard. Poplar wants the ball in his hands as a primary initiator, and Villanova's backcourt needs a star. Poplar believes it's his turn to prove that he can be that alpha once and for all. Transfer from: Texas It's been a struggle for Hunter to stay consistent offensively, but at his best, he's still one of the premier on-ball defenders in the game. Hunter is the closest thing to a true, set-the-table point guard of this new-look Tigers bunch, but his experience playing both on and off the ball at Texas should pay off next to new running mate PJ Haggerty. Memphis certainly needs Hunter's 3-point jumper to stick to open up extra space for Haggerty's drives. Hunter has shot over 36% from downtown in conference play in back-to-back seasons. Hunter should be unleashed to be in the hunt for First Team All-AAC honors. Transfer from: Wisconsin Hepburn is so much better when he doesn't have to be a go-to scorer. When Hepburn can unleash extra energy on defense, his value elevates. The Wisconsin transfer was well-schooled on the defensive end under Greg Gard, and he projects to be one of the best on-ball defenders in the ACC while giving Louisville's offense a steady hand. Hepburn is a career 36% 3-point shooter who makes great decisions and can go for 20 on nights when he has the right matchup. But the veteran point guard hits the floor trying to make others better. Pat Kelsey's high-tempo system could unlock the best version of Hepburn. Transfer from: Minnesota Hawkins is one of the top initiator point guards in the country, and this was a fantastic coup for Texas Tech's new-look backcourt. The Minnesota transfer will be the table-setter for Toppin's buckets around the rim and the 3s from Chance McMillian and Kerwin Walton. He will have the keys to this Texas Tech offense, and Hawkins deserves that opportunity. Hawkins throws exceptional lobs and he's so easy to play with. Hawkins also shot over 38% from downtown on over four attempts per game during Big Ten play, so you can't go under every screen. That opens up more space in the ball-screen game. Hawkins is only 5-foot-11 and 165 pounds, so he's an easy target for opposing offenses, but Texas Tech has insulated him with sturdy perimeter defenders to cover up some of his weaknesses on that end. Transfer from: Furman Pegues is a killer. He will take and make tough shots, and that type of guard is exactly what Auburn needed in the portal. Pegues played a variety of roles at Furman, first as a spot-up guy playing off Mike Bothwell and Jalen Slawson and then as a lead guard who had to initiate everything. That experience and variety should pay off right away for the Tigers. His nifty drives, pure jumper and smart playmaking give Pegues a chance to be Auburn's No. 2 option behind Johni Broome from the jump. Big fan of defense ➡️ offense plays pic.twitter.com/w7FMzFDSxU Transfer from: Georgia Tech Auburn's offense could bog down in late-clock situations last season, but it addressed that issue with Pegues and Kelly. At Georgia Tech, Kelly had to be a high-usage scorer who took tough shots. At Auburn, he'll have to embrace a lower-usage role with the benefit of much cleaner looks. Don't be fooled by the percentages, Kelly is a dynamic shooter and he can hit some tough stepbacks against even the best defense. Auburn coach Bruce Pearl has raved about Kelly often this season, often describing him as one of the best shooters he's ever had. Transfer from: South Carolina Johnson was a top-of-the-scouting report killer for South Carolina last season. He had a ton of responsibilities on his plate offensively. That experience should reap benefits in Round II at Ohio State. Johnson should slide right next to Bruce Thornton and form one of the top bucket-getting guard duos in the league next season. Johnson was the best version of himself at South Carolina with a pick-and-pop big man like BJ Mack. That's still an unproven question for Ohio State's frontcourt. But there's no doubt Johnson's drives are impactful. That first step is nasty. He'll be productive in his return to Ohio State. Transfer from: Eastern Washington Remember when Great Osobor followed his coach, Danny Sprinkle, from Montana State to Utah State and became a household name? Something similar could happen with Coward who followed David Riley from Eastern Washington to Washington State. The 6-foot-6, 205-pound wing is on NBA radars thanks to his versatility. Riley smartly uses Coward like the queen on the chess board, posting him up against smaller matchups or letting him stretch the floor and bend defenses with his drives. Coward shot 75% at the rim and 40% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. That'll play. He's a two-way player, too. Coward should get way more exposure in the WCC. Transfer from: Belmont All of Gillespie's advanced offensive stats last season at Belmont were terrific. Gillespie was extremely efficient from 3-point range, and he shot nearly 70% at the rim in halfcourt settings. That's nuts for a 6-foot-1 point guard. The question is whether all of that efficiency will translate against high-major opponents. Maryland is banking on it. Gillespie does not have to be Jahmir Young 2.0, but he'll get the first crack at replacing the Terps' All-Big Ten guard. Gillespie's dribble-handoff game with skilled five-star big man Derik Queen should be terrific. Transfer from: UNC Wilmington TCU coach Jamie Dixon has leaned into a heavy-transition offense the last few years, and White can help keep that train rolling. The slashing wing is a good, low-volume shooter, but he's just an awesome driver who constantly breaks down defenses and gets to the paint. He's so wiry and tough to stay in front of. History says you can find productive transfer-up targets from the CAA ranks, and White is up next. He's one of the best wing-handlers in the portal, and White can be one of TCU's better defenders from the jump. He doesn't check off quite as many boxes as Emanuel Miller, but White should replace a bunch of that production. Transfer from: Arkansas Mark was one of the top isolation scorers in the country last season. Mark shot over 70% at the rim and drew nearly five fouls per 40 minutes. He's constantly putting pressure on the defense with his drives and a midrange jumper he can comfortably get to whenever. He shot a career-best 36% from 3-point range for Arkansas, but it was on a bit lower volume (3.2 attempts per game). Mark should be one of Texas' best two-way players, and he might earn that closer role. Transfer from: Evansville Humrichous was one of the most impactful players in the country last season. Evansville was competent with Humrichous on the floor (+3.6 net rating) and a complete dumpster fire without him (-16.8 net rating). Illinois wants at least four shooters on the floor at all times, and that's Humrichous' game. Humrichous shot 42% on 142 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. The 6-foot-9 forward can fire over just about anybody. Humrichous also owns real wiggle off the bounce. If the right matchup presents itself, Illinois will be comfortable giving Humrichous the green light to go to work one-on-one to get to his fadeaway, midrange jumper. Humrichous is easily one of the top stretch forwards in the portal, and there weren't many of them in the free agency pool. Transfer from: Saint Mary's Saint Mary's defense was impenetrable when Jefferson was on the floor. Now, he heads to Iowa State to be a key cog for another elite defense. He'll guard those rangy forwards in the Big 12 that Milan Momcilovic would've had issues with. Jefferson's playmaking, defense and rebounding give him such a high floor. Iowa State can use him to back down good matchups from the slot, and he's a willing passer who can spray it and create advantages for drivers like Keshon Gilbert or shooters like Momcilovic, Tamin Lipsey or Curtis Jones. Jefferson is easily one of the most talented forwards T.J. Otzelberger has coached at Iowa State, and if the jumper continues to improve, he will leap into a new tier. Transfer from: Ohio State Richmond and Smith are the big-name gets for St. John's, but Scott is such a stud. There was a real shortage of stretch 4s in the portal, but St. John's landed one of the best out there. Scott shot over 37% on 115 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season, and he is very comfortable getting into his post-ups from the slot. Plus, Scott projects to be an outstanding multi-positional defender. His floor spacing will be invaluable for St. John's. He might never sit. Transfer from: Pepperdine Everyone is looking for forwards as well-rounded as Ajayi. Gonzaga scooped him up quickly, and it was super familiar with his game after he tangled with the Zags often during his Pepperdine days. Ajayi should get the first crack at replacing versatile stud Anton Watson. Ajayi is more of a wing-handler who can play on the perimeter thanks to his gorgeous stroke and ability to attack long closeouts, but he's got a proven knack for rebounding. Gonzaga can use him in post-ups, as a popper in pick-and-rolls or even as the initiator for some ball-screen reps. Ajayi should be a high-level connector for a Gonzaga squad that has National Championship aspirations. Transfer from: Northern Colorado Saint Thomas balled out in the Dalton Knecht role at Northern Colorado. He's a big, physical wing who shot over 67% at the rim last season. That efficiency might come down in the Big Ten, but that aggressiveness has to be maintained. Thomas should settle right into a No. 1B option behind Claude. He'll have a high usage rate, and USC can use him as a post-up weapon or in ball screens. Thomas could also be featured as USC's pseudo-point guard, but his growth as a catch-and-shoot weapon is key. Transfer from: Virginia Tech The 6-10 big man should give Miami's defense some much-needed size on the back line. Kidd's best asset is his low-post dominance. Kidd was one of the top post-up scorers in college basketball last season and he has great hands in the pick-and-roll. Miami smartly added East Carolina transfer sniper Brandon Johnson to this frontcourt to make it even harder to send another big to double-team Kidd. Miami just has a cavalry of shooting surrounding Kidd. Transfer from: Drexel Skilled size is everything for Mark Pope's offense, and a center who can be a playmaker on the perimeter is vital. Williams is not a 3-point shooter, but he can clear open space with screens and dribble hand-offs. He's also an adept passer who had a 17% assist rate this past season at Drexel. Kentucky will also rely heavily on Williams to protect the rim and scoop up boards. The 6-foot-10, 265-pound big man has enough bricks in his britches to handle one-on-one coverage against just about any big man, so Kentucky won't have to send double teams. Playing with incoming sophomore Brandon Garrison might be a blessing in disguise for Williams. Kentucky can keep him fresh, out of foul trouble and his motor should be revving for the 20-to-25 minutes he's on the floor. Seven foot playmaker 🦄12 PTS (5-6 FG) | 6 AST | 5 REB pic.twitter.com/QH3oEW0oR7 Transfer from: Louisville \Huntley-Hatfield is the jewel of the NC State transfer haul. Huntley-Hatfield's tape was impressive amidst a rocky Louisville campaign. He became a double-double threat every night and played with outstanding effort. He's 6-foot-10 and 240 pounds with the ability to play multiple defensive coverages, and Huntley-Hatfield should continue to grow as a floor-stretcher. There's no reason to think he won't be a productive monster for NC State who knows how to feature its big men. Transfer from: Kentucky Bradshaw might make or break Ohio State. If his production matches his potential, the Buckeyes could be one of the best teams in the Big Ten. Bradshaw's ability to stretch the floor would open up the paint for Johnson and Thornton to get to the rack. The former five-star, 7-1 center was also regarded as a big-time rim protector during his high school days. Ohio State is banking on a Kel'el Ware-like bounceback season in a new place with a full bill of health. Transfer from: Tulsa Haggerty is a lean, mean, foul-drawing machine. The Tulsa transfer can put a ton of pressure on the rim, and his floater is a real weapon. And he pitches a tent, starts a fire and calls the free throw line home. Haggerty shot double-digit free throws in 15 games last season. That's a skill. Penny Hardaway needs Haggerty to shoot it better from downtown and find a way to impact winning without super high volume. Haggerty owned a 30% usage rate last season at Tulsa. It was his team. Memphis is loaded with talent. Haggerty's usage might not sniff 30% with Tyrese Hunter, Dain Dainja and Colby Rogers all needing to get theirs. But Haggerty's a heckuva talent who can be one of the engines of this club. Transfer from: FAU Martin is a big, physical 2-guard who will hunt his jumper and is a menace in transition. Martin struggled with injuries a bit last season, but if he's back to full strength, Florida was a smart landing spot for both sides. Florida coach Todd Golden is likely banking on Martin being the Gators' best perimeter defender. Martin gets in some trouble when he tries to create his own offense, but he's awesome in transition, an area that Florida heavily prioritizes. Transfer from: Michigan State Hoggard's strengths are obvious. Hoggard is a very good defender who can lock down just about any perimeter option. He's a terrific playmaker who nearly racked up a 3-to-1, assist-to-turnover ratio this past season. Hoggard shot a serviceable 35% from 3-point range last season, but his issues offensively came inside the arc. For a big, strong guard, Hoggard struggled mightily to finish around the rim and his pull-up jumper went off the rails. Hoggard shot just 5-for-42 on those pull-ups. That almost feels too bad to replicate. Positive regression seems inevitable. Transfer from: South Dakota State Mayo is just a bucket, but his shots will come in different spots at Kansas than they did at South Dakota State. Mayo is expected to move into more of an off-ball role which should unlock more catch-and-shoot opportunities. Mayo drilled 43% of his 96 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season. Oh, and Mayo is a midrange maestro. That ability to go get a bucket should be a huge stress reliever for a KU offense that needed an extra jolt. Mayo is probably closer to a two-level scorer than a true three-level scorer, but his comfort as a primary scorer/creator at South Dakota State should help him ace a slightly scaled-down role for Kansas. We could get used to this 🎯#Payheed x @zekexmayo pic.twitter.com/RI8yundO7m Transfer from: Villanova Oregon crushed it in the portal and it starts with Bamba. The Villanova transfer is good at a little bit of everything. He shot over 43% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season and he can smartly attack long closeouts. Bamba is capable of handling some on-ball responsibilities as well, and he'll be an impactful defender for the Ducks. Bamba is a plug-and-play, two-way starter who should be a double-digit performer, at minimum. Transfer from: Stanford Stojakovic has excellent bloodlines and needed a fresh start after a rough freshman-year showing at Stanford. The flashes of brilliance were there as an off-ball sniper who is an excellent cutter and can smoothly drive it. When he played with confidence (check the USC film), Stojakovic was a baller. But the dark days were grim. The odds are strong that Stojakovic is going to be a really, really good player one day, but he has to clean up the mechanics on his jumper and continue to improve his body. Similar to Jaylon Tyson, Stojakovic made a wise choice in the portal to go somewhere where he can earn a high usage rate and have the ball in his hands from the jump. Transfer from: Oakland Good things happen when you pair a smart player like Townsend with a smart coach like Tommy Lloyd. The 6-6, 228-pound forward isn't a stretch 4 (he's made 50 3-pointers in 126 games), but he's closer to a wing handler who can constantly create advantages. He's in that Jaime Jaquez-lite mold as an excellent post-up weapon, good cutter, smart decision-maker who will not hurt you. Arizona ranked outside the top-60 nationally in points per possession in halfcourt settings, per Synergy. Not bad, but not great, either. An elite transition offense helped Arizona finish No. 11 overall in offensive efficiency, but there were real pockets when Arizona's offense could get bogged down. Townsend might be part of the solution. Townsend provides another halfcourt hub who can win one-on-one matchups and get to the free throw line. Transfer from: Ohio State Opponents shot just 54% at the rim against Ohio State when Okpara was on the floor. His length, court coverage and rim presence are extremely valuable. Okpara is a willing role player who is an excellent lob threat in pick-and-rolls, but he's not a center you want to run your offense through. Okpara still has work to do to become a reliable post-up scorer, but he should team up well with Zakai Zeigler's pinpoint lobs. Transfer from: Iowa Perkins has been a staple in Iowa's rotation for three years but the leap into being a legitimate First Team, All-Big Ten guy never truly materialized. But the 6-4, 205-pound guard is the most proven piece on this Mizzou roster. He's a very good scorer at two levels. Perkins loves to get to the middle of the floor for a midrange jumper. He's also constantly putting pressure on the rim and getting to the free throw line. Nearly 40% of his shots last season came at the rim, per Synergy, and he averaged over five free throw attempts per game in Big Ten play. His decision-making overall really grew which is encouraging. Perkins finished with a 2.4-to-1, assist-to-turnover ratio. That'll work every single day of the week and twice on Sundays. Transfer from: Kansas State When Kaluma keeps it simple, he can be effective. Kaluma shot a career-best 36% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season at Kansas State. The 6-foot-7, 225-pound wing is a willing rebounder and has been part of good defenses both at Kansas State and Creighton. Kaluma can be an impactful piece when he attacks straight-line drives, drills spot-up 3s and hunts buckets in transition before the defense gets set. But he gets in so much trouble when he tries to be a top of the scouting report creator. Kaluma had a dreadful, negative assist-to-turnover ratio. He takes tough shots off the dribble and doesn't make 'em. He's yet to record an above-average offensive rating in conference play in each of the last three years. The flashes are there, but eliminating the negative plays will be so important. Transfer from: North Texas Edwards is a bucket. He was the high-usage engine of North Texas' offense, and Edwards finished with fantastic efficiency from downtown and the midrange despite his tape being filled with a ton of tough shots. The 6-foot guard just knows how to score, and a lightning-quick first step makes him such a tough cover. Vanderbilt's decision to pair a defensive-first playmaker like Hoggard with a score-first guard like Edwards looks like smart roster-building. Transfer from: Kentucky The powerful, 6-8 wing will be one of Arkansas' best multi-positional defenders. Thiero has pogo-stick bounce and can be an excellent secondary rim protector. He's probably best-suited guarding bigger wings or forwards, but Thiero can definitely hang on the perimeter and he'll always chip in on the glass. Offensively, he's a connector and a high-energy role player. Thiero is an outstanding cutter and offensive rebounder, but he can also attack long closeouts. Trying to hide your center on Thiero was not a great idea because of his fluid drives. But he needs to finish better at the rim and continue to expand his perimeter game. Thiero is rapidly getting better. He's a good bet to be in Arkansas' closing lineup because of his defense. Transfer from: Texas Cincinnati was an outstanding offensive-rebounding team while also being one of the best rim defenses. Mitchell will fortify those areas even more. The 6-8, 205-pound forward is one of the best athletes in the country. He covers so much ground defensively and racked up a block or a steal in 31 of 34 games last season. Cincinnati can play Mitchell at the 4 next to Aziz Bandaogo and build an iron wall around the rim. Cincinnati will dominate the glass with those two guys on the floor together, even if the floor-spacing is a real question. Mitchell has not made a jump as a shooter yet, but he's a phenomenal play-finisher. Mitchell shot over 77% at the rim and threw down a whopping 55 dunks last season. Mitchell is a legitimate lob threat and an excellent cutter who never stops moving. Maybe most importantly, Cincinnati had a way higher transition rate than Texas. That's money in the bank for Mitchell who can put on a show in the open floor. Transfer from: Dayton One of the best 3-point shooters in the country is joining one of the best offensive schemes for 3-point shooters. Is there truly anything else to say? .@kobybrea is just getting started 😮‍💨13 PTS (5-7 FG, 3-5 3FG) | 2 AST pic.twitter.com/dumTubh5aY Transfer from: Arkansas Gonzaga doesn't have many holes on the roster, but the Zags' staff hit the portal looking for one more get out of jail free card. Insert Battle. The Arkansas transfer won't be asked to shoulder a monster, alpha role, but he can slide into any lineup, whether off the bench or in the starting lineup, and just go get buckets. This is the best ecosystem of Battle's career. He'll give Gonzaga that rim pressure that it certainly needs from its backcourt. Transfer from: Florida Last offseason, Kugel was regarded as one of the top NBA prospects in the SEC, but his sophomore season at Florida was a major disappointment culminating with multiple "DNPs" in the SEC Tournament. Kugel's body language was ... not great. Mississippi State is hopeful a fresh scene can unlock his sky-high potential. The 6-foot-5, 205-pound guard just floats off the ground. He's a fantastic athlete, and that comes alive in transition. But his decision-making has to markedly improve and quickly. While the turnovers were harmful, the shot selection might have been even more detrimental. Kugel can make every shot in the book but that can be a blessing and a curse. This is an upside play by Chris Jans. If it clicks, Kugel can be the best overall player on the team, even better than stud sophomore guard Josh Hubbard. Transfer from: Stanford Angel shot over 43% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers and over 70% at the rim. That will play all day, every day. The 6-8, 240-pound, fifth-year senior just plays winning basketball. You can post him up against smaller defenders and he'll drag slower-footed bigs onto the perimeter. He's not overly dynamic but the Stanford transfer can knife to the rim and he's a heady cutter. Angel is only additive to everything else Oregon has cooking. Dana Altman found a gem. Transfer from: Tulane James is an elite role player who Jon Scheyer smartly added to this rotation. James is a warrior who rarely came off the floor at Tulane. He's not some high-volume sharpshooter, but 39% on 81 catch-and-shoot 3-pointers will play. He makes defenses pay for leaving him open. But it's all the little things that make James a stud. He's an excellent defender who is absolutely chiseled. He can hound shooters, big wings or lead guards while providing a little secondary rim protection, too. James might not start but he's going to carve out a major role for Duke. Transfer from: Stanford Carlyle was a former prized prospect but his freshman year at Stanford was filled with extreme highs (31 points against Washington State) and gut-wrenching lows (4-for-17 shooting against Colorado). He gives IU a second dynamic lead guard who can go get buckets in pick-and-rolls. He took more off-the-dribble 2-point jumpers (55) than catch-and-shoot 3-pointers (53). Get to the middle of the floor, and make something happen. That's his game. Refining his decision-making is paramount because the turnovers and shot selection were rough last season. Carlyle has a chance to be an excellent player down the road if the jumper sticks and he improves his meager 19% rim rate. He's too fast to let defenses off the hook by settling for pull-ups that often. A sixth-man role could make sense, but Carlyle can earn a spot in the starting (and closing) lineup if he guards his tail off. Transfer from: Toledo Xavier's floor spacing should be immaculate with Maddox and Conwell on the floor together. The Toledo transfer shot over 40% from 3-point range in three of his four seasons at the college ranks. The 6-foot-2, 195-pound guard is just a flamethrower, and he has sneaky bounce when he attacks the rack. Transfer from: Duke Power was buried at Duke, but he will get every opportunity to be a featured piece for Virginia. Power, a former five-star prospect, is a big-time shooter who showed real playmaking abilities in high school. Off-movement shooting is so valuable in Virginia's blocker-mover offense, and Power can do all of that. He's poised to be a productive ACC starter next season, but if Virginia can keep him around for multiple years, he has a chance to be a real star. Transfer from: Oregon State Texas has so many guys who are used to being the featured scorer. There's only one ball, so that could force Pope to change his game to help everyone else. Pope had to be a scorer first for an undermanned Oregon State club, and he did it well. Pope has a phenomenal jumper. He'll give Texas' offense real gravity, but he can be a bit jumper-reliant. He had a very low rim rate last season, but Pope was a sniper both off the catch (38%) and off the bounce (36%). IPope's jumper seems legit. That gives him a high floor. Transfer from: Minnesota Payne is a complete handful. Texas A&M is one of the elite offensive rebounding programs in the country, and the Minnesota transfer had the third-highest offensive rebound rate during Big Ten play. That'll work. He's so powerful and explosive. Payne is an awesome target in pick-and-rolls, and his physicality shows up on the defensive end. Payne plays really, really hard, and there's some intriguing skill starting to develop here too. Payne can occasionally run into problems when he faces up at the elbow and tries to create, but that freelancing ability is fun. He'll make some decent reads, too. He's not just an awesome screen-setting big man who will be a play-finisher, glass-cleaner and rim protector. There's more coming to his game in time. Transfer from: Chicago State Cardet is going to be a big part of the Devin Carter Replacement Plan. The 6-6, Chicago State transfer wing just wants to get to the rack. Over 50% of his shots last season came at the rim and he had a sky-high free throw rate. Playing off two feet will be essential to finish off his drives a bit better. Cardet is capable of getting going from all three levels, but simplifying his game will be key to finding success in a Big East that is so well-scouted If healthy, Bryce Hopkins is Providence's alpha, but Cardet is another capable double-digit scorer who can be the engine of the offense. He's a better shooter than the numbers suggest. He shot over 35% on his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season, but he rarely played off the ball at Chicago State. Getting freed up for more spot-up opportunities should help Cardet's efficiency rise. Cardet should be an exceptional defender under Kim English who is one of the rising defensive coaches in the game. Transfer from: Omaha Michigan State needed a bucket-getting wing, and Fidler should get the first crack at earning that job. Fidler doesn't beat you with loads of athleticism, but he does a ton of his work before he gets the rock and the jumper is pure. Fidler was much more effective playing off the ball, and Michigan State will continue that trend. Improving as an on-the-move shooter would be huge. Fidler can use his size to rise over smaller defenders, and he uses shot fakes to clear space well and draw fouls. Fidler should be an efficient play-finisher for MSU who could be the answer in late-clock scenarios. Transfer from: Boston College Zackery is only additive and doesn't detract from anything else Clemson has cooking. He's thickly built and should be solid in so many areas. He's a career 40% 3-point shooter on just under three attempts per game. He guards. He takes good shots. Zackery developed into a nice ball-screen initiator with a pick-and-pop big man like Quintin Post at Boston College. Clemson can do some of the same things with Zackery and Ian Schieffelin or Chauncey Wiggins. Transfer from: Vanderbilt Lubin does not have elite length or size, but he will outwork you. The Vanderbilt transfer has a ridiculous motor and attacks the rim with a vengeance. His second-jump burst is real. Lubin grew significantly as a roller, and he'll be a rock-solid, ball-screen partner for UNC's elite backcourt. UNC needed a reliable play-finisher offensively, and Lubin can do all that and then some. He's not some elite back-line defensive anchor, but Lubin should be able to play multiple coverages defensively and hold serve against some bigger 4s and smaller 5s. Transfer from: South Florida Pryor could be the X-Factor for this Louisville offense. Pat Kelsey just desperately needs the South Florida transfer to keep making 3-pointers at a high clip to pull centers away from the rim. Pryor is very comfortable playing in space and attacking long closeouts, but he gets very hard to guard in transition after he grabs-and-goes and attacks defenses who can't get set yet. His playmaking and unselfishness is something. Transfer from: Virginia Milicic is a sharp stretch 4. He shot 38% from 3-point range and that's his path to playing time. But he's not just roaming around the perimeter. Milicic is comfortable handling it and attacking open spaces off the bounce. He finished everything around the rim, and he's a tough cover off the ball. He'll dart in and out of screens, cut baseline, 45-cut and everything in between. Milicic's nose for the ball on the defensive glass should translate. Tennessee will have to adjust some things personnel-wise for Milicic's defense, but he's not a stiff. He should be just fine guarding 4s. Transfer from: Vanderbilt Lawrence is a streaky shooter, but he's best when he's slashing to the tin. Two seasons ago, he shot over 64% at the rim at ridiculously high volume. Everything kinda cratered last season for a Vanderbilt team that splintered, but Lawrence's talent is still obvious. Lawrence is easily the most proven, high-major scorer on this much-improved Georgia roster. For the Dawgs to reach their goals, Lawrence has to regain his form and play like one of the best two-way guards in the SEC again. Transfer from: Michigan UConn has made the big-man platoon a huge part of their roster-construction gameplans, and it's not going anywhere in 2024-25. Samson Johnson and Reed will form a two-headed monster. Johnson is bouncy, athletic and extremely fast. Reed will bring more power. The 6-10, 265-pound big man has been watching plenty of Adama Sanogo tape. That type of physical, low-post monster is such a different archetype compared to Johnson. Reed is an elite rebounder, and he's going to draw fouls because of his activity and pure, raw power. UConn's proven player-development chops should be a huge boon. Transfer from: Ohio State Everything looks better when you shoot 46% from 3-point range on just 62 attempts, but Middleton should head into his sophomore season at Seton Hall with plenty of confidence. the former prized recruit was utilized as an off-ball wing at Ohio State who only had a 15% usage rate. Seton Hall can bump that up a bit, but we'll see just how ready Middleton is to be one of the top guys on the scouting report. If the 3-point stroke is real, Middleton will be a massive piece of this club. Seton Hall coach Shaheen Holloway needs him to stretch the floor, attack long closeouts and be a nasty wing defender. Middleton left Ohio State looking for more. Seton Hall gives him the chance at a huge role. Transfer from: Princeton This is one of the best fits in the portal. Allocco is a pure hooper. The Princeton transfer is so comfortable playing mismatch-hunting basketball, which is a staple of Micah Shrewsberry's game plan. He shot over 40% from downtown on both off-the-dribble 3-pointers and catch-and-shoot treys. He's also super comfortable getting to his midrange jumper or slicing his way to the rim. The decision-making is a nice benefit, too. Allocco has to get stronger to make his drives more impactful. He's also not the most explosive dude on the floor, but the wiggle is real. Allocco is a needle-mover, and Shrewsberry should have some fun cooking up some open looks for him to feast. Transfer from: Yale Wolf's tape is so fun. The Yale product can drop dimes from the middle of the floor, and he shot 35% on 83 3-pointers last season, so you have to respect the jumper. Michigan will likely try to play Wolf next to Goldin. Multiple 7-footers on the floor at the same time could be a little clunky, but both guys are so smart and Wolf's playmaking and shooting might make it work. Wolf isn't quite as intimidating a rim protector as Goldin, but his hands in drop coverage are sticky. He forced numerous deflections at Yale. Wolf is going to be a useful piece next year. He could be a terror in 2025-26 when Goldin exhausts his eligibility. 🐺🐺 pic.twitter.com/6VJAWxmCzA Transfer from: Syracuse Brown is an outstanding multi-positional defender who will help this unit compete to be the best defensive team in the country. Brown was an All-ACC defensive team selection in 2023-24, but he might be even better at Duke now that he doesn't have to bang with centers every single play. Everyone wants to be a switch-everything defender, but Brown actually is one. The Syracuse transfer will help douse so many fires, and his cutting and playmaking off the short roll will be a massive asset to Duke's offensive attack. Brown is another elite role player. Don't be surprised if Brown is a staple of Duke's closing lineup. Transfer from: Tennessee What an addition for Mike Rhoades in Happy Valley. Dilione was expected to have a bigger role at Tennessee last season, but Dalton Knecht stole all the headlines. Dilione now lands at Penn State and could be a phenomenal buy-low spot to get his career back on track. Dilione provides a huge jumbo playmaker who can stuff the stat sheet. On paper, the fit next to Ace Baldwin could be very fun if Dilione's jumper is legit. Baldwin is already a terrific on-ball defender and Dilione can grow into one too. This one has a chance to be a Hunter Sallis-like explosion spot for Penn State. Transfer from: Hofstra Carlos was a two-year starter for a very good Hofstra program, and he'll help fill the Judah Mintz void in Syracuse's backcourt. Carlos was one of the top pass-first, initiator point guards in the portal, and this has every opportunity to be a strong match for both sides. Carlos' ability to stretch the floor should free up the paint for JJ Starling to get more traction on his drives. Carlos is very jump-shot reliant (just 22% of his shots last season came at the rim), but the stroke is pure. Transfer from: Iowa State Well would you look at that, another five-star is transferring to Wake Forest after a disappointing first stop. It's up to Steve Forbes, aka the Transfer Portal Whisperer, to unlock the version of Biliew that never came to fruition at Iowa State. Biliew's freshman-year tape wasn't anything to write home about . He looked completely out of sorts and struggled to find any sort of footing for an Iowa State club that wanted to win big right away. Forbes is betting on the pedigree and a new scene. The former five-star recruit has athletic tools galore, and buffing up the frontcourt athleticism was one of the huge objectives for Wake Forest. Biliew doesn't need to be an offensive star right away, but he can have a huge impact on this team as a highly-active defensive whiz who can douse fires. If Wake Forest wants to win the ACC, it has to get through Duke. Who is the best bet to guard Cooper Flagg? Biliew. Transfer from: Arkansas DePaul has added so much shooting on the perimeter, but it needs someone to break down the defense and get into the paint. Insert Blocker. The Arkansas transfer is the most natural point guard on this roster and he punctured opposing defenses at will last season. He should lead this team in free throw attempts while offering nasty perimeter defense. The former prized recruit has a runway to a major role at DePaul and the roster construction is set up to best maximize his skills and keep the paint clear for his drives. This could end up being a diamond in the rough for DePaul. Transfer from: High Point Learn the name. This one has a chance to be a gem. Miles was one of the top pick-and-roll, bucket-getters in the country last season at High Point, and Porter Moser has a proven hit rate of getting plenty out of transfer-up guards from the lower levels. Miles was efficient in every area. He shot over 65% at the rim, 36% from 3-point range and 50% on his pull-up jumpers. Miles is also a terrific decision-maker. Transfer from: UMass The well-traveled Cross has turned into a heckuva player. He's a good bet to shoot around 35% from 3-point range on over two attempts per game. He's a great cutter, rebounder and playmaker. Cross finds mismatches and knows what to do with 'em. SMU dropped a bag to land Cross (who had a ton of interest from good teams galore), and the fifth-year senior will be worth it. Transfer from: Northern Iowa Born gets the first crack at replacing Colorado State legend Isaiah Stevens. Born isn't the distributor that Stevens was, but he can score that thing. The Northern Iowa transfer is on the doorstep of eclipsing 1,500 career points. Colorado State coach Niko Medved should be able to utilize the lefty sharpshooter in creative ways in the Rams' Princeton-style offense. Born will be one of the Mountain West's best scorers. Transfer from: Ohio State Dayton needed a post-up hub and found it in Key, an Ohio State transfer who was a bucket on the block. Key eats up one-on-one coverage and rapidly improved at finding open shooters when the double-team came his way. Key, a low-post beast, teaming up with Nate Santos, a stretch 4 deadeye, should be a fabulous match for a Dayton squad that intends to chase an A-10 crown. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Title: S&P 500's era of hot stock market returns is over, Goldman Sachs says

Posted on 10/28/2024 7:51:55 AM PDT by SeekAndFind For the last 15 years, all you've needed to do to achieve double-digit returns on your money was park it in an S&P 500 index fund, reinvest dividends, and forget about it. That happy ride may be over, according to a new note from Goldman Sachs that has Wall Street abuzz.The big picture: The S&P is on track to return only about 3% a year in the coming decade, Goldman's portfolio strategy group estimates. Compare that to 13% average annual returns over the last ten years.Goldman's forecast implies the S&P — the benchmark index tracked by many of the world's most popular investment vehicles — is more likely than not to have lower returns than U.S. Treasury securities (72% odds) and could even deliver returns lower than inflation (33% odds) through 2034.State of play: The forecast incorporates some of the standard variables portfolio strategists look at to project future returns — price-to-earnings-ratios and interest rates, primarily. But much of the subpar projection is rooted in the extraordinary concentration of the recent stock market runup.Stocks of a handful of fast-growing, highly profitable tech giants that are investing heavily in artificial intelligence — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — increasingly are the S&P.The index may be meant to contain 500 stocks, but those plus Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, and a couple of others have accounted for around a third of the total market-cap weighted index in recent months.Flashback: The Goldman team notes that in past episodes in which the market became highly concentrated, the megafirms that drove gains weren't able to continue achieving the outsized growth in sales and profit margins that would have propelled further gains.In the 1960 and early 1970s, the "Nifty Fifty" were large cap superstar companies, including names like IBM, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox. The 1970s ended up being a lost decade for stock market returns.The late 1990s tech boom sent shares of Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco Systems, and Intel to the moon, but the 2000s were also a deflating time of weak returns.What they're saying: "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," write David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and four colleagues."The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index," they write. "As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

It says what it wants the market to do. Probably time to invest in SP500. 2 posted on 10/28/2024 7:56:13 AM PDT by MeanWestTexan (Sometimes There Is No Lesser Of Two Evils) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind HERE's the COMMENT MADE BY THE OXFORD INCOME GROUP REGARDING GOLDMAN SACH's PREDICTION: To put that into perspective, the S&P 500 Index has produced an average annual return of about 10.3% since its 1957 inception. If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

You can do that with Vanguard dividend index funds which have done reasonably well compared to the S&P500. I complement that with QQQ and other growth index funds. A key point of this article seems to be that growth has been driven by a subset of companies invested in AI. I would counter that there will always be some version of that happening. Always problems needing to be solved. Dem control provides a caustic environment but stock performance has continued despite dem efforts to destroy the economy. Stock performance has done surprisingly well under dem Presidents. But all bets are off if the dems secure overwhelming control of both branches of Congress. In the end no one can predict the future and the market involves lots of risk and is not for everyone. 12 posted on 10/28/2024 8:49:17 AM PDT by plain talk [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: MeanWestTexan Sounds like an echo of what I just said to the walls of my study.

But much of the subpar projection is rooted in the extraordinary concentration of the recent stock market runup.Stocks of a handful of fast-growing, highly profitable tech giants that are investing heavily in artificial intelligence — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — increasingly are the S&P.The index may be meant to contain 500 stocks, but those plus Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, and a couple of others have accounted for around a third of the total market-cap weighted index in recent months.Flashback: The Goldman team notes that in past episodes in which the market became highly concentrated, the megafirms that drove gains weren't able to continue achieving the outsized growth in sales and profit margins that would have propelled further gains.In the 1960 and early 1970s, the "Nifty Fifty" were large cap superstar companies, including names like IBM, Eastman Kodak, and Xerox. The 1970s ended up being a lost decade for stock market returns.The late 1990s tech boom sent shares of Microsoft, General Electric, Cisco Systems, and Intel to the moon, but the 2000s were also a deflating time of weak returns.What they're saying: "Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time," write David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, and four colleagues."The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index," they write. "As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

"As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate."Data: Yahoo Finance; Chart: Axios VisualsWhile the Goldman note has received lots of attention, the core idea — that subpar returns are likely ahead for the biggest U.S. stocks — is so widespread as to be practically conventional wisdom among those who analyze asset allocation.For example, Vanguard routinely updates its projected returns on different asset classes and currently only anticipates 3% to 5% returns for large-cap U.S. stocks (i.e., the S&P 500) over the coming decade.Vanguard sees substantially better returns ahead on value stocks, small caps, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and international stocks.Between the lines: The flip side of the explosive growth in valuations of U.S. mega-caps over the last 15 years is that pretty much everything else, with more modest returns in that time, still has valuations that offer meaningful upside.Those of us who studied our Modern Portfolio Theory and built a portfolio strategically diversified based on factors like geography and company size have suffered subpar returns over the last 15 years relative to people who just piled everything into the S&P.In effect, the Goldman and similar forecasts are a prediction that the worm has turned, and the decade ahead will reward that diversification.Yes, but: Maybe the AI revolution will involve winner-take-all effects and such massive capital spending needs that the winners of the last decade will also be the winners of the next decade, propelling the S&P much higher despite historical warning signs.The bottom line: In deciding whether to go all-in on the S&P or diversify your stock investment more among value-oriented, smaller, and international companies, you are implicitly betting on one of those narratives.

If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

It says what it wants the market to do. Probably time to invest in SP500. 2 posted on 10/28/2024 7:56:13 AM PDT by MeanWestTexan (Sometimes There Is No Lesser Of Two Evils) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind HERE's the COMMENT MADE BY THE OXFORD INCOME GROUP REGARDING GOLDMAN SACH's PREDICTION: To put that into perspective, the S&P 500 Index has produced an average annual return of about 10.3% since its 1957 inception. If you extend the index backward to 1930 (which market analysts often do), the average is even better, around 11%. And the index is up 23% this year with two months to go. How Goldman's Prediction Compares to Other Decades - Distribution of S&P 500 annualized 10-year returns since 1930 So an anemic average return of 3% over the next 10 years would be a kind of lost decade for equities. Historically, we've only seen extended periods of such low returns after crises like the Great Depression and the 1970s oil shocks. If Goldman is right, investors would be better off parking their entire portfolio in risk-free Treasuries. Right now the 10-year Treasury yield is hovering around 4.2%. How did Goldman produce such a lousy prediction? Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin, who authored the dour report, included many factors in his calculations - ranging from interest rates to return on equity to potential future recessions. But his two major problems for equities over the next decade are market concentration and valuations. He says the stock market is too concentrated in a few stocks, and stocks are too expensive overall. He's not totally wrong about that... For valuations, Kostin's team uses the cyclically adjusted PE multiple, which is 38 times earnings, one of the highest valuations of the last century. As for concentration, the report points out that the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 comprise 36% of its entire market capitalization. In other words, 2% of the companies in the index account for more than a third of the index's market cap. (Think of the Magnificent Sevens stocks here). Historically, when the market has a very high valuation and is narrowly concentrated, it underperforms over the next decade. So Kostin has a point. Yet there are many factors that would suggest his forecast could be off the mark... by a lot. So, the question is, should investors run for the hills yet? Let's start with earnings. S&P 500 earnings are predicted to rise by double digits in 2025 and 2026. And as Chief Investment Strategist Alexander Green of the Oxford Group periodically reminds us, earnings are the best indicator of where share prices will go in the medium to long term, certainly over a decade. I would also point to rising productivity in the economy. The United States leads the world in productivity growth. In fact, U.S. labor productivity is up a whopping 70% since 1990. That means that every year U.S. companies are generating more output with less labor (typically their biggest expense). Those numbers only look to accelerate as a host of new technologies - and artificial intelligence in particular - are likely to raise productivity growth even more in the years ahead. And productivity is the key to rising living standards, lower inflation, higher corporate profits, and, ultimately, rising share prices. Not to mention... there's a fundamental problem with long-term predictions like the one Goldman produced last week... They require far too many assumptions to be taken seriously. And they don't account for other factors - oil shocks and wars and other unforeseeable events, as well as inflationary policies. The way to wealth is through identifying companies that are poised to grow revenue and earnings, capture market share, and become more profitable over time. And in the most immediate future, the coming election could have a huge effect on your wealth. 3 posted on 10/28/2024 7:59:23 AM PDT by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind You can read as many “predictions” on the stock market as you have time to read.

Title: Fantasy Basketball Waiver Wire Week 2: Dyson Daniels' new role could yield improved Fantasy numbers, more
URL: https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/fantasy-basketball-waiver-wire-week-2-dyson-daniels-new-role-could-yield-improved-fantasy-numbers-more/
Time Published: 2024-10-25T16:46:29Z
Full Content:
If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Welcome back! I missed the NBA. And I missed you, dear readers. Glad to have this space we can share together again. It's been a bizarre opening week. Half of the first 12 games were double-digit blowouts, and four of last season's top-14 per-game fantasy producers missed Game 1. As opening weeks go, these complications mean we've learned less than we'd hoped, but we've still learned plenty. We can learn infinitely more from a single lopsided and injury-riddled regular season game than the entire preseason and training camp put together. As you'd expect, the waiver wire is deep this week. Two players are stop-everything-go-now must-adds, and a whole lot more have attractive potential. And, of course, our annual cautionary note: don't panic-drop your middle-round picks. Jonathan Kuminga and Jabari Smith put up disappointing stats in their first games, but there's a reason they were widely hyped by analysts and went inside the top 100 in every industry draft I was a part of. Smith, in fact, was also featured in this paragraph after an Opening Night dud last year – he finished the season safely inside the top 90, mildly beating expectations. Don't panic on earlier picks with tremendous upside after one disappointing night. As we do every year, the players in this article must be rostered in less than two-thirds of CBS leagues. Players are listed in the order that I recommend adding them, assuming they are equally good fits for your team. Players rostered in more than two-thirds of leagues but who are still under-rostered. Double-check to make sure they aren't available in your league. In many cases, these players qualified for this article before big opening night performances, meaning managers with once-weekly waiver runs are particularly likely to see these players still available. Walker Kessler, Jazz (80% rostered) Dereck Lively, Mavericks (71% rostered) Jalen Suggs, Magic (80% rostered) Brook Lopez, Bucks (77% rostered)Cameron Johnson, Nets (75% rostered) Jeremy Sochan, Spurs (69% rostered) Andrew Wiggins, Warriors (81% rostered)Ben Simmons, Nets (82% rostered) Dyson Daniels, Hawks (43% rostered) Daniels started and played 35 minutes in the opener. Securing that massive role is, by far, the most important reason that Daniels is this week's top add. The fact that he was wildly productive – 15-5-2 with five steals, two 3s, and a block – is a nice bonus, but he'd be addable regardless. The 21-year-old former lottery pick was buried on the Pelicans' depth chart before coming to Atlanta in the Dejounte Murray trade last summer. Daniels' per-minute productivity was mediocre, but earning the start and playing big minutes over a healthy Bogdan Bogdanovic likely implies that Daniels will get enough work to rack up stats. He's likely to be most helpful on defense, with low-ish scoring and decent rebounds and assists. Note: I would prioritize Daniels over everyone listed in "double-check your leagues," except for Kessler. Onyeka Okongwu, Hawks (61% rostered) If the Hawks' minute distribution in their first game is indicative of what will happen all season, then calling Okongwu a must-add is underselling it. Fantasy managers have known about Okongwu's great per-minute productivity for years, pining for the day when he'd finally see a full workload. In the opener, he played 28 minutes off the bench, while starter Clint Capela played only 20. It's only one game, but it was a real game – and there was no blowout, foul trouble, or injury to muddle the data. The Hawks' second game is Friday night at 7:30 ET. If you're reading this after that game, and Okongwu once again saw 28-ish minutes while Capela played 22 or fewer, then go ahead and flip him ahead of Daniels for this week's top pickup. Note: I would prioritize Okongwu over Wiggins and Simmons, listed in "double-check your leagues" above. Mark Williams, Hornets (62% rostered) Williams (foot) will miss the second game of the season, an ominous start after playing in just 62 games combined through his first two seasons. That said, waiver pickups are free, and he's really productive when he plays. Last season, he averaged 13-10 with 1.1 blocks and 0.8 steals in just 26.7 minutes. Especially if you have an IR spot, add Williams, stash him, and then add someone else. Note: I would prioritize Williams over Wiggins and Simmons, listed in "double-check your leagues" above. Norman Powell, Clippers (63% rostered) The Clippers are short-staffed. With Kawhi Leonard (knee) out indefinitely and P.J. Tucker permanently away from the team, they lack rotation players. We learned Wednesday that part of their plan to replace all of those players is to just give all their minutes to Powell. He played 40 in the opener, tying teammate James Harden for the third-most by any player so far this season. With that many minutes, it would be hard to avoid making a fantasy impact. Powell should score a lot while also helping in 3s and steals. Note: I would prioritize Powell over Wiggins and Simmons, listed in "double-check your leagues" above. Rui Hachimura, Lakers (52% rostered) Hachimura took over as a starter shortly before the All-Star break last season. Over those final two months of the season, he averaged 16-5-1 with 1.8 3s in 31 minutes per game while shooting 56-45-76. If the 35 minutes he played in the opener is indicative of a further increasing role, then Hachimura should easily flirt with the top 100, and that's without factoring in any improvement for the 26-year-old. Trayce Jackson-Davis, Warriors (46% rostered) Another player who took over as a starter late last season and carried that promotion into the new campaign. He averaged 11-8-2 with 2.4 stocks in 25.4 minutes in his 11 full-time starts, and his opening night workload mirrored that. Jackson-Davis was drafted in most industry leagues, and his roster rate is much higher on other host sites – he's only so widely available because CBS had an unusually low default rank on him in their draft room. He's highly likely to reach a near-universal roster rate within a couple of weeks. Yves Missi, Pelicans (25% rostered) The Pelicans probably have the worst center depth chart in the league. It's just Daniel Theis, Missi, the 21st pick in last June's draft, and Karlo Matkovic. Matkovic was a late second-round pick in 2022 who spent last season in the G-League and made his NBA debut in the final minute of Wednesday night's game. Theis started but played only 19 minutes to Missi's 23. Missi was having a good game, and the margin was somewhat small, so we'll need to keep watching to see if this pattern continues. But if it does, Missi could emerge as an excellent source of defensive stats. In the "actions speak louder than words" department, Missi was the first player in this column that I actually went out and added in my own competitive leagues (in part because the players listed above were already rostered). Andre Drummond, 76ers (55% rostered) When Joel Embiid is out, Drummond needs to be in lineups. It's that simple. I don't think Drummond will have much utility while Embiid is playing, hence Drummond's low-ish placement in this column. But he's a must-start any time Embiid is out, and we already know Embiid (knee) will be out on Friday. De'Andre Hunter, Hawks (40% rostered) Despite foul trouble, Hunter still managed 26 minutes in an opening night start. That's a great sign for a chronically underrated Fantasy contributor. Hunter has popped up in this column repeatedly over the past two seasons, averaging basically 16-4-2 with nearly two 3s while playing around 30 minutes per game. His workload in the debut implies another season of a similar role, which means another season of rosterability for as long as he can stay healthy. After Missi, Hunter was the second player I added in my own leagues this week. Bilal Coulibaly, Wizards (47% rostered) It was kind of unfair for the Wizards to kick off their schedule against the Celtics. The two teams are just in completely different classes. But one of the few bright spots in their merciless drubbing was Coulibaly, who put up 8-6-6 with a steal in 30 minutes. It wasn't anything amazing, but it was solid production and a lot of minutes against a great opponent. It might not turn into anything, but this is the sort of performance that can easily build into a breakout campaign. Toumani Camara, Trail Blazers (10% rostered) Generally speaking, I think the fantasy basketball community underrates the "he's just a good player" factor, especially when it comes to surprising players like Camara. A good recent parallel is Herb Jones, who, like Camara, was a defense-first, second-round pick who surprised everyone by forcing his way into a large rotation role as a rookie. That undeniability usually matters. Camara isn't as good as Jones, but he is a good defender who has earned a large role in the rotation. He played 30 minutes as a starter in the opener, though, granted, that was without Shaedon Sharpe (shoulder) and Matisse Thybulle (knee). Sharpe is the more serious threat, so we'll see what happens when he returns (expected in about two weeks). Even with that looming threat, however, I like Camara as a flier to see if he can maintain this workload and what happens to his numbers as he continues to improve. Other recommendations: Al Horford, Celtics (54% rostered); Nikola Jovic, Heat (23% rostered); Tre Mann, Hornets (25% rostered) Dalton Knecht, Lakers Knecht barely did enough to warrant a blurb, but he was the most popular pickup on CBS this week after playing a larger-than-expected 16 minutes on opening night, so I wanted to address him. It is an excellent sign that Knecht appears to be starting the season firmly in the rotation. The rookie sharpshooter could be a solid contributor if he earns a larger role. But first, he'll have to hold onto these minutes once Jarred Vanderbilt (foot) returns). Knecht's surprisingly lengthy appearance Tuesday increases his dynasty appeal. But he's droppable if you drafted him in a standard-sized league. Lonzo Ball, Bulls Another of the week's most popular pickups that need to be dropped. It is very exciting to see Ball back in action after nearly three years away. If he ever gets anything near full health and a full workload, he'll be rosterable. But he played 14 minutes in the opener. Keep an eye on the transaction page in your league – the following injured players have seen their roster rates fall meaningfully over the past week. As evidence of these players' value, all of these players were selected well inside the top 100 in recent industry drafts. Let other managers' impatience be your benefit. Isaiah Hartenstein, Thunder (71% rostered) – out at least four more weeks Trey Murphy, Pelicans (66% rostered) – out at least two more weeks Ausar Thompson, Pistons (50% rostered) – out indefinitely Toumani Camara, Trail Blazers (10% rostered) Just making sure you noticed that Camara is 10% available. His blurb is in the "adds for all leagues" section. Miles McBride, Knicks (21% rostered) McBride was the clear sixth man for the Knicks on Opening Night. The blowout was obvious early, so it's unclear how many minutes that will translate to during a competitive game – but, historically, it's been a profitable position under substitution-challenged coach Tom Thibodeau. Last season, in the 20 games where he played between 19-33 minutes, he averaged 11-2-2 with 2.1 3s and 1.1 steals (while averaging 24.9 minutes). If he is, in fact, firmly entrenched as the sixth man, then that strikes me as a realistic and possibly slightly conservative expectation of what we might see from him moving forward. Other recommendations: Bruce Brown, Raptors (8% rostered); Dean Wade, Cavaliers (1% rostered); Derrick Jones Jr, Clippers (5% rostered) © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / OCTOBER 25 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives.

Trading in Gift Nifty indicates a flat opening on Friday and another dull day for domestic markets. Amid mixed global cues, domestic benchmarks are expected to remain range-bound while action will be on the broader markets, said analysts. Stock-specific action will continue based on Q2-FY25 performance, they added. Dr Lal Pathlabs’ (DLPL) Q2-FY25 margins expanded by 110bps y-o-y on the back of improving contribution from Swasthfit and better margin performance at Suburban (about 600 bps q-o-q). Sample volume growth (+8.6 per cent y-o-y), however, remained soft owing to lower incidence of monsoon-related illnesses (except West region) and a higher base. Broadly, TVS Motor has reported bottom-line in line with estimates in Q2FY25 led by of sustenance of EBITDA margin at above 11 per cent level. Revenues increased by 13.3 per cent y-o-y to ₹9,228 crore (Vs estimate of ₹9,538 crore) on the back of 14.3 per cent y-o-y increase in volumes as ASPs declined by 0.9 per cent y-o-y.

We retain our BUY rating and TP unchanged at Rs1,230 on Krystal Integrated Services (KIS), a rising leader in the Integrated Facilities Management Services (IFMS). The company’s quarterly performance aligns with our estimates and sets a strong foundation for future growth, also supported by new contract wins in H1FY25. These wins, along with Krystal’s expansion into promising verticals like MEP services, robotics, and AI-driven technical solutions, are poised to drive sustainable growth. The strategic partnership with Vishnu Prasad Research Centre to commercialize solid waste management technology further strengthens its competitive edge and coupled with growing demand in the catering business is a perfect recipe for solid growth. With reduced working capital days and a stable revenue mix, Krystal is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising opportunity in the IFMS services. Valued at 16x Sept 26e EPS to arrive at TP of Rs1,230.
