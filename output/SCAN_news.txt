Title: Thematic And Sector ETFs: Real Opportunity Or Financial Fashion?

ByGianluca Sidoti ByGianluca Sidoti, Forbes Councils Member. Gianluca Sidoti is an Independent Financial Advisor, Founder of TraDetector and Managing Partner at The Wealth Company International. Investors are always searching for the next big opportunity. In recent years, thematic and sector ETFs have offered precisely that: access to transformational trends like artificial intelligence, green energy, biotechnology or digital finance. Their promise is simple yet enticing: By investing in these funds, you can ride the wave of innovation and potentially unlock above-average returns. As an independent financial advisor, I encounter a growing number of clients asking whether these strategies belong in their portfolios. They’ve seen the headlines, heard about impressive short-term gains and want to participate. Yet, as with any investment decision, the reality is more nuanced than the marketing narratives suggest. Thematic and sector ETFs are designed to provide concentrated exposure to a particular industry or a future-driven trend. Unlike traditional broad-market ETFs, these funds typically invest in a narrower selection of companies, sometimes spread globally, sometimes focused on emerging players. During certain market environments, these thematic funds have delivered spectacular returns. The rise of electric vehicles, the boom in renewable energy and the acceleration of cloud computing all offered extraordinary windows of opportunity for early investors. However, history shows that such windows often come with a catch: They open wider during moments of euphoria and tend to close when volatility strikes. Clients sometimes approach me with enthusiasm, eager to devote large portions of their portfolios to the latest trend. I understand the appeal; thematic ETFs combine a compelling story with the excitement of future possibilities. But part of my role is helping investors distinguish between a sound long-term investment and the risks of chasing performance. One of the most significant challenges with thematic investing is timing. By the time a trend becomes obvious and investment products are widely available, much of the initial explosive growth has often already occurred. Take, for instance, the surge in clean energy ETFs in 2020 and early 2021. Funds like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF attracted massive inflows, yet many investors who entered late experienced disappointing returns once valuations normalized. The same pattern emerged with disruptive innovation funds. The ARK Innovation ETF became a household name after skyrocketing in 2020, only to see significant declines in subsequent years. It’s a powerful reminder that enthusiasm alone does not guarantee investment success. Being early in identifying a secular trend is one thing; being early—and staying disciplined—is another. When working with clients, I approach thematic ETFs carefully and deliberately. Rather than positioning them as core holdings, I integrate them into a broader framework built on diversification, risk management and long-term objectives. A thematic ETF might represent a small, strategic satellite position—a way to align part of a portfolio with a client’s interests or beliefs without jeopardizing their broader financial stability. One client, a technology entrepreneur, recently approached me, interested in blockchain-related investments. While his conviction about the technology’s future was strong, I advised against committing a disproportionate share of his assets. Instead, we agreed to allocate a modest percentage of his portfolio into a diversified blockchain ETF, complemented by exposure to established technology companies supporting blockchain innovation. This approach allowed him to participate in the trend while maintaining a balanced, resilient portfolio. Another client, passionate about environmental sustainability, wanted to focus on clean energy and ESG-driven sectors. Together, we selected a thematic ESG ETF but ensured her investment was part of a well-diversified equity allocation, not a stand-alone bet. By setting expectations appropriately—understanding that even promising sectors can experience short-term volatility—she remained confident during inevitable market fluctuations. The reality is that not every emerging trend will deliver outsized returns. Some themes are crowded, with high valuations already priced in. Others may take longer than expected to materialize, testing investors’ patience and risk tolerance. In my practice, I emphasize to clients that thematic investing is not about trying to predict the next breakout industry overnight. It’s about positioning intelligently, with a clear understanding of the potential upside, the timeline and the risks involved. One of the critical tools in evaluating thematic ETFs is scrutinizing the underlying holdings. Many funds share the same handful of high-profile stocks, creating hidden concentration risks. Others may stretch the definition of a theme to broaden their asset base, including companies only tangentially related to the supposed focus area. Due diligence matters. It’s not enough to be excited about “artificial intelligence” or “renewable energy”—it’s essential to understand what you’re actually investing in. Furthermore, thematic ETFs often suffer from a lack of historical performance data. Since many are launched during times of high interest, it’s difficult to gauge how they will behave across full market cycles, especially during recessions or periods of rising interest rates. Investors need to be prepared for periods of underperformance and accept that patience is often a necessary component of thematic investing. Despite these challenges, thematic and sector ETFs can have a meaningful role within an intelligently constructed portfolio. They offer investors a way to express specific convictions, diversify sources of growth and align their investments with personal values. The key is to integrate them thoughtfully—and never at the expense of long-term security. In today’s world, where innovation is constant and narratives drive markets, it’s tempting to follow the latest trend. But successful investing, as I often remind my clients, is rarely about chasing headlines. It’s about building a resilient strategy capable of withstanding both the noise and the hype. Thematic and sector ETFs can be a part of that strategy, provided they are treated with the right mindset: not as magic solutions or shortcuts to wealth, but as deliberate choices, aligned with a disciplined financial plan. In the end, trends will come and go, but sound principles endure. The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.
