Title: How LLY Stock Delivered $47 Billion To Shareholders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/15/how-lly-stock-delivered-47-billion-to-shareholders/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T13:40:48Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In the last decade, Eli Lilly stock (NYSE: LLY) has returned $47 billion to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-centric approach has delivered solid results in 2025, with the stock posting 9% year-to-date returns, despite experiencing some volatility from its peak of $937 earlier in the year, while demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of increased competition in the diabetes and obesity treatment markets. Eli Lilly's commitment to rewarding shareholders reached new heights with the board's approval of a massive $15 billion share repurchase program in December 2024, replacing the completed $5 billion buyback and representing one of the largest capital return initiatives in pharmaceutical industry history. The diabetes and obesity treatment leader further reinforced its shareholder-first philosophy by announcing a 15% dividend increase for the seventh consecutive year, raising the quarterly dividend from $1.30 to $1.50 per share, bringing the annual dividend to $6.00 and yielding approximately 0.74% at current levels. Eli Lilly’s exceptional financial performance has been driven by the blockbuster success of its GLP-1 medications Mounjaro and Zepbound, with 2024 revenues reaching $45.04 billion (up 32% year-over-year) and earnings of $10.59 billion (up 102%), providing the robust cash generation that enables both aggressive share buybacks and consistent dividend growth while maintaining substantial R&D investments for pipeline advancement. These two drugs alone accounted for $11.5 billion in total sales last year, and in the first half of 2025, this figure has surged 115% y-o-y to $14.5 billion. Let’s look at some numbers and compare how this payout power stacks up against the market's biggest capital-return machines. Interestingly, LLY stock ranks 58th in history in total shareholder returns. Why does this matter? Because dividends and buybacks represent direct returns to shareholders and reflect management’s confidence in future cash generation. Many companies follow this strategy. Below is a list of the top 10 companies by total capital returned through dividends and repurchases. While that’s one perspective, Trefis High Quality Portfolio considers many more factors to help reduce company-specific risk while maintaining growth exposure. For the complete list, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking. Key takeaway: Total shareholder returns as a percentage of market cap often appear inversely related to growth potential. Companies like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding faster and more predictably but have returned smaller proportions of their value to shareholders. That’s the trade-off: attractive capital returns can sometimes come at the cost of growth. Keeping that in mind, let’s examine Eli Lilly’s fundamentals. (See Buy or Sell Eli Lilly Stock for more.) That’s a solid snapshot, but a complete investment evaluation requires a broader view. That’s exactly what the Trefis High Quality Portfolio delivers—balancing lower risk with upside exposure. Still, Lilly isn’t immune to volatility. It dropped 51% during the Global Financial Crisis and 43% in the Dot-Com bubble. Even during more recent events—the 2018 correction, inflation shock, and Covid pandemic—it declined between 18% and 22%. So, while fundamentals remain strong, the stock can still see notable drawdowns during market downturns. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio of 30 stocks has consistently outperformed major benchmarks such as the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000. Why? Collectively, HQ stocks have offered higher returns with lower volatility—a smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: AVGO Stock AI Jackpot: $51B Shareholder Returns
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/avgo-stock-ai-jackpot-51b-shareholder-returns/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:40:46Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has returned an impressive $51 billion to its investors through direct cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-focused strategy has delivered extraordinary results in 2025, with the stock posting a remarkable 50% year-to-date return, dramatically outperforming the broader market and establishing AVGO as one of the year’s most compelling semiconductor investments despite recent volatility. See – What’s Behind The Surge In Broadcom’s Stock? – for more details. Broadcom's commitment to consistent income generation continues through its steady quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, maintaining an annualized dividend of $2.36 that yields approximately 0.68%, with the company successfully sustaining 13 consecutive years of dividend increases since becoming a public company. The semiconductor giant's robust capital allocation was significantly amplified in April 2025 when the board authorized a massive $10 billion share repurchase program running through December 31, 2025, reflecting management's confidence in the company's strong cash flow generation and its dominant position in AI infrastructure and mission-critical software. Broadcom’s exceptional financial performance has been underpinned by robust revenue growth, with Q3 2025 revenues reaching $16 billion and generating an impressive free cash flow of $7 billion (44% of revenue), while Q4 guidance of $17.4 billion represents a 24% year-over-year increase driven by accelerating demand for AI semiconductors and infrastructure software solutions. Let’s examine some statistics and evaluate how this payout capability compares to the market’s leading capital-return powerhouses. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd largest return to shareholders in history. Why should you care? This is because dividends and share buybacks signify direct and tangible returns of capital to investors. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s financial well-being and its capacity to generate sustainable cash flows. Furthermore, there are numerous other stocks with similar characteristics. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by the total capital returned to investors via dividends and stock repurchases. For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you observe here? The overall capital returned to investors as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a quicker pace, in a more predictable manner, compared to others, yet they have delivered a significantly lower percentage of their market valuation to stockholders. That’s the downside to substantial capital returns. While they are appealing, one must reflect on the question: Am I forfeiting growth and robust fundamentals? Keeping that in perspective, let’s analyze some figures for AVGO. (see Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for further details) Nonetheless, AVGO isn’t immune to significant declines. It experienced a drop of nearly 48% during the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 35% in the 2021 inflation shock, and around 27% in the 2018 correction. Even with robust fundamentals, it’s apparent that the stock can endure substantial setbacks when the market shifts. Quality companies still suffer when investor sentiment changes dramatically. However, the risk isn't restricted to considerable market declines. Stocks can decrease even when markets are favorable – consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. To understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp downturns in the past, read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
