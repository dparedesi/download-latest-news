Jana Small Finance Bank expands to Andhra Pradesh with first branch in Guntur, offering diverse financial services. The Indian government is becoming more dependent on household savings to handle its rising debt, with around $346 billion in sovereign bonds due over the next five years. By tapping into trusted instruments like G-Secs and small savings schemes, the government aims to reduce dependence on foreign capital and stabilize public finances. However, this strategy comes with its own risks. While short-term deposits under the (GMS) Gold Monetization Scheme will continue at the banks’ discretion, the discontinuation of new enrollments emphasizes the ongoing struggle to convince households to monetize their gold. Regardless of efforts to cut down on gold imports and boost liquidity, participation in the scheme remains low. Over-dependence on domestic savings could also restrict funds existing for private sector investments, possibly slowing long-term economic growth. With household savings on the decline and government debt on the rise, maintaining this approach may prove difficult. Striking the right balance between managing public debt and fostering private sector growth will be key to sustaining economic stability and development. Robust core markets to drive higher EBITDA — upgrade to Buy; lift TP to INR34,000 Valuation: upgrade to Buy; raise TP by 21% to INR34,000 (19% implied upside). We had turned Neutral on Shree in Jan’25 largely on account of weakness in its core markets; however, the recent recovery in core markets and higher utilization should result in market share gain for Shree, in our view. As a result, we raise our FY26F/27F volume estimates by 5%/7% to 41MT/46MT on account of its improved utilization in the Northern and Eastern regions (>80% of volume mix). Furthermore, both regions have witnessed resilient pricing, up 4% q-q, compared to only 2% pan-India. We increase our FY26F/27F EBITDA by 9%/15% to INR49bn/INR65bn from INR45bn/INR56bn, largely reflecting the company’s improved cement realizations and utilization in core markets. Our FY26F/27F EBITDA are 1%/11% above Bloomberg consensus. We expect Shree to remain the highest unitary EBITDA player in the industry.

The US economy maintained some decent momentum in March at the same time as Europe’s growth rate has picked up pace. Japan in contrast saw some marked weakening in its headline composite PMI, suggesting a big loss of momentum. As above chart suggests US factories reported the steepest rise in input costs for 31 months, causing the rate of inflation to far outpace equivalent rates reported in the other G4 economies. Despite these challenges, US corporate profits surged to a record high in the fourth quarter, driven by strong demand and pricing power. Profits from current production, with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rose by $204.7 billion, or 5.4%, reaching an all-time high of $4 trillion. . On the macroeconomic front, the US GDP growth rate has slowed, coming in at 2.4%—slightly above the forecasted 2.3% but significantly lower than the previous 3.1%. Meanwhile, the goods trade deficit narrowed by 4.9% to $147.9 billion in February, as exports rose by $7 billion to $178.6 billion, while imports dipped by $0.6 billion to $326.5 billion. In Asia, Taiwan is exploring multiple options to respond to potential new US tariffs. Officials indicated that the country may increase energy imports and reduce its own tariffs to rebalance bilateral trade. Meanwhile, Japan’s core consumer price index (CPI) for of Tokyo rose by 2.4% YoY in March, up from 2.2% in February, in line with market expectations. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept interest rates unchanged in its March policy meeting, adopting a cautious stance amidst global risks. However, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled that further rate hikes could be on the table if economic conditions evolve as projected. On the domestic front, Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD is preparing to establish a production unit near Hyderabad, marking Telangana as the first Indian state to host a BYD facility. The Telangana government has shortlisted three potential sites near Hyderabad for the proposed plant, as reported by ETV Bharat. In the bond market, the Indian government announced plans to borrow ₹8 trillion in the first half (H1) of FY26, accounting for around 54% of the total gross market borrowing target of ₹14.82 trillion, as per the expectations The plan also includes the issuance of ₹10,000 crore worth of sovereign green bonds (SGBs). Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is set to double the cap on investments by individual foreign investors in listed companies to 10%, aiming to boost capital inflows. This move will broaden the scope to include all foreign investors, potentially increasing the combined holding limit to 24%, as talks with the government and SEBI continue. Further, India is likely to undertake another round of import duty cuts before April 2. The list may cover four to five products, including select electronics, chemicals, plastics, aircraft, parachutes, and cruise ships, which currently attract duties ranging from 7.5% to 10%. Asian market Asia markets opened lower today tracking losses on Wall Street as U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats kept investors on edge. Brent: 73.44, DXY: 104.28, USD10Y: 4.35%, GIFTNIFTY: -0.05% The monthly expiry trade closed higher at 23,592, suggesting that the Index has likely completed its corrective phase. It has filled the bullish gap zone and formed a Piercing candlestick pattern, indicating potential upward momentum. The immediate resistance is at 23,800, and a breakout above this level could drive the Index toward the psychological mark of 24,000. On the downside, support is seen at 23,400. The BankNifty has also formed a strong bullish candle, indicating the continuation of the current uptrend. The downside appears to be protected at 51,050, with 52,060 acting as a strong resistance level. We are bullish on Hero Motocorp from the Auto sector, as it has broken out from an Inverted Head and Shoulder formation with strong volume. Additionally, the Energy sector is poised to clear its previous swing high, supported by a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern. In the IT segment, Persistence shows strength, forming a bullish flag and pole pattern, although we are waiting for the breakout. The Pharma sector appears to be in the final phase of an Inverted Head and Shoulder formation, suggesting a strong rally post-breakout. From the Broader Markets, Sharda Cropchem looks strong after a Symmetrical Triangle breakout, while stocks like Ramco Cements and Tejas Network are on the verge of an Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern breakout. SEBI has proposed that exchanges should stay with F&O expiry on Tuesday & Thursday. This may mean that NSE reverts to expiry on Thursday (from Monday) & BSE stays with Tuesday expiry. This may abate concerns around BSE’s potential loss of mkt share and impact on EPS (we estimated ~12%). Clarity on OI limits is awaited but impact of that is lower for BSE. Stock has retraced majority of its fall, but lower reg. risks & better mkts can aid re-rating.

Trump’s proposed auto tariffs are really bad as signals major trade war escalation. # Please note, amidst Trump tariff woes, gold prices have spiked towards $3,051 per ounce, flirting with their historic highs, driven by its safe-haven appeal as the announcement of US auto tariffs heightened concerns over next week’s reciprocal measures. # So, for the day, we will spy with one big eye if Nifty bulls can absorb ‘Trump Tariff Blow’. # The sentiments are dented as the street is unable to make up their mind about how disruptive US President Donald Trump’s tariff will be. # Technically, Nifty’s biggest make-or-break support is now placed at 23401 mark. Confirmation of strength only above Nifty 23857 mark. # Traders also are likely to reposition ahead of US PCE inflation data to be wired this Friday (March 28th). # Amongst stock specific action; 1) Larsen & Toubro is in focus on bagging orders worth around Rs 15,000 crore from QatarEnergy LNG. 2) BSE’s stock price jumped nearly 5% as gains came after the company announcing that its board will meet on March 30 to consider a bonus share issue. 3) Bajaj Housing Finance (+8%) jumped out of the gate The stock surged during the bi-annual rebalancing exercise of NSE indices. (Bajaj Housing Finance, which will start trading on the Nifty Next 50 or the Nifty Junior index from Friday, March 28, would have likely received net inflows worth up to $17 million). 4) Dilip Buildcon (+5%) shares jumped after its JV won a ₹2,631 crore order from BSNL for the BharatNet project. 5) DCM Shriram board approves setting up of 12 TDP integrated compressed biogas plant at company’s Ajbapur unit.

Mehta Equities Market kya lagta hain@ 7.30am – Friday, March 28th 2025 US President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on imported cars and auto parts, a move aimed at boosting domestic automotive manufacturing by incentivizing automakers to invest in the United States. The tariff, effective from April 3, is expected to generate approximately $100 billion annually for the US economy, marking a significant shift in US trade policy. The policy affects not only fully assembled vehicles but also key automotive components such as engines, transmissions, powertrain systems, and electrical assemblies. This decision is likely to disrupt global supply chains, with significant repercussions for India’s auto parts industry, which supplies major US and global automakers. Indian automotive component manufacturers, many of whom are integral to the global supply chain, now face potential cost escalations and trade uncertainties. The increased tariffs could reduce exports to the US, forcing Indian companies to explore alternative markets or establish local manufacturing units within the United States to bypass the tariffs. This policy shift aligns with Trump’s broader “America First” economic agenda, prioritizing domestic production over foreign imports. However, it also raises concerns about rising vehicle prices in the US, potential trade tensions with major auto-exporting nations, and the long-term impact on global automotive investments.

Geopolitical tensions, trade policy uncertainties, volatility in international commodity prices and financial market uncertainties pose considerable risks to India’s economic growth in the next fiscal, however the outlook for inflation remains benign, Ministry of Finance said on March 26. In its Monthly Economic Review for February 2025, the ministry highlighted, “domestic private sector capital formation, focused on India’s solid fundamentals and economic prospects, will be an important driver of economic growth in FY26.” The review pointed out that supportive fiscal measures, accommodative monetary policy, and the Union Budget’s focus on longer-term development reforms will strengthen India’s domestic economic resilience amidst significant global uncertainties. India’s economy is expected to grow between 6.3 and 6.8 percent in FY26. On the inflation front, the finance ministry expects food prices to remain benign given estimates of agricultural production. Retail inflation eased to 3.6 percent in February 2025 as food prices eased. The monthly economic review noted that India’s economic performance in the latter half of FY25 was supported by strong agricultural and service sector growth, alongside steady private consumption. The report highlighted that “real GDP and real GVA are estimated to have grown by 6.2 per cent in Q3 FY25. This reflected a rebound in economic activity from Q2 FY25, in which GDP growth was 5.6 per cent.” Growth in the agricultural sector was particularly strong at 4.6 percent in FY25, driven by robust kharif output and positive rabi prospects. India’s fiscal management also remains on track, with the Union Budget 2025-26 laying out a prudent fiscal consolidation path. “The Union Budget 2025-26 announced a cautiously ambitious debt consolidation path that projects union government debt to decline by at least 5.1 percentage points over a six-year period from 2024-25 to 2030-31.” The government maintained a balance between fiscal consolidation, welfare, and growth, ensuring that “there is a close convergence of actual deficits, critical ratios, and essential expenditures with their budget estimates, indicating a sustained commitment to fiscal targets.” Meanwhile, trade performance showed mixed trends. While India’s total exports increased by 6.2 percent year-on-year during April-February FY25, merchandise exports recorded only marginal growth of 0.1 percent, weighed down by weaker petroleum product exports. However, services exports remained resilient, contributing to an overall trade surplus. “India’s exports have recorded softer growth thus far in FY25. However, a robust services trade surplus continues to offset the impact of lower growth in merchandise exports.” Foreign investments saw a decline in net FDI due to increased repatriation and outbound investments. Nonetheless, the finance ministry remains optimistic about India’s capital market resilience, supported by steady fiscal management and policy reforms. “Despite the sell-off by FPIs and heightened global market turbulence, the Rupee continues to be amongst the least volatile currencies as compared to its peers.” India’s inclusion in the Bloomberg Emerging Market Local Currency Index is expected to further bolster foreign investment in debt markets. Labour market indicators reflected stability, with the urban unemployment rate declining to 6.4 percent in Q3 FY25, accompanied by improvements in labour force participation and workforce expansion. Payroll data from EPFO indicated a net addition of 17.89 lakh members in January 2025, reflecting a continued increase in formal sector employment. The report stated that “various indices and surveys reveal positive sentiments towards hiring.” Despite global uncertainties, the finance ministry reiterated that “strong macroeconomic fundamentals, sustained investment, and policy support would help India navigate external risks while maintaining a steady growth trajectory in the upcoming fiscal year.” HCL Tech: Company partners with Samsung to enhance Semiconductor innovation.

Title: Broadcom's AI Boom: How High Can This Semiconductor Giant Go?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/03/25/broadcoms-ai-boom-how-high-can-this-semiconductor-giant-go/

Full Content:
ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Broadcom Inc is a semiconductor giant, making the chips and infrastructure that power the most advanced computing systems in the world. Broadcom’s technology is everywhere, whether it’s the hyperscalers such as Amazon and Alphabet training large AI models or enterprises integrating AI-driven applications. But the more interesting thing is that the company just delivered another blowout quarter, with revenue exploding and AI-related sales skyrocketing. It's also very profitable, with a very high expected adjusted EBITDA margin, which is rare in semiconductors. Despite a premium valuation, Broadcom's future still looks bright with strong cash flow and noteworthy partnerships. Also, as the stock has dropped 16% YTD, this dip might be a buying opportunity before the next leg up and the stock could continue to surprise investors. The question is, how high can Broadcom go? Let's dive in to find out. Broadcom crushed estimates in its first quarter of fiscal 2025. The AI hardware leader beat on earnings-per-share (EPS) of $1.60 by 9 cents and significantly surpassed revenue expectations of $14.92 billion, $330 million ahead of estimates. The 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth of the company is a result of continued heavy investment by data centers and hyperscalers upgrading their AI infrastructure. Infrastructure software revenue clocked in at 47% and Broadcom's semiconductor solutions revenue grew 11% year over year on broad-based demand across its portfolio. Now, let’s talk a bit about AI spending, which is only accelerating, placing Broadcom to ride a long-term tailwind. Tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Apple are shelling out in order to stay at the forefront of the AI race, and Broadcom is benefiting from their activities. The company's Q1 AI-related revenue increased 77% compared to the previous year to $4.1 billion, which is clear evidence of the growing demand for its AI-optimized chips and connectivity solutions. And this is only the beginning. The data center and AI-related hardware and software market are seen as expanding at a ridiculous 40-55% annually toward $1.4 trillion by 2027. As more and more industries increasingly adopt AI usage in their business processes, the demand for AI infrastructure will quickly increase and Broadcom is well set to take a large portion of it. Strong free cash flow momentum: Beyond top-line growth, Broadcom's free cash flow (FCF) increased even faster than revenue, which is evidence of strong cash generation and operational efficiency by Broadcom. The company generated a FCF of $6.0 billion, up 28% YOY. This figure outpaced revenue growth by three percentage points. It also meant a 40% FCF margin, up 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter and validating Broadcom's ability to reinvest in growth, pay down debt and return capital to shareholders. Since Broadcom is executing flawlessly and AI demand is growing rapidly, the company should continue to deliver brilliant results in the quarters ahead. Q2 FY25 looks just as strong as well. Revenue is expected to come in around $14.9 billion, which is a strong 19% YOY increase, a symbol that the demand for its products is not slowing down anytime soon. And with no surprise, the biggest driver is AI. Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue alone is expected to be around $4.4 billion in the quarter due to hyperscalers spending on AI XPUs and connectivity solutions. This is a huge tailwind, and it resonates with the importance of Broadcom's tech in driving the AI revolution. Finally, their profitability with an expected 66% adjusted EBITDA margin is more impressive. That's rare in semis, but such a mix of high-value AI chips and infrastructure software of Broadcom maintains fat margins. Broadcom is pushing the semiconductor innovation boundaries as hyperscalers step it up on AI investments. Its tech has become extremely essential, and the company's Q2 expectations in AI semiconductor revenue are a testament to that. The company is pouring resources into R&D to keep ahead, putting focus on cutting-edge AI XPUs and networking. It is developing a 10,000 teraflops XPU with 2nm 3.5D packaging and scaling AI clusters to 1 million XPUs on Ethernet. On the networking side, it has doubled RAID capacity and is prepping 1.6T bandwidth switches for sampling. These advancements in AI will be game-changers in the AI accelerator industry. Strategically, Broadcom is winning big. Just recently, two more hyperscalers tapped Broadcom for AI XPUs in order to draw on its stature as a key enabler of AI infrastructure. Now the company is making Alphabet’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Microsoft's Maia, Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Meta Platforms' MTIA, and ByteDance's AI ASIC chips, essentially providing the custom silicon for the biggest names in AI. Broadcom's balanced model of high-margin software and AI-driven hardware is shown by this deep integration across most of the major cloud and AI players and the VMware-driven enterprise software growth. If Broadcom continues at this speed, the company might cement itself as one of the most powerful forces in AI infrastructure. Broadcom has done an excellent job of maintaining an earnings consistency track record, having either met or beaten EPS estimates in every quarter over the past few years. Such outperformance speaks to the company's business model's enduring power as well as the ability to drive continued growth. Broadcom Inc Price Chart Investors have taken notice as Broadcom's stock price has surged 53% over the past year and a whopping 931% over the past half-decade. This performance is not simply luck but instead reflects the company's strategic positioning in AI-driven semiconductors and enterprise software. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Chart Looking ahead, Broadcom is set to post robust earnings and revenue growth. The EPS for FY2025 and FY2026 are projected to increase substantially YOY, at $6.62 and $7.86 respectively. Nonetheless, seeing how Broadcom has a track record of exceeding estimates, it can do the same in the future as well. If Broadcom delivers results in line or above the past quarters by the same margin of say 3-5%, then its EPS for FY2025 can touch $6.80-$6.95 and for FY2026 can cross $8.00. This means that the potential of this outperformance will make its valuation even more attractive. Premium price? Not really: Broadcom's forward P/E at 28.7 may seem elevated at first glance compared to traditional value stocks. However, as stated above, premium valuations are justified if a company generates superior growth. Broadcom's earnings trajectory supports its multiple in its case. A deeper look at Broadcom's Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) ratio provides further evidence that it is relatively cheap. The stock is trading at a PEG ratio of 1.31, based on a forward P/E of 28.7 times and a matching EPS growth rate. Broadcom's PEG indicates that the company is attractively priced in view of its strong earnings trajectory and is notably 18.75% lower than the sector median of 1.67. The bottom line is that despite the premium valuation of Broadcom, the stock is still relatively cheap when one takes into consideration its growth rate. With a solid track record of consistent estimate beats and strong EPS and revenue growth, Broadcom has a lot of room to run. In FY2025, EPS is forecasted to be $6.62, rising to $7.86 in FY2026 and higher. This implies a short-term price target of about $205 to $210 (based on FY2025 estimates) given this company's forward P/E of approximately 28.7 times. In the long-term, EPS is expected to rise to $9.12 in FY2027 and $12.74 in FY2028. If it happens, a conservative P/E multiple of about 21 times implies the stock should trade near $280-$290 in 3-4 years. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Trends Bullish case scenario: If Broadcom exceeds estimates, due to AI demand, networking expansion, and software growth, EPS would grow faster than expected. If EPS reaches $7.00 in FY2025 and $8.25 in FY2026, and the market rewards Broadcom with a higher multiple of 32 times P/E, the stock could trade above $235 in the short-term. And if EPS hits $10.50 by FY2027 and $14.00 by FY2028, a 23-25 times P/E multiple would take the stock to $350-$375 within the next few years in the long-term bullish case. Broadcom Price Target Scenarios Broadcom insiders have been selling a notable amount of stock over the past year, which naturally piques some eyebrows. CEO Hock Tan sold $26 million worth of shares at $173 each, one of the biggest sales. It seems concerning, but as it was only 10% of his holdings, it's not necessarily a red flag. In addition, insider selling dropped in the past three months and no insider sales occurred in the past month, perhaps implying that the company's executives hang on to their shares after Broadcom's latest earnings release. Furthermore, Broadcom's 1.3% insider ownership worth $14 billion is still a good thing. It is not a huge stake, but it is a statement that executives and important decision-makers have an interest in the company's long-term success. Institutional investors are stepping in: Although there have not been any insider buys recently, institutional investors are increasingly confident in Broadcom's long-term potential, even as insiders are cashing out. Institutional buying tends to outweigh insider selling, as these funds are taking a long-term, research-backed approach. Broadcom Inc Number of Guru Trades While some gurus are taking profits or rebalancing, trades demonstrate a steady accumulation trend, which implies that large funds see Broadcom as a stock they want to hold or add to at current levels. One of the standout among them is Ken Fisher, the founder of Fisher Investments who currently has 23.9 million shares. Fisher uses tech stocks heavily in bull markets, as they are supposed to lead the rally. According to him, Broadcom is a key pillar of market strength, and his large stake in his firm reflects his confidence that the stock will continue to be this way. Balancing debt repayment with growth potential: Broadcom's insider selling could be deemed a strategic move of offloading shares at premium valuations to repay debt. Broadcom took on a big bet on debt with its $69 billion VMware acquisition and has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.14 which is very low, so it makes sense to lower leverage. That said, the company has enough free cash flow to reinvest in innovation while improving its balance sheet. If Broadcom continues to grow at such a pace, the dilution from insider sales may be minimal and the company may be able to grow past any concerns, making these insider sales a natural part of its financial strategy, not a reason to worry. Broadcom's growth trajectory is still very compelling, but a few risks may counter its bullish outlook. The biggest risk is Broadcom relying on Apple. Beginning with the iPhone 17 in 2H25, Apple's transition to in-house Wi-Fi chips could have a big impact on Broadcom's sales. This revenue stream may decline, provided Apple fully phases out Broadcom's chips over the next three years. Another concern is valuation risk. If growth fails or doesn't merit these superior multiples, Broadcom might face downward pressure. Lastly, profitability concerns remain. While sales are growing, gross margin expansion must be sustained. Investors would shift out of Broadcom if it grows revenue but cannot keep the margin momentum. Broadcom is in a perfect situation to take advantage of the AI boom and enjoy solid top and bottom-line growth. The long-term risk from Apple's move toward in-house chips is a big one, but the stock's AI momentum is more than enough to make up for lost revenue. Valuation too continues to be a point of debate, but the history of beating estimates and AI demand surging make its premium multiple justified. Insider selling might also make investors worry, which is justified and should be kept an eye on, but investors should not finalize their bet on a stock based on it. There are many other watch factors, for instance, maintaining profitability. Broadcom can stay ahead as long as it continues to expand margins with revenue growth. For now, the stock looks well positioned for long-term upside.

Trump's tariff threats have rattled global markets. But in India, the market slump isn't just about the new US president. Millions of small investors are feeling the squeeze, for other reasons than a trade war. It was FOMO, or Fear of Missing Out, that got Kanishk* to start investing in the stock market. He told DW that as India battled the second wave of COVID-19 in 2021, he started noticing ads on Instagram featuring social media influencers giving money-making tips. "I didn't want to miss out on this — the way people were making money. That, I would say, is the first thing that got me into the market," Kanishk said. He explained how, after initially investing in mutual funds, he gradually moved to trading on the stock market. Like a lot of amateur investors, he had no clue about the fundamentals of investing, he said, but he kept up with the market trends, "especially on Reddit," the US-based social media platform. And in the beginning, "everything was great."

Both Puj, a media professional from Kolkata, the capital of the state of West Bengal, and Shah, who runs a cultural center that teaches art and music in the western city of Ahmedabad, also started trading in the stock market sometime during the pandemic lockdown. "The market was doing so well it felt anyone who was making any money was making it in the markets," Shah said, who added that he bought random stocks, sometimes based on the recommendations of others. "Weirdly, whatever I did, I kept making money." Puj took a more guarded approach. "I knew that the market [was] in a euphoria stage, I was very aware of the bubble that was happening," she said. Then came September 2024 and all three were hit hard when the bubble burst. After months of rallying, the market eventually corrected, followed by a monthslong slump. For most Indians who started trading on the stock markets, the rally after the pandemic slump was a great time. It reflected the $275 billion (€250 billion) economic stimulus package Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government had injected in 2020.

"During COVID, people had surplus cash, and a large number of young investors entered the capital markets as retail investors," said Sagun Agrawal, a derivatives trader in the Indian capital markets and a financial literacy advocate for women. "This was positive for the markets as it boosted liquidity and created investable funds for capital formation." Online trading has become more popular thanks to new companies offering low brokerage fees and easy access to credit. One such option is Margin Trading Facility (MTF), which lets traders buy shares by paying only part of the cost upfront. The brokerage covers the rest as a loan, with interest. National Stock Exchange (NSE) data showed that between March 2020 and March 2024, the number of registered investors in India almost tripled to 92 million. India's NIFTY 50 stock market index went from about 8,000 points in March 2020 to record levels of more than 26,000 points in September 2024. For the retail investors caught up in the euphoria, it felt like nothing could go wrong — until it did. In the months since September last year, Indian equities have lost more than $1.2 trillion in value. In February, the NIFTY 50 benchmark index was down 16% from its peak, and on its longest losing streak since 1996. It was the worst performing global market. Small retail investors were among the worst hit. "Many of these [retail] investors were uninformed and chased hyped-up securities, leading to froth in the market. As corrections took place over the last six months, these investors faced major financial setbacks," said Agrawal. Bijoy Peter, a senior partner at Bangalore-based Germinate Investor Services, said one of the reasons for the market correction was the disparity between the soaring valuations of corporate India and their declining earnings. India's GDP growth had also slowed to 5.4% in the July-September 2024 quarter, he said. He also pointed to a lack of government spending in infrastructure and other sectors at the time, as well as other global factors. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) started pulling their money out of India. China started implementing significant stimulus measures in its market, which contributed to money moving there, he said. This movement of money out of India had a huge impact. "When such a large sum moves out, the effect is massive because investors have to sell their holdings. Selling at that magnitude has a huge impact on stock prices," Peter said. "As a result, the market began to fall." Peter added that a lot of positive developments initiated by the government had been overlooked by the market — including an increase in tax limits, measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India to inject liquidity into the banking system, as well as the announcement of increased infrastructure spending. Agrawal also noted that last September, the real sellers were Indian High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs) and high-value investors. They sensed that the market was overvalued and had limited scope for further upside, she said. "The major investors pulled their money out of the market, causing the decline, while smaller investors were left to bear the losses," one trader, who asked not to be named, told DW. While Indian markets have been navigating stormy waters over the last five months, some said the situation was starting to look up with the stock market experiencing significant gains last week. However, investors remained cautious amid US President Donald Trump's threats to impose reciprocal tariffs on India from April 2, calling India "a very big abuser" of tariffs.

Economist Dr. Surjit Bhalla, former executive director for India at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a member of the Economic Advisory Council to the second Modi government, said he was feeling bullish as Trump "has presented India with a unique opportunity for reform." "We've never had a chance like this before, particularly in areas like trade, foreign direct investment, and other key factors that drive GDP growth and profits." "For us, this is a crucial moment to implement much-needed reforms, both in the external sector and domestically, including areas like agriculture," Bhalla said. "This could be India's opportunity to advance to the next stage of reforms." Meanwhile, retail investors such as Kanishk, Shah and Puj, having survived hard times in the past few months, are bracing for the possible impact of Trump's threatened tariffs, while keeping their fingers crossed. Kanishk said he was more cautious now after the slump and was "taking the words of the finance influencer with a pinch of salt." Shah stopped trading about a year ago, sometimes reflecting on whether it was too early. "But seeing how stressed everyone is, I feel I might have dodged a bullet," he said. Puj has reworked her investment strategy altogether, she is staying put and buying only in small quantities when markets are down. Having seen all her investments in the red not too long ago, she said she is wiser now, adding, "Going down is not so fun." *names changed on request Edited by: Keith Walker
