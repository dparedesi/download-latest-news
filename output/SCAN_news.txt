Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Neilson Barnard / Getty Images Entertainment via Getty Images Very few investors can match Stanley Druckenmiller. He delivered an average annual return of over 30% over three decades at Duquesne Capital without a single losing year, but he does not own Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) today. We’ll look into why in a bit. Druckenmiller is a timeless icon who has done very well in the recent past, with his portfolio up 9.07% in just Q3 2025 alone. His current portfolio contains 62 holdings. You’d expect his top holdings to be the usual Mag 7, plus some AI stocks. After all, how can you perform well without investing in these stocks? Almost every hedge fund and ETF that tried to sidestep these stocks ended up lagging the market. Remember, Druckenmiller isn’t just any hedge fund manager. He has managed to do well with his top holdings being almost devoid of any AI software companies, with the only AI bet being Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Let’s take a look at his moves with these top AI companies he does not hold. Stanley Druckenmiller started adding Nvidia shares in late 2022, very early on after ChatGPT’s release. He bought in Q4 2022, Q1 2023, and Q2 2023. But starting in Q3 2023, he started shedding his NVDA stake. He sold for 5 straight quarters as NVDA stock climbed higher and higher. He sold his last NVDA share in Q3 2024, when NVDA stock reached nearly $135. The stock is at $178 today, so did Druckenmiller make a massive mistake? Likely not. His top 3 holdings today have done a lot better than Nvidia, and taking profits in 2024 and shifting into those were anything but a miscalculation. Druckenmiller likely identified that NVDA stock became too expensive for his liking and didn’t have comparable upside potential vs. the stocks he moved into. Druckenmiller has had an on-and-off relationship with Palantir. He sold over half his shares in Q3 2021, then bought in Q1 2022 and Q2 2022. Again, he sold for over a year straight from Q3 2022 to Q2 2023. He took a break from the stock before buying in Q1 2024, buying 770,000 shares before selling 94.6% of his shares (728,000) in Q3 2024. He sold whatever PLTR stock he had left in Q1 2025, presumably near the peak price of ~$120, as Palantir’s rally accelerated aggressively. PLTR stock has climbed up to $187.75 today. While he did miss out on Palantir’s gains since Q1, he took out big profits from Palantir and piled into what he saw as “safer” stocks with bigger upside. It would be out of order for an investor like Druckenmiller to pay an earnings multiple deep in the triple digits for PLTR stock. And this paid off. The top 3 stocks in his portfolio have all performed better than or equal to PLTR stock over the past 6 months. His biggest holding outperformed PLTR by over 2x, with the second-biggest holding outperforming it by nearly 3x (it is up 100% in the past 6 months). The third holding is essentially neck and neck with Palantir’s 35.8% performance. Druckenmiller has quite a long history with Eli Lilly, but we’ll be looking into transactions in the past 5 years. He bought for 3 straight quarters, in Q2 2022, Q3 2022, and Q4 2022. Druckenmiller then took profits for 6 straight quarters from Q1 2023 to Q2 2024 as he shed all his LLY stock holdings as the company did exceedingly well. He made a hefty profit doing so, only to re-enter in Q4 2024 as LLY stock dropped from the $900s range to the $700s range. Druckenmiller bought for 3 straight quarters but then ended up selling it all in Q3 2025, equalling a sale of 101,000 shares in total. Q3 had an average closing price of $744.53. LLY stock has since recovered and is at $1,054 as of this writing. Druckenmiller likely grew impatient with this drawn-out recovery and didn’t want to stay in the loop with the company, especially with the uncertainty surrounding drug prices as the government got involved. And again, while he missed out on gains on LLY, his top holdings have delivered much more. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: Broadcom Can’t Stop Falling. Overreaction or AI Stock Warning Sign?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chris Hondros / Hulton Archive via Getty Images Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has delivered a strong performance in 2025, with shares up approximately 46% year-to-date, driven largely by demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-related semiconductors and custom chips. The stock reached an all-time high of $414.61 per share last week. However, following the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, its shares have declined sharply. The day after it hit its peak — which beat expectations on revenue and earnings per share — the stock fell more than 11% in a single session over concerns about gross margin pressure from a higher mix of AI revenue. Additional declines followed, with shares dropping another 5.6% yesterday, resulting in a cumulative drop of more than 17% over three trading days. Broadcom’s stock is trending lower again this morning in premarket trading. Broader concerns about AI investment returns and profitability have pressured multiple AI-related stocks in recent weeks, though Broadcom had held up better until this pullback. Shares are roughly flat over the prior month. The question for investors is, does this sharp drop indicate more downside ahead, or is it a back-up-the-truck opportunity in a company with robust long-term AI prospects? Broadcom’s ascent in 2025 stemmed primarily from explosive growth in its AI semiconductor business. Fiscal fourth-quarter AI revenue hit $6.5 billion, up 74% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for custom AI processors and networking solutions from hyperscalers such as Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Anthropic, and OpenAI. The chipmaker secured major contracts, including partnerships for custom chips, that contributed to overall revenue growth of 28% in the quarter. Its infrastructure software segment — bolstered by the 2023 VMware acquisition — provided additional ssupport with recurring subscription revenue. These factors propelled the stock’s gains this year, outpacing many peers and solidifying Broadcom’s position as a key beneficiary of the AI infrastructure buildout. Yet, the sharp decline began after the earnings release. Despite beating estimates and guiding for strong first-quarter revenue, management highlighted gross margin pressure from an increase in AI revenue, which carries lower margins than some traditional segments. This sparked investor worries about near-term profitability in the AI boom. The sell-off intensified during a broader rotation out of AI-related stocks, spurred by reports of delayed data center projects and debates over returns on hyperscaler capital expenditures. Rising debt levels have also weighed on the sector. Semiconductor indexes fell significantly — the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, comprising the 30 largest U.S.-traded semiconductor stocks, is down more than 6% — with Broadcom leading decliners on multiple days. Profit-taking after the year’s massive run also played a role, as expectations had run high heading into earnings, a classic buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news situation. Analysts, though, remain overwhelmingly positive on Broadcom’s outlook. Consensus ratings remain a Strong Buy, with an average one-year price target of $455 per share, implying 33% upside. UBS raised its target to $475 per share after the earnings report, while Trusit Financial set an industry high of $500 per share. Analysts seemed unanimous in their outlook, all reiterating buy or better ratings, citing sustained AI demand, a large backlog, and potential for accelerated growth next year. They point to Broadcom’s leadership in custom AI chips and networking as supporting further sales growth. Broadcom trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 25x based on fiscal 2026 estimates, with a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.69 when factoring in its expected 36% long-term EPS growth. Analysts project that strong earnings expansion will be driven by AI, making Broadcom’s current valuation appear reasonable based on its growth prospects compared to its historical multiples. The chipmaker’s recent drop reflects short-term concerns over margins and AI spending worries rather than any fundamental weakness in demand. With analysts maintaining Buy ratings and lofty price targets, plus ongoing AI revenue acceleration, dips like this present buying opportunities for long-term investors focused on Broadcom’s dominant position in AI infrastructure.

Title: Nifty Mid Caps To Offer 22% Upside, Says CLSA's Laurence Balanco

Time Published: 2025-12-15T01:29:22Z
Full Content:
After predicting Nifty to reach 28,800 levels in 2026, CLSA technical analyst Laurence Balanco believes Nifty mid-cap stocks stocks are offering a major buy signal and could deliver gains of up to 22%. In his latest Price Action note for CLSA, Balanco highlighted that the Nifty Midcap index has pulled back to a key confluence of support. This means the index is currently an attractive entry point for investors. Balanco adds that the Nifty Midcap index recently tested the 13,500–13,510 zone. This has been identified by Balanco as a key critical zone as it aligns with the 50-day moving average (DMA) and the upper boundary of the consolidation pattern seen throughout 2024 and 2025. Thursday’s intraday reversal at this level could signal selling exhaustion, which in turn means the correction in the index is likely over. This is what Balanco deduces from the recent price action. CLSA anticipates the index will now resume its breakout from a massive "cup-and-handle" formation. "Pattern continues to support an upside target of 16,800–16,820, implying a potential gain of roughly 22%," the note stated. While Nifty Midcaps could be in a position to offer attractive upside, CLSA is also bullish on the benchmark Nifty 50. Balanco himself had said earlier this month that the benchmark could reach 28,800 levels in 2026. For this week, Balanco observed that Nifty 50 has established a solid support base between 25,275 and 25,318 following a recent corrective phase. As long as the index holds above the broader support zone of 24,448–25,669, Balanco expects a breakout above the 2024 highs. The brokerage firm has set a Nifty target of 26,700–26,800, based on the consolidation pattern formed between July and October.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © stocknroll / E+ via Getty Images It’s the big question on the minds of investors even before the month of December starts: Will stocks be treated to a Santa Claus rally again this year? Of course, Santa doesn’t come around every single year, and while a market pullback alongside a big lump of coal could be left under the tree instead, I’d argue that it makes more sense to consider the year ahead or even the next three years than the next three weeks. Like it or not, seasonal rallies don’t always materialize, even when it seems like a Goldilocks environment is in place, and the stage is set for markets to end a strong year with one last final leg higher. While it’s impossible to know what’s up next in the near term, I do find the following stocks a great value as we enter the best time of the year. For some reason or another, it feels like a lackluster year for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), even though it’s way ahead of the S&P, up close to 33% year to date. Historically speaking, it’s a less remarkable year for the stock, even though the results have been nothing short of spectacular. Undoubtedly, it seems as though expectations have caught up with the legendary GPU maker. And while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google TPUs and other ASICs could erode a bit of the competitive edge, I do think that it’s a mistake to count Nvidia out of the game, given the power of raw AI compute. If AI innovators are serious about moving on the path to recursive self-improvement and achieving some form of superintelligence, arguably, there isn’t enough computing power to go around. While Google TPUs pose a risk to Nvidia’s dominance, I’d argue that the massive performance leap made by Gemini 3.0 shows that AI advancement isn’t plateauing. And, at the end of the day, that’s good news for the AI trade and demand for all kinds of AI chips. While Dr. Michael Burry might be betting against the firm, I wouldn’t seek to do the same, especially as AI monetization, agents, and continued advancement en route to AGI pave the way for continued spend on AI compute. Speaking of big AI spending, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) seems willing to swing for the fences, with a significant debt load and the potential to take on even more debt to keep building. Undoubtedly, the legacy software company is undergoing a profound, but pricey, and arguably risky debt-fuelled transformation. There’s a lot of execution and overbuild risk here. And there’s also the risk of what happens to OpenAI, one of its biggest customers. Though Oracle shares aren’t without more than their fair share of risk, I do think there’s also explosive upside if management can deliver and AI demand stays robust through 2030. At this juncture, all signs suggest there isn’t enough compute to go around, and Oracle would be right to be aggressive about scaling up and improving its slice of profits in the AI revolution. In any case, if there’s a global AI compute shortage, more firms on the supply side have to step up to the plate. While companies across the board could pull back on spending, especially if monetization doesn’t live up to its potential, or if a “data wall” of sorts drags on the pace of model advancement, I do think far fewer investors are focusing on what could go right these days (many analysts see considerable upside from these depths), especially as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) accelerates its growth and becomes a bigger slice of the total revenue pie. Undoubtedly, anywhere there’s a considerable debt load and nerves about a potential AI bubble bust, there’s bound to be extreme fear about what could happen if things don’t go as planned (think an AI pause or cooldown of sorts). And while I’m no fan of adding to an already sizeable debt pile to keep the foot on the gas, I do think Oracle’s bold bet might just pay off as AI innovators seek as much compute as they can get to power the AI revolution. After tumbling close to 12% on a second-quarter revenue miss, I think there might be an opportunity to buy. The AI backlog is booming, and guidance is upbeat, but, then again, it’s hard to ignore the free cash flow situation and all that debt, which may very well backfire in a big way if an AI bubble does burst in the new year.

Title: 3 Growth Stocks That Could Be Due for a Face-Ripping Rally in 2026

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Koto Amatsukami / Shutterstock.com I left my crystal ball at home, but I’m going to be doing my best halloween impression in trying to put forward three growth stock picks that could be due for major rallies in the year to come. I do think 2026 will be a year that will feature plenty of innovation, in a number of different sectors. From artificial intelligence to machine learning to a plethora of other growth areas of the economy set to be reshaped by innovative new technologies, there are plenty of unique opportunities in this market for investors to choose from. I’d argue there are hundreds or thousands of such companies that will likely outpace the growth of the market in the year to come. That said, over the years I’ve condensed my watch list down to a few companies I watch intently. Among this group, here are three of the top opportunities I think could soar in 2026, if conditions remain in place for this bull market rally to continue. One of the more speculative small-cap picks I’ve been pounding the table on of late is The Metals Company (NASDAQ:TMC). I’m not going to stop, as nothing’s changed for me about the company’s underlying growth thesis. In fact, I’d argue that recent developments make this stock even more attractive for those with truly long-term investing time horizons. With a number of recent permit approvals to continue exploratory mining activity, and the potential to take a first-mover position in a highly lucrative sector pending some additional approvals that need to take place, TMC is a company that’s closer than many think to commercial mining operations. The question is how to value the company’s future cash flows, and that’s tricky business. But I’d argue that so long as the commercialization story continues on the track it’s on, the current positioning of The Metals Company provides plenty of upside potential. As revenue and earnings continue to grow off of a very low base, I think this is a stock that could have parabolic upside at the end of the day, and 2026 could be the year the fireworks really take off. In the world of mega-cap tech stocks, I’d suggest that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could actually have one of the most attractive forward price-earnings multiples of any of its peers. At just 24-times forward earnings, Nvidia’s status as a leading growth stock may only be unmatched by value investors looking at this company and deciding to pick up shares for their own portfolio. I’m not going to go so far as to say Nvidia is cheap here, but it’s the cheapest this stock has been in years on a relative price-earnings-to-growth ratio. My recent piece covering the bull thesis around Nvidia, and specifically how this stock could get to $300 per share, is worth a read. But the gist of this article is really that the company’s next-generation Rubin chips could be the key to unlocking massive growth in the New Year. We’ll have to see how AI companies adopt new chip technologies, and if competitors will eat into Nvidia’s market share. That’s certainly a risk. But in terms of stocks with massive upside potential in 2026, I think it would be negligent for most investors to not at least take a look at Nvidia here. If there’s one Magnificent 7 stock with a more attractive valuation multiple than Nvidia, we’re probably talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). Shares of the search giant have absolutely soared of late due to a variety of bullish factors. The company’s Tensor Processing Units, used in Alphabet’s core Gemini LLM platform (but also increasingly being used by other players in the AI race), provides Alphabet with its latest cash flow growth catalyst investors are trying to price in.
