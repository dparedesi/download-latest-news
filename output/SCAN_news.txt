Title: Travel Back in Time to 2009… and Buy Tech
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/travel-back-in-time-to-2009-and-buy-tech/
Time Published: 2025-02-20T23:00:14Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedFebruary 20, 2025 In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2009, I was obsessed with the risk of a “double-dip” recession. The outlook was bleak. The banks all seemed to be failing, stocks had crashed, housing was belly-up, and the Fed was printing money like mad. So instead of gobbling up cheap tech shares, I was primarily focused on hoarding my (meager) stash of precious metals and preparing for an armageddon which never came. The gold and silver investments worked out fine, and I’m extremely bullish on gold and silver going forward. But let’s be honest. I would have been better off if I had diversified and bought fast-growing U.S. tech companies at huge discounts. For example, in January of 2009 Amazon (AMZN) shares traded as low as $2.38 (split-adjusted). Today it trades at $222, nearly 100x higher. That opportunity has passed. But what if there was a similar setup to the Nasdaq in 2009 available today? I think I’ve found it. But be forewarned, some of you are going to hate it. I’ve been reluctant to write about it for a while now, but simply can’t hold it in any longer. It’s… Chinese tech. Over the past few years, China’s massive real estate bubble has popped. Our own Jim Rickards nailed this event, writing in July of 2021 that China was a Fragile Giant. China also confronts an insolvent banking system and a real estate bubble. Up to half of China’s investment is a complete waste. It does produce jobs and utilize inputs like cement, steel, copper and glass. But the finished product, whether a city, train station or sports arena, is often a white elephant that will remain unused. The Chinese landscape is littered with “ghost cities” that have resulted from China’s wasted investment and flawed development model. It was an incredible call by Jim. In the years following that article, the KraneShares China Internet ETF (KWEB) crashed 80% from its all-time high. KWEB is China’s equivalent to the Nasdaq 100. So this was China’s version of America’s 2008 bubble crash, on steroids. Fast forward to today, however, and I believe the bottom is finally in for Chinese tech firms. KWEB still trades about 66% below its all-time high. Here’s a 5 year KWEB chart: As you can see, China’s tech sector is still far below all-time highs. If this is the beginning of a new bull market, it’s still quite early. Importantly, today DeepSeek has changed the narrative around Chinese technology. Whether we like it or not, they’re making major progress in areas such as AI, nuclear, fusion, electric vehicles, phones, satellites, semiconductors, and even planes. There are certainly problems in China, such as overcapacity and ruthless competition eroding profit margins. And needless to say, the communist government structure isn’t ideal for tech firms. Nevertheless, China’s tech sector is cheap, hated, and in an uptrend. That is typically a recipe for gains. This morning Alibaba (BABA) beat earnings and jumped more than 10% in early trading. As I write this it’s still up around 7% at midday. Alibaba is the “Amazon of China”. It’s the country’s largest online retailer, and the largest cloud computing provider (just like Amazon). You could also call the company the “Paypal of China”, due to its 33% stake in Ant Group, which owns the all-encompassing Alipay payment app (think Paypal meets Visa). Alibaba is also one of the top 3 AI companies in China, and its leading AI model, Qwen Max 2.5, is competitive with ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Google’s top models. Alibaba has soared 80% over the past year. But it has huge amounts of room to run to get back to all-time highs. Here’s a 5-year chart of BABA: So… why did Alibaba shares crash, anyways? The first factor was the real estate bubble popping, which we covered above. But there’s more to the story. Back in 2021 and 2022, Alibaba was dominating in China a little too much. President Xi and the CCP didn’t like that. Alibaba’s subsidiary Ant Group was making big moves in the financial space, threatening to cut in on state-owned banks and other financial businesses. So the Chinese government laid the smack down on Alibaba, issuing huge fines and cancelling the IPO of Ant Group (Alipay). This is a real risk of investing in China. The government has too much power over business matters. But I think that risk has mostly passed. Today Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma have paid their fines, and their dues. A meeting with President Xi this week sealed the deal. Jack Ma and BABA are suddenly back in polite society. President Xi and the government have signaled support for the private sector, and are stimulating the economy with QE and cheap loans (as we did in 2009). To be clear, I don’t think Alibaba will deliver 100x returns from here. It’s already too large for those types of gains. But I think it still has a very nice run ahead of it. The Ant Group (Alipay) IPO could happen in the near future, which would be a major catalyst for the stock. In full transparency, over the past 7 months I’ve been buying Alibaba (BABA), Xiaomi (XIACY), and BYD (BYDDY). These are some of China’s hottest tech firms. I also recently added a China small-cap ETF (ECNS) and PGJ (China internet ETF). I plan to hold these positions for at least five years, if not longer. This week President Trump posted the following message on his Truth Social platform. Source: Truth Social Some of you may be surprised by President Trump’s friendly tone here. I am not. We need to make a trade deal with China, and soon, as we discussed last month. It’s in both countries’ interests. If a trade deal with China does go through, that should throw gas on the fire beneath Chinese tech stocks. Uncertainty around trade wars and tariffs has been a major factor holding back the sector. Overall I strongly believe the global trade wars are just beginning, but we may see some progress soon on the China front. To conclude, I believe the setup in Chinese tech today is quite similar to the Nasdaq in 2009. I may be wrong, but am willing to take that chance given the potential upside. It’s not very often we get a chance to buy fast-growing tech at a 66% discount. I’m not going to miss the opportunity this time, even if it means investing in a communist country. If some of you can’t stomach that, however, I completely understand. It’s not the hand I would’ve chosen, but it is the one we’ve been dealt. I believe China’s tech sector is in for a lucrative bull market ahead. Phew, it feels good to have that off my chest. Disclosure: Of the companies and funds mentioned in this article, the author owns Alibaba, Xiaomi, BYD, PGJ, and ECNS.

Title: New Crypto to 10X as Saylor’s Strategy Plans to Add $42B to Its $BTC Stash
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/new-crypto-to-10x-as-strategy-plans-to-add-42b-btc/
Time Published: 2025-02-19T10:04:10Z
Full Content:
Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is now one step closer to adding another $42B worth of Bitcoin ($BTC) to its balance sheet by 2027. Most importantly, all of the raised funds will go toward $BTC purchases. Strategy’s $BTC bet is paying off, as evident from its stock performance, so more institutional investors may add crypto to their portfolios soon–and not just $BTC. We share the best new crypto to benefit from the upcoming bull run. Strategy currently holds $45.88B worth of $BTC. On February 10, the company bought 7.6K $BTC for $742.4M at roughly $97K per coin. This brought Strategy’s BTC Yield, a KPI that measures the change in $BTC-to-diluted-share ratio over time, to 4.1%, up 1.2% from January 27. In an official statement, Strategy explained its new convertible notes will not accrue interest, so their principal amount is fixed. Investors, too, retain the option to recall their notes at face value from March 1, 2028, or if the company undergoes a fundamental corporate transformation. MSTR price barely reacted to the news–in fact, it dipped 1.1% since yesterday. However, MSTR’s yearly growth of 373% proves Saylor’s strategy is working. Growing institutional demand for $BTC is the main factor that drives a broader crypto rally this year. However, not all established altcoins and new crypto on presale will feel the effects equally. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the best meme coins that could explode when $BTC hits a new all-time high (ATH). When $BTC reaches the $150K and $200K price targets, BTC Bull Token will reward its community with $BTC airdrops. All you need to get free $BTC is to hold $BTCBULL in the Best Wallet app. Another massive airdrop, this time, of $BTCBULL tokens, will happen when $BTC hits $250K. The presale raised $2.3M in just a week, showing strong momentum. One $BTCCBULL now costs $0.00237, but the price is growing fast as more investors join the movement. Solana is now the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystem–the cumulative market cap of its tokens surged 9X in 2024. Unfortunately, the network struggles to handle the influx of new apps and users. This leads to congestion and, sometimes, failed transactions. Solaxy ($SOLX) introduces a Layer-2 solution that speeds up processing, lowers fees, and prevents network outages by offloading part of transactions from Solana mainnet to its side chain. It relies on the tried and tested Ethereum’s rollup architecture and thus is reliable for high-throughput applications like AI agent tokens and DeFi protocols. Solaxy’s native token, $SOLX, now costs $0.00164 on presale. Early adopters invested $22.2M into the project so far, and the next price uptick will happen when the project crosses the $22.8M milestone. After the $SOLX token launches on exchanges, it could reach $0.032. The much-anticipated deployment of Solaxy’s Layer-2 chain should support this momentum and help $SOLX hit $0.2 by the end of 2026. It might be time for Dogecoin ($SOGE) to retire, as another dog now dominates the meme coin sector–Broccoli. Broccoli is the dog of Binance’s founder Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ. Zhao received the dog as a gift from his Dubai-based friend and has since bonded strongly with the Belgian Malinois pup. CZ didn’t launch any tokens himself but promised he’d support top Broccoli-themed tokens on BNB Chain with extra liquidity. This triggered an influx of Broccoli coins to the market. FirstBroccoli ($BROCCOLI) is the original and best-performing Broccoli token. It hit the ground running the next day after CZ posted about his dog on X and already reached a $70M market cap. This morning, $BROCCOLI hit a new ATH of $0.0881 but has since corrected to $0.07, which might present an appealing entry opportunity for those who believe the token will see more upside. Strategy’s $42B $BTC expansion plan shows strong confidence in the $BTC-first, $BTC-only approach that made MSTR one of the best-performing US stocks. But for real investors, smaller-cap new crypto like $BTCBULL and $SOLX could offer greater returns due to their lower entry points. However, remember that the crypto market is volatile, and no gains are guaranteed, even with $BTC. Always DYOR and diversify your portfolio to offset potential losses.

One, it will lower the exports of its trade partners as local production rises, but India is unlikely to be impacted materially because only ~2% of its total finished steel exports in the first 9 months of this fiscal were to the US. Two, there will be a diversion of exporter inventory to other importer-nations at aggressive prices, especially in a milieu of increasing global competition. This could bring down the prices of steel in India, already trending at 4-year lows, further. That means the Indian government may have to step in with safeguard duty to support domestic capacities. The timing and quantum of this will be crucial. Three, incremental production by US mills will mean a reduction in the steel scrap available for exports. That is because, as much as ~70% of the steel industry there uses the electric arc furnace process, which typically involves converting scrap to produce steel.

Despite Gift Nifty signaling a positive start, our markets opened the week on a negative note. In the initial hours, Nifty slipped below the recent lows of 22800 but found support, preventing further selling pressure. Gradually, the index recovered throughout the session and ended near the high point, gaining 0.13% to close a tad above the 22950 mark. After an eight-day losing streak, Nifty finally posted gains, reaffirming strong support around 22800. From a technical standpoint, early signs of a potential double-bottom formation on the daily chart suggest a solid base at this level. We have been tracking a Falling Wedge pattern connecting the major lows of August and November. However, a closer look at recent price action reveals another Falling Wedge on a shorter timeframe, linking the lows of November and January. Looking ahead, strong support is evident at every 100-point interval, ranging from 22800–22700 (lower end of the wedge) to 22600–22500, which coincides with the 127% retracement of the early February rebound. Additionally, a two-point positive divergence on the RSI Smoothened suggests a potential shift towards positivity. Given these factors, we do not anticipate significant downside risks, and the bulls may attempt a recovery in the near term. Therefore, we advise traders to avoid panic selling and refrain from initiating fresh short positions. Instead, any dips can be viewed as opportunities to accumulate quality names in a staggered manner. That said, while we don’t want to sound too gung-ho, we prefer to take one step at a time. Immediate resistance is placed at 23250, aligning with the 20-day EMA and the intraday high on the hourly chart, while the upper boundary of the Falling Wedge near 23400 remains a critical hurdle. Traders should closely monitor these levels and plan their trades accordingly. · Pace of expansion may remain below Q1 FY2025 levels, led by industry · Rise in GDP to continue to trail GVA growth for the third quarter in a row ICRA has projected the year-on-year (YoY) expansion of the GDP to rise to 6.4% in Q3 FY2025 from the seven-quarter low of 5.4% in Q2 FY2025, benefitting from enhanced Government spending amid uneven consumption. Further, the growth in the gross value added (GVA) is estimated to record a relatively broad-based improvement to 6.6% in Q3 FY2025 from 5.6% in Q2 FY2025, driven by the industrial (to +6.2% from +3.6%), services (to +7.7% from +7.1%), and agricultural (to +4.0% from +3.5%) sectors. On a sombre note, the GDP and GVA growth in Q3 FY2025 is foreseen to continue to trail the NSO’s initial growth estimates for Q1 FY2025 (+6.7% and +6.8%, respectively), which had seen some sectors affected by the Parliamentary elections, the Model Code of Conduct, and also the heat wave in some states. ICRA estimates that the growth in net indirect taxes (in nominal terms) eased significantly to low single digits in the quarter from 7.9% in Q2 FY2025, owing to a sharp, albeit base effect-led rise in the YoY increase in subsidy disbursement by the Centre (to +31.1% in Q3 FY2025 from +4.3% in Q2 FY2025; -53.6% in Q3 FY2024; -7.6% in Q2 FY2024). As a result, the GDP expansion would continue to trail that in the GVA in Q3 FY2025 for the third quarter in a row, with a similar trend expected in the full year as well. Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head-Research & Outreach, ICRA said: “India’s economic performance in Q3 FY2025 benefitted from a sharp ramp-up in aggregate Government spending (Centre + state) on capital and revenue expenditure, high growth in services exports, a turnaround in merchandise exports, healthy output of major kharif crops etc., which would have buffered rural sentiment. Some consumer-focussed sectors saw a pick-up during the festive season, even as urban consumer sentiment dipped slightly, and other sectors such as mining and electricity saw an improvement after weather-related challenges in the previous quarter. Overall, while we expect the pace of GDP and the GVA expansion to rise in Q3 FY2025 relative to the seven-quarter low prints for the previous quarter, marking an upturn, the performance may remain inferior to the NSO’s initial estimates for Q1 FY2025.” Zen Technologies stock plunges 10% on Q3 results, despite buy calls, as company faces growth concerns and order delays. 360 ONE Asset acquires 15% stake in Bharti AXA Life Insurance, enhancing growth, innovation, and market presence in India.

This is due to the economic uncertainty looming in the market on the back of tariff threats by Donald Trump right after his arrival in the power again. The overall imports of Gems & Jewellery for January 2025 stood at USD 1421.61 million (Rs. 12269.41 crore) showing a decline of 37.83% as compared to USD 2286.55 million (Rs. 19008.4 crore) for the same period last year. While there may be multiple factors like loosened demand due to end of wedding season, this also indicates the strengthening aatmanirbharta of Indian Gems & Jewellery sector where the domestic demand is met by domestic jewellery manufacturers, thus having less to no reliance on international players for finished jewellery products. Commenting on the same, Colin Shah, MD, Kama Jewelry said, “With Trump coming back into power and aggressively pushing massive tariff hikes, the impact of the same is evidently visible on overall global trade activities. We are in a wait-and-watch situation to monitor Trump’s tariff stance, which will decide how the global market will navigate through these times. However, a gradual rebound in trade activities could be seen in the upcoming months once there is absolute clarity.” Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE). Slow going and going slowly We do not find much value in most parts of the market despite the recent sharp correction in the market. The Indian market may stay lackluster, weighed down by (1) rich valuations across sectors and stocks, (2) potential earnings downgrades and (3) higher-for-longer global interest rates. The 3QFY25 results season did little to change our cautious view of the market. Not much value as yet despite sharp correction in parts of the market We do not find much value in most parts of the market despite the sharp correction in several sectors and stocks in the past few months. Most sectors and stocks are still trading at rich valuations, with the extent of overvaluation rising in inverse correlation to market capitalization, quality and risk. FPIs may not return in a hurry; DIIs are buying in a hurry The battle between FPIs and DIIs will likely continue in the next few months, with (1) FPIs likely to continue with their cautious stance, given a challenging global investment environment for EMs and (2) DIIs likely to deploy aggressively, given (1) high cash positions with MFs and (2) possibly strong (though tapering) inflows from retail investors. However, a period of low trailing returns could dampen return expectations among retail investors and inflows into domestic mutual funds. The 12-month return of the NSE-50 Index, the Nifty Midcap 100 Index and the Nifty 100 Smallcap 100 Index has come down to 5%, 3% and (-)3% with negative returns of 5%, 12% and 15% in the past six months. Challenges emerging in both macro and micro India’s macroeconomic position has deteriorated somewhat in the past few months, with (1) a continued slowdown in consumption demand (especially of basic staple items), reflecting the income and inflation challenges for the low-income households, (2) a likely slowdown in government capex (one of the drivers of the economy until recently) and (3) increased pressure on the external position (low BoP surplus, a sharp decline in FX reserves and a weakening INR). 3QFY25 results and management commentary showed (1) a modest deterioration in the asset quality of banks, led by the MFI book of small finance banks and MFI-NBFCs, (2) continued weakness in consumption demand despite some recovery in rural demand, but (3) strong momentum in investment. 3QFY25 results weak in general; misses punished 3QFY25 net income of the Nifty-50 Index grew 8.8%, moderately ahead of our expectation of 7.8% growth, and 3QFY25 net income of the KIE coverage universe grew 8.2%, moderately below our expectation of a 9.2% increase. 3QFY25 EBITDA of the Nifty-50 Index increased 6.7% versus our expectation of 5.1% growth. The weak 3QFY25 operating results again highlighted some of our long-standing concerns around (1) the Street’s optimistic profitability and volume assumptions and (2) disruption threats across sectors India’s sugar output is expected to fall to 26 million tons this season due to disease affecting the cane crop in Uttar Pradesh. Sugar production is expected to rebound next season, but supplies will remain tight in the near term due to lower output in Thailand and other countries. Tight refined sugar supplies will boost white sugar’s premium over raw sugar, with world sugar prices needing to stay above $530 a ton to incentivize exports.

The market construct doesn’t favour a rally in the market. FIIs are likely to continue to sell. News flows are not positive. The US market continues to be strong and may attract more capital flows to the US from other markets. A new development is from the Chinese authorities indicating a new perspective regarding the Chinese government’s approach to Chinese businesses. President Xi has indicated the need for a “clean relationship” between government and business. This is regarded as a favourable development for reviving the Chinese economy, which is struggling now from the fall out of the crisis in the real estate sector. If the Chinese government’s new initiatives attract positive responses from the FIIs, that means more bad news for Indian markets. More money will flow into Chinese stocks through the Hang Seng exchange since the PE of the Hang Seng index is only around 12 compared to the 18.5 one-year forward PE in India. Since largecaps are fairly valued in India, calibrated buying in this segment can be done. But the market construct doesn’t favour aggressive buying.” Gold imports in January surged 40.79% to $2.68 billion due to rising domestic demand, says the commerce ministry Tesla Inc. plans to enter the Indian market, hiring for various roles after CEO Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Modi. Nifty-50 reported 5% YoY PAT growth, aligning with expectations but significantly weaker than the 20%+ CAGR seen between FY20-24. The slowdown in earnings momentum, coupled with increased market volatility and sector-specific challenges, has led to a more cautious investment outlook. BFSI, Healthcare, and Capital Goods Drive Stability BFSI led the earnings cycle, growing 11% YoY, with PSU banks (+24% YoY) outpacing private lenders due to lower credit costs and better asset quality. Healthcare posted 25% YoY growth, driven by chronic therapies and strong US generics demand. The Capital Goods sector expanded earnings by 20% YoY, benefitting from strong order inflows and continued government infrastructure spending. Technology (+9% YoY) remained resilient, though margin pressures persisted. Cyclicals and Consumer-Oriented Sectors Underperform Oil & Gas earnings declined 11% YoY, impacted by weak refining margins and crude price fluctuations. Cement had a difficult quarter (-55% YoY) as pricing pressures and cost inflation hurt profitability. Chemicals saw a 12% YoY earnings drop, affected by weak export demand and price corrections. Consumer and auto segments struggled with rural demand weakness, margin compression, and a cautious FY26 outlook. Key Sectoral Review – Diverging Performance Across Industries The sectoral performance in 3QFY25 was highly uneven, with some industries benefitting from strong structural tailwinds, while others struggled with demand contraction and cost pressures. Despite overall market weakness, select sectors like BFSI, Healthcare, Capital Goods, and Telecom posted resilient growth, whereas Cement, Oil & Gas, and Consumer Discretionary lagged behind. Sectoral Performance: Strength in BFSI, Healthcare & Infra BFSI continued to lead the recovery, with PSU banks benefitting from strong loan growth and lower credit costs. The Healthcare sector (+25% YoY) capitalised on steady demand for chronic medicines and an expanding generics market in the US. Capital Goods and Infrastructure remained strong (+20% YoY), supported by government-led capex and high order inflows. The Telecom sector also returned to profitability, driven by tariff hikes and subscriber growth. Cement, Oil & Gas, and Consumption Lag Behind Cement earnings plunged 55% YoY, impacted by weak pricing trends and cost inflation. Oil & Gas declined 11% YoY, with lower refining margins weighing on profitability. The Chemicals sector saw a 12% YoY decline, struggling with weak global demand and oversupply issues. Meanwhile, Consumer and Auto sectors continued to underperform, with subdued rural demand and margin pressures leading to muted growth expectations for FY26. Market Valuations Remain Elevated Despite weak earnings momentum, valuations remain stretched, with two-thirds of sectors still trading above their historical averages. The Nifty’s P/E ratio stands at 19.9x, marginally below its long-term average, while the P/B ratio at 3.1x reflects an 11% premium, suggesting limited upside without a strong earnings recovery. Our View: Navigating a Market at Crossroads: With the earnings downgrade cycle intensifying and macro uncertainties persisting, a selective investment strategy is imperative. The market is facing high valuations, slowing earnings growth, and volatility across key sectors, requiring a disciplined and resilient approach to portfolio construction. South Korea plans a record $249 billion trade policy financing to support exporters, reinforcing its commitment to strengthening global trade. China’s January bank lending hit a record high due to policy stimulus, while its tech sector is booming, reflecting strong innovation growth. The country is also strengthening strategic resource partnerships, with Congo emerging as a key supplier of copper. Japan’s GDP grew at an annualized 2.8% in Q4, exceeding forecasts due to strong consumption and business spending. The government has approved new climate, energy, and industry policies through 2040 to ensure long-term sustainability. Japan’s DBJ has also partnered with Indonesia’s INA to launch a hybrid fund for mid-sized businesses. India aims to boost trade with the US while balancing its tariff reactions. The country’s January trade deficit aligned with expectations, and the rupee is expected to take cues from dollar movements, while bond markets focus on liquidity changes. Indonesia recorded a trade surplus of $3.45 billion in January, primarily driven by weak imports. The country’s parliament is set to vote on mining law amendments, which could significantly impact its resource exports. Hong Kong regulators have hinted at allowing cryptocurrencies as proof of wealth, signaling a shift toward digital asset adoption. In Singapore, January exports fell 2.1% year-on-year, weaker than forecast, indicating external trade weakness. The UK is facing business concerns over impending tax hikes, while the housing market is beginning to slow due to recent tax policy changes. The Bank of England sees inflation slowing, though a temporary jump is expected in 2025. European shares have hit record highs, driven by optimism over potential peace developments in Ukraine. However, security demands continue to strain European finances, and German cities are struggling with rising costs amid a weak economy. In the US, Federal Reserve official Christopher Waller has warned against allowing policy uncertainty to paralyze rate decisions, indicating a proactive approach. Commodity markets are experiencing shifts as speculators reduce long positions in corn and soybeans. Meanwhile, BHP sees signs of economic recovery in China but remains cautious about potential trade tensions. The company has scrapped its $49 billion bid for Anglo American and is now focusing on organic growth rather than acquisitions. Source: Reuters Biocon Biologics Ltd, a fully integrated global biosimilars company and a subsidiary of Biocon Ltd, announced today that the European Commission has granted marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) for Yesintek, a biosimilar of Ustekinumab. Yesintek is intended for the treatment of adults and children with plaque psoriasis, as well as adults with psoriatic arthritis or Crohn’s disease. Clinical trial data demonstrated that the Ustekinumab biosimilar has comparable safety and efficacy to the originator product. Biocon shares were down 1.41% on the NSE, trading at ₹342.65 Patel Engineering Limited wins ₹1,090.45 crore irrigation project in Maharashtra, expanding its infrastructure portfolio with joint venture partnership. Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares After significant fluctuations, the Index settled higher at 22,960, successfully defending the 22,800 level for the third time in recent weeks, reinforcing it as a strong support. On the upside, the 23,100 level remains a key immediate resistance, and a breakout in either direction is crucial for establishing a clear market trend. Similarly, BankNifty has defended its support at 48,750 and reversed, with resistance at 49,750 still intact. From a sectoral perspective, most sectors have formed neutral to positive candles, suggesting a potential trend reversal. A close above the previous day’s high would provide confirmation of this shift. This outlook is also reflected in the Midcap and Smallcap segments, where a break above key resistance levels could signal further upside potential. Overall, the market is at a critical juncture, with a breakout or breakdown from these levels likely to define the next phase of the trend. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. GIFT Nifty is trading sideways this Tuesday morning after Nifty snapped an 8-day losing streak and closed in positive territory yesterday. The focus is on Wednesday’s FOMC minutes, expected to reveal a hawkish Federal Reserve, lowering hopes for rate cuts in 2025. Positive catalysts include Russia-Ukraine peace prospects, falling oil prices, a weaker US Dollar, and RBI’s rate cuts. However, FIIs remain net sellers, with Rs 1,20,494 crore withdrawn so far this year. Technically, Nifty’s strength is seen above 24054, with a bullish outlook on HINDALCO, CIPLA, and VOLTAS for short-term gains. * DEEPAKNTR * MANAPPURAM JPMorgan on Persistent: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 7200/Sh (Positive) MS on Shree Cement: Upgrade to Equal weight on Company, raise target price at Rs 26950/Sh (Positive) Citi on Shriram Fin: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 720/Sh (Positive) Citi on Maruti: Maintain Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 14500/Sh (Positive) MS on Ultratech Cement: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 13650/Sh (Positive) UBS on Max Health: Upgrade to Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 1200/Sh (Positive) CLSA on Tech Mah: Maintain Outperform on Company, target price at Rs 2030/Sh (Positive) MS on Deepak NTR: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 3000/Sh (Positive) MS on Ambuja: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 590/Sh (Neutral) UBS on PCBL: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 600/Sh (Positive) MS on Indian Markets: Buying Indian equities could prove rewarding, India should resume its outperformance to EM in the comingmonths.

Their negotiation teams have also been directed to try and achieve a deal by Fall 2025. The terms of this deal are likely to reduce tariffs and other barriers on textiles, electronics, engineering and other industries. Moreover, India also pledged increased energy purchases from the United States, which will increase India’s spending on oil and gas from $15 billion to $25 billion to improve energy brauchen und help resolve trade deficits. President Trump made the announcement of his new “reciprocal” tariff plan, where he applies the same duties onto other high tariff countries. While self benefiting trade practices were set in place, this policy has introduced short term uncertainty into the market. Prime Minister Modi’s visit had included discussions on defense cooperation, including the potential sale of F-35 fighter jets to India. This is part of a wider ten-year defense agreement that intends to improve the military capability of India and its influence on regional security issues. In terms of security and immigration, Trump also supported the extradition of the person responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks as a breach of diplomacy to bolster trust from both countries. February 14, 2025 proved to be an eventful day as Modi’s trip. Indian economic indicators responded immediately and statistics show that India suffered a 0.5% dip as the market opened. 12.30 U.K. Claimant Count Change (Expected: 10.0k versus Previous: 0.7k) 15.00 U.K. BOE Gov Bailey Speaks 15.30 EURO ZEW Economic Sentiment (Expected: 24.3 versus Previous: 18.0) 20.50 U.S. FOMC Member Daly Speaks 23.30 U.S. FOMC Member Barr Speaks TENT U.S. President Trump Speaks (Recorded Interview on Fox News around 06.30 am Wednesday India Time) (Rs.
