ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN: BMNR) has surged 600% year-to-date, holding the world’s largest corporate Ethereum position of 1.7 million ETH valued at $8 billion. This far exceeds other corporate ETH holders, giving the company unmatched leverage to Ethereum price movements. With continued purchases underscoring management’s conviction, traditional metrics like revenue or margins become secondary—this is pure cryptocurrency exposure on a massive scale. But can the stock double again from here? The answer is yes. Below, we outline the potential drivers behind such a move. That said, if you want upside potential with less volatility than an individual stock, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering more than 91% returns since inception.

BitMine’s holding of 1.7 million ETH provides interesting opportunities, including strategic initiatives and institutional partnerships, that smaller holders cannot achieve. Ongoing purchases reinforce management’s confidence and bolster its leverage with crypto infrastructure providers. For the stock to double, two factors must align: Ethereum must appreciate in value, and the company must manage its treasury effectively. While the upside is immense, the risks scale equally. For instance, the stock once lost 88% of its value during the 2022 downturn. Ultimately, BitMine delivers unmatched Ethereum exposure through the public markets. But success depends almost entirely on the cryptocurrency’s trajectory, not traditional business fundamentals. Keep in mind, investing in individual stocks—especially those tied to cryptocurrencies—carries substantial risk. For broader exposure, explore the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a strong record of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks have typically offered higher returns with less volatility than the benchmark—delivering a smoother ride, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Will AI Be the Next Dot-Com Bubble?

As AI continues to rake in funds despite questions about long-term profitability, some experts are calling for more diversification. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Is it time for investors to slow their AI roll? Some experts think so. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made headlines last week when he described the AI craze as a bubble. Combined with ChatGPT-5’s botched rollout earlier this month and some signs of sliding among tech stocks, that prompted investors to question whether the AI boom is set to go bust in the near future, like the dot-com bubble of the late ’90s. Still, AI-focused ETFs continue to hit the market, with VettaFi listing 48 in its database, and expert outlooks are mixed. “I think it’s important to be aware of the risk,” said Claire Cantalupo, senior market analyst at InvesTech Research. “It doesn’t necessarily mean AI is going to crash tomorrow.” There are a few things to look for when evaluating a possible bubble, Cantalupo said. One is a paradigm shift: a new technology or innovation leading to a surge in optimism and high valuations, with investors losing their sense of risk and reward. Another is “a universal belief that this time is different.” AI could, and probably will, change the world, she added, but it may also be causing inflated valuations that aren’t sustainable. During the dot-com boom, for example, equipment provider Cisco ranked as a major player, briefly becoming the world’s most valuable company with a market cap topping $500 billion. But it lost 90% of its value in the two years after the bubble burst in 2000. “The unfortunate reality is the top 10 companies in the S&P make up 40% of it by market capitalization,” Cantalupo said. “So investors who think they’re diversified by investing in index funds are actually far more exposed to just a small basket of stocks than they think they are.” Other potential indicators that the AI boom is a bubble include: Artificially Sweet. The S&P 500 continues to climb because of a few tech stocks — Nvidia, Meta and others — with massive AI projects. The projects could lead to too much hype, said Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. Meta, for instance, has reportedly offered huge compensation packages to AI engineers that could lose value if the company’s stock falls. Still, Colello expressed optimism, based in part on continued demand for Nvidia’s products. “Certainly, there will be businesses that fail to live up to lofty valuations and times where AI expands too quickly,” he said. “However, we don’t think these dynamics are plaguing the large AI leaders just yet.” There isn’t an ETF for everything, but the volume of leveraged products coming to market shows a strategy of filling any voids. Cash is king, but income-generating mutual funds and ETFs are increasingly being used for clients, Nasdaq found. The company’s massive asset moves may, in part, reflect institutional investors’ entry into the industry, particularly crypto. Meg Ryan, a lecturer at Harvard with a background in military law, will take over next month as director of the SEC Division of Enforcement. The latest ETFs from F/m Investments and Compoundr help institutional investors avoid taxes on income distributions. Crypto assets are increasingly available as spot ETFs like IBIT, and investors may have a fear of missing out, despite the volatility. ETF volatility plays a large role in the gap between returns for investors and for funds as a whole, Morningstar data show. A set of Vanguard funds subadvised by Wellington will mark the first active stock-picking ETFs in the company’s fleet. Energy demand is rising globally, in part because of AI use, and a handful of ETFs focused on nuclear energy stand to benefit. Cyclical industries can provide some regularity for ETF investors, but not without downsides. The filing marks President Trump’s latest move to bring his spot bitcoin strategy to the ETF market. Will advisors bite? Following revised jobs reports data, Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics head. His successor choice at the BLS may raise red flags. © 2025 The Daily Upside
