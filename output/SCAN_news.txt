The quantum computing threat challenges Bitcoin's status as "digital gold," prompting strategic shifts. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The consensus that Bitcoin has matured into “digital gold” faces a new fracture line on Wall Street, one that has little to do with daily price volatility and everything to do with the distant future of computing. Two prominent strategists named Wood are currently offering diametrically opposed roadmaps to global allocators for the world’s largest crypto asset. On Jan. 16, Christopher Wood of Jefferies eliminated his firm’s long-standing Bitcoin exposure, citing the existential threat posed by quantum computing. On the other hand, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest is urging investors to look past technical anxieties and focus on the asset’s distinct lack of correlation with traditional markets. This divergence highlights a critical evolution in how institutional capital is underwriting crypto assets in 2026. The debate is no longer merely about whether Bitcoin is a speculative token or a store of value. It has shifted toward a more complex calculation regarding survivability, governance, and the specific type of hedge investors believe they are buying. Christopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, built a reputation for navigating market sentiment with his “Greed & Fear” newsletter. His latest move cuts against the grain of two years of institutional accumulation by removing a 10% Bitcoin allocation from his model portfolio entirely. In the reallocation, Jefferies shifted the 10% Bitcoin sleeve into assets with older narratives: 5% into physical gold and 5% into gold-mining stocks. A $4.6T wealth machine is turning “execution only” into real advice, and it starts with a tiny-sounding sleeve. The rationale is rooted in tail risk rather than immediate market dynamics. Wood argued that advances in quantum computing could eventually undermine the cryptography that secures the Bitcoin network. While most investors still file quantum threats under “science projects,” Jefferies is treating the possibility as a disqualifying factor for pension-style, long-horizon capital. This anxiety is finding validation among technical experts who argue the timeline for a threat is compressing faster than markets realize. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole, argued that a quantum computer could break Bitcoin in just 2 to 9 years without an upgrade, with a high probability in the 4- to 5-year range. Edwards describes the market as having entered a “Quantum Event Horizon,” a critical threshold at which the frontier risk of a hack is roughly equal to the time required to reach upgrade consensus and execute a rollout. In the Jefferies framing, the uncomfortable reality is that a quantum computer will someday be able to crack Bitcoin because its security assumptions rest on cryptographic primitives that are vulnerable to those powerful future machines. The specific threat involves adversaries “harvesting” exposed public keys now to store them and decrypt the private keys later when hardware matures. Estimates suggest more than 4 million BTC are held in vulnerable addresses due to reuse or older formats. This leaves a “harvest now, decrypt later” attack vector that could compromise a massive share of the total supply. Grayscale, one of the largest digital-asset managers, has sought to ground the 2026 market conversation by labeling quantum vulnerability a “red herring” for this year. Its analysis suggests that, while the threat is real, it is unlikely to drive prices in the near term. Considering this, Grayscale argued that in the longer run, most blockchains and much of the broader economy will need post-quantum upgrades anyway. This view aligns with developments within the crypto sector. Bitcoin’s 2028 doomsday clock: How ‘Quantum-Proof’ marketing manufactures FUD. Andre Dragosch, Bitwise Europe's Head of Research, has also countered the “immediate doom” narrative by emphasizing the sheer computational gulf between current technology and a viable attack. While Dragosch validated concerns about older wallets, he argues that the network itself remains extraordinarily robust. He wrote: “Bitcoin now runs at 1 zeta hash per second, equivalent to more than one million El Capitan-class supercomputers. That’s orders of magnitude beyond the reach of today’s quantum machines – and even beyond those expected in the foreseeable future.” Considering the above, ARK Invest is doubling down on the argument that Bitcoin belongs in modern portfolios precisely because it behaves unlike anything else. In a 2026 outlook note, ARK’s Cathie Wood leaned on correlations rather than ideology. Her argument is clinical: Bitcoin’s return stream has remained weakly linked to major asset classes since 2020, therefore offering a way to improve portfolio efficiency. ARK supported this view with a correlation matrix using weekly returns from January 2020 through January 2026. The data shows Bitcoin’s correlation with gold at 0.14 and with bonds at 0.06. Data shows there is no definitive top or bottom correlation between Bitcoin, gold, the S&P 500, and U.S. property. Perhaps most strikingly, the table shows that the S&P 500’s correlation with bonds is higher than Bitcoin’s correlation with gold. Wood uses this data to argue that Bitcoin should be viewed as a valuable diversifier for asset allocators seeking higher returns per unit of risk in the years ahead. This represents a subtle but important shift in messaging. ARK is reframing Bitcoin from “a newer version of gold” into “an uncorrelated return stream with asymmetric upside.” For investors watching the split between two of the market’s high-profile strategists, the immediate takeaway is not that Bitcoin is broken. It is that the institutional narrative is maturing into something more demanding. Jefferies is effectively saying that a hedge that might require a contentious protocol-level migration is not the same as physical gold, even if both assets can rally in the same macro regime. This is because gold does not require coordination, upgrades, or governance to remain a valid asset. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a hedge that ultimately depends on its ability to adapt. Conversely, there is a counterargument that traditional finance faces greater near-term peril from quantum computing than Bitcoin does. Dragosch said: “Banks depend heavily on long-lived RSA/ECC keys across authentication and interbank communications. Once quantum machines can break these, systemic attacks become possible – far earlier than any realistic threat to Bitcoin’s decentralized architecture.” With this in mind, ARK is effectively saying that the benefits of portfolio diversification can justify a BTC position, even if the asset is still evolving. So, the question that hangs over these cases is whether Bitcoin can credibly coordinate a post-quantum transition without splintering the social consensus that gives it monetary value.

Title: The Russell 2000 Is Crushing 2026: 4 Red-Hot High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy Now

Investing Small-cap stocks have been out of favor for years and might offer the best risk-reward after a huge three-year run for the major indices. With the Russell 2000 up almost 6% in 2026 in just two weeks, many across Wall Street see more gains for the index. With the prospect of an improving U.S. economy in 2026, that should provide a strong tailwind for small-cap and small-cap value stocks. Sending You to Google News in 3 © scyther5 / Getty Images In 2026, the seemingly forgotten Russell 2000 has emerged as the leading equity index, already up 5.6% compared with the S&P 500’s 1.2% gain. That’s because it is uniquely leveraged to a domestic-driven economic rebound, easing financial conditions, and renewed risk appetite for small-cap stocks. Valuation saturation and global exposure trap the large-cap benchmarks. Meanwhile, small-cap companies benefit disproportionately from falling interest rates, improved access to credit, and rising mergers-and-acquisitions activity. These all lower their cost of capital and unlock growth. The index is also more sensitive to U.S. fiscal policy, infrastructure spending, and reshoring trends, allowing earnings growth to accelerate faster than that of multinational mega-caps facing currency and geopolitical headwinds. After years of underperformance, relative valuations in the Russell 2000 entered 2026 at historically attractive levels, setting the stage for multiple expansion as investors rotate toward cyclical growth and away from overcrowded large-cap trades. We have to admit that the surge of the Russell 2000 in 2026 came as somewhat of a surprise to us here at 24/7 Wall St. Yet, the reality is that after three years of double-digit gains for the S&P 500, many of the top stocks, including most of the Magnificent 7, are starting to underperform the index.

Title: What’s Going On With Bitcoin And The Stock Market? Analyst Breaks It Down

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin (BTC) and the stock market have experienced sharp price swings and declines since 2025. Because of this volatility, a crypto analyst has warned that the market correction could intensify further in 2026. In a detailed analysis, he outlines a bearish scenario for Bitcoin, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency could soon face another price crash amid persistent downward pressure in the broader stock market. Market analyst Doctor Profit has raised concerns about the direction of the crypto and traditional markets, warning that both Bitcoin and stocks are currently in a severe bear market. In a technical breakdown on X this Monday, the expert highlighted three major bearish setups forming simultaneously in Bitcoin. He highlighted a massive Bearish Divergence on the weekly and monthly charts, a clear bearish flag signaling a potential drop toward $70,000, and a possible Head and Shoulder pattern that could still play out. While he acknowledged that Bitcoin could still experience short-term price increases and briefly rise toward the $97,000-$107,000 range due to strong liquidity, he said that the ultimate target remains $70,000. Doctor Profit emphasized that Bitcoin’s potential decline to $70,000 could go two ways. It could either break out of the bearish flag to that downside target or complete the Head and Shoulders pattern before reaching $70,000. He stated that he will not add new short positions at current prices but plans to increase them aggressively from $115,000 to $125,000 if Bitcoin moves into the $97,000 to $107,000 range. The analyst painted a similarly grim picture for the stock market. He said he was “ultra-bearish” on both Bitcoin and the financial system. He also noted that the banks are stressed and that forced liquidations in precious metals like Silver are creating ripples across the broader market. Additionally, Doctor Profit noted that insider activity shows clear signs of panic among investors, with record levels of selling since August 2025. Because of this, the analyst believes that the market is heading for a 2008-style crash. Consequently, he has concluded that the current market conditions are too extreme. On the bright side, Doctor Profit said that although he maintains short positions on stocks and Bitcoin, he remains bullish on Gold and Silver. He explained that any upside to the $97,000-$107,000 range will prompt him to increase his short exposure and roll spot profits for BTC from $85,000 into these positions. Toward the end of his analysis, Doctor Profit discussed upcoming events that could influence Bitcoin and the broader financial markets this week. He stated that the US CPI inflation forecast of 2.7% will be released this Tuesday. Other than this, the rest of the week is expected to have few market-moving events. Doctor Profit has also highlighted January 15 as an important date because US lawmakers will vote on the CLARITY Act. He explained that if the bill passes, it will move closer to becoming law, setting clear rules and oversight for the crypto market.

Title: 3 Dividend Stocks With High Yields and a Triple-Digit Upside Potential

Investing Verizon (VZ) trades at under 9x earnings with a 6.82% dividend yield despite generating $26.2B in pre-tax income. Hormel Foods (HRL) offers a 5% yield and has raised dividends for 59 consecutive years. HP (HPQ) trades below 7x forward earnings with a 5.59% yield and a sub-37% payout ratio. Sending You to Google News in 3 © CHIEW / Shutterstock.com You don’t have to settle for a moderate yield with moderate upside if you like dividend stocks. Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL), and HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) offer both a high yield and upside potential in the coming years and can greatly outperform the broader market. You can still buy stocks with a lower yield, but it’s worth keeping in mind that even a 4% yield is outclassed by Treasuries that yield over 4.8% while being risk-free. At the same time, the market is littered with cash-rich companies that are going through a tough period. I argue these dividend stocks are bound to inevitably bounce back once the storm passes. You’ll be able to snag the dividend payouts plus the massive upside once that happens. Let’s take a look. Verizon is one of the most mispriced cash cows on the stock market today. It is one of the largest telecommunications businesses and has more than proved itself in the past few years. Telecom companies are usually debt-laden and were considered more on the discretionary side. However, Verizon managed to generate positive cash flow despite exceptional interest rates, increase its dividends, and keep its customer base steady. In fact, customers have shown that their internet subscription is actually essential to them. They’re unlikely to go offline no matter how tough the economic situation is, and that makes Verizon a solid safe haven to buy into for a high and dependable yield. VZ stock carries a 6.82% dividend yield today and trades at less than 9 times earnings. Sure, it has over $170 billion of total debt on its balance sheet, but pre-tax income of $26.2 billion over the past year is more than enough to service that debt and pay growing dividends. Once interest rates look less scary, I expect VZ stock to make a full recovery and beyond, likely reaching $80. Hormel Foods has taken a beating over the past five years and is down 48.2% over that period. This company makes a variety of branded food products. While inflation initially helped it, the momentum has gone downhill since 2021. Regardless, I now believe it is too cheap to ignore. HRL stock now comes with a dividend yield of over 5%. Better yet, dividends have been raised for 59 years consecutively. The payout ratio still leaves room for more modest increases. I expect this cash cow business to do a lot better. EPS is expected to continue growing above a 6% clip in both FY 2026 and FY 2027, along with revenue growth above 2%. You may argue that the 16 times forward earnings premium is thus fair value for the stock, but I’d disagree. Such a low valuation would only be fair if HRL stock came with a lower yield and a more fickle cash flow. I see the forward PE ratio climbing above 25x in the coming years as interest rates drop, allowing the yield to be appreciated more by the Street. HP Inc. makes personal computers, printers, laptops, etc. It is not to be confused with HPE, which makes servers and storage. HPQ stock is down over 34% in the past year, and I believe it’s worth buying into the weakness now. The company has solid, stable cash flow, with computer and printing businesses still being very lucrative and reliable. Component prices are explosive, but this isn’t a one-sided affair that many doom-and-gloom analysts expect will kill HP Inc. Instead, it could turn HPQ much hotter. Customers are willing to cover the cost of rising components. Plus, the company has strong links to enterprise clients who keep orders steady year after year. As a result, EPS is expected to stay flat in FY 2026 and grow at a 4% clip in FY 2027, along with a modest sales increase below a 2% growth rate. These aren’t sexy figures, but they show a lot of resilience that most other companies do not have in the electronics sector. You get a forward dividend yield of 5.59%. The real kicker is that the payout ratio is less than 37%. Management has been increasing the dividend at over 10% annually on average over the past 5 months. The business itself doesn’t need to grow at a flashy pace before Wall Street starts paying more due to how much income it can churn out. HPQ trades at less than 7 times forward earnings.
