Title: Markets begin 2026 on a flat note as ITC crash overshadows auto sector rally

The session was marked by extreme sectoral divergence, with the automobile index surging over 1 per cent on robust December sales data, even as the FMCG sector plunged more than 3 per cent following the imposition of fresh excise duty on cigarettes. The trading day witnessed the narrowest intraday range since September 2025, with the Nifty moving within a mere 84-point band, reflecting subdued participation amid global market holidays and continued foreign institutional investor selling. Market breadth remained neutral with 2,211 stocks advancing against 1,952 declining on the BSE, where 4,335 stocks were actively traded. As many as 144 stocks hit their 52-week highs, while 87 touched their 52-week lows. ITC emerged as the session’s biggest casualty, crashing 9.69 per cent to ₹363.95, wiping out massive investor wealth as cigarette stocks reacted sharply to the new excise duty announcement. Other notable losers included Tata Consumer Products, which declined 1.57 per cent to ₹1,173.30, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories down 1.53 per cent at ₹1,252, Bajaj Finance falling 1.13 per cent to ₹975.60, and ONGC slipping 1.03 per cent to ₹237.90. “The domestic market started the year with a range-bound session and ended slightly higher amid thin trading due to global holidays and continued FII selling,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments Limited. “Sectorally, auto stocks gained on strong December sales, while value buying supported IT stocks. However, overall advances were capped as FMCG stocks declined following the newly imposed excise duty on cigarettes.” The automobile sector provided the session’s bright spot, with Bajaj Auto leading the gainers’ pack with a rally of 2.59 per cent to ₹9,585. Shriram Finance advanced 2.39 per cent to ₹1,020, NTPC climbed 1.99 per cent to ₹336.10, Eicher Motors gained 1.98 per cent to ₹283.55, and Wipro rose 1.52 per cent to ₹267.30, reflecting strong investor appetite for quality stocks backed by solid fundamentals. Broader markets outperformed the benchmark indices, with the Nifty Midcap 100 rising 0.44 per cent to 60,750.45, gaining 265.95 points, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 closed marginally lower by 0.05 per cent at 17,704.90. Among sectoral indices, Nifty Bank gained 0.22 per cent to close at 59,711.55, Nifty Financial Services advanced 0.19 per cent to 27,666.80, and Nifty Next 50 jumped 0.45 per cent to 69,675.40. “Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a range-bound trading session,” noted Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities. “Among sectors, the Auto Index was the top gainer, rallying 1 per cent, whereas the FMCG index corrected sharply, shedding over 3 per cent.” From a technical perspective, analysts maintained a cautiously optimistic outlook. “The zone of 26,200-26,240 will act as an important hurdle for the index,” said Sudeep Shah, Head of Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities. “Any sustainable move above the 26,240 level will lead to a sharp upside rally in the index up to the 26,400 level in the short term.” Looking ahead, market participants expect volatility to pick up as attention shifts to the upcoming third-quarter earnings season and Union Budget expectations. “In the days ahead, Q3 earnings, budget expectations, and global cues such as the India-US trade deal and potential Fed actions are expected to guide market direction, with earnings growth likely to remain the key driver in 2026,” Nair added.

Title: Sabotaging Bitcoin

Time Published: 2025-12-30T20:53:59Z

I'm David Rosenthal, and this is a place to discuss the work I'm doing in Digital Preservation. In When the AI bubble pops, Nvidia becomes the most important software company overnight, Tobias Mann speculates about the aftermath of the AI crash, when the world will be awash in data centers full of Nvidia GPUs not doing AI. The sub-head is:"Want to survive the crash? Find another way to make money with GPUs"This leads me to wonder what the hash rate of a 1GW data center full of Nvidia's finest chips would be, and whether this might make the outsider attack feasible. Let's guess that they'd be half as efficient as Bitmain's, so you'd need 19 of these data centers. That's probably more than are going to get built before the crash, so the answer is no. A Bitcoin sabotage would hit the US, then India, then Europe. But the US the hardest. Bitmain is mainland Chinese (and has a subsidiary subject to US sanctions). If an attack would come from anyone, it would most likely be a result of economic war (real war, not 'war') between the US and China, with the hit to India a bonus for the Chinese. Such an attack would likely be unforeseeable until it happens (barring any internal leaks).The Bitcoin futures market shouldn't be the only way to profit from a Bitcoin sabotage. I'm not clued in to know what second order market effects to expect, though, but someone probably has a good idea. Post a Comment

Title: Strategy stock bleeds as MSCI verdict nears – What next for MSTR?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/strategy-stock-bleeds-as-msci-verdict-nears-what-next-for-mstr/
Time Published: 2025-12-30T09:45:08Z
Full Content:
MSCI delisting fears and stock dilution drags MSTR lower. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, saw its stock drop to a fresh yearly low. Following a broader tech sell-off on the 29th of December, MSTR stock dropped by 2.15% to a record 2025 low of $155.32. From its 2024 high of $543, MSTR has crashed by 71%, presenting several Wall Street bears with a windfall opportunity. Although some bears began unwinding short positions in November to realize their gains, MSTR’s free fall did not slow down. At press time, the stock was back within the 2024 price range of $100-$180. Source: MSTR, TradingView One of the factors driving bearish sentiment over the past few weeks has been the risk of MSCI index delisting MSTR and other crypto treasury firms. Although the Strategy founder, Michael Saylor, has defended the firm as an operational company that should remain on the global index, prediction site Polymarket was pricing a +75% chance of delisting in early 2026. JPMorgan analysts warned that such a move would drive $8 billion in outflows from the stock. Some even speculated that the delisting would force liquidation of its Bitcoin holdings, but market expectations for such a BTC sell-off remained low. The MSCI decision in mid-January could offer the needed clarity for the stock’s next direction. Additionally, the ongoing dilution through MSTR stock sales to fund Bitcoin [BTC] purchases may have contributed to the stock’s pressure. According to analyst Novacula Occami, Strategy sold $4 billion worth of MSTR despite its BTC holdings trading below its enterprise value, or mNAV, being below 1. “Since that July announcement, they’ve issued $4.9 billion of $MSTR common with $4 billion of that issued at a common mNAV below 1 (in Nov and Dec).” Source: X The firm had earlier stated that it wouldn’t sell the common stock (MSTR) if the mNAV fell below 2.5x, then changed it to 1x. Overall, Strategy has spent $22.5 billion to buy Bitcoin in 2025. This was nearly half of its +$50 billion investment in BTC since 2020. Source: CryptoQuant This has been funded by MSTR and preferred stock sales, as well as debt. In fact, the latest $108 million BTC buy was wholly funded by MSTR stock sales. Strategy now owns 672,497 BTC. That said, despite the massive dump in 2025, Wall Street analysts were still bullish on MSTR stock. There were 13 buy ratings in the past month, with price targets ranging from $465 to $485, implying a 170%-200% upside potential.

Indian markets are poised for a stronger financial year, with improving macros, low inflation, and reviving earnings growth expected to drive equities. Investors are reallocating between assets, with a focus on bottom-up stock selection and sectoral tailwinds. Opportunities are seen in financials, industrials, and defensives, while rate-sensitive segments and CDMOs offer further potential. Overall, Sonthalia believes FY27 could reward disciplined investors who focus on valuations, sectoral tailwinds and bottom-up stock selection rather than chasing crowded themes.
