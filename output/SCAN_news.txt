Defence stocks surged Rs 43,000 crore on Friday, lifting the Nifty Defence index to an eight-week high. Gains were driven by new submarine orders, a 15-year MoD modernisation roadmap, and strong order books. Analysts see long-term potential but caution that near-term upside may be limited by valuations and execution capacity.

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Financial markets have already had an unusual year, but recent price action lately has been especially bizarre, according to Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. In a Substack post on Tuesday titled “Super weird markets since Jackson Hole,” he traced the path of key assets since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door to rate cuts in a speech at the annual central bank symposium last month. “You’d have thought that would weigh on the Dollar, lift the S&P 500 and boost commodity prices across the board. But that hasn’t happened,” Brooks wrote. “The only thing that’s moved is gold, with a massive price rise of almost 10 percent.” To be sure, stocks have rallied since his post as benign inflation data cleared the way for Fed rate cuts when policymakers meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. Gold prices have also marched higher, setting fresh highs along the way and closing Friday at $3,680.70 per ounce. But the bond market has behaved more unexpectedly. Brooks noted the 30-year Treasury yield didn’t fall right after Powell’s speech but only turned lower after another bad jobs report was released two weeks later. “The fact that the 30-year Treasury yield didn’t fall immediately is weird and worrying,” he added. “It took very weak payrolls to finally do that.” In addition, while the dollar index has had some ups and downs, it has returned to about where it was before Powell’s speech, with Brooks calling that “counterintuitive” as expectations for Fed easing would typically bring it lower. Meanwhile, bitcoin sold off after Jackson Hole but is also back where it started, even though cryptocurrencies have generally acted like risk assets in the past and previously rallied on rate-cut hopes. “What does all this mean? Recent market moves suggest gold is the ultimate safe haven,” Brooks said. “Bitcoin is proving too volatile and speculative, so — as political pressure on the Fed mounts — markets gravitate to gold.” Fears of a debt crisis in France and the U.K. have jolted global bond yields higher in recent weeks. Political gridlock in France in particular has dimmed hopes that Paris will rein in deficits anytime soon. On Friday evening, Fitch downgraded France’s credit rating from AA- to A+, the lowest level ever for the eurozone’s second-largest economy, saying a major shift to fiscal discipline is unlikely. It’s possible the crisis in France sent more investors looking for a safe haven toward the dollar, potentially explaining why the greenback has been stable, Brooks said. After his post, other global events have stirred more geopolitical concerns that may also favor the dollar. Israel attacked Hamas leaders in Qatar, a close U.S. Mideast ally, sparking sharp backlash in the region and sending oil prices higher. And Russian drones entered Polish airspace, forcing NATO allies to activate air-defense systems and deploy fighters jets that shot down the aircraft. “The bottom line is that there’s a lot of things in markets that don’t currently hang together well at all,” Brooks said. The key question is whether the rise in gold prices is sign that the dollar is losing its reserve currency status, though he thinks it’s just temporary noise and sees a reversion to the mean eventually. In a note on Tuesday, Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, also noticed the odd market moves that have been going on. But he said “the tell” is the dollar’s 10% decline year to date against other global currencies, which stems from President Donald Trump’s efforts to weaken Fed independence, worsen deficits, and reorder the global trading system. “When you take all that into account, those market moves suddenly start to make a lot more sense,” Brown added. “Yes, the correlations are unusual. But, so is the macroeconomic environment, and so are the policy choices that continue to be made, as government spending runs away with itself across DM, rate cuts resume stateside, inflation risks remain tilted to the upside, and a potential economic re-acceleration looms now the initial trade/tariff uncertainty has (largely) been navigated.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Estimating MicroStrategy’s Timeline to 1 Million Bitcoin
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2025/09/12/estimating-microstrategys-timeline-to-1-million-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T20:53:34Z
Full Content:
Current Bitcoin Holdings of MicroStrategy MicroStrategy (now rebranded as Strategy Inc. as of early 2025) is the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. As of September 2025, the company holds approximately 638,460 BTC in its treasury . This massive stash – roughly 3% of all bitcoins that will ever exist – reflects an aggressive accumulation strategy that began in 2020 and has accelerated in recent years. MicroStrategy’s Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, has made it clear the company views Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset and has no intention of selling. As Saylor famously stated: “Never. No. We’re not sellers. We’re only acquiring and holding bitcoin… that’s our strategy.” This long-term “HODL” stance underpins MicroStrategy’s goal of continually increasing its bitcoin holdings regardless of market fluctuations. Historical Bitcoin Acquisition Timeline MicroStrategy’s path to 1 million BTC can be understood by looking at how rapidly its holdings have grown: Summary of Holdings by Year: MicroStrategy’s BTC stack grew from ~70k in 2020 to ~447k by end of 2024, and ~638k by late 2025. This exponential trajectory underscores the company’s increasing conviction (and available capital) for Bitcoin acquisitions. Public Statements on Future Bitcoin Plans MicroStrategy’s leadership has been very transparent about their long-term commitment to Bitcoin. Key insights from executives include: In summary, all public communications from MicroStrategy’s team convey unwavering bullishness on Bitcoin and an intention to keep buying for years to come. The company positions itself as a pioneer of the “Bitcoin standard” for corporations, frequently evangelizing Bitcoin’s virtues to other CEOs (e.g. via its annual Bitcoin for Corporations conferences). MicroStrategy’s message: they’re all-in on Bitcoin and still just getting started. Financial Capacity for Future Purchases How can MicroStrategy actually fund a march to 1 million BTC? The company’s financial strategy provides the answer: raise capital aggressively and plow it into Bitcoin. Key elements of their financing capacity include: Bottom Line: MicroStrategy has built an extensive capital arsenal for future Bitcoin purchases – including authorized but unused capacity in the tens of billions of dollars across common and preferred stock programs. In total, by mid-2025 the company had already raised about $47 billion in equity capital over five years for its Bitcoin strategy, and it signaled plans to raise yet more. With these financing mechanisms, MicroStrategy theoretically has the firepower to acquire the remaining Bitcoin needed to reach 1 million BTC (though practical and market constraints, discussed next, will influence the timing). Market Conditions Influencing the Acquisition Rate Several market and macroeconomic factors will affect how quickly MicroStrategy can continue buying Bitcoin and reach 1,000,000 BTC: In summary, favorable market conditions – a rising Bitcoin price, strong investor appetite for MicroStrategy’s stock/preferreds, and accessible capital – would enable MicroStrategy to keep an aggressive pace. Unfavorable conditions – a stagnant or falling BTC price, shareholder fatigue, or tight credit/low equity premiums – could slow the pace. The company’s recent behavior (continuing to buy despite some criticism) suggests that as long as they can secure funding, they will push forward, even if it means weathering short-term stock volatility. Investors should thus expect MicroStrategy to remain a bold buyer, adjusting speed as needed but not fundamentally altering course. Timeline Projections to 1,000,000 BTC Taking into account MicroStrategy’s current holdings (~638k BTC) and its historical and potential acquisition rates, we can outline scenarios for how long it might take to reach 1,000,000 bitcoins. Below we consider a Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive case, based on different annual purchase rates. These scenarios are illustrative – the actual outcome will depend on the factors discussed (market conditions, financing success, etc.): The table below summarizes these scenarios with a simple year-by-year estimate of total BTC holdings, assuming a starting point of ~640k BTC (around late 2025 levels) and constant annual purchase rates in each case: Table: Projected Bitcoin holdings under different annual accumulation scenarios. Bold entries indicate crossing 1,000,000 BTC. Under the Conservative path, MicroStrategy would not hit 1 million BTC within this 5-year window (reaching ~840k by 2029, and only in the early 2030s would it cross seven figures). The Moderate path achieves the milestone by about 2029. The Aggressive path has MicroStrategy breezing past 1 million as early as 2027, and potentially holding 1.3+ million BTC by 2029 if that pace were sustained. It’s important to stress that these are simplified projections. In reality, MicroStrategy’s annual BTC accumulation has varied wildly – from just +8k in 2022 to +234k in 2024 – depending on market opportunities. The company tends to be opportunistic, as seen in late 2024 when it accelerated buys during a Bitcoin price surge and favorable stock conditions. Future purchases will likely come in spurts rather than a steady linear rate. For example, MicroStrategy might conduct another big raise during the next crypto bull run (if Bitcoin, say, pushes well beyond $100k) and add a large block of coins in a short time. Alternatively, if the market is lukewarm, it might accumulate more slowly quarter by quarter. Conclusion How long might it take MicroStrategy to acquire 1,000,000 bitcoins? Based on current holdings (~638k BTC) and past trends, it could be as soon as 2–3 years in a bullish, capital-rich scenario, or closer to 7–10 years under more cautious conditions. MicroStrategy’s own actions suggest a strong desire to reach this milestone sooner rather than later. The company has explicitly built the capacity to raise tens of billions more dollars and has demonstrated willingness to deploy huge sums into Bitcoin at every opportunity. As of early 2025, management said they had already executed $20 billion of a planned $42 billion capital deployment for Bitcoin – well ahead of schedule – indicating an accelerated timeline. Crucially, MicroStrategy’s ability to continue at an aggressive pace will hinge on external factors: the trajectory of Bitcoin’s price, investor tolerance for its high-risk strategy, and macroeconomic liquidity. The firm’s stock performance and status (e.g., inclusion in major indices, or competition from a Bitcoin ETF) will also influence how much fuel it can add to the fire. So far, Saylor and his team have been adept at navigating these factors, keeping MicroStrategy at the forefront of Bitcoin accumulation. If Bitcoin’s market remains strong and MicroStrategy retains investor confidence, reaching 1,000,000 BTC by the latter half of this decade is plausible under an aggressive strategy. In any case, MicroStrategy has cemented itself as a unique corporate entity – essentially a Bitcoin holding company – and its quest for 1 million BTC exemplifies the boldest expression of the “Bitcoin standard” in the corporate world. Every quarter brings them closer to that historic figure. Given the company’s track record and statements, it wouldn’t be surprising if MicroStrategy ultimately becomes the first corporation to hold one million bitcoins, whenever that day comes.

Title: Tempus AI: Is TEM Stock A 10x Growth Story?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/12/tempus-ai-is-tem-stock-a-10x-growth-story/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T13:59:58Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Great news for Tempus AI stock! The company has just received FDA approval for an upgraded version of its Tempus Pixel platform — a cardiac imaging system that uses advanced AI to deliver highly accurate images of a patient’s heart. Remember when we talked about TEM last month and how it might double to $130? Well, it’s already climbed more than 33% in just a month. But here’s the surprising part: the opportunity for Tempus AI may not stop at a 2x return. It can potentially be a 10x story or more. Sounds too good to be true? It’s not—once you understand what Tempus AI actually does. Think of Tempus as the “Google of healthcare data.” The company has built the world’s largest library of clinical and molecular data and uses AI to turn this information into insights for precision medicine. While it started in oncology, it has since expanded into cardiology, radiology, and even mental health. Tempus doesn’t just gather data—it transforms it into real-time insights that help doctors make better treatment decisions. It’s like giving physicians a supercomputer that analyzes millions of patient cases to recommend the best care for each individual. Let’s talk numbers. Tempus has grown its revenue at an average rate of 50% over the past three years. In Q2 2025 alone, revenue grew 90% year-over-year, and the company raised its full-year outlook to $1.26 billion—over 80% growth from last year. Looking for more – revenue is expected to double over the next three years. The company is also nearing EBITDA profitability. This isn’t just growth—it’s accelerating growth with improving margins. Of course, these strong numbers come with the volatility typical of high-growth stocks. If you’re looking for upside with less risk than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with over 91% returns since inception. Also see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Tempus AI’s potential for explosive growth isn’t wishful thinking—it’s supported by solid fundamentals. Beyond profits, there’s a bigger reason Tempus AI must grow: healthcare justice. AI can help correct systemic disparities in care that affect underserved communities. Some populations face higher mortality from certain diseases due to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, creating major burdens. By using AI to tailor treatments and improve accuracy, Tempus can help close these gaps—making precision medicine accessible to everyone, not just patients at top hospitals. This mission will likely fuel broad social support. Let’s crunch the numbers. Tempus is projected to make about $1.26 billion this year. Imagine it scales revenue 15x. Of course, not overnight, think long term. With the AI healthcare market forecast to top $800 billion, can Tempus claim just 2.5% of that? It’s possible, especially if it captures more R&D spending from big pharma. For context, just five companies—Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Roche, AbbVie, and Eli Lilly—spent over $75 billion on R&D last year alone. If Tempus grows to $20 billion in revenue, it will likely become highly profitable. With medtech firms typically earning net margins of 22–25%, that implies about $5 billion in profit. At a median multiple of 35 times earnings, Tempus’s valuation would hit $175 billion—up from $15 billion today. This level of growth isn’t unprecedented. Look at Intuitive Surgical, which jumped 8x in value over the past decade—from $20 billion to $165 billion. The best part? We don’t think ISRG stock is done yet. Tempus AI may follow a similar trajectory. Despite its promise, Tempus faces major risks. Regulatory approvals for each AI tool are slow, and new data privacy laws may bring hefty fines. The company is also still unprofitable with high R&D spending, meaning it may need to raise more capital, diluting shareholders. Competition is intense—from giants like Roche and tech titans like Google with deep pockets. And its valuation is steep: a $15 billion market cap on $1.3 billion in 2025 revenue. Any stumble has the potential to send its stock plunging, making that 10x dream a long shot. Remember, single-stock investing always carries meaningful risk. Consider the Trefis High-Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which holds 30 stocks and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4 years. Why? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered stronger returns with lower volatility than the index, offering a smoother ride as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Overall, Tempus AI is a bold bet on the future of healthcare AI. The key question isn’t if it will succeed—it likely will. The real challenge is whether that success can deliver outsized returns from today’s lofty valuation. The next three to four years will be pivotal as it races to scale while the healthcare AI market matures and competition intensifies.

Title: 10x Upside For IONQ Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/12/10x-upside-for-ionq-stock/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T10:00:10Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), a quantum computing company, has taken a major leap by figuring out how to mass-produce high-quality synthetic diamond films. Think of it this way: they can now bond these specialized diamonds onto standard computer chips—a potential game-changer for building quantum computers. Developed with Element Six, this breakthrough enables the company to manufacture these components at scale. It’s a core element of IonQ’s plan to reach a 2-million-qubit quantum system by 2030. In fact, IonQ’s acquisition of the UK quantum computing startup Oxford Ionics a few months ago was a pivotal step to speed up this goal. With this advance, the big question is whether it can drive even more explosive gains in IonQ’s stock. The stock has already surged 500% in the last year, but could it climb another 10x from here, reaching $400 a share? It can. In the sections below, we outline what could enable that outcome. That said, if you want upside exposure with lower single-stock risk, consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which has delivered >91% returns since inception while outperforming the S&P 500 with lower volatility. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? IonQ is a high-risk, high-reward name with significant upside potential. Its trapped-ion technology and cloud-first strategy could provide an edge. To realize that potential, the company must sustain technical leadership, convert research into real-world applications, and monetize partnerships. For investors comfortable with risk, IonQ offers a way to invest directly in the future of quantum computing. However, meaningful risks remain in this early-stage space. Alternatively, explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to capitalize on strong markets while limiting downside when conditions deteriorate, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano Could Lead Explosive Altcoin Rally, Analyst Says

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Crypto markets are “on the edge” of a broad altcoin breakout, with XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano positioned to lead, according to technical strategist CryptoInsightUK. In a video analysis released today, the analyst argues that structural signals across major charts—supported by improving macro conditions—tilt the risk-reward toward a decisive upside move, provided US inflation data doesn’t deliver a negative surprise. The setup begins with Bitcoin grinding higher into range highs while still sitting in what he calls “a position of potential reversal,” a juncture he links to today’s US CPI print after a softer-than-expected PPI reading. “If CPI comes in weak today, I think the markets will rip,” he said, framing inflation as the swing factor that could unlock risk appetite across crypto. He contends the strongest signals are emerging away from Bitcoin and Ethereum. On Ethereum, liquidity “still” sits below price around $4,100, with a pocket of resting orders above, leaving open the possibility of “a quick flush… to take that” before higher levels are attacked. “How much of a drop would we need to sweep this liquidity? Six percent,” he said, adding that the base of recent transactions “looks pretty good as a support,” even if a brief downside wick cannot be ruled out. The case for altcoins rests largely on visible liquidity concentrations and higher-timeframe structures. Cardano (ADA), he said, exhibits a favorable imbalance with “a… load of liquidity” stacked above “around one dollar,” and additional magnets in the $1.21 and $1.40 areas if momentum expands. He emphasized the sequence of higher lows and higher highs that preceded a consolidation, a pattern he compared across several charts. Dogecoin (DOGE), in his view, mirrors the same anatomy on a larger timeframe: a prior higher-high/higher-low sequence, a tightening range, and “liquidity above us,” with a push through $0.29 opening a path to targeting $0.45. “I’ve been saying for a while tokens like DOGE look like they are going to absolutely send it,” he said. For XRP, he argued that price action has “led the cycle” and recently broke a well-tracked downtrend on the daily and four-hour charts, while shorter-term liquidity maps now show concentrations overhead. Beyond single names, he anchored his thesis in market-wide breadth gauges. He highlighted “Total 3”—the combined market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—pressing against prior highs and “knocking at the door… for price discovery.” In a closely related lens, he said “Total 2” (market cap ex-Bitcoin) is one incremental push away—“half a percent higher”—from a highest-ever weekly close, with three days left in the candle. The evolving formations, he added, can be interpreted as an “ascending wedge” that morphs into a “cup and handle” after a textbook Wyckoff-style accumulation and back-test, the kind of structural progression that often resolves with a powerful range break. Rotation dynamics are at the core of his call. Drawing on an ETH-vs-BTC dominance composite, he said the tape “looks like weakness” for the pair, with heavier volume on down moves in that ratio—an indication, he believes, that capital is migrating from Bitcoin and Ethereum into the broader altcoin complex. “If [Bitcoin] dominance breaks down… it’s better for altcoins,” he said. “As long as capital’s flowing into the market, I don’t really mind which starts to outperform which… but if we have a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price and a drop in dominance, it means that altcoins are going to be absolutely sending it.” At the same time, he flagged the near-term fork in the road. Markets are testing “decision” levels into macro data, and a brief liquidity sweep lower—on Bitcoin and ETH in particular—remains plausible before any sustained impulse. “We’re not in a breakout territory here yet,” he cautioned. “We’ve seen the first signs of it… [and] we could reject here and consolidate for a little bit longer… but one catalyst here and it’s green season in my opinion for crypto generally.” Throughout the analysis, the analyst returned to a handful of price signposts traders are likely to watch: ADA gravity around $1.00 with follow-ups near $1.21 and $1.40; DOGE confirmation above ~$0.29 and then $0.45 as the next objective; and XRP’s break of descending resistance with liquidity pools sitting overhead on intraday maps. If the macro side cooperates, his base case is unambiguous. “I think the breakout is imminent,” he said, pointing to synchronized strength across Total 2 and Total 3, gold’s recent breakout, and equities at or near all-time highs. “This is the sort of time where we’re going to break out,” he added. “Massive breakouts” in altcoins, when they come, often unfold as “a few weeks or a few days of massively green candles.” Even so, he closed with a reminder that timing remains hostage to catalysts. “It’s decision time for the market,” he said. “Could reject here and consolidate… but one catalyst here and it’s green season.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.99.

The domestic wood panel industry is gearing up for a robust revival, driven by a surge in housing handovers, large-scale capacity expansions and easing timber prices, said analysts. Shares such as Greenply Industries, Century Plyboard, Greenpanel, Greenlam Industries, Archidply Industries and Rushil Decor gained sharply in today’s trade. In the three months, these stocks have generated handsome returns between 3 and 29 per cent. While plywood remains the dominant category, Medium-Density Fibreboard (MDF) is witnessing rapid adoption, especially in commercial and OEM segments. MDF demand grew at a 22 per cent CAGR during FY21-FY25, said Yes Securities, expecting this momentum to continue as pricing stabilises and margins recover. In Q1FY26, wood panel companies reported modest operating performances. “Plywood segment exhibited mixed volume growth, but OPM was subdued y-o-y. MDF segment saw muted volume growth (except CPBI) and operating margins continued to be mixed across companies, said ICICI Securities. According to analysts, operating margins should stay healthy in the plywood segment as timber prices have stabilised. Besides, the government is taking steps to ensure BIS on furniture by February 26. While the import inventory has also died down, there is still competition for pricing from the unorganised players. This, combined with the softening of timber prices, will act as a tailwind for the plywood business, said Axis Securities.. Yes Securities, in a recent thematic report, said the sector is entering a multi-year upcycle, with top players like Century Plyboards and Greenply Industries expected to lead the charge. India’s real estate market has seen a massive presales boom over the past four years, with a significant portion of inventory now entering the handover phase. The average area of homes scheduled for delivery between 2024 and 2029 is nearly double that of the previous decade, implying higher interior spends and increased demand for furniture — a key driver for woodpanel consumption. “The MDF industry has faced oversupply challenges in recent years, creating pricing pressure and materially impacting margins. However, with most large capacity expansions already commissioned and demand growth likely to sustain, utilisation levels should improve, aiding margin recovery. Furthermore, the imposition of anti-dumping duty has curbed imports substantially, and the existing inventory of low-cost imports is nearing exhaustion. Consequently, we expect improvement in the overall scenario for MDFs hereon,” the Yes Securities’ report noted. Top listed players have invested over ₹5,000 crore in capacity expansion across plywood, MDF, laminates and particle boards. With major capex behind them and demand set to rise, analysts anticipate a strong earnings trajectory. On the cost side, timber prices, which account for up to 65 per cent of raw material costs, are showing signs of cooling after an 18-24 month rally. This should aid margin recovery across companies. With timber prices showing signs of cooling and anti-dumping duties curbing cheap imports, the woodpanel sector is set for margin expansion. Analysts highlight that PEG ratios for top players are below 1x, indicating attractive valuations relative to growth. As the housing handover cycle accelerates and furniture demand rises, investors may find compelling opportunities in select woodpanel stocks — especially those with diversified portfolios and completed capex cycles. With furniture demand rising and capacity in place, brokerages see woodpanel companies entering a margin-accretive earnings cycle. Analysts prefer diversified players like CPBI and Greenply for re-rating potential, while niche MDF player Greenpanel may see steady but limited upside.
