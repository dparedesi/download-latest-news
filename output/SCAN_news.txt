Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © alexgo.photography / Shutterstock.com After yesterday’s debacle in which approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization was erased from the stock market, some technology stocks are still hunting a bottom. With the Nasdaq Composite now down 3% for the month of November so far, the AI rally has lost its steam for the time being as the markets wrestle with bullish fundamentals overshadowed by negative headlines. While the selling hasn’t been pretty for the bulls, it does not appear to be over, at least not yet. The following technology stocks – Micron Technology (Nasdaq: MU), Data Dog (Nasdaq: DDOG), Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) and Palo Alto Networks (Nasdaq: PANW) – are heading lower today in a most volatile time to be invested in the U.S. stock market. After sinking as much as 11% in Thursday’s market sell-off, and even dipping below the psychologically sensitive $200 threshold, the bottom has seemingly fallen out in the stock. Today MU stock is down another 3.6%. Investors have been spooked by Micron’s aggressive AI capex plans in which management conceded that its $18 billion plan would face headwinds. Investors are having to get used to these massive balance sheets committed massive amounts of capital to stay in the AI race. Also, profit taking is normal with a stock that has run up over 100% year-to-date. Rosenblatt has a whopping $300 price target on the stock, owing to its massive total addressable market and leaving room for plenty of upside potential. Morgan Stanley analysts are targeting a very bullish $325 stock price with an “overweight” rating. Therefore investors might look to any pullback in the stock as a potentially strategic buying opportunity but not for the faint of heart. After spiraling by 9.5% on Thursday, Datadog is widening its losses today, falling 3.4% as of mid-morning trading. After nearing the $200 level in November, Datadog has taken a step backwards, threatening to fall below the $150-per-share level in recent days. Year-to-date, the stock is up 8.2%, and Wall Street analysts are bullish with an average price target of $218 attached. With OpenAI integration a bullish sign, today’s declines may be technical in nature, as there is no apparent negative catalyst, but the declines are still hitting investor portfolios hard. After losing 7.8% in Thursday’s market downturn, Advanced Micro Devices stock can’t get out of its own way. AMD stock has now dipped below the $200 level, falling a steep 4% in today’s session. AMD clinched its latest all-time high last month when it rose as high as $264 per share, and investors may be taking profits off the table. AMD also has a spot in the coveted OpenAI club, having clinched a recent partnership with the maker of ChatGPT. The consensus is that the stock is worth close to $300 per share, but the ride up is likely going to be bumpy. After falling 7.4% yesterday, Palo Alto Networks is down a further 1.2% today. The cybersecurity company reported earnings and suffered a downgrade by HSBC, which lowered its view on the stock from “hold” to “reduce” with a price target of $157. PANW announced a merger in which it is buying a cloud-management company in a $3.3 billion transaction, which as the buyer could also be weighing on the stock.

Title: Nvidia’s $54B Earnings Test and Fed Minutes Put Best Wallet Token in Play

Time Published: 2025-11-20T12:59:16Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Markets are walking a tightrope this week. Nvidia is set to report $54B+ in Q3 revenue, a figure big enough to make or break the AI trade that has driven much of 2025’s risk rally. Futures across stocks and crypto have been drifting as traders wait to see whether the world’s top AI chipmaker can justify its massive valuation and keep the AI narrative alive. Economists expect roughly 50K new jobs, a clear comedown from earlier in the year. A softer payrolls print combined with divided Fed views on further cuts would reinforce the idea that policy is slowly tilting back toward easier conditions, even if inflation is still above target. Bitcoin has already been slapped down to near seven-month lows, roughly 25–30% below its recent peak, in a pullback analysts describe as sentiment-driven rather than structural. If Nvidia smashes expectations and the macro data lean dovish, that combination could flip the switch back to ‘risk-on’ and give both Bitcoin and altcoins room for a sharp relief rally. When that kind of macro reset hits, fresh liquidity doesn’t just chase the majors. It needs rails, wallets, and launchpads that make it easy for new users to move from fiat into crypto, hop across chains, and discover the next wave of tokens. That’s where infrastructure plays come in, and it’s exactly the lane Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is trying to own with a multi-chain wallet, in-app presale access, and a presale that has already raised more than $17.2M at $0.025975 per token with around 76% staking rewards. The current non-custodial wallet landscape is messy. Newcomers juggle multiple apps, seed phrases, and gas settings across chains, while veterans still pay too much in swap fees and miss early-stage deals because everything is fragmented. Best Wallet is designed to stitch that chaos together, and Best Wallet Token is there to help. The app is a true multi-chain wallet, with support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, Base and more, letting users buy, store, deposit, send, and swap thousands of tokens from one interface. Fiat on-ramps are integrated through partners like Onramper to surface aggressive rates and lower card processing costs, which matters when altcoin rotations kick off and every percentage point of friction eats into upside. Security is handled with MPC tech from Fireblocks and cloud backups instead of exposed seed phrases, plus features like 2FA, biometric login, and advanced anti-fraud tooling. That’s aimed squarely at the next wave of users who want self-custody without feeling like they’re one mistyped word away from losing a portfolio. On top sits the $BEST token. Holding $BEST reduces transaction fees when buying or swapping crypto in-app, cuts swap costs across the 330-DEX, 30-bridge routing stack, and boosts rewards on the upcoming Best Card, which plans up to 8% cashback for heavy users. Best Wallet’s launchpad feature also gives $BEST holders early access to the best crypto presales at a ‘Phase 0’ price before wider listings, letting them rotate into new narratives faster and cheaper than users stuck on legacy wallets. This lines up neatly with where the market is heading. Tokenized funds, regulated stablecoins, and payments giants experimenting with on-chain rails all point toward a future where compliant wallets with deep DeFi hooks become the main interface for value transfer. Best Wallet is built to sit in that intersection, connecting regulated stablecoin flows with native DeFi and presale access. As capital trickles back into risk assets, a wallet-plus-token combo that makes multi-chain navigation easy could attract both first-timers and battle-hardened degen traders. Watch $BEST as onboarding demand grows. The presale is currently priced at $0.025975 per token, with more than $17.2M already raised and a sizeable social footprint across X, Telegram, and Discord. Staking is live during the presale, offering 76% APY powered by an 800M-token (8%) allocation dedicated to staking rewards. That lets early buyers immediately put idle tokens to work while the sale is still ongoing, compounding exposure if the token lists into an improving macro backdrop. Learn how to join and stake in our guide to buying $BEST tokens. If Nvidia’s earnings confirm that the AI boom still has legs and the Fed’s tone softens on the back of a weak 50K jobs print, that cocktail could refill the risk-asset punch bowl. In those conditions, a presale-stage wallet token plugged directly into multi-chain liquidity, presales, and stablecoin rails becomes a clear way to get leveraged exposure to the next adoption wave without betting on a single niche sector like meme coins or gaming. Join $BEST before the presale closes. This article is informational only, not investment advice; crypto prices and presale outcomes are highly speculative and capital is at risk.

Title: Nvidia’s $57B Quarter, Bitcoin’s Rebound, And 3 Tokens Aligned With The Next Risk Cycle
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-nvidia-report-rebounds-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T12:31:56Z

Nvidia’s fiscal Q3 numbers didn’t just beat expectations, they detonated them. Revenue came in at $57.01 billion, almost $2B above what Wall Street was pricing in, with a jaw-dropping $51.2 billion from data-center alone. AI spending isn’t easing off the accelerator; it’s compounding like a tech-market feedback loop on steroids. And yes, that matters for crypto. Bitcoin had slipped under $89,000 after a 27% drawdown from its $126K+ peak six weeks ago. But the moment Nvidia’s earnings hit, BTC snapped back above $91,000, and risk appetite started seeping back into the broader market. Traders suddenly remembered that the so-called “AI bubble” looks a lot more like a structural capital cycle than a blow-off top. The pattern is getting hard to ignore: Through 2024 and 2025, the correlation between high-growth tech and Bitcoin has only tightened as both assets increasingly express the same macro trade, long compute, long scarce digital assets, short fiat dilution. So the question isn’t just where Bitcoin goes next, it’s which parts of the crypto stack actually benefit from this returning liquidity. Capital is rotating into assets with real throughput, real user demand, and tangible cash-flow potential, not just shiny narratives. That’s where programmable Bitcoin layers, multi-chain wallet ecosystems, and even high-octane meme assets start to separate. Below, we look at three projects across that spectrum. One aims to fix Bitcoin’s structural limitations. One is positioning itself as the next major wallet-distribution and order-flow engine. And one is pure speculative beta packaged in meme culture, the kind that historically thrives when risk cycles flip from cautious to greedy. Together, they outline how this next phase of the market could unfold across infrastructure, utility, and culture. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as the first Bitcoin Layer 2 to integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), effectively grafting Solana-grade parallel execution onto Bitcoin’s settlement layer. The pitch is simple but powerful: let Bitcoin handle security and finality, while an SVM-powered L2 processes everything that requires speed, throughput, and programmability. That architecture directly targets Bitcoin’s three long-running frictions: slow block times, high fees during congestion, and limited support for complex applications. Because the SVM stack has already proven itself at high throughput and ultra-low latency, Bitcoin Hyper aims to deliver sub-second performance to wrapped BTC payments, DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and even gaming environments, without dragging interactions through 10-minute blocks. A decentralized Canonical Bridge manages BTC flow between layers, while SPL-style token support and Rust tooling make it easier for Solana-native developers to deploy dApps that tap into Bitcoin’s liquidity without learning an entirely new stack. Momentum on the fundraising side has been strong. The presale has now raised more than $28.1M, placing it among the larger early-stage Bitcoin L2 launches, with tokens currently priced at $0.013305. Recent on-chain activity shows four whale wallets accumulating roughly $532K, including a $53K single purchase, a sign of early conviction from size-on-chain buyers. Those looking to position early can explore how to buy $HYPER, while long-term analysts may want to revisit the latest Bitcoin Hyper price prediction to understand where the project could sit if demand for scalable BTC layers continues to build. Join the $HYPER presale now. If Bitcoin Hyper is a bet on Bitcoin becoming a high-performance settlement engine, Best Wallet is a bet on controlling the front door that users walk through to access that ecosystem. Its pitch is bold: capture a massive share of the wallet market by the end of 2026 by merging security, presale access, liquidity routing, and a smoother user experience into a single interface. The stack behind it is surprisingly serious. Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP architecture at the wallet layer, the same institutional-grade key management used by major exchanges, then layers on portfolio analytics, presale discovery, and Rubic-powered DEX aggregation. In a market where users hop between Bitcoin L2s, Ethereum rollups, Solana, and Base within the same session, routing matters. If a wallet controls where swaps, bridges, and presale entries originate, its native token can effectively tax that flow via fee rebates, yield boosts, or future governance over routing paths. Traction has also been strong. The Best Wallet presale has raised $17.22M+ so far, with tokens currently priced around $0.025975. Staking utilizes a dynamic APY model (currently 76%), adjusting rewards based on demand, lock durations, and liquidity conditions. This mechanism is designed to prevent runaway emissions and keep incentives responsive as volumes shift. If the next cycle brings another wave of retail onboarding as Bitcoin pushes toward or past its highs, the wallets that sit closest to user intent become some of the most leveraged positions in the ecosystem, and Best Wallet is aiming directly at that layer. For traders mapping out the potential upside, our Best Wallet token price prediction offers useful context on how its market share ambitions could translate into value. Explore Best Wallet’s roadmap and presale details. SPX6900 ($SPX) lives on the far end of the spectrum: a meme-driven ERC-20 that blends parody, market cynicism, and pure speculative energy into a single ticker. It primarily runs on Ethereum but extends across Solana and Base via Wormhole, providing multichain liquidity and cross-community reach. Circulating supply sits near 930M SPX, supported by deflationary burn mechanics that lean into the “engineered scarcity” meme. The token’s breakout moment came in early 2024 when it briefly crossed the $1.5B market-cap milestone before cooling toward the mid-hundreds of millions, still enough to hover near the top-100 bracket and sit shoulder-to-shoulder with established meme heavyweights.] Its culture centers on satire, speed, and collective in-jokes rather than utility, but that’s precisely why traders watch it. In risk-on windows, especially when AI stocks rip or Bitcoin reclaims momentum, SPX tends to act as a volatility amplifier. Liquidity often rotates from majors into meme assets with cross-chain presence, and SPX’s ties to Project AEON NFTs give it extra surface area for speculative flows. Track SPX6900 across major exchanges and analytics dashboards. Explore Bitcoin Hyper now.

Nvidia stock rose after the company delivered another huge earnings beat, with Q3 revenue topping $57 billion against expectations of about $55 billion. Data-center sales hit $51 billion, showing demand for AI chips is still accelerating. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.30 per share, above forecasts. The company said several Blackwell GPUs are sold out and guided Q4 revenue to nearly $65 billion, calming AI-bubble worries. Nvidia also modeled zero China revenue due to export rules but still signaled strong global demand, keeping investor momentum intact.

Title: Nvidia’s earnings could answer the AI bubble question and upend global markets in moment of truth for Magnificent 7
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/19/nvidia-earnings-artificial-intelligence-magnificent-seven-apple-stocks-investors-guide/
Time Published: 2025-11-19T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia’s Jensen Huang says he doesn’t believe we’re in an artificial intelligence bubble. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos says we probably are in one. OpenAI’s Sam Altman, the human face of the AI boom, has also invoked a bubble, adding, “I do think some investors are likely to lose a lot of money.” This, in a nutshell, is the narrative of the entire global stock market right now and the conundrum that no tech CEO or asset manager can avoid addressing: Is AI a bubble or not? Much is at stake. Since the current bull market began in October 2022, roughly 75% of gains in the S&P 500 have come from just seven stocks—Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Those companies, known as the Magnificent Seven, have a combined market cap of about $21.5 trillion as of mid-November. Their strategies, Apple’s perhaps excepted, are heavily dependent on AI. But if AI does not deliver the revenues or the efficiencies that Big Tech expects, the fallout in stocks will likely be severe—because the world’s investable assets are currently concentrated in AI and AI-adjacent stocks to an unprecedented degree. The S&P 500 had risen 14.7% this year (at the time of writing), repeatedly breaking new record highs. But 40% of the index’s value comes from the 10 biggest stocks within it, all but one of which are tech companies. Most of those companies, in turn, are pouring vast sums into AI for the development of new data centers, large language models, and the massive amounts of electricity they guzzle. Goldman Sachs estimates that capital expenditure on AI will hit $390 billion this year and increase by another 19% in 2026. Bank of America is even more bullish: It projects that AI capex will hit $1.2 trillion in 2030. The recipients of the lion’s share of that money are 10 AI companies that are interlocked with one another as customers and investors in an “increasingly circular” way, as a recent research note from Morgan Stanleydescribed it. That note referenced relationships between OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, CoreWeave, and AMD, involving billions in equity stakes, revenue sharing, vendor financing, and “repurchase agreement[s]” being passed back and forth among them. On one level, that’s normal: Most industries feature a collection of companies that do business with one another. The problem in AI is that the revenues currently being generated by AI companies are far smaller than the amount of capex being directed at them by the Magnificent Seven. The back-of-the-envelope math is harsh: AI capex coming from tech companies listed in the S&P 500 is $400 billion or more per year, going forward. The biggest AI company—OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT—has disclosed revenues of just $13 billion for 2025. Altman recently said revenues were “well more” than that, hinting they may hit $100 billion in 2027. But that’s still nowhere near the level of capex it’s committing to. OpenAI may have lost $12 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone, according to a disclosure by Microsoft, which has a 32.5% stake in the company. Yet it has committed to spending $1.4 trillion to develop its product—and it is valued by its venture capital and other investors at $500 billion. These numbers don’t add up—and won’t until the massive AI rollout starts to yield real financial benefits. “That is exactly the discussion in the market at the moment. Can the 10 AI companies generate enough revenue to justify the capex?” says Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. If the answer to that question is no, or more relevantly, not soon enough to satisfy investors’ expectations about the future, then the fallout in global equities could be brutal. Take, for instance, the Russell 2000, an index of small-cap U.S. companies: 806 of them, or about 40%, have no earnings or negative earnings. Counterintuitively, the stocks of unprofitable Russell companies have outperformed those that actually made money this year, according to Apollo. Most of those unprofitable companies are tech firms, riding the AI narrative. With the Magnificent Seven dominating large-cap stocks, and money-losing small-caps soaring from optimism around AI, any reversal in sentiment will be widespread, especially if it’s triggered by a softening in AI infrastructure spending. And the broader repercussions in equity markets could be even greater. Since 1990, U.S. assets of all kinds—stocks, bonds, property, you name it—have become increasingly dominant globally. U.S. stocks now account for about 60% of the valuation of all stocks on the planet, according to Christian Mueller-Glissmann, Goldman Sachs’ managing director and head of asset allocation research. And technology stocks represent about 45% of all U.S. stocks, worth $26 trillion or more at the close of October, according to S&P Global. In other words, most of the world’s assets currently look like an upside-down pyramid, teetering on its point. The wide base at the top consists mostly of U.S. equities; underneath that, the performance of those equities is driven by just seven public tech companies. Those seven companies are funding 10 or so much smaller private AI companies, upon whose fortunes they currently rely. And those AI companies—at the very bottom of the inverted triangle—are largely unprofitable. There’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘show me the money’ moment. We think we’re pretty close to the moon already. For that reason, owning the S&P 500 via an exchange-traded fund, traditionally one of the safest and most common bets for smaller “retail” investors, isn’t providing the diversification it used to. Today, it’s largely a bet on a few globally massive tech platforms—concentrating millions of people’s retirement savings toward the tip of that pyramid. The world’s dependence on U.S. equities stems in part from the fact that the U.S. is simply the largest economy in the world, says Mueller-Glissmann, making the concentration a proportional reflection of economic reality. But it also means that if U.S. equities are in a bubble, then the whole world is in a bubble—whether we like it or not. The reason U.S. stocks have become so much bigger than foreign stocks is that the U.S. has a heavier concentration of finance and tech stocks compared with the rest of the world, Mueller-Glissmann adds. Those sectors enjoy a high degree of operating cost leverage, or the ability to increase revenues without adding many new staff or resources. An app with 200 million users doesn’t have anywhere close to twice the running costs of an app with 100 million users, but if a gold mining company wants to double its capacity, it pretty much needs to double its costs in equipment and labor. America has an enormous amount of this “financialization,” Mueller-Glissmann says. “That makes [the] argument a bit more scary, in the sense that this world portfolio is getting more and more important for the global economy in terms of driving wealth effects and in terms of driving financial conditions. So for the next 12 months, investors will stay closely tuned to the revenue picture in AI. For now, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Apollo, and Bank of America have all either published research or told Fortune directly that they expect capex growth for AI to continue unabated through 2026. The bubble has a way to go, in other words. The advice—as always—is to sell…but not right now! (For some concrete investing ideas, see the following pages.) At some point, the tide will go out, and stock investors, venture capital firms, and Big Tech’s AI capex “hyperscalers” will all want to know who has a viable business and who is swimming naked, according to Lisa Shalett, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s chief investment officer. That, in turn, could be the catalyst for a much broader stock market reckoning. Shalett believes that the current period of American exceptionalism—in which U.S. companies and assets dominate the global economy—is due to unwind in what she calls a “great rebalancing.” And when that happens, she wrote in a recent note to clients, its impact won’t be limited to companies with direct stakes in the AI boom. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Shalett argues, American stock market outperformance relative to the rest of the world has been “‘supercharged’ by historic monetary policy intervention” that kept interest rates near zero; deficit spending and fiscal stimulus, including about $4.6 trillion in relief outlays at the height of the COVID pandemic; “and the fruits of globalization, which were enhanced by the privilege of having the world’s reserve currency.” Those factors, Shalett believes, are likely to phase out over the next five to 10 years, with negative implications for U.S. stocks across the board. And that’s where the AI bubble question takes on even more weight. Over the past year, sky-high projections about AI’s economic benefits have helped investors ignore a steady flow of troubling economic indicators. If AI reality fails to live up to the hype, gloom could spread quickly. With global trade becoming more expensive under President Trump’s tariffs, inflation now a semipermanent feature of economic life, and the U.S. facing potential pressure from the bond market to balance its fiscal books, investors are unlikely to be generous if they detect that reliable earnings-per-share growth has been replaced by speculative folly. “People realize that there’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘Show me the money’ moment,” Shalett tells Fortune. “We think we’re pretty close to the moon already.” And if asset values come back down to earth, the challenge will be to avoid burning up on reentry. 75% $21.5 trillion 30.9 This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “How an AI bubble could ruin the party.”

Title: Berkshire Hathaway's Latest Stock Moves Unveiled: What Investors Need To Know

Time Published: 2025-11-18T16:42:11Z
Full Content:
As Buffett prepares to step back as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the company is making moves few would expect from the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett spent decades telling investors he doesn't understand technology stocks well enough to bet big on them. Yet Berkshire Hathaway's latest Securities and Exchange Commission filings show the company has made a new $4.9 billion wager on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), while offloading shares in long-held favorites like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Are these signals that the company is shifting its investment philosophy? The surprise stake in Google’s parent company, worth about $4.9 billion, marks one of the conglomerate’s biggest moves in recent years—one that seems to challenge Buffett’s long-standing caution toward Silicon Valley. With Buffett planning to “go quiet—sort of,” as he put it last week, after his final months as CEO, the moves could mark a new era for one of the world’s most closely watched portfolios. The company’s new 17.8 million-share position in Alphabet signals a potential change in how Berkshire approaches technology stocks. The purchase stands out as Berkshire’s largest new investment of the quarter, after Buffett grew the company's massive cash pile to $382 billion while others poured their money into tech stocks this year. At the 2019 Berkshire annual meeting, Buffett and his late partner Charlie Munger said they had "screwed up" not buying Alphabet earlier, despite watching Google advertising spark massive sales across their own businesses. At the time, shares traded around $59, increasing nearly fivefold in price since. This isn't a typical Buffett buy. The Oracle of Omaha has consistently shied away from tech stocks he says he doesn't fully understand, making an exception only for Apple—which he famously reframed as a consumer products company instead. The timing could suggest Abel's growing influence as he prepares to officially take over as CEO in the New Year. Still, Berkshire's Alphabet shares are worth far less than its stakes in Coca-Cola (KO, 9.9%) and Chevron Corp. (CVX, 7.1%), continuing a portfolio historically dominated by consumer staples and energy. The cut in Apple shares is part of a longer story between the companies. Berkshire slashed its shares by almost 15% last quarter, which means it's sold about 74% of its stake in AAPL in the last two years alone. That seems to mark a systematic unwinding of what was once one of Buffett's highest-conviction bets. The steady sell-off of Bank of America stock suggests Buffett—or his team—sees limited upside in traditional banking at 2025 stock values, possibly concerned about economic headwinds or simply rebalancing away from financial services. Together, those moves continue a broader pattern of profit-taking on legendary legacy holdings. Even so, Apple remains Berkshire’s largest single investment—about 21% of its total portfolio. Meanwhile, Berkshire added $1.2 billion to its Chubb insurance stake, indicating that it remains interested in financial services when the stock price is right. Berkshire's portfolio reshuffling could offer three crucial lessons for everyday investors:
