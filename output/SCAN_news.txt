ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Oracle’s meteoric rise continues to defy expectations. With a 36% surge following its latest earnings and a cumulative 3x gain since early 2023, the enterprise software giant is rewriting the playbook for cloud transformation. But here’s the million-dollar question: Can Oracle realistically triple again from current levels to reach $900 per share? The numbers suggest it's not just possible—it might be inevitable. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – JNJ Stock To $250? Oracle just dropped a bombshell that caught even the most bullish analysts off guard. The company’s remaining performance obligations (RPO) exploded 359% year-over-year to $455 billion from the previous quarter's $138 billion figure. What does this actually mean? Think of RPO as Oracle’s locked-in revenue pipeline—contracts already signed and sealed, just waiting to be delivered. This isn't wishful thinking or ambitious projections; it's money already committed by customers. Oracle didn’t just report numbers—they laid out a clear trajectory for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue that reads like a growth investor's dream: Here’s what makes them credible: most of this revenue is already baked into the reported RPO. Oracle isn't gambling on future demand—they're simply executing on contracts already in hand. Why is everyone suddenly throwing money at Oracle’s cloud? The AI revolution requires massive computational infrastructure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has positioned itself as a premier destination for AI workloads. As companies race to implement AI solutions, they need reliable, scalable cloud platforms—something that Oracle provides. The timing couldn’t be better. While competitors face capacity constraints and pricing pressures, Oracle is expanding aggressively and capturing market share in the highest-growth segments. Let’s break down the path to a $900 stock price with simple, conservative assumptions: Assuming Oracle maintains its operational leverage and margins improve modestly with cloud scale: From today’s levels, that represents a roughly 3x upside. Is a 40x P/E reasonable for 2030? For a company growing cloud revenue at a projected 34% average annual rate with locked-in contracts extending years into the future, a 40x multiple seems conservative, especially in a market that regularly assigns higher multiples to companies with less predictable growth. Note that tech stocks like Microsoft and Amazon currently trade at 35-40 times trailing earnings. Look at Oracle’s Valuation Ratios for more details. No investment thesis is complete without acknowledging potential headwinds. Oracle faces several challenges that could derail this optimistic scenario. Competition intensifies as cloud becomes table stakes. Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud aren’t sitting idle. They have deeper pockets and broader ecosystems. Oracle’s advantage in AI infrastructure could erode if competitors aggressively price or innovate their way back into contention. Economic headwinds could pressure enterprise spending, and companies might delay cloud migrations or renegotiate contracts. While Oracle’s RPO provides some insulation, large enterprise deals can still be postponed or downsized during tough times. Execution risk on this massive scale-up. Growing from $59 billion to $200 billion in annual revenue requires flawless execution across hiring, infrastructure buildout, and customer delivery. Any stumbles could shake confidence in these ambitious projections. Multiple compressions could be more severe than expected. As Oracle matures further, the market might assign lower multiples than our 40x assumption, particularly if interest rates remain elevated. Our separate analysis focusing on the downside risk for Oracle offers more details. Oracle’s latest results represent more than just a good quarter—they signal a fundamental shift in the company’s trajectory and market position. With $455 billion in locked-in future revenue and a clear path to $200 billion in annual sales by 2030, the case for $900 per share is surprisingly straightforward. That said, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the Trefis High-Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So is this a slam dunk? Not quite. Execution risks are real, competition is fierce, and market conditions can change rapidly. But for investors willing to bet on Oracle’s ability to capitalize on the AI-driven cloud boom, the risk-reward equation looks compelling. The 30% after-hours pop might actually be the conservative reaction. When a company provides this level of revenue visibility with this kind of growth trajectory, a 3x move over the next four to five years starts looking less like speculation and more like inevitability. The question isn’t whether Oracle can reach $900—it's whether investors have the patience to ride the journey.

(Negative) Gold – Glinting & Blazing and approaching $4000 US Federal Reserve Policy Outlook, Central Bank Accumulation, Geopolitical Tensions, ETF and Institutional Flows remains the key drivers behind the rally. US inflation hasn’t been fully caged with FED independence remaining under pressure and geopolitics also adding sparks. This may not last forever, but the near-term tide and current is in favor of gold. Gold is turning out to be the main course, serving hot, in one’s portfolio. New highs are in the face of a fresh political crisis in France, Japan and the US sanctions against Russia. Rate cuts bets have intensified after a weaker-than-expected US jobs report last Friday. Generally risk and refuge (Stocks & Gold) do not rally together but this cycle seems diƯerent with lingering inflation, US federal reserve rate cuts and tariƯ driven backdrops. Gold rallying is not a speculative froth but a diversification game by the Central Banks from dollar monopoly to gold. Traders might view it as a hot money chase, but the Central Banks preservation leads to built up in the gold vault and pulling it oƯ the market, creating a scarcity premium. Just an arithmetic of 1% movement from treasuries into bullion could lead to a gold rise beyond $4000 an ounce, or even more. Headwinds Bullish moves may be challenging on growing skepticism over the impact of the Supreme Court verdict (October 14th) on Trump’s plea on the tariƯ matter. US inflation data for August is due this week with an expected upside due to tariƯs, which may have a bearing on the US Fed rate cut decisions. Markets are on a close watch. Levels On any eventuality of a gold correction, immediate support is seen at $3616 and $3578. Up to 16th Sept’25 the gold volatility could witness rally beyond $3700 for a $3781 target which acts as a stoploss for the shorts targeting $3422. In the short-term gold seems to be overbought, but the broader trend is still positive. Weaker numbers of the US inflation data this week could boost gold further.

The company has shown encouraging signs of turnaround, but the FY25 profit was largely aided by tax credits and core profitability remains thin. At a P/E of over 60x, the issue looks aggressively priced, especially with most of the proceeds going to existing shareholders through the OFS. For investors, this IPO is a high-risk, high-reward bet, suitable only for those with a long-term horizon who believe in the company’s ability to scale sustainably as online penetration deepens. Our stance would be to ‘apply with caution,’ given the growth potential but stretched valuations.” Urban Company IPO subscribed 5% within minutes of opening.

A major downward revision to Nonfarm Payrolls showed 911,000 fewer jobs added between March 2024 and March 2025 than previously reported. Coupled with last week’s weak labor data, markets are now pricing in three rate cuts this year, including one at next week’s Fed meeting. Inflation figures due later this week could further shape rate expectations. Meanwhile, gold’s rally is also being supported by safe-haven demand amid geopolitical risks, US tariff concerns, and strong central bank buying. The metal is up 39% year-to-date. On Tuesday, the 10Y benchmark (6.33 GS 2035) opened 1 bps lower at 6.46% vs 6.47% tracking the fall in US Treasury yields as the sharply lower US non-farm payrolls data induced traders to fully factor in a 25bps rate cut by the Federal Reserve on Sep 17 policy. However, the fall was short lived, and yields surged to end at 6.49% as market participants booked profits amid lack of fresh triggers. Market participants now await India’s CPI inflation data due to be released on Sep 12, Friday for further directions.

The deceleration in growth is due to a slowdown in government capex (fiscal consolidation and execution limits in key sectors) and due to heightened caution in the private sector (muted near-term demand, tariffs, etc.). While high growth (20%+) seen post COVID-19 is unlikely anytime soon, we believe ~10-11% growth in capex is very much achievable and sustainable given the continuing policy focus (central govt capex is up sharply YTD), very strong power-related capex (which should continue for the next several years), solid balance sheets, strong cash flows, and healthy capex intentions of corporates. A 10% growth environment offers pockets of opportunity for healthy earnings growth – we prefer industrial names with stronger tailwinds and optionality (CG Power), strong and diversified end markets (Cummins India), and the possibility of an uptick in margins (Thermax). We initiate coverage of ABB India at Neutral, and of Siemens and BHEL at UW. Our order of preference in industrials is L&T, CG Power, Cummins India and Thermax. Stick to growth and visibility: Prefer L&T, CG Power, Cummins and Thermax – L&T remains our top pick with its attractive valuation (24x core FY27E P/E) with high RoCEs (30%+) and EPS growth (18%+). In this report, we initiate coverage of: 1) CG Power at OW (strong growth, supported by expanding transformer capacity and optionality from OSAT), 2) Cummins India at OW (demand visibility, strong margin performance), 3) Thermax at OW (margin tailwinds as low margin projects end). We also initiate coverage of ABB India and Praj at Neutral, and Siemens and BHEL at UW.

The stock of Piramal Pharma bounced off the support at ₹182 early this month. Last week, it closed above a key resistance at ₹195, turning the short-term outlook positive. Also, the price is now above both 21- and 50-day moving averages. While the price action shows that the stock has been flat in the past few sessions, the breakout remains valid, and we expect it to soon see another leg of uptrend.

Title: Thinking more broadly: Bonds beyond vanilla
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/09/thinking-more-broadly-bonds-beyond-vanilla/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T23:09:18Z

Traditionally, the job description for a core bond manager was numbing: (1) show up for work, (2) buy a bunch of Treasury bonds and some investment grade intermediate corporates, (3) celebrate the trading coup that allowed you to buy the same bond as everyone else but for a quarter basis point less – woohoo!, (4) go home and enjoy a fiber-rich dinner and small glass of red wine. In reality, managers added negligible value. Over 10 years (through August 2025), the core bond fund trailing 75% of its peers returned 1.7% annually, the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (a proxy for “the market”) returned 1.8% annually, and a fund leading 75% of its peers returned 2.2%. Net difference between cellar and penthouse: 0.5% per year. (Source: MFOPremium calculations, Lipper Global Datafeed data.) And that’s pretty typical for other trailing periods. As a result, relative returns were highly dependent on efficiency: very large funds with very low expense ratios, able to place bids on very large lots of very efficiently priced bonds, had a nearly unbeatable structural advantage. 10-year performance difference between the top quartile and the bottom quartile Core bond: 0.5% annually (per MFO Premium) Core stock: 1.6% annually (per Morningstar) In a world where US Treasury bonds are the world’s safest investment and among its most reliably profitable, it was an unbeatable recipe. We might be leaving that world behind, which suggests we might need to consider possibilities where diversification and manager judgment might add substantial value. That implies the possibility of considering an ongoing stake in credit rather than just investment grade, in international rather than just U.S., in special situations rather than just vanilla auctions, and in shorter durations. For intelligent investors—regardless of whether financial analysis is a daily habit or a distant interest—it’s becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the mounting alarm bells surrounding the United States’ fiscal outlook. In mid-2025, the national debt stands at over $37 trillion, a sum now greater than the entire American economy. This staggering figure reflects years of budget deficits and a political climate where policy decisions often appear driven more by ideology, self-interest and brinkmanship than any rational economic strategy. Even major investors, once reliant on U.S. Treasury bonds for security, are beginning to question how much longer the world’s largest borrower can sustainably fund its needs without consequence (Drew Desilver, “Key facts about the US national debt,” Pew Research, 8/12/2025). (Sources: Historical Debt Outstanding, US Treasury; Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, 9/2025) These fiscal realities are not happening in isolation. As the U.S. government takes on more debt, with rising costs just to pay interest, confidence in federal bonds has begun to erode. Recent episodes of political gridlock over spending caps and the debt limit have highlighted just how reactive and unpredictable U.S. fiscal policy has become. The practical effect is a new era of vulnerability for traditional income portfolios anchored almost solely on U.S. Treasuries and investment-grade corporates. Investors are seeing the value of home-country assets increasingly shaped by fiscal risk and short-term fixes rather than predictable economic fundamentals. In contrast, a growing number of foreign markets not only boast more attractive valuations but also signal ripening opportunities as non-U.S. economies chart their own paths out of stagnation. Diversification, therefore, isn’t simply about chasing higher yields or speculating abroad—it’s emerging as a necessary hedge against the potential excesses of U.S.-centric fiscal and market dynamics. One measure of that changed dynamic is Research Affiliates’ estimates of the risks and returns, given a series of uniform economic assumptions, of dozens of asset classes. The following table gives the 10 highest Sharpe assets plus the US bond aggregate. Categories in black are fixed income (seven of 11), and blue are equity. (Source: Research Affiliates, Asset Allocation Interactive, 9/2025) By contrast, the three asset classes with negative expected 10-year Sharpe ratios are US Large-Cap stocks (-0.03), Developed Markets Large Growth stocks (-0.06), and US Large Growth stocks (-0.12). Bottom line: investors need to consider looking for core exposure, not just 5% nibbles, in areas beyond the common. The bad news is that many of the most intriguing income investments are not easily accessible to most investors: closed-end interval funds such as RBC Blue Ray Destra International Event-Driven Credit (CEDIX) or Carlyle Tactical Private Credit (TAKNX), often have high minimums and limited brokerage access. Others, such as SEI Opportunistic Income (SIIT) Fund and GMO Emerging Country Debt, are institutional. Those structural quirks – the ability to use leverage and to lock large investments in place by denying investors the chance to redeem at will – give those managers exceptional advantages. That said, there are intriguing options available to regular investors. We searched the MFO Premium database for funds that met six criteria: And, finally, they had to be purchasable. Sixteen funds survived the cut. The funds are sorted by Sharpe ratio. How to read that chart: The first three columns are easy. Name, Lipper fund category, and average yearly return over the past four years. Down capture is the percentage of the US bond market’s downside that the fund captured. A negative down capture means the fund tended to rise when the US bond market fell. The R-squared (R2) measures the degree of correlation between the fund and the US bond market: 100 means that the fund marches in lockstep with the bond market; 0 means the fund is completely independent of it. Finally, visual represents of three performance metrics: a maximum drawdown rating (how far the fund fell relative to its peers), downside deviation rating (called “bad deviation,” it’s a measure of how much a fund routinely falls relative to its peers) and Ulcer rating (our favorite: a measure of how far a fund falls and how long it takes to recover; deep fall + long recovery = massive investor ulcers). In each case, a blue cell signals top 20% performance. MFO does not make “sell now!” or “buy now!” calls, much less predictions about “the 10 funds you absolutely must own!” Those calls are easy to make, impossible to make reliably. Our argument is simpler: we are in the midst of a fiscal mess, which is likely to get messier and messier. It would be prudent, before any panic sets in, to examine the question: are there ways to reduce my exposure to emerging risks and still earn a decent return? The funds above have made money over the past five years; the US bond market has not. Those funds uniformly aim to provide high current income with admirably low exposure to the traditional income markets. And it reminds us, again, of the consistent independence and excellence of the CrossingBridge folks who are responsible for the two highest-rated funds on the list (CrossingBridge Low Duration and RiverPark Strategic Income). We will try to profile three of these funds each month during the last three months of 2025. David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts). Cofounder, lead writer.

Title: Ethereum bet jumped 11x in 5 years — from $1,000 to $11,145, should investors still bet on ETH today?

Ethereum has quietly been one of the most rewarding bets in crypto. A $1,000 investment made just five years ago in 2020 would now be worth around $11,145, an 11x jump despite wild swings along the way. But with ETH trading around $4,327 this September, investors are asking the real question: is Ethereum still worth buying after such explosive gains, or is the big money already made?

Despite GST 2.0's reforms aiming to boost consumption and corporate earnings, FIIs continue selling Indian stocks, driven by Trump's tariff concerns and global uncertainties. A significant FII exodus, reaching ₹1.4 lakh crore in 2025, persists despite domestic investor support. High valuations and the lure of cheaper markets further fuel the foreign investor skepticism.

Title: Serious U.S. Dollar Fed Warning Issued As Bitcoin Mounts $24 Trillion Gold Price Challenge

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has surged this year, topping $124,000 per bitcoin in August as a growing crisis at the Federal Reserve takes a surprising turn. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has doubled since this time last year—with some now predicting bitcoin is on the brink of a $84 trillion shock—with the massive $4 trillion rally causing some of the world’s biggest celebrities to jump on the crypto bandwagon. Now, as the new crypto gold rush forges what could be the new “Rockefellers or Rothschilds,” Goldman Sachs analysts have warned the U.S. dollar’s global reserve-currency status could be eaten away by gold—just as bitcoin comes for its safe-haven asset crown. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “A scenario where Fed independence is damaged would likely lead to higher inflation, lower stock and long-dated bond prices, and an erosion of the dollar’s reserve-currency status,” Goldman analysts including Samantha Dart wrote in a note to clients seen by Bloomberg. “In contrast, gold is a store of value that doesn’t rely on institutional trust.” Trump has been ramping up his war of words against the Federal Reserve this year, attacking Fed chair Jerome Powell as economists warn of a looming dollar disaster. Trump has threatened to fire Powell and tried to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook, sparking fears over the future of the Fed’s independence from the White House. Dart predicted the gold price could surge to $5,000 an ounce if U.S. president Donald Trump’s war on the Fed causes global investors to lose confidence in bonds, stocks, and the dollar, with only a small shift from the massive Treasuries market into bullion enough to trigger outsized gains. “As a result, gold remains our highest-conviction long recommendation in the commodities space," Dart wrote, adding, “we estimate that if 1% of the privately owned U.S. Treasury market were to flow into gold, the gold price would rise to nearly $5,000/[troy ounce], assuming everything else constant." Gold’s rally this year, climbing from $2,500 an ounce 12 months ago to $3,600 today and giving gold a $24 trillion market capitalization, has come alongside a bitcoin price boom that’s sent bitcoin, sometimes called digital gold, to record highs. “[Bitcoin] sits at the intersection of gold and equities—an emerging store of value that thrives when liquidity rotates into risk,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments following the latest U.S. jobs report coming in below expectations, setting up the Federal Reserve to cut rates later this month as U.S. president Donald Trump has called for. “With $7.2 trillion in money market funds likely to move as yields fall, bitcoin offers the ultimate hybrid profile: digital gold for safety, and asymmetric upside as a risk-on asset. Seasonality also strengthens the setup, with the fourth quarter historically bitcoin’s strongest quarter—the asset has only seen two negative Octobers in its entire history— suggesting that as liquidity returns, buying pressure could accelerate into year-end.” Technical analysis comparing bitcoin to gold by Coindesk shows the bitcoin price could be headed for “a potential breakout by late in the fourth quarter or early next year.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Meanwhile, the World Gold Council is developing a digitalized form of gold as fears grow that bitcoin could replace it as the world's safe-haven asset. "We are trying to standardise that digital layer of gold, such that the various financial products used in other markets can be used in the gold market going forward,” David Tait, a former banker and chief executive of the World Gold Council, an industry body representing gold miners, told the Financial Times. “My goal is that many asset managers around the world will suddenly look at it differently." Fears that bitcoin could overtake gold among investors seeking exposure to a scarce, non-governmental or corporate asset have been heightened by the rapid rise of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which now hold almost as much in assets under management (AUM) as gold ETFs despite spot bitcoin ETFs only being launched at the beginning of 2024. "How long before AUM in 'digital gold’ ETFs surpasses physical? Bitcoin ETF assets are closing in on gold ETF assets," financial markets research company Bespoke’s account posted to X, pointing to data that showed they are now worth $150 billion and $180 billion, respectively.
