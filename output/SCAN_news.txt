Most Widely Read Newspaper Kindly share this story: The presale of DTX Exchange is capturing market interest as it has managed to raise just over $6.5 million and plans to integrate DEX and CEX elements within its independent Layer-1 blockchain. Providing up to 1000x more liquidity than most existing cryptocurrencies, DTX is designed to facilitate both crypto and traditional financial operations, without the need for additional blockchains. According to analysts, listing the Binance would significantly have an impact on the price of DTX through the roof as a 1 ETH investment opportunity. However, BTC and ETH have painted a bullish picture if key support levels are intact, such as what we see Bitcoin is currently trading below the realized price and ETH is good for a short-term up move. Bitcoin Struggles Below Realized Price, Testing Market Support It is currently priced at $68,608 below the realized price of $69,352 thus slowing down the chances of a bounce back to $72,000. Hitherto, prices tested below the realized price imply that the amount of selling pressures is bearish, therefore depressing the market. Although prices managed to go slightly above this level in the past, the Bitcoin price has been struggling and recently fell below this level as market participants wonder how low the price of BTC could go. According to a recent analysis, it explained that if the price manages to hold the $69K, then it could surge to $78K. However, the prolonged trading below the realized price gives the impression that the company’s stock has more downside than upside in the current bear market. Bitcoin has gained 60% of the market share recently, proving it is back from the aggressiveness of the altcoin season this past year.

The analyst considers $1,551 as another ‘break even’ level for the Ethereum holders and believes that such a price level may lead to further erosion of confidence. However, some signals suggest a bullish rally in the short term for Ethereum. As per the crypto analyst Therefore, if a wedge pattern is cleared for Ethereum in the future it will be possible for it to move up to $2,750 which will be good news for investorsIn the long-term, Ethereum has certain aims including $6,000 as some experts, under the assumption of other market indicators persist.

Key Highlights -Impact on India Pharmaceuticals: Indian generic drug exports to the US may face tariff revisions, potentially affecting the pharmaceutical sector. IT Sector: A slowdown in US discretionary spending due to trade wars could negatively impact India’s IT exports. FPIs: If US interest rate cuts are delayed, FPI inflows into India could diminish, as there is an inverse relationship between US interest rates and FPI flows into emerging markets. India’s Monetary Policy: Any delay in US rate cuts could also delay India’s repo rate cuts, prolonging pressures on the Indian economy, which is already seeing a slowdown in earnings growth. “A Trump victory should ideally flag off the next leg of US market dominance over the global markets. It would also contribute to an accompanying rise in bond market yields, particularly the 10-year Treasury. A stronger US bond yield would exacerbate the capital outflows from the Indian markets triggering another cruel spell of drawdowns. Additionally, we could see a pronounced comeback of the protectionist tendencies, which we first glimpsed in Trump’s last stint as the US President. Between 2017 and 2020, the denial rate of H-1B visas ramped up putting IT companies in a fix. With Trump coming to power, there could be employee and workflow disruptions leading to transitory, minor dents in the top lines of IT companies. However, the symbolic posturing behind the move will be sobering for a country like India, with a massive workforce looking to market their skill overseas. If the democratic nominee Kamala Harris comes to power, it would be a non-factor, essentially an extension of the policies of the incumbent President Joe Biden.” Bank Nifty opened today’s session with a gap-down at 51,053 versus yesterday’s close of 51,215.

Most Asia-Pacific markets were also trading lower, reflecting caution ahead of the U.S. election results.

Additionally, when comparing growth rates with December 2023, deposit growth has continued to outpace credit offtake. Credit offtake increased by 8.0% compared to December 2023, reaching Rs 172.4 lakh crores as of October 18, 2024. Mortgages and MSMEs account for the bulk of this increase. However, the growth slowdown compared to last year can be attributed to a higher base effect due to the merger and RBI measures such as higher risk weights and the proposed LCR norms. Deposits rose at 8.6% compared to December 2023, reaching Rs 218.1 lakh crore as of October 18, 2024. This growth can be attributed to rising term deposit rates of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs). The Short-term Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) has decreased to 6.43% as of October 18, 2024, compared to 6.74% as of October 27, 2023, indicative of surplus liquidity.

The Global Methane pledge was adopted in COP26 and countries that were part of the pledge agreed to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. A number of National Oil companies globally have joined the OGMP 2.0 framework and are also part of the Oil and Gas Climate initiative. Cairn’s entry into this very elite club of companies which have adopted the OGMP framework will mean regular (annual) reporting on emissions and potentially a commitment to reach Level 5 reporting (most rigorous reporting) within a 3-5 year timeframe. This should encourage industry peers in India to also consider adopting the framework and moving towards higher quality of reporting of methane emissions. 👉Net profit up 21.4% at ₹440.5 cr vs ₹363 cr
