Title: Here’s How High Bitcoin Price Would Be At Gold’s ATH Market Cap
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/how-high-bitcoin-price-gold/
Time Published: 2025-12-24T14:30:47Z
Full Content:
Gold has reached unprecedented price levels at the end of 2025, breaking above $4,525 per ounce and setting fresh all-time highs as Bitcoin price continues to struggle. That surge has pushed gold’s total market capitalization to levels that dwarf the value of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. This difference between gold, the established safe-haven asset and Bitcoin, a growing digital store of value, invites a provocative question: if BTC’s total valuation equaled gold’s peak market cap, what price would BTC have to reach? Gold’s rally in 2025 captured global attention as prices climbed past $4,500 per ounce for the first time, setting a new record that reflects more than just short-term speculation. Gold’s strength this year is not just about price per ounce. In market-cap terms, gold has added about $12 trillion in value since the start of 2025 alone. That single-year increase in gold’s market capitalization is around seven times larger than the entire Bitcoin market cap. This recent all-time high price has helped boost gold’s total market capitalization to an estimated $31.1 trillion, based on the total value of above-ground gold stocks multiplied by the elevated price per ounce. Bitcoin’s market capitalization currently stands at $1.736 trillion, based on a circulating supply of just under 20 million BTC. Unlike gold, BTC’S total valuation has not increased this year. Instead, it has shrunk by roughly $100 billion since January 1, with its price now struggling in the mid-$80,000s. Market Cap Of Gold And Bitcoin. Source: Companiemarketcap.com Put simply, Bitcoin is only a small slice of gold’s valuation. At today’s levels, gold’s $31 trillion market cap means that Bitcoin fits into gold roughly 18 times over. This ratio is a good reference point for Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential, given its reputation as a digital version of gold. If Bitcoin were to match gold’s $31 trillion market capitalization, the corresponding price per BTC would be considerably higher than current levels. Using a circulating supply of about 19.96 million BTC, BTC would need to push to approximately $1.55 million per coin to reach parity with gold’s current all-time-high market cap. The amount of capital inflow needed for BTC to reach this price level is massive and unprecedented. Still, many Bitcoin maximalists believe this scenario is not unrealistic over an extended timeframe. Michael Saylor, one of Bitcoin’s most vocal advocates, has proposed that BTC will eventually surpass gold in total market value within the next 10 years. In a November interview, Saylor said he has “no doubt” that BTC will become a larger asset class than gold by 2035. It is obvious that 2025 is about to be a red year for Bitcoin and the entire crypto market. However, 2026 could play out as a recovery and normalization year. Recovery in this context does not imply explosive upside, but a period where bearish price action is worked off and confidence in BTC is rebuilt gradually.

Title: A chaotic 'up-crash' for markets riding a turbulent 2025

Please let us know The Business Topic:Reserve Bank Of Australia Interest rates fell, inflation kept surprising and the AI billions and trillions kept flowing: world stock markets had a party. (Unsplash: Krys Amon/licence) AI. Market records. Tariffs. Penguins. TACO. It's been a big year of economic shocks and surges as the international framework of global trade was shredded. In other major news, a company famous for making gaming PC chips became the world's most valuable, and Australia's key interest rate stuttered downwards then flatlined. George Tharenou, chief economist for Australia at investment bank UBS, was in New York during April's so-called "liberation day", when US President Donald Trump revealed a sweeping regime of tariffs that stunned global markets. "It was surreal seeing the markets move to meltdown amid the uncertainty," he recalled. "This is a true bubble-like mentality, and it doesn't look like there's initially anything right now to pop it," argues UBS's George Tharenou. (ABC News: John Gunn) And there were many more shocks to come. To analyse the hits and misses of 2025, the ABC quizzed some of Australia's most prominent economists about four intertwined elements that helped to define the year. Those key events and trends: Asked to summarise 2025's economic picture, Shane Oliver, the head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP, was succinct: "Resilience. But tell that to the penguins of the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands to the distant south-west of Australia — bizarrely singled out in one of the biggest developments of the year, April's US tariffs. Placing heavy tariffs on exports from islands that have no human residents or trade with the US was emblematic of the chaos unleashed when the US administration revealed expensive new costs on goods sent to the nation. "The big thing for the last year in terms of markets has just been how strong they've been," says Shane Oliver. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine) "What we saw on 'liberation day' was a sign that Donald Trump wanted to rip up the global architecture that had prevailed for much of the post-[World War II] period," Dr Oliver said. The tariffs place a cost on trade from allies, neighbours and perceived enemies alike. While staunch US allies such as Australia and the UK were hit with a 10 per cent rate, at one point, a 145 per cent tariff was going to be put on trade with China. The US defended placing tariffs on islands that lacked trade or humans, suggesting that otherwise they would become a penguin-portal of countries seeking to avoid US levies. "The idea is that there are no countries left off," US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told broadcaster CBS. Taxing penguins was just part of the slapdash nature of the levies, which would make goods imported into the US more expensive, according to Dr Oliver. The impact — as countries scrambled for deals, exceptions and new markets for their goods — was panic. Sally Auld, chief economist at NAB, said she grabbed the red pen, essentially revising down projections of US and global economic growth for 2025. But as deals were made and the application of many tariffs was paused, that frosty view thawed. NAB chief economist Sally Auld says stock markets, worldwide, are buoyant for a single reason: "The whole tech complex has really led the market higher." (ABC News: John Gunn) Australia held on the "baseline" 10 per cent tax on goods exported to the US, while countries across the globe cut deals. "It became clear that most other countries really just didn't want to fight," Ms Auld said. Betashares chief economist David Bassanese watched the initial tariff hit play out on financial markets. "Markets reacted, fearing it could tip the US economy into recession," he recalled. What came next was the so-called "TACO trade" — standing for Trump Always Chickens Out — when the negative impact of deals or ideas became known. "We didn't get a tit-for-tat escalation in the trade wars. So most countries … basically rolled over and accepted the tariffs that Donald Trump imposed on them," says David Bassanese. (ABC News: John Gunn) "We have seen that. He has scaled back the tariffs through the course of the year. He's announced some deals with countries," Mr Bassanese said. Our nation is heavily exposed to moves in global trade — particularly commodity markets that set the price for exports like iron ore and gold. But at the start of the year, a huge focus was placed on a boardroom in a temporary office in Sydney, where the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board was meeting to set interest rates. At the start of the year, anticipation of a cut to official interest rates was intense. The RBA had hiked the cash rate to 4.35 per cent in November 2023 and held it there through 2024. With around one-third of Australians servicing a mortgage — and a further third renting, many from landlords with mortgages — the public was feeling the pain of higher repayments. Consumers slashed their spending as the cost-of-living crisis kept chomping at household budgets. "There was undoubtedly a lot of tension," said independent economist Nicki Hutley. "Part of the reason [households] were doing it tough wasn't just interest rates, it was higher-than-usual inflation." "We're very tightly poised", said independent economist Nicki Hutley, between lowering inflation without risking some significant rises in the unemployment rate. (ABC News: John Gunn) By late 2022, consumer prices were rising at a rate of 7.8 per cent a year. That tempered this year, with price rises at one point slowing to 1.9 per cent, below the 2–3 per cent target range the central bank was aiming for. The RBA cut the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points in February, May and August. "The pressure was there because we could see inflation was coming down, we could see the economy was really, really sluggish," Ms Hutley said. NAB's Ms Auld said the impact of a lower cost of money was flowing through the economy, with stronger consumer spending and higher housing prices. "The challenge has been that the recovery that we've got is already starting to lessen the scope for inflation to fall," she said. Most market watchers have now changed their initial view that the RBA would cut rates further in the final months of 2025 or the start of 2026, as inflation has ticked up, once again rising above the central bank's 2–3 per cent target. Mr Tharenou has what will be an unpopular view for people with big outstanding debts — interest rates are more likely to go up than down. It's a view shared by a growing cohort of economists, and expressed by RBA governor Michele Bullock herself. "I think begrudgingly the RBA is going to shift towards raising the cash rate by the middle of next year," Mr Tharenou said. AMP has forecast rates to remain on hold through 2026, with the risk skewing towards a hike. Dr Oliver said in order for a rate cut to be back on the table, unemployment would need to rise. In the most recent data, the unemployment rate remained at 4.3 per cent in November, down from 4.4 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms in September. At the end of 2024, both the trend and seasonally adjusted measures were 4 per cent. The RBA's rate-setting board next meets on February 2 and 3. "Liberation day" might have sounded like freedom but the initial reaction of global stock markets was unrestrained panic. In New York, the S&P 500 index wiped $7.5 trillion in value in the two days after the announcement. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 22 per cent from its December 2024 record close and the Dow Jones, European indices and Australia's markets fell more than 5 per cent. "The push-pull factors in markets this year have been a) Donald Trump and tariffs, but b) the positive of the AI boom," said Betashares's Mr Bassanese. Massive investments in artificial intelligence, data centres and computer chips propelled the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech companies most exposed to the boom — Google's parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Facebook's parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Nvidia. The stock price of the latter has rocketed more than 1,200 per cent after its computer chips — originally powering the visuals of gaming computers — became the bedrock of an AI boom. Nvidia leapfrogged Microsoft to become the most valuable company in the world, and the first to be valued at more than $US4 trillion ($6 trillion). It's what George Tharenou of UBS describes as an "up-crash". "It's almost a detachment from fundamentals," he said. "We haven't really had a boom in the real economy, but we have had a boom in asset markets." "People call it FOMO [Fear of Missing Out]. The higher the price, the higher the demand. People just want to get into asset markets and not miss out." Despite a recent dip, the ASX 200 index of our largest companies is up close to 5 per cent year-to-date. That makes sense to Shane Oliver of AMP. "We've seen the interest rate cuts, we've seen profits, particularly in the US, continue to surprise on the upside. And even though conditions have been on the soft side [in Australia], we've avoided recession". The runaway performance of the "Magnificent Seven" has brought fears of a repeat of the late-1990s, early-2000s dot-com market crash. But there's a key difference, said NAB's Sally Auld. While the dot-com bubble and the subsequent burst were driven by hysteria around companies trading at really expensive valuations despite being "yet to turn a dollar", Ms Auld said, "that's definitely not the case this time around". Bolstering that case is the mind-melting amounts of money being spent on data centres, factories and technology to power the AI revolution. "I think that number is now close to $500 billion, which is a huge number, and really forcing people to accept that this is a new innovation cycle," she said. The capital expenditure has been so large that it has put a so-called floor under the growth of the US economy. "Somewhere between 40 to 50 per cent of [gross domestic product] growth in the first six months of this year in the US can be accounted for by that huge AI capex spend — it's helping to prop up equity markets." The potential impact remains huge. So is the risk. "We're all openly talking about the fact that there are bubbles and almost thinking that it doesn't matter, that somehow, mystically, this time will be different," economist Nicki Hutley said. George Tharenou is another who isn't convinced the gains are justified by fundamentals. "It's almost the opposite of the law of economics," says Mr Tharenou, describing this year's market behaviour.

Title: 20VC x SaaStr: 2025’s Winners, 2026’s IPOs, and Why the Tech Lash Is Coming

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts The year in review with Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll The year that changed everything is almost over. In this special year-end episode, Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll break down the founders, funds, and companies that defined 2025—and make bold predictions for what’s coming in 2026. From Dario Amodei earning “Founder of the Year” to why SpaceX will IPO before OpenAI, from the talent wars that “threw all conventions out the window” to why unemployment data could trigger a massive tech lash—this is the definitive look at where we’ve been and where we’re going. Spoiler: If you’re a B2B company that didn’t reaccelerate with AI in 2025, you got an F minus. And if unemployment ticks up even 2-3 points next year for any reason? “Society will be terrified of AI.” The unanimous choice wasn’t about predictions of mass unemployment (which the panel largely dismissed). It was about execution. Claude 3.5 and 4 changed everything—enabling vibe coding, powering Cursor, making Lovable and Replit actually work. “Without this, we have no vibe coding,” Jason said. “Many of these products existed for years. They did not work until Claude.” But it’s not just product. Rory highlighted Anthropic’s business execution: “Growth rate faster than OpenAI, valuation convergence even after OpenAI’s potential new round at $800B… he’s cranked out the ‘I’m going to get profitable, I’m going to be sensible.’ If you own those stocks at the start of the year, this is the stock you’d feel most excited about.” Honorable mentions went to Gwyn Shotwell at SpaceX (“navigating geopolitically challenging times with Elon’s brand this year… exceptional”), Alex Wang at Scale AI (“the best of the pseudo-hire playbook—moment in time, playing your cards right”), and Vlad at Robinhood (“Nine products doing over $100 million in revenue. JFC.”). Index wins on pure execution: Wiz (announced this year, $32B), Figma (seed), and Revolut ($75B). “Competent execution across multiple different exits,” Rory said. “Exits are the coin of the realm.” But Jason gave his vote to Neo on aesthetics and hustle: first money into Cursor and Cognition. “24 months ago, he seemed to be having weird arguments with Gary Tan on Twitter. Now he’s literally hustling his way into cursor, hanging out at MIT, giving programming tests himself.” And the wildcard? Google—owning ~10% of SpaceX, ~14% of Anthropic, and the majority of Waymo. “Those three with double-digit ownerships, even if done in a circular way… corporate investor of the year.” Meta paying $100M for individual researchers. The $14B deal to acquire a company’s team while letting investors keep the husk. Nat and Daniel getting their venture fund acquired too. “The entire convention on why people buy companies, how employees get treated, how much a human can be paid to do a job got thrown out of the window in the space of 6 months,” Rory said. In retrospect, the logic makes sense: “If you’re spending $73 billion on capex, spending $5 billion to make sure the people using the capex know what they’re doing probably makes sense.” The other massive surprise? There’s no ceiling on venture outcomes anymore. Lovable going from $2B to $8B valuation in weeks. Anthropic at $100M being “the deal of the century from a risk-reward outcome.” “That there is no ceiling on venture… changes all the math and calculations.” “Every founder, every VC—our job was to ride this torrent of AI,” Jason explained. “If you’re not an LLM, your job this year was to ride the greatest wave of our lifetimes.” Databricks did exactly that. In 2021, Databricks was presenting about managing cloud compute and data—nothing about AI. Now they’re at $5B revenue growing 55%, accelerating, while Snowflake’s AI revenue remains small. “If we had to have canon of the year for who rode the AI wave and utterly changed the trajectory of the company, it would be Databricks.” Other breakouts: Eleven Labs (scaled to $400M ARR, standing off OpenAI competition—”$30 in 10 minutes versus $2,000 in two weeks”), and Open Evidence (capturing 500K of the 1M US doctors in one year by perfectly targeting medical search). Jason’s order: SpaceX goes first (probably summer), Canva second (“the AI story is not perfect, but the numbers are there—do it now before looking obsolete”), Databricks in the back half (“it’s just the Series M”), Anthropic at year-end (“the simpler way to solve their capital needs”). OpenAI? Probably mid-2027. “It’s burning too much.” The challenge: taking a company public at $1 trillion is an unsolved banking problem. “What do you do with $950 billion in stock when many owners have been in for 10-15 years? Could be tricky.” The top B2B public stocks (Palantir, Cloudflare, Monday, Shopify, CrowdStrike, Snowflake) have all figured out their AI tailwinds. Jason’s betting at least three stay in the top six next year: “I’m not a hedge fund guy, but the trends aren’t going to change much.” But the contrarian bet? Salesforce. Trading at all-time low revenue multiples (5-5.5x), but when Agent Force actually works at scale: “Every single Salesforce customer is going to want that product. Would you like this agent to automatically go after all the customers your team didn’t follow up with? Sign me the f— up.” The warning: Adobe is “the worst offender” for claiming $5B of “AI-influenced revenue” without net new bookings. “If you’re going to hide in your tower and say ‘we grew 8% but half was AI-influenced’—that’s table stakes.” “2025’s biggest failure was the co-pilot,” Jason said. “We’re not going to put it in our base product. We’re not going to make the core product better. But we’re not going to provide so much value that you want to pay for it. That was the cynical whiteboard of January 2025 that failed up and down the B2B board.” The counterexample? Notion. If they really hit 50% growth at $600M, the only explanation is customers paying $20/month instead of $10 for their AI offering. “I can’t use Notion without AI as a 10-year customer. It’s worth the 2x.” Very few B2B companies have earned that premium. Rory’s pick: Buy Google, short Nvidia. “If the capex cycle continues and we’re all still spending, Nvidia does fine. But unless they need continued acceleration… Google has upside if the capex tide goes out.” Jason’s counter: “You’re a fool to invest against Nvidia for 2026. There’s not enough time for competing GPUs and TPUs to get into data centers that don’t exist. 2027? I don’t know. But 2026—the bet’s still on.” Amazon is the underperformer candidate—only up 2% this year, and “there’s just not enough time” for their AI strategy to materialize. Here’s the prediction that should worry everyone: if unemployment ticks up 2-3 points for any reason—tariffs, business cycle, bank events—AI will take the blame. “All the AI executives talk about there will be an impact on unemployment,” Rory noted. “Politics doesn’t work by looking at BLS data by subgroup. All they’ll know is: unemployment’s ticked up, and those guys building AI are admitting the crime. They’re like, ‘We did it. We put you all out of a job.'” Jason agreed: “When there’s hard numbers at the top of the New York Times… it will become every dinner table conversation. Society will be terrified of AI.” The dark humor? “If the robots are going to take over society, I want to be sure that I own the robots.” “What was the biggest surprise of 2025? The three days when Windsurf was being bought by Cognition and I interviewed Varun the day before—are they being bought? Are they not? OpenAI was buying them and then they’re not—that was a bizarre moment.” “Nvidia investing $100 billion into OpenAI and the start of the circular deals… all of us giving up on caring about things like circular deals. We’ve all stopped caring. If it marks up my fund, great. It’s just the way it is now.” “Which companies go public in 2026? SpaceX, Canva, Databricks, Anthropic—four IPOs backloaded next year. OpenAI probably should have gone first, but it’s burning too much.” “The product of the year is Claude 3.5 or 3.7. Without this, we have no vibe coding. Without this, we have no Lovable, no Replit, no Cursor that really works. Many of these products existed for years. They did not work until Claude.” “What agents can do—we just started. Outside of parts of coding, we just started. We haven’t missed the boat as investors. We haven’t missed the boat.” “If the robots are going to take over society, I want to be sure that I own the robots.” “The entire convention on why people buy companies, how employees get treated, how much a human can be paid to do a job got thrown out of the window in the space of 6 months. Blew me away.” “Exits are the coin of the realm. The only fair way to measure things is: did you end up owning a lot and having big ownership in big exits?” “If the AI kind of lift starts to recede, they’ll all come down because they’re way over their long-term valuation. Pennies in front of steam wheels. Someone’s going to look up and say, ‘Oh my god, 70x… I should panic.'” This post is part of the ongoing 20VC x SaaStr collaboration.
