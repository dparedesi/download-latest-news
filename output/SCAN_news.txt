(Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Server maker Super Micro Computer stock (NASDAQ: SMCI) extended its recent rally, gaining close to 30% over the last five trading days. The stock now trades at $35 per share, up about 2x from recent lows seen around mid-November, when investors were concerned about the company’s potential delisting from the Nasdaq exchange. Last week, the company said that it had hired BDO as its public auditor, replacing Ernst & Young, who resigned in October after it raised concerns regarding the accuracy of the company’s financial statements. With the new public auditor on board, Super Micro is expected to gain additional time to avoid delisting from Nasdaq as it works to file its overdue 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 2024 and its September quarter report. Separately, see how Disney may be undervalued in Disney Stock To 2x? Looking over a longer period, SMCI stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 39% in 2021, 87% in 2022, and 246% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Now even considering the strong historical performance and the recent rally, SMCI stock is still down by a massive 70% from its all-time highs earlier this year. The stock also trades at just about 9x projected 2025 earnings. However, jumping into SMCI stock might not be a wise move just yet, in our view. Here’s why. Significant risks remain for Super Micro. The company’s new auditor will have to rework its financial statements and this process will likely take time. Super Micro has only indicated in filings that it plans to submit its overdue financial reports, but has not provided a specific timeline. Separately, earlier this week, the company announced it had prepaid borrowings from Bank of America and Cathay Bank. Some of the debt had covenants that required the company to file its FY 2024 and most recent quarterly financial statements by December 31. On the upside, by fully prepaying these loans, SMCI has eliminated the need to meet this reporting deadline. On the downside, this could also signal that there could be further delays in filing its audited accounts. Now, Super Micro Computer has been a big winner in the generative AI space, as demand for its server systems surged as companies looked to deploy the latest GPUs using the company’s server solutions. Revenues more than doubled in FY’24, with consensus estimates pointing to an additional 80% increase for the current fiscal year. However, the AI growth story doesn’t compensate for the company’s corporate governance concerns and questions about its financial reporting. Want to profit from shifts in the AI market? Consider this trade Sell Nvidia, Buy AMD Stock The company’s recent troubles began in August after short-seller Hindenburg Research pointed to multiple red flags in the company’s accounting practices. Further, The Wall Street Journal reported in late September that the U.S. Justice Department may be probing the company, although the investigation was reportedly in its early stages at the time. The company’s history of delayed reports and concerns raised by various parties doesn’t exactly inspire trust. Even if the company’s valuation looks reasonable today, issues with internal controls and accounting practices may impact its long-term viability and ability to deliver shareholder value. It also remains to be seen if the new auditor will indeed sign off on the company’s accounts. Given these risks, it’s probably best to exercise caution with SMCI stock until there are signs that the company’s core accounting issues have been be resolved.

The Sensex and Nifty showed modest gains, with investors closely monitoring multiple economic signals and institutional movements. The Sensex opened marginally lower at 79,032.99 from its previous close of 79,043.74 but has moved up, trading at 79,402.52 as of 9.52 AM, gaining 358.78 points or 0.45 per cent. Similarly, the Nifty opened slightly higher at 23,927.15 compared to its previous close of 23,914.15 and is currently at 24,034.20, rising by 120.05 points or 0.50 per cent. The National Stock Exchange introduced F&O contracts for 45 new stocks across diverse sectors, including finance, technology, and renewable energy. Notable additions include Indian Bank, Union Bank, LIC, Cyient, KPIT Technologies, Adani Green Energy, DMart, and Zomato. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) displayed significant selling pressure, offloading equities worth ₹11,756 crore on November 28, contrasting with Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) who were net buyers, purchasing equities worth ₹8,718 crore. “A perplexing market action in recent days is the inexplicable volatility in FII activity,” said Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. “A few days of buying followed by yesterday’s massive selling is difficult to explain.” Sector-specific movements were prominent. Banking stocks showed potential positive traction due to improved deposit growth, with credit growth slowing to 11.15 per cent year-on-year, while deposit growth slightly exceeded at 11.21 per cent, according to RBI data. The insurance sector attracted attention as the government proposed raising Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) limits from 74 per cent to 100 per cent, potentially opening up new investment opportunities. Top gainers included pharmaceutical stocks, with Sun Pharma (1.77 per cent), Cipla (1.75 per cent), and Dr Reddy’s (1.68 per cent) leading the pack. Mahindra & Mahindra (1.36 per cent) and Adani Ports (1.23 per cent) also showed positive momentum. Conversely, power and utility stocks faced challenges, with Power Grid experiencing a 1.54 per cent decline. Shriram Finance (-0.37 per cent), Coal India (-0.36 per cent), ITC (-0.27 per cent), and Tech Mahindra (-0.16 per cent) were among the top losers. “The market is expected to open on a flat note due to concerns over FII selling and a weak start in Asian markets,” noted Vikas Jain, Head of Research at Reliance Securities. “Asian indices dropped by up to 2 per cent following inflation data from Japan that exceeded expectations.” Technical analysts highlighted critical market levels. “Immediate support is placed at 23,800 and 23,680, which align with strong Fibonacci levels,” explained Mandar Bhojane from Choice Broking. “On the upside, 24,350 serves as immediate resistance.” Global factors continued to influence market sentiment, including ongoing concerns about US inflation, potential tariff threats, and uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve rate policies. Market participants are advised to remain cautious and monitor sector-specific movements, with particular attention to banking, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. The market’s trajectory remains uncertain, with investors and analysts closely watching upcoming economic indicators and global economic developments.

Title: Consumer Debt, Trump, and Precious Metals: Insights from Greg Weldon
URL: https://activistpost.com/2024/11/consumer-debt-trump-and-precious-metals-insights-from-greg-weldon.html
Time Published: 2024-11-28T17:15:37Z
Full Content:
November 28, 2024 By Money Metals Exchange Mike Maharrey, reporter and analyst at Money Metals Exchange, interviewed Greg Weldon, CEO of Weldon Financial and editor of newsletters such as Weldon’s Money Monitor and Metal Monitor. Weldon, often referred to as “The Gold Guru,” shared his macroeconomic insights on inflation, consumer debt, and precious metals, offering valuable guidance for investors navigating today’s economic complexities. ﻿ Greg Weldon highlighted how the current economic environment contrasts sharply with the 1980s. He explained that today’s high levels of debt fundamentally alter the U.S. economy’s ability to grow sustainably. He pointed out that the Federal Reserve’s decision to tolerate higher inflation, as outlined in Jerome Powell’s 2018 Jackson Hole speech, reflects the challenges of managing the debt burden. Weldon emphasized that the economic optimism following Trump’s election may falter as the reality of debt-driven constraints becomes clearer. Price & Buy Weldon raised alarms about consumer credit conditions, suggesting the U.S. may be approaching a financial tipping point. He pointed to declining savings and rising delinquencies as signs of severe strain on American households. These trends, Weldon noted, indicate that consumers are nearing their borrowing capacity, potentially triggering broader economic challenges. Weldon remains optimistic about the long-term potential of gold and silver. He sees central bank demand and limited speculative interest as key drivers for future growth in the metals market. Gold: Silver: Weldon emphasized that corrections in precious metals markets often provide buying opportunities for long-term investors. Price & Buy Weldon detailed several global risks shaping the economic landscape. Severe drought conditions in the U.S., geopolitical tensions, and inflationary pressures are creating a challenging environment for policymakers and investors alike. These dynamics, Weldon explained, will likely exacerbate inflation and push the Federal Reserve toward more aggressive interventions. Weldon offered a nuanced perspective on cryptocurrencies, recognizing their utility in combating currency devaluation while noting their speculative nature. He sees Bitcoin as distinct from gold, often behaving more like a risk asset tied to stock market movements. Weldon advised investors to balance crypto holdings with physical assets like gold and silver to mitigate risks. Price & Buy To navigate the current economic landscape, Weldon stressed the importance of blending macro and microeconomic analysis. He highlighted opportunities in mining shares and suggested using technical analysis to identify key entry points. Weldon encouraged investors to diversify across sectors and asset classes to hedge against economic uncertainties. Greg Weldon concluded by emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive investment strategy that combines macroeconomic insights, technical analysis, and sector-specific knowledge. For those interested in his research, Weldon offers detailed reports and managed account services. He can be reached at [email protected], and his podcast, Money Markets, and New Age Investing, is available on major platforms. During the Money Metals Podcast, Greg Weldon addressed a wide range of pressing economic topics, offering insights into inflation, consumer credit challenges, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies. Below are some of the key questions posed by host Mike Maharrey and Weldon’s in-depth answers, providing valuable perspectives for investors navigating today’s complex markets. The debt levels today are significantly higher, which fundamentally alters the economy’s ability to grow. Unlike the 1980s under Ronald Reagan, the U.S. no longer has the flexibility to manage inflation through high interest rates due to the massive debt burden. Greg Weldon projects gold prices to reach $4,900 within three years, driven by strong central bank demand and limited speculative interest. Corrections in gold prices offer buying opportunities. China’s increased demand for silver and its dual role as an industrial and monetary metal are critical. Silver’s technical breakout at $31.60 could signal a strong upward trend. Bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset tied to stock market movements than as “digital gold.” While useful for protecting against currency devaluation in some countries, cryptocurrencies face risks like infrastructure disruptions. Diversification with physical assets like gold is advised. Weldon highlighted Canadian miners like Torex and Wheaton as strong candidates due to favorable technical setups and currency dynamics. Uranium stocks are also gaining momentum. Severe drought conditions in the U.S., rising food prices, geopolitical tensions, and inflation pose significant challenges. These factors could force the Federal Reserve to act more aggressively, affecting market dynamics.

Title: The S&P 500 will climb 10% to 6,600 next year as earnings and the economy stay strong, Barclays says

The S&P 500 is primed to continue its bull rally in 2025, though at a slightly slower pace, Barclays strategists said in an outlook published this week. The strategists, led by the firm's head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna, predict the index will climb another 10% to 6,600 next year, propelled by strong tech earnings growth and a resilient economy. Their forecast marks a slowdown index's 26% gain so far this year, but they're bullish that the economic environment will continue to prop up the stock market. "Macro slowing to still-healthy levels should support more US equity upside next year, albeit a deceleration from '23-'24's breakneck pace. Positioning looks constructive, and policy uncertainty creates room for stock and sector selection," the analysts said in a Monday note. Much of their optimism lies in the robust US economy, which remains strong as consumers—the "central pillar" of the US economy and stock market—enjoy income gains and continue to open their wallets, they said. "The US economy remains resilient thanks to the still-intact 'virtuous cycle' between rising aggregate incomes and consumption," the analysts wrote. "Concerns around household financial distress appear overblown; overall delinquency rates remain low and borrowers, as a whole, are burdened with less consumer and revolving credit, as a percentage of income, than prior to the pandemic," they added. They also point to strong earnings growth potential for Big Tech stocks, which they say Wall Street is likely underestimating by 12%. They acknowledge, though, that there are some risks stemming from companies' massive AI investments and investors' eagerness to soon see a return. Data compiled by Bloomberg shows that tech giants like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have already invested hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure and are poised to spend another $200 billion next year. The analysts say inflation also poses a risk, especially if President-elect Donald Trump implements his proposals for sweeping tariffs and a crackdown on immigration, both of which would drive up prices through 2026, the analysts say. That could prompt fewer rate cuts from the Federal Reserve than markets are expecting, adding a hurdle for stocks, they added. "The risk to equities is not insignificant, especially since Treasury yields are up sharply since September and are approaching levels at which they've historically been a headwind for equities, which could be problematic in the event of fiscal expansion and fewer rate cuts," the analysts said. They added, though, that the policy roadmap remains uncertain and markets have typically weathered inflation and rates well in recent years. Barclays joins other big banks in forecasting continued gains in 2025, and the mood is decidedly bullish even as policy and geopolitical headwinds swirl. RBC analysts predicted the S&P 500 will hit 6,600 points on Monday, while strategists at Deutsche Bank set a target of 7,000. Last week, analysts at BMO said the index will hit 6,700 next year.

Title: Nvidia’s Stock Has 70% Potential Upside For 2025

Nvidia once again posted a $2 billion beat to consensus revenue estimates in Q3, reporting YoY growth of nearly 94% to over $35 billion in revenue. Data center revenue more than doubled in the quarter to over $30 billion with Hopper driving the second largest data center beat in company history, speaking volumes as to the level of demand for its GPUs given that Blackwell will not initially ship until next quarter. As recapped to our premium members after the earnings report, the I/O Fund is tracking supply chain signals indicating the next generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined. A smart phone is displaying the NVIDIA Corporation stock price on the NASDAQ market, with an NVIDIA ... [+] chip visible in the background, in this photo illustration taken in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The I/O Fund is already tracking a 30% minimum difference between GB200 NVL72 orders and what the Street has estimated for next year. When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. Beating on data center revenue is becoming common place for Nvidia, yet what’s interesting is the data center segment posted the largest surprise relative to estimates since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. A bar graph illustrating Nvidia’s impressive revenue performance, showcasing a $35.08 billion ... [+] revenue surpassing the consensus estimate of $33.13 billion. This marks the largest data center segment beat since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24, highlighting Nvidia’s consistent outperformance in the data center sector. Data center revenue of $30.77 billion increased 112.0% YoY and 17.1% QoQ, beating estimates by $1.95 billion. This marked the largest beat since the $2.46 billion beat in Q2 FY24, as well as the two $1.8 billion beats in Q3 FY24 and Q1 FY25. This is important as this beat was driven solely by Hopper – which is in its seventh quarter with the H100s and H200s. Blackwell’s is expected to ramp quickly in Q4 and into next year. Analysts estimate Blackwell’s volume in Q4 could be between 150,000 and 200,000, before tripling sequentially to 550,000 in Q1 FY26 (Jan-Apr quarter of 2025). The expectation for AI clusters is to go from tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands, to millions of GPUs, indicating a long runway for Blackwell and subsequent GPU generations. What’s shaping up for 2025 is the convergence of multiple strong tailwinds for Nvidia to capture via Blackwell: GPU clusters this generation beginning at the upper end of Hopper’s hundred-thousand clusters, Big Tech capex continuing to increase past one quarter trillion (which we covered two weeks ago), and more importantly, Blackwell’s pricing power versus Hopper. Q3 earnings aside, this bigger picture is that Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU sales next year will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 — combined. 2025 is shaping up to be potentially the most important year for Nvidia since I first highlighted Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis in my free stock newsletter in November 2018 and when the I/O Fund entered at $3.15 for returns of 3,280%. Including Q4’s estimate, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion to $130 billion in data center revenue in 2023 and 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone. Back in August, in the analysis Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings, I wrote: ‘According to reports from Wccftech: “Team Green is expected to ship 60,000 to 70,000 units of NVIDIA's GB200 AI servers, and given that one server is reported to cost around $2 million to $3 million per unit, this means that Team Green will bag in around a whopping $210 billion from just Blackwell servers along, that too in a year. The weight of that report cannot be overstated as it implies 26% upside to 2025’s estimates based on one SKU alone.” Despite Blackwell not yet shipping in full volume, there are multiple data points that support this ramp to $200+ billion in revenue. Perhaps the most important quote was one that could easily be overlooked — Nvidia’s management explained in Q3’s earnings that they have “completed a successful mask change for Blackwell…that improved production yields. Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.” Since both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem beginning in Q4, there’s more emphasis on supply constraints moving forward, as management was clear in saying that both products have “certain supply constraints” with Blackwell’s demand “expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.” Broadly speaking, supply constraints are nothing new as it’s been widely understood Blackwell is already sold out for next year. By executing this mask change to improve production yields, Nvidia can theoretically get more usable chips per wafer, alleviating some supply fears and allowing it to meet higher demand levels, leading to higher revenue generation. Management already hinted at this, saying “we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated.” CEO Jensen Huang also explained that GPU clusters with Blackwell will be starting where Hopper left off: “You see now that at the tail-end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells.” Even though Nvidia guided Q4 nearly in-line with analysts' expectations at $37.5 billion, there is still significant room for Blackwell to grow through 2025. Current forecasts point to revenue surpassing the $50 billion-mark one year from now, with revenue growth in excess of 40% for the next five quarters. A table displaying the wide range of analyst revenue estimates for Nvidia in FY26, highlighting a ... [+] $40 billion range for Q3 and a $70 billion range for Q4. The potential for Nvidia to achieve over $50 billion in quarterly data center revenue is also noted. Interestingly, there is still a massive disconnect in analyst estimates as FY26 progresses – estimates for Q3 have a nearly $40 billion range from the low to high estimates. When looking at Q4 of next year, there is a ridiculous $70 billion range, with some analysts predicting $31 billion at the low end while others have estimates as high as $101 billion. Should Nvidia maintain its quarterly cadence of beating by $2 billion from the midpoint of these estimates, and assuming data center mix remains at ~90%, Nvidia could easily exit FY26 with data center revenue at >$50 billion/quarter, or $200+ billion annualized compared to data center revenue of $140 billion this year. Big Tech’s capex supports this revenue growth story, as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet have all accelerated capex significantly in the past couple of quarters and reaffirmed the need to continue investing aggressively in AI infrastructure moving through 2025. Additionally, Big Tech is already spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s Blackwell lineup: This is but a fraction of 2025’s estimated capex– 2024’s capex could come in at ~$240 billion with an estimated $70 billion spent in Q4, with the four currently tracking for over $270 billion in capex predominantly for AI infrastructure in 2025. Nvidia has been capturing a lion’s share of AI spending from Big Tech, at ~80% to 85%, and assuming little change in its AI GPU market share with competition primarily arising from AMD and no one else, Big Tech’s spending implies a clear path towards $200 billion in GPU revenue in 2025. The importance of Big Tech’s capex was also echoed with the CEO stating we will see $1 trillion in data infrastructure rebuild before he expects to see digestion from the hyperscalers. Per Huang: “I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize a trillion dollars with the data centers.” That would imply another 3X from here for the remaining three-quarter trillion – not in stock price, but in capex. Presumably, it would mean a higher trajectory for the stock price in terms of valuing that revenue. Hopper drove another beat, which Nvidia is becoming widely known for. It’s rare for analysts to openly expect large beats going into a print, yet UBS had correctly tagged the beat this quarter at $2 billion. However, due to declining from peak revenue growth of 265% earlier this year, Hopper-driven growth of 94% is not what will drive the stock up for the next leg higher. Nvidia investors, such as myself, will need Blackwell’s pricing power and Blackwell’s clear demand signals to re-invigorate the stock. Nvidia reported 93.6% YoY growth, more than 10 points higher than consensus estimates for ~83% YoY growth. Nvidia is now lapping its peak growth quarters, Q4 FY24 and Q1 FY25, where revenue peaked at 265% growth due to Hopper ramping tremendously fast. Growth technically is decelerating nearly 30 points in Q3 and growth will further decelerate nearly 24 points next quarter, but to be reporting above 93% YoY and almost 70% YoY versus 200-260%+ growth comps is still a very strong report to say the least. A graph illustrating Nvidia’s year-over-year growth rates, showing a deceleration from peak growth ... [+] of 265% to current growth of 94%. The graph highlights Nvidia’s consistent beats against analyst estimates, driven by Hopper, and the anticipated future impact of Blackwell. For Q4, management guided for revenue of $37.5 billion, +/- 2%, just slightly ahead of consensus estimates for $37.02 billion at the midpoint. Analysts are now expecting $38.01 billion in revenue for Q4, just a week after the report, at the upper end of the guided range. Both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem moving forward as Blackwell ramps significantly through fiscal 2026. Analysts were nitpicking margins, yet this concern is overblown. Q3’s margins were relatively in line with guidance despite the $2 billion top-line beat, and for Q4, management forecast margins to contract nearly 2 points sequentially. However, CFO Colette Kress was clear that following Blackwell, gross margin will eventually return to its current percentage: “As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low-70s. When fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s.” Investors should never underestimate Wall Street’s ability to miss the bigger picture. Analysts on the call cross-examined this 200 bp sequential decline despite Nvidia having an operating margin of over 60% compared to most of the Mag 7 having operating margins at half that. It’s also completely normal for semiconductors to feel margin pressures in the initial stages of ramping a new product, especially at this scale and pace. A chart showing Nvidia’s operating margins, highlighting the anticipated 2-point sequential decline ... [+] in Q4 and the projected return to mid-70s gross margins with the ramp-up of Blackwell. The chart emphasizes Nvidia’s strong current margins compared to industry peers. The bigger picture for Nvidia moving forward is that Blackwell holds the potential to dwarf Hopper’s revenue generation in fewer quarters. Breaking it down further on CNBC, I stated Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power I had been quite vocal prior to earnings that Q3’s report was nothing but a blip in the longer-term picture, with 2025 being much more important than this quarterly report. The I/O Fund is already tracking a 30% minimum difference between GB200 NVL72 orders and what the Street has estimated for next year. When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The I/O Fund has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pull back, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from the semiconductor industry and meaningfully breakout.

And analysts warn that President-elect Donald Trump is likely to inherit this headache too. The metal is not gold, silver, or uranium. It’s not the lithium used for EV batteries. It’s not the copper that is essential for electrification. It’s not even the rare earth elements that are crucial for everything from smartphones to wind turbines. This metal has a global annual production of less than 100,000 tons – a small fraction of the lead, copper, and iron produced every year. But it is a vital component in everything from armor-piercing bullets, nuclear weapons, explosive missiles to fire retardants in electronics and military uniforms. Most importantly, there are no viable alternatives at the moment. But one forward-looking company, Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF), has recently purchased historically-proven deposits that could swiftly address America's most pressing resource vulnerability in recent times. The metal we’re talking about is antimony, and its scarcity has Western governments rattled.Military Metals CEO Scott Eldridge sees a major antimony supply crunch coming. And antimony prices this year, along with new Chinese restrictions add extra support to that prediction with prices tripling since earlier this year from $12,000 per ton to $38,000. That’s why the company acquired past-producing antimony mines on two continents at breakneck speed. But first, let’s zoom in on antimony demand, and prices, and why they are going through the roof right now. The Global Antimony Supply Squeeze The current crisis stems from China’s dominance in both global antimony production and refining. China, Russia, and Tajikistan control 85% of the world’s antimony supply. Antimony is not easy to extract and it’s often a by-product in the extraction of other metals like gold, silver, or copper. And China, which also currently controls 65% of global antimony refining capacity, has just imposed troubling new restrictions on its export. Because China controls most of the world’s antimony, when they cut supply Western military supply chains are directly impacted. According to a recent article published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., the U.S. only has 20 days’ worth of antimony inventory. Germany has just 2 days’ worth of munitions supply. And geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East, Afghanistan, and other places continue to aggravate the demand for antimony. So, antimony demand from defense is at record highs right now, and it’s only going to increase exponentially in the years to come. Washington's $1.8 Billion Antimony Push All these factors have together pushed antimony prices past $38,000 per ton – a 300% price increase in just the last 24 months. And this might just be the start! Understandably, political support for securing critical mineral supply chains across the globe is intensifying. Major economies like the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Japan, Australia, the European Union, and South Korea have all classified antimony as a “critical mineral.” And the U.S. government is keen on backing domestic antimony projects to reduce dependence on Chinese imports. As a part of that initiative, Perpetua Resources Corp., a mining company focused on developing gold-antimony deposits in the Stibnite district of Idaho, is securing a $1.8B loan from U.S. Export-Import Bank, along with an additional $60M from the Department of Defense. As a result, Perpetua’s stock has shot up over 400% since March this year. But this rapid surge is just one example of the antimony sector's explosive potential. Now, Military Metals Corp (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF), an under-the-radar company with premium assets in friendly NATO territory is positioning itself for even bigger success...The company recently announced that it has purchased one of Europe’s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia. The flagship Trojarova property here features a historical Soviet-era resource of 61,998.4 tonnes of antimony which has a in-situ value of over $2 billion of antimony in the ground at today’s spot prices. Located just 30 minutes from Bratislava with excellent infrastructure, the company thinks they can fast-track this project with a resource estimate within 6 months. Then there’s the Tienesgrund property, also in Slovakia, which covers 13.38 km² and encompasses 40-50 historical mining tunnels dating back to 1840. Historical Soviet-era work estimated 162t with an average grade of 7.7% antimony here, and the company expects to establish a resource within 12 months. Their West Gore property in Nova Scotia, which was one of Canada's largest antimony producers during World War I still holds significant unmined material. Historical ore extracts showed as high as 46% antimony content. Lastly, their Bear Creek property in Slovakia is a historical high-grade tin resource. The company got this project as a part of their Slovakia deal, but they’re thinking of divesting this to get money for their antimony projects. Key Factors Driving Military Metals Corp.’s Story At this critical point in the antimony market, Military Metals Corp. stands out for five key reasons... To sum up, as global demand for antimony continues to rise and geopolitical tensions persist, securing stable supplies outside of China’s control remains a key challenge for Western nations. 8 bonus stocks to keep an eye on: Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

The company recently announced that it has purchased one of Europe’s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia.

Key Factors Driving Military Metals Corp.’s Story At this critical point in the antimony market, Military Metals Corp. stands out for five key reasons... Significant Growth Potential: Even though the Military Metals Corp. stock has seen a substantial run in recent times, with the current market cap of just $23M vs real asset potential, there’s a lot more upside yet to be unlocked. Rising Market Awareness: Growing media coverage in the Financial Times, Forbes, etc., gives early investors a massive advantage in capitalizing on the coming antimony surge. Pure Antimony Play: Unlike gold or oil, there are no ETFs or futures contracts to trade antimony. Equity investments into junior mining companies, like Military Metals Corp., is the only real way to get exposure to antimony. Premium Asset Portfolio: The company has assets located at three prime locations in Slovakia and one location in Canada. Plus, the project qualifies under the European Critical Raw Materials Act, potentially helping to accelerate its development. To sum up, as global demand for antimony continues to rise and geopolitical tensions persist, securing stable supplies outside of China’s control remains a key challenge for Western nations. 8 bonus stocks to keep an eye on: Freeport-McMoRan Inc.
