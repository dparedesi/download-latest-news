We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Small-Cap Biotech Stocks with Massive Potential According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) stands against the other small-cap biotech stocks. The biotechnology sector is expanding quickly due to rising demand for novel therapies, technological advances, and government assistance. Advances in fields like gene editing, sequencing, personalized medicine, and artificial intelligence are making new techniques possible, while the aging population and growing healthcare demands are driving a robust market for new treatments. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, venture capital firms made approximately $52 billion in global investments in therapeutic-focused biotech companies between 2019 and 2021. Two-thirds of this sum was given to platform-tech start-up companies. Despite its growth, many biotech companies have faced challenges in turbulent markets, taking drastic measures such as cutting programs and implementing significant layoffs to conserve cash. While recent rate cuts could encourage the revival of scientific projects, analysts like Jared Holz note the difficulty of gauging their impact. Holz also highlighted a shift in market dynamics, observing that biotech's performance increasingly correlates with small-cap equities. If small-cap stocks trade well, biotech is likely to follow, though stagnation could occur if momentum fades. Notably, the idea of interest rates predicting biotech success is relatively new, emerging only after the pandemic, which reshaped the industry by driving substantial investment into therapeutic-focused companies. With innovative treatments, biotech businesses are revolutionizing healthcare by tackling important unmet medical needs. Establishing the National Bioeconomy Board as a component of Biden's Investing in America agenda is a significant breakthrough. It seeks to maximize biotechnology's economic potential in the United States. Furthermore, policy suggestions to expedite the approval process for biotechnology goods are being developed by the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology. More academics will be able to use biotechnology for agricultural purposes if entry obstacles are reduced, which will benefit American farmers and increase food security. It is anticipated that these initiatives will open up new markets. This year (2024) started strongly for the biotechnology sector due to a rise in mergers and acquisitions as well as anticipations of falling interest rates. Therefore, estimates suggest that the worldwide biotechnology market might increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 14% from 2024 to 2033, reaching an astonishing $5.7 trillion. The market for agricultural biotechnology is also expected to develop at a 7.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and reach $232 billion by 2032. But even with the market's potential, investing in biotech companies still carries a number of serious dangers. Bankruptcy may result from failing to satisfy clinical trial endpoints or obtain adequate finance before a product launch. In the biotech industry, where drug development usually takes more than ten years and has an estimated failure rate of about 90%, the danger of failure is very substantial. Hence, biotech stocks are often considered “high-risk, high-reward” investments due to their upside potential coupled with significant risks In our methodology, we identified the top small-cap biotech stocks with significant growth potential, ranked according to their total hedge fund holdings as of Q2 2024. Our selection process began by filtering companies with a small market capitalization. Next, we reviewed analyst recommendations, focusing on stocks with strong bullish sentiment and high institutional ownership. Finally, we ranked these companies based on the number of hedge funds holding their shares as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:KURA) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing precision medicines for the treatment of cancer. At its core, the company designs and develops targeted therapies that aim to improve outcomes for patients with various types of solid tumors and blood cancers. A major catalyst for Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) is the development of ziftomenib, its lead drug candidate. Ziftomenib, an oral medication targeting the menin-MLL1 protein-protein interaction, has received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for patients with relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This designation could accelerate the drug's path to market, potentially leading to increased revenue and market share. Another catalyst is the company's expanding clinical trial program. The corporation has completed enrollment in a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of ziftomenib (KOMET-001) and is conducting multiple clinical trials to evaluate ziftomenib in combination with current standard-of-care regimens. Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) reported significant financial developments in Q3 2024, with research and development expenses increasing to $41.7 million from $29.3 million in Q3 2023 which was driven by higher clinical trial costs for key programs such as ziftomenib and KO-2806. General and administrative expenses also rose to $18.2 million from $13.1 million, contributing to a net loss of $54.4 million, up from $38.6 million in the prior year. The company maintains a strong cash position of $455.3 million, ensuring operational funding into 2027. As of the third quarter of 2024, 36 hedge funds had investments in the company, with Suvretta Capital Management being the largest shareholder, holding stakes valued at $149.5 million, according to the Insider Monkey database. Analysts on Wall Street have a consensus Strong Buy rating for the stock. Over the past three months, analysts have set a 12-month price target of $30.89, with estimates ranging from a low of $22.00 to a high of $37.00. This represents a potential upside of 52.47% from the current price of $20.26. Overall KURA ranks 2nd on our list of the best small-cap biotech stocks with massive potential according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of KURA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: 2025: Intel Stock's Comeback Year?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/04/2025-intel-stocks-comeback-year/
Time Published: 2024-12-04T12:00:00Z

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 14: The Intel logo is seen outside a pop-up store on Oxford Street ... [+] on November 14, 2024 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Next year promises to be an important one for Intel stock. Intel is likely to see its bread-and-butter CPU sales pick up with a more compelling portfolio of products and recovery in demand. Meanwhile, the company’s foundry business also faces a moment of truth of sorts, as it looks to commercialize its cutting-edge 18A process. And with Donald Trump back in the White House next year, Intel’s sizable base of U.S. manufacturing could put the company in a unique position of strength, given the pro-American policies of the new administration. Below, we take a look at what to expect from Intel in 2025. See our Intel upside analysis on How Intel Stock Can Surge 3x To $60. On the other hand, see our counter scenario which explores how Intel Stock Could Dive To $10. The decrease in INTC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, and 95% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So what are some of the factors that could help Intel stock rebound? Intel has lost considerable ground in the CPU market in recent years. While rival AMD has been gaining share, the broader pivot to AI accelerators is also hurting demand for the company’s GPUs. However, Intel’s latest lineup looks more promising. The Lunar Lake chip designed for laptops and ultra-compact devices as well as the Arrow Lake chip for desktops, are manufactured by TSMC using its advanced 3nm process. This could give the company a better shot at competing with AMD in the near term. The broader recovery of the PC market, coupled with stronger products, is likely to help Intel boost Intel revenues in 2024. Moreover, after close to two years of massive investments in AI chip data, companies could begin to boost CPU spending led by general-purpose workloads and server refresh cycles. Intel’s latest server chips, such as the Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids are also expected to compete more favorably with AMD, using the new 3 nanometers “Intel 3” process node. Intel’s revenue guidance for Q4 was also better than expected, with the company projecting sales of between $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion, indicating that we could begin to see some of these trends play out. Separately, see What’s Happening With Bitcoin Miner MARA Stock? Intel is betting big on its 18A process, which it considers its most advanced yet, to turn around its foundry business. The process produces chips with technologies including RibbonFET gate-all-around transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, which are expected to boost performance and power efficiency. Intel has secured big contracts with this technology, including with the U.S. Department of Defense for the RAMP-C program, which seeks to bring leading-edge semiconductor technology domestically. Other high-profile customers include Amazon and Microsoft, which intend to design custom chips, including AI accelerators. Intel announced in early August that it had reached critical milestones with chips made using the 18A process, noting that the chip had powered on, booted operating systems, and was operational within Intel. The company expects external customers to tape out (move from design to foundry for manufacturing) their first 18A designs in 2025, with enterprise-scale production to begin thereafter. If Intel executes this transition effectively, it could shift the narrative around the stock, justifying the significant investments made in its foundry business over the past few years. A Trump Boost For Intel’s FoundryPresident-elect Donald Trump’s emphasis on boosting U.S. manufacturing could work in Intel’s favor, given its sizable domestic fabrication footprint. There’s a possibility that Intel could see considerable regulatory support aimed at boosting domestic chip production. For example, the new administration could look at imposing tariffs that make it more expensive for foreign fabrication companies to produce and export chips to the U.S. A stronger emphasis on domestic production, either through tariffs or via other policies, could drive more business to Intel. Intel’s foundry division - which produces chips for third-party customers - could also see stronger demand, particularly as companies look to rely on U.S. suppliers to avoid potential duties. Semiconductors are critical for national security - an area that Trump has consistently emphasized - and Intel’s domestic manufacturing might be viewed as contributing to protecting U.S. technological independence. Intel could also see a higher number of contracts awarded to it from the government, being the only American semiconductor player that designs and fabricates leading-edge logic chips in the U.S. This means that the company’s domestic chip supply chain could help it win more contracts under Trump, who boosted military spending over his last term. Although Nvidia remains the undisputed leader in the AI market at the moment, with AMD coming in a distant second, Intel is expanding its presence in the AI processor space with its Gaudi 2 and upcoming Gaudi 3 AI accelerators. We believe that this is an opportunity for the likes of Intel to gain some ground. The AI market at large could gradually shift from the process of model training to inferencing, which is the process of generating outputs and answers from trained models. The process of inferencing is less computationally intensive, and it’s possible that these tasks can be handled adequately well by AI processors from the likes of Intel and AMD. Costs are also becoming a concern for end customers of AI chips. The economics of the AI business remain weak, with heavy investments in GPU chips yielding minimal revenues and there’s a real possibility that from 2025, companies could be a lot more circumspect with their AI spending. Although Gaudi sales have been lackluster, Intel’s newest Gaudi 3 accelerator costs about half as much as Nvidia’s chips, and this could make for a more favorable price-to-performance tradeoff. The shift toward inferencing is a key reason to consider Selling Nvidia, Buying AMD Stock. Intel stock trades at about $24 per share currently or 25x consensus 2025 earnings, which is reasonable in our view given the above factors. Intel is also expected to return to growth next year with consensus pointing to about 6% revenue expansion. We value Intel stock at about $27 per share, slightly ahead of the current market price.

Enhanced Liquidity through Distributed Liquidity Pools: Low or poor liquidity is no doubt one of the pressing challenges within the sector. To address this, DTX will combine funds from various sources, allowing the platform to offer competitive and consistent prices to traders. Non-Custodial Storage for Improved Security: Centralization and the risk associated with centralized custody solutions have become critical issues in the trading scene. Its non-custodial model will give users full control of their private keys and assets—their private keys, their assets. Tokenization for Asset Classes Expansion: Its tokenized assets will represent real-world financial instruments, commodities and tangible assets. This model will represent traditional assets on the blockchain, allowing users to invest in the global trading market. Wallet-Based Trading and Financial Inclusion: The exchange protocol will embrace financial inclusion by allowing direct trading from crypto wallets without requiring traditional bank accounts. With users able to participate in global financial markets, it is set for adoption and is arguably the best crypto to invest in. New DeFi Coin With 100x Upside Potential As one of the fastest-growing new ICOs, its massive upside potential has captured whale and retail attention. Over $9 million has been raised in funding amid soaring demand, positioning it as this quarter’s best presale. In the sixth round of the ICO, a token costs only $0.12, which is not only cheaper than most top altcoins but also more promising. With its debut around the corner, a 100x gain is projected—perhaps the best new crypto to invest in.
