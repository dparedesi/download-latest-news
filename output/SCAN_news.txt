Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of Strategy (MSTR).Strike (STRK), the preferred stock issued by bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) has been listed for just over a month and is currently 3% higher than at its Feb. 5 introduction. Strategy's common stock, on the other hand, is 20% lower over the same period. Preferred stock like STRK can be thought of as a hybrid of equity and debt. Holders have a greater right to dividend payments than common stock owners if the company makes them and also to the company's assets in the event of a liquidation. STRK is a perpetual issue, which lacks a maturity date (like equity) and pays a fixed dividend (like debt). Those features mean preferred stock tends to be less volatile than the common stock. That certainly seems to be the case for STRK. According to Strategy's dashboard, STRK has a 26% correlation with MSTR and a slightly negative -7% correlation with bitcoin (BTC). It's also less volatile, at 49%, compared with bitcoin’s roughly 60% and MSTR’s volatility exceeding 100%. Last week, Strategy announced a $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering for STRK. That is, it's prepared to sell up to that amount of the stock at the current market price over a period of time. If all the STRK is sold, the company would face a total annual dividend bill of about $1.68 billion. Generating that amount of cash means the company would either to sell common stock through an ATM offering — unlikely given the depressed share price as of late —or use cash generated from operations or proceeds from any convertible debt raised. STRK offers an 8% annual dividend yield based on its $100 liquidation preference and at the currently price of $87.45, offers an effective yield of around 9%. As with debt, the higher the STRK price, the lower the yield, and vice versa. STRK also includes a feature allowing each share to be converted into 0.1 share of common stock, equivalent to a 10-to-1 ratio, when the MSTR price reaches or exceeds $1,000. Strategy stock closed at $262.55 on Wednesday, for the option to become viable it would have to appreciate significantly, offering potential upside beyond STRK’s fixed dividend. As an income-generating product with lower volatility, STRK presents a more stable option with potential upside. However, the massive ATM offering could impact this potential upside, similar to how ATM share sales have affected the common stock’s performance.

Title: BofA Goes Positive On Intel: Under Lip-Bu Tan, CDNS Stock Appreciated By 32x Vs. 16x Gains For SOX

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Intel has experienced a massive turnaround in sentiment over the past couple of weeks, first spurred by the Trump administration's purported exhortations to TSMC to get involved in Intel's struggling foundry division either via a technology transfer or by establishing an operational joint venture. More recently, the stock has received another boost, courtesy of the appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as the CEO of Intel. Now, Bank of America's Vivek Arya is out with his take on this development, adopting an overwhelmingly positive attitude towards Lip-Bu Tan's appointment at the helm of Intel. To wit, Arya has now hiked his target for Intel shares from $19 to $25. For context, the stock is currently trading at the $23 price handle in early pre-market trading. Arya says that the analysts at BofA "really like the new CEO appointment," which becomes effective next week, citing: Of course, Arya does take pains to note the challenges that lie in front of Lip-Bu Tan: "The upside potential however is balanced against risks from a lack of AI roadmap and increasing competition from ARM-based PC and server CPU rivals, amidst a tough macro environment." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the ongoing flux at Intel has attracted a fair share of commentary from Wall Street analysts in recent days. For instance, when rumors emerged that Intel might spin off its fabs, BofA's Vivek Arya brilliantly laid down the scenario's cons, noting that splitting up Intel "could be time- consuming and complicated given: 1) Extensive approval requirements from global (China) regulators due to INTC’s dominant ~70% share of PC/server CPU, 2) Mismatch between INTC and TSMC’s manufacturing processes, 3) TSMC’s ongoing fab expansion plans in Arizona with ability to serve AI customers, 4) AVGO’s existing low-levered but high debt ($58bn net debt) balance sheet, and 5) Constraints of INTC’s CHIPS Act funding (design needs to own 50%+ of manufacturing) and ROI requirements from co- investment partners Apollo and Brookfield." Similarly, Lynx Equity issued an equally pertinent when it asked "why would TSM wish to take a stake in Intel’s IFS" given the fact that global fab capacity "at leading and lagging nodes" is no longer in short supply, that Intel's fab business still offers "questionable performance at advanced nodes" and will not break-even until late 2027, and the "IFS’s tortured relationship with the US government via the CHIPS Act?"

Title: Tesla Stock Plummets 50% Since December, Here’s How Investors Can Manage The Volatility

ByShahar Ziv ByShahar Ziv , Contributor. Tesla Stock Plummets 50% Since December Amid Musk’s Political Ties Tesla stock has plunged by over 50% since December, a dramatic collapse that has stunned shareholders and analysts alike. In mid-December 2024, Tesla traded near an all-time high of around $480 per share; by early March 2025, it had sunk to roughly $220. This wipeout erased over $800 billion in market value, the steepest drop Tesla has seen in years. Even Elon Musk’s Tesla shares have not been spared — Musk’s net worth has tumbled by more than $100 billion during the crash. Given that the rout has drawn widespread attention, let’s dig into the impact of Tesla stock on investors and actionable lessons for managing your portfolio in the face of such volatility. Tesla’s stock fell sharply after December’s peak, entering a seven-week losing streak through early 2025. On March 10, TSLA plunged 15% in a single day – its worst one-day drop since 2020 – after an investment bank slashed its delivery forecasts and broader market fears spooked investors, according to Forbes. By then, Tesla shares were down over 55% from their mid-December high. To put the collapse in perspective, more than $800 billion in market capitalization has been wiped out – a sum roughly equal to the entire GDP of Poland, as Ian King of Sky News noted. This Tesla stock price drop has made it the worst-performing major tech stock of the period and raised pressing questions: What does this mean for investors? For shareholders, the crash of Tesla stock has been punishing. Investors who are heavily concentrated in TSLA have seen their portfolios take a significant hit. For example, a portfolio with 50% in Tesla stock would have lost roughly 25% of its total value in just a few months due to the plunge. Even index funds and ETFs felt the jolt since Tesla is a significant component of major indices — though diversified funds softened the blow compared to holding Tesla alone. The most extreme case is Elon Musk himself: as the largest Tesla shareholder, Musk’s stake plummeted in value, shrinking his fortune by an estimated $130-plus billion year-to-date, noted Forbes. While few investors are in Musk’s shoes, many retail traders and institutional funds with outsized Tesla positions have experienced significant losses on paper. Beyond the dollar figures, the psychological impact on investors is real. Tesla has long been a high-volatility stock, but a 50% implosion over a short period tests even the most steadfast believers. Those who bought in at the peak or added heavily during the post-election rally are now deeply underwater. Some loyal Tesla bulls are treating the drop as a temporary setback (or even a buying opportunity), while more cautious investors are rethinking their exposure. In online forums, you can find sobering anecdotes — for instance, one user lamented on Reddit that his 58-year-old father put his entire 401(k) into Tesla stock, a concentration that proved devastating in this crash. Critically, Tesla’s plunge has been a case study of the importance of diversification and risk management. Investors with balanced portfolios (holding a mix of stocks across industries, plus bonds or other assets) likely weathered the Tesla storm far better than those who bet the farm on TSLA. A diversified approach means even a 50% crash in one stock might only trim a few percentage points off your overall holdings instead of wiping out your retirement plan. As JPMorgan’s advisors note, a common guideline is to keep any single stock to no more than 10-20% of your portfolio to avoid this kind of concentrated risk. The Tesla debacle has driven home this lesson for many: overexposure to one high-flyer can wreak havoc on your finances when the winds change. On the other hand, some investors are using this moment to strategize rather than panic. Market experts point out that volatility is the price of admission with growth stocks like Tesla. If you still believe in Tesla’s long-term prospects (and can tolerate the rollercoaster), you might very well decide to hold your position or add to it at these lower levels. Indeed, some analysts remain bullish — for example, ARK Invest famously projects massive long-term upside for Tesla, and Wedbush’s Dan Ives argues that autonomous tech is the holy grail that will eventually vindicate Tesla’s valuation. Tesla’s stock performance has rebounded from steep drops before. However, such optimism is no comfort to investors with shorter time horizons or lower risk tolerance, who have seen hard-earned capital evaporate. Tesla’s crash reminds them that investor sentiment can flip quickly, especially when a stock’s narrative shifts. In summary, the impact on investors ranges from paper losses and shaken confidence to valuable lessons learned. This leads to the next point: how investors should respond, and what can we learn from this episode to protect our portfolios better? If you’re an investor caught in the Tesla stock downdraft, taking a clear-eyed, strategic approach is crucial. Here are some actionable personal finance lessons and steps drawn from expert commentary: Reassess And Don’t Panic Sell — First, resist the urge to panic sell purely out of fear. Step back and reassess Tesla’s prospects and your investment thesis. Ask yourself: Has something fundamentally changed in the company’s long-term outlook, or is this downturn largely sentiment-driven and temporary? Holding through volatility may still make sense for long-term believers in Tesla’s technology and vision. “It will be fine long-term,” Musk has insisted, suggesting patience if you have high conviction. However, be honest about whether your original reasons for investing still hold. If you’ve lost faith in the direction Tesla is heading, trimming your position on any rebounds could be prudent. The key is to make a calm, informed decision rather than an emotional reaction at the worst possible moment. Diversify Your Portfolio — The Tesla crash underscores the classic lesson: don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio is the best defense against a single stock’s implosion. Financial planners often recommend limiting any stock to 5-10% (at most 20%) of your portfolio. This ensures that no single position can sink your net worth. If you found yourself overexposed to TSLA, use this as a wake-up call to spread your investments. Consider adding broad index funds, ETFs, or stocks from different sectors (technology, finance, healthcare, etc.) so that your future returns don’t hinge on one company’s fate. Diversification can smooth the ride and mitigate the impact on investors when a high-flyer like Tesla hits turbulence. Consider Rebalancing — After a considerable swing, your asset allocation may be out of whack. It’s wise to rebalance your portfolio periodically, especially after extreme moves in any holding. For instance, when Tesla stock was soaring last year, it might have grown to an outsized percentage of your portfolio – a signal to pare back some shares and lock in profits. Conversely, if Tesla now occupies far less of your portfolio (and you still believe in it) after the crash, you could rebalance by adding modestly to maintain your target allocation. Rebalancing enforces a discipline of sell high, buy low. It helps you manage risk by not inadvertently letting one stock (or asset class) dominate your holdings. Many investors do this on a set schedule or when a position exceeds a certain threshold. The Tesla episode shows why sticking to a rebalancing plan is essential — it would have naturally led you to reduce exposure near the top and be more assertive when the drop hit. Focus On Fundamentals, Not Hype — Tesla’s wild ride reminds you to anchor your investments in fundamentals. At its peak, Tesla’s valuation implied substantial future growth and flawless execution expectations. It’s okay to be optimistic as an investor, but temper that by analyzing the company’s performance: Are sales and profits growing to support the stock price? Are new products and innovations materializing as promised? When a stock’s price starts far outrunning its fundamentals, as Tesla’s did, understand that it may not be sustainable. Heed analysts’ warnings about valuation risk. For example, JPMorgan’s Ryan Brinkman cautioned that Tesla’s stock was “divorced from the fundamentals” – if you hear such red flags repeatedly, it might be time to re-evaluate your position. The Tesla stock performance crash was primarily a comeuppance for overly optimistic assumptions. In the future, ensure you invest based on realistic expectations and measurable results, not just hype or a charismatic CEO’s promises. Have An Exit Strategy (And Entry Strategy) — Extreme volatility like this highlights the value of having a plan for when to sell and when to buy. If you’re a Tesla shareholder, decide under what conditions you would reduce your stake. It could be a predetermined price (to capture gains or limit losses), a change in the company’s fundamentals, or even a loss of confidence in leadership. Having criteria in advance can prevent hasty, emotional decisions. On the flip side, if you’re a believer eyeing this Tesla stock price drop as a buying opportunity, set some rules as well. Ensure any new investment fits your risk tolerance — maybe your dollar-cost average to mitigate timing risk, or only commit capital you’re prepared to leave invested long-term. And remember Morningstar’s advice: wait for a margin of safety. Tesla’s stock is now closer to its fair value estimate ($250) but still not a screaming bargain; “we recommend investors wait for a larger margin of safety before considering an entry point,” Morningstar’s analyst team wrote. In other words, don’t catch a falling knife — be patient and demand a price that genuinely compensates for the risks. Learn From The Tesla Turbulence — Treat this as a learning experience for your overall financial journey. Market volatility and stock crashes happen – even to popular, innovative companies like Tesla. Use this time to revisit your financial plan. Does your current portfolio align with your risk tolerance? (If Tesla’s drop kept you up at night, you might take on too much risk.) Are you properly diversified? Do you have an emergency fund and other bases covered so you’re not forced to sell stocks at a bad time? These personal finance fundamentals are as important as picking the following big stock. The silver lining of Tesla’s volatility is that it can instill more discipline and prudence in managing your investments. Whether you hold TSLA, buy more, or cut your losses, make that choice part of a thoughtful, long-term plan. Since December, Tesla’s 50% stock crash has been a wake-up call for investors. Understanding why Tesla’s stock plunged helps investors make sense of the carnage: even market darlings can stumble badly when expectations overshoot reality. More importantly, the episode highlights how crucial managing risk in your portfolio is. Diversification, discipline, and due diligence are the antidotes to even the wildest stock swings. If the Tesla stock turbulence has rocked your portfolio, take a step back and apply these lessons. By staying calm, reviewing your strategy, and possibly rebalancing your investments, you can protect your financial future from the next big shock — whether it’s another Tesla stock performance twist or something entirely unforeseen. In investing, as in driving, it pays to buckle up for volatility and keep your eyes on the road ahead.
