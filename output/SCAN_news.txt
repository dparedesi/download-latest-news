Tata Steel Nederland announces major transformation programme to enhance competitiveness for a sustainable future Stock fell over 2%. Infosys announced it is extending its strategic collaboration with AIB, a financial services group operating predominantly in the Republic of Ireland and the UK. Stock ends nearly 2% lower RBI governor's announcement on gold loan regulations causes major gold loan company stocks to plummet. Responding to the rate cut by 25 bps by RBI, Mr Shailesh Chandra, President, SIAM and Managing Director of Tata Passenger Vehicles Ltd & Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd. said, “Reduction in rates at this time, would have a positive impact on the Auto Sector, as it will increase accessibility by reducing the financing costs, thereby creating a positive sentiment across the market Sanjay Agarwal, Founder, MD & CEO of AU Small Finance Bank “RBI’s announcement of a 25-bps rate cut in the repo rate along with a change in monetary policy stance to ‘accommodative’ from ‘neutral’ is a welcome step. Heightened geoeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty triggered by the recent tariff announcements is bound to have some adverse spillover impact on growth, even though India would remain relatively insulated vis-à-vis some of the other countries. The display of sensitivity and alertness to these seismic global shifts by the RBI is comforting. Going forward, a benign inflation outlook for FY26 on the back of a normal monsoon and soft commodity prices enhances the scope for incremental policy easing. For banks, the visibility of rate cuts along with the recent improvement in liquidity and Assurance by RBI to provide adequate liquidity for growth abodes well. This should help in lowering the overall interest rates in the economy, improve the credit-deposit balance and aid the overall growth impulse. To summarise amidst the global turmoil, we welcome the policy focus on long-term macro stability.” Harsh Dugar, Executive Director, Federal Bank “The policy recognises the macroeconomic risks and the likely impact of trade wars, has clearly shown the intent to support growth(although the estimate has been revised downward) given the contained benign inflation environment. The reduction in the repo rate will lower borrowing costs, stimulate investment, and ultimately contribute to sustained economic growth. We expect the RBI to remain supportive on liquidity to support transmission in interest rates and support credit growth .”. Bharat Dhawan, Managing Partner, Forvis Mazars in India “The RBI’s rate cut is a timely step to keep the economy on track as global uncertainties rise. Banks are well-placed to lend more actively, and with inflation expected to ease further, consumers could feel more confident about big-ticket purchases. Many sectors are going to benefit from the rate cut. With borrowing costs now slightly lower, homebuyers and developers could find more breathing room, giving a welcome push to the real estate sector. On the rural side, strong farm activity is likely to boost income levels, which may support spending in smaller towns and help keep consumption steady. RBI’s stance has shifted from neutral to accommodative now, which means RBI may go for another 25-bps cut in the second half of 2025, especially as the focus gradually shifts toward reviving demand and encouraging investment in a slowing global environment. Overall, the policy balances caution with action, aiming to protect growth without losing sight of inflation risks.” Piyush Baranwal, Sr. Fund Manager, WhiteOak Capital AMC on RBI MPC announcement*. “MPC today delivered a second rate cut in successive meeting while also finally changing the policy stance from neutral to accommodative, thus giving further clarity on the trajectory of rates going ahead. Continued tariff wars could diminish growth globally, India included. This may depress prices of goods impacted by tariff walls as well as prices of various commodities, causing India’s inflation to remain under check. Together, these open up room for further rate cuts from RBI to the tune of 50 bps in the coming months, though the same can change quickly on either side given the elevated uncertainty. Pertinent to note here that current lower spreads for Indian G-Secs vs. the US treasury when compared to the past may not necessarily be an impediment in these spreads narrowing further. This is on account of the unique issues plaguing the US bonds such as elevated fiscal deficit, compounded by potentially diminished inclination of global central banks and other investors in buying US treasuries unlike in the past. This is due to the seemingly erratic behavior from the US government, which has upended the globally established norms of trade and investments for both friends and foes alike, causing anxiety in the minds of the global community. Given the indications of continued policy easing and comfortable liquidity from RBI, we believe longer duration bonds as well as spread assets should likely outperform going forward.“ Divam Sharma, smallcase Manager, CEO & Co-Founder at Green Portfolio “The softening of crude oil prices and the US dollar has certainly helped the broader fight against inflation. This trend has further strengthened the case for the RBI to consider rate cuts and shift focus toward supporting growth. Now, looking at the global picture—China is likely to face increasing challenges in exporting to the US. However, it will continue to manufacture at scale. As a result, the surplus goods not going to the US will be redirected to large consumer markets like India. India, in turn, is gradually opening up to Chinese imports, which could lead to cheaper goods flowing into the country. This increase in supply and competition can further help in keeping inflation in check. Additionally, the fall in crude oil and other commodity prices, especially in a low-growth global environment, adds another positive layer to the inflation outlook. That said, there is a flip side- domestic industries that are either trying to restrict imports, substitute them, or rely heavily on exports may feel some pressure. Their margins could be dented in the short term. However, a reduction in interest rates would provide a strong push for domestic businesses. It would lower borrowing costs and incentivize investment, which is crucial for sustaining growth momentum. All in all, this is a welcome move. While the short term may remain volatile, the long-term prospects look promising. With falling interest rates, opportunities to replicate China’s manufacturing model, cheaper imports, and potential for new bilateral trade agreements, the outlook for India over the next six months and beyond is quite encouraging. The move was largely on expected lines, with the RBI maintaining a wait-and-watch stance. We anticipate inflation to remain subdued, creating room for further rate cuts—potentially one or two more over the course of this year. While the short term may see some volatility, as the RBI has also acknowledged, the medium to long-term growth outlook remains strong. This is supported by robust domestic consumption and emerging export opportunities, driven by improving trade relations with many of the world’s major consumer markets.” Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist at OmniScience Capital on RBI MPC announcement “The challenging global economic situation resulting from Trump Tariffs is likely to result in global economic slowdown. While India’s economy is insulated to a large extent from global economy, it is bound to be impacted by the global slowdown, albeit to a lesser extent, compared to other more export-oriented economies. Under these circumstances RBI’s rate cut is supportive of domestic growth and is welcome. Since the global challenges could last for several quarters to years, continued growth-supportive policy stance is expected in the near future from RBI. Reduced domestic interest rates put pressure on the INR towards depreciation. However, given that the crude oil prices are also crashing on the back of expected global slowdown, a depreciating INR would not be that much of a concern from oil imports point of view, but would actually be helpful in exports given the increased competitiveness required due to the tariffs.” Suresh Darak, Founder, Bondbazaar* Global volatility & huge uncertainty, due to unilateral final imposition of trade tariffs by the US, has led to wild movements on rates globally. For instance the US 10 yr Treasury yield has gone up by ~25bps overnight. Tariffs, if continued for long, should be inflationary on the immediate basis while it’d slow demand in the medium term. RBI seems to be trying to move past the tariff noise and addressing the demand slowdown concern with the repo rate cut of 25bps and change of stance to accommodative. Interesting times are up ahead over the next 1-2 months, and the US govt. actions will significantly impact rates globally including in India. “Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has delivered a 25 bp rate cut changing the stance to accommodative from neutral with a greater confidence of convergence and a durable alignment of headline inflation with a target of 4% over a year horizon going forward. With the comfort of more predictable inflation trajectory aligned to the target range; the need to support both consumption and investment led growth has taken a centre stage and the subsequent MPC decisions will be growth centric in the near term. An accommodative stance entails easy monetary policy that is geared towards stimulating the economy through softer interest rates. While the governor, in his statement, has stated that stance directly provides the policy rate guidance, without any direct guidance on liquidity management; he has also mentioned that liquidity management serves as an important operating tool with the RBI for various purposes including monetary policy transmission. Taking clues from this, we expect the regulator to provide sufficient durable liquidity as we move ahead in FY26 for an effective and efficient transmission of the rate cuts to wider sections of Economy. 10-year government bond yield is expected to hover in the range of 6.35% - 6.50% during the rest of Q1 FY 26. The CD curve, which is used as a base curve for pricing bulk deposits, has significantly come off; further the asset curve is likely to get softened primarily driven by sections of loans linked to external benchmarks.” -- Mandar Pitale, Head Treasury, SBM Bank India Vaibhav Porwal, Co-Founder, Dezerv. “In today’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a 25-basis-point reduction in the repo rate—from 6.25% to 6.00%. Additionally, the MPC changed its stance from neutral to accommodative, clearly signalling support for growth through potential future rate cuts. This move is in line with our market expectations. It’s important to note that this stance change does not directly imply increased liquidity; however, RBI has confirmed it will continue to manage liquidity as needed. Key takeaways: ● Policy outlook: In the coming months, provided there are no significant economic shocks, we anticipate the MPC will either maintain current rates or implement additional rate cuts. We expect an additional 50–75 basis points of rate cuts in FY26, depending on global factors and tariff developments. ● Growth forecast: GDP growth for FY26 has been revised downwards to 6.5% from 6.7%, reflecting cautious investment and spending due to ongoing uncertainty. However, urban consumption shows signs of gradual improvement. ● Inflation outlook: CPI inflation for FY26 is now projected at 4.00%, slightly down from the previous forecast of 4.20%. Lower crude oil prices have positively contributed to this improved inflation outlook. Additionally, the RBI announced several non-monetary measures aimed at strengthening the financing ecosystem—these include enabling securitisation of stressed assets, extending co-lending guidelines to all regulated entities, and issuing fresh regulations on gold loans and partial credit enhancement. With falling interest rates, bond prices are likely to rise, benefiting short to medium-term bonds. We anticipate further rate reductions in upcoming MPC meetings, and fixed-income investors should lock in currently elevated yields through medium-term bonds. Investing now enables you to secure these higher returns before they potentially decrease further.” Vipul Bhowar, Senior Director - Listed Investments, Waterfield Advisors “(RBI) The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announced a 25 bps reduction in the repo rate, bringing it to 6%. It also changed its policy stance from “neutral” to “accommodative.” The inflation outlook has improved decisively. As projected, there is now greater confidence in the durable alignment of headline inflation with the target of 4% over a 12-month horizon, though the impact of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs continues to loom large. Given the challenges of slower growth in the Indian economy, the central bank was anticipated to persist in modifying its policies to promote stability.” Phoenix Mills: Q4FY25 business update The company reported retailer sales/ consumption growth of 15% YoY to ₹3,262 cr in the period.

The revision of stance to accommodation will cushion the secondary impact of tariffs on domestic economy. With inflation under check, growth imperatives will take precedence in FY26. On the regulation side market-based securitization framework for stressed assets, review of policy on gold lending and non-fund-based facility are timely. Widening of co-lending framework gives wider choices to all parties concerned” Shares of Nestle India, Hindustan Unilever, Hero Motocorp, Titan and Tata Consumer Products traded among major gainers, while Wipro, Trent, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Tata Steel depreciated. Top gainers & losers today: Banking stocks fell, including NBFCs Cholamandalam, IIFL Finance, Muthoot Finance, Manappuram Finance as RBI revised repo rate and aims to issue comprehensive regulations on prudential norms for gold loans. With inflation forecast for FY26 at 4% the focus of RBI has completely shifted on the GDP growth as numbers got revised downwards to 6.5% from earlier 6.7%. RBI not only reduced interest rates by 25 bps but also changed its stance to accommodative from neutral. Inflation to remain under control as forecast of normal monsoon, record production of wheat and higher production of key pulses will ensure durable softening of food inflation. Also fall in crude oil price will keep inflation under check. If inflation remains under/around 4% for FY26 then the real rate at 200 bps is on the higher side and mostly will be reduced by cutting interest rates further. However RBI would want to keep its arsenal intact if there is any disruption in the world order due to a tariff war. We believe RBI will watchfully go for couple of more cuts in little over as many policy meets. 10 year bond yield may not show immediate correction but this policy has defined the near-term ceiling for it. “The RBI’s policy stance is clearly supportive of the fixed income markets. The continued focus on maintaining liquidity surplus—through both operational tools such as ₹80,000 crore in OMOs—underscores its accommodative approach. The money market rates should come down. While some seasonal tightness in liquidity is expected post-April, we believe the RBI’s proactive management will ensure that the overall environment remains conducive to credit flow and financial stability. There is a risk of tariff war, which we need to watch out. However, since oil prices are down and commodity prices are in control, inflation risk is lower. There could be another 50 basis point rate cut during the rest of the year “The additional 25-basis points rate cut to 6% by the Reserve Bank of India is a significant step in supporting growth and completely in line with the industry’s expectations. As I had mentioned earlier, since nearly 80% of Aadhar Housing Finance’s existing borrowers are on floating rates this reduction will benefit them. At some stage soon this will lead to reduction in Aadhar RPLR thereby reducing EMI burden. The only wait now is for the banks to pass on this benefit to us. Furthermore, many first-time buyers in the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Lower Income Group (LIG) segments will now find it easier to take that crucial step towards home ownership as this move directly translates into lower EMIs and improved affordability. This proactive liquidity support from the central bank clubbed with government initiatives like PMAY 2.0, (SWAMIH) 2.0 fund, income tax exemptions, the introduction of a mortgage guarantee fund will positively accelerate housing demand and aid to government’s vision of housing for all.” The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to shift to an accommodative stance and cut the repo rate by 25 basis points is a welcome move amid global economic uncertainties. This signals the central bank’s proactive approach to support growth and liquidity in the economy, especially in light of potential headwinds such as escalating trade tensions and counter tariffs. The reduction in borrowing costs along with tax cuts announced in budget is expected to boost consumption demand, especially in interest-rate sensitive segments. This can also support discretionary spending, which could aid sectors like auto, consumer durables, and housing. This move can also help India’s relative economic outperformance versus global peers, given the backdrop of a slowing global economy. However, market sentiment was dented by the RBI’s mention of revised gold loan guidelines, which has triggered uncertainty. NBFCs and banks with a strong gold loan portfolio witnessed sharp corrections. The “risk-off” mood among investors, driven by regulatory overhang, contributed to the sell-off. The fact that the guidelines are open for comments and review adds a layer of unpredictability to earnings visibility for these companies. While the policy stance is supportive of growth and liquidity, sector-specific regulatory risks—especially in the gold loan segment—are creating near-term volatility. Investors and stakeholders will be closely watching for clarity on gold loan norms, which could help in reassessing valuations and risk appetite for financials exposed to this segment. The RBI’s decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% and shift its policy stance to ‘accommodative’ signals a clear intent to support growth amid rising global uncertainties. With inflationary pressures easing—largely due to lower crude and food prices—and downside risks to growth becoming more pronounced post the recent US tariff hikes, this policy move was timely and expected. The change in stance strengthens the case for a continued easing cycle. We expect this to translate into lower borrowing costs, particularly benefiting rate-sensitive sectors such as housing, automobiles, and MSMEs. Real estate, in particular, stands to gain as improved affordability may drive homebuyer sentiment and spur new demand. While the RBI has revised its GDP growth forecast for FY26 to 6.5%, external challenges, including trade disruptions and climate-related volatility, may exert further pressure. The outlook for inflation remains manageable at 4%, supported by expectations of a normal monsoon, though risks from extreme weather events must be closely watched. Overall, the policy action reflects a calibrated approach—balancing growth support with macroeconomic stability—and sets the tone for a data-driven, accommodative monetary trajectory in the months ahead. Banking stocks fell, including gold loan NBFCs Cholamandalam, IIFL Finance, Muthoot Finance, Manappuram Finance as RBI revised repo rate and aims to issue comprehensive regulations on prudential norms for gold loans. Public sector banks such as Indian Bank, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India and Canara Bank depreciated 2 per cent. IT stocks continued to drag the broader index, while metal and pharma also depreciated. FMCG and auto index showed resilience despite market descent.

Jeffrey D. Sachs, renowned economist and Columbia University professor, said, “If we had the Indian Supreme Court, I would not have worried frankly. The Indian Supreme Court is pretty activist — it would strike this down as an enormous presidential overreach. I don’t know about our Supreme Court.” Speaking at the Rising Bharat Summit 2025, Sachs sharply criticised the growing concentration of power in the hands of the US President and warned that America is slipping into one-man rule. Referring to former President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers, he said, “The President of the US declared an emergency. Now this is interesting, he claims that he can declare an emergency and then govern without law and just govern with decree.” Sachs added, “Now what he calls an emergency is anything that Donald Trump wants to call an emergency. So he calls our trade deficit an emergency. Well, no, it has been around for 20 some years, it has deep economic causes. It is not something that one person should decide and then override the laws of the land in an emergency decree.” He warned that such actions have left the US “profoundly destabilised”, and questioned whether democratic institutions would respond: “We don’t know whether the courts will be able to enforce a judgment that these actions are illegal, which they plainly are… or whether Congress will wake up and say, hey, we have a rule under Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution, which says very explicitly that the right to levy duties belongs only to the Congress, not to the President.” The professor did not mince words, stating, “We don’t know at this moment if the US is a one-person rule or a democracy with checks and balances. Maybe we will have a coup now, we don’t know. Americans voted for Trump to be ruled as per constitution, not as per decree.”On the foreign policy front, Sachs advised India to remain cautious about its strategic alignment with the US. “American friendships have ended up destroying countries. India should be careful, there is no alliance. India is too big for alliance. Being the most populous country, India needs to take care of its relations,” he said. Sachs alleged that Washington seeks to use India as a counterweight to China: “US wants to use India to beat up China. Don’t play the American game is my advice. US foreign policy is divide and rule for every country in the world. India is too big for the US game. US wants India to bash China, to be part of QUAD.” While we await the revised draft, it is good that the RBI is revisiting the partial credit enhancement guidelines as the segment did not scale up given the restrictions in existing guidelines. Some of the challenges included the capping of the partial credit enhancement only 20% of bond issue though capital requirements were significantly higher in relation to the guarantee provided and limited / back-ended amortization of credit enhancement resulting in guarantee fees outweighing the benefits of cost reduction upon rating enhancement. While we await the details, guidelines to harmonise gold loan practices across lenders augurs well for the segment, given the sharp growth in loan book driven by the gold prices and favourable demand dynamics, as unsecured and personal credit slowed since H2FY2024. With the elevated gold prices at present and the currently favourable risk profiles of the NBFCs in this space, considering the liquid nature of the security, the near-term impact on account of regulatory tightening should be manageable. However, competitive pressures for NBFCs could increase going forward, which remains monitorable. “The RBI has reduced the repo rate by 25 bps and at 6% now indeed delivered on the relief front, and the central bank is ahead of the curve with its policy measures to combat the uncertainties post due to global tariff war. The central bank has provided relief on the rate front for the second consecutive time. The rate cut is complemented well by the change in policy stance from neutral to accommodative. The change in stance indicates the readiness of the central bank to act as per the prevailing situation. Other than the rate cut and policy stance change, the commentary on inflation indicating further softening of inflation due to better crop production and above normal monsoon expectations. The RBI has now cut rates by 50 bps in the current calendar year, a move which is expected to further boost demand for real estate. Lower interest rates are anticipated to propagate better home loan affordability, eventually accelerating housing demand in varied ticket segments. The other measures like RBI allowing securitisation of stressed assets and co-lending between regulated entities and beyond priority sector, along with ample system liquidity will help boost the credit growth in the system. Barring the tariff war, geopolitical tensions, most economic indicators are positive, including inflation, GDP growth and a normal monsoon year.” RBI delivers on expectations: RBI cuts rates, changes stance, and provides comfort on inflation projection. Takeaways: 1. As expected by market participants, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut Repo rate by 25 bps, bringing the Repo rate to 6.00%, Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) at 5.75% and Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) at 6.25%. 2. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also changed its stance to ‘Accommodative’ (from ‘Neutral’). 3. The principal driver for the rate cut and change in stance were RBI’s expectations of a benign inflation trajectory and the need to support moderating economic growth. 4. RBI lowered its Gross Domestic Production (GDP) projection for FY 25-26 to 6.50% (Vs 6.70% earlier). RBI also lowered its FY25-26 Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation forecast to 4.00% (Vs its earlier forecast of 4.20%) 5. RBI expressed its view of a moderating growth and softening of inflation of the coming months, which bodes well for bond markets. However, it also reiterated the need for vigilance at this juncture, given the risks posed by the rising uncertainties regarding global macro-economic conditions and its potential impact on domestic conditions. 6. As opposed to expectations of some market participants, RBI did not give any express guidance on market liquidity, but noted the present positive systemic liquidity conditions and reiterated its commitment to proactively The Reserve Bank of India announced a 25-basis point rate cut, bringing the repo rate down to 6% from 6.25% which is in line with market expectations. The policy stance has shifted from &#39;neutral&#39; to &#39;accommodative&#39;, indicating the possibility of further rate hikes. The RBI assured that liquidity will be infused as required, offering comfort to the markets. Forward projections may remain optimistic, with inflation expected to stay around 4% and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth projected at 6.5%. Given the benign inflation outlook, the RBI is likely to focus on growth through monetary stimulus measures. Overall, the policy is viewed as positive for fixed income markets. Equity markets extended their morning losses in mid-day trading on Wednesday as investors continued to process the Reserve Bank of India’s anticipated rate cut against the backdrop of escalating global trade tensions. The central bank lowered its key policy rate by 25 basis points to 6 per cent and shifted its stance from “neutral” to “accommodative,” signalling a growth-focused approach. Equity markets decline as RBI cuts rates, shifts focus to growth amid global trade tensions, impacting IT and consumer goods. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a significant expansion of its co-lending framework, which was previously limited to arrangements between banks and NBFCs for priority sector loans only. The new policy will extend co-lending arrangements to all regulated entities and all loan categories. RBI expands co-lending framework to all regulated entities, aiming to boost credit access and drive inclusive growth.

The RBI’s recent 25-basis-point rate cut, bringing the repo rate to 6%, is more than just a monetary policy adjustment; it’s a calculated gamble on India’s ability to defy global headwinds through the sheer force of domestic demand. The central bank’s decision to revise FY26 GDP growth projections downward from 6.7% to 6.5% reflects realism, acknowledging that domestic demand alone may not be enough to offset external drags. Yet, with global trade fragmenting, export growth uncertain, and capital flows volatile, the economy has no choice except to double down on its most reliable engine: the Indian consumer. This isn’t just about lowering interest rates; it’s about reorienting the entire financial system to fuel consumption-led growth without leaving households and businesses drowning in debt. Financial institutions must move beyond passive rate transmission and actively shape lending toward high-impact sectors. Affordable housing, rural consumption, and small-business credit aren’t just growth drivers they’re lifelines for broader economic resilience. The focus should be on productive lending that boosts incomes, rather than merely spending. For instance, financing agri-tech startups that raise farm productivity puts more money in rural pockets, which then flows into FMCG, autos, and durables. Similarly, supporting MSMEs in tier-2 and tier-3 cities creates jobs that sustain urban consumption. This isn’t trickle-down economics; it’s a direct pipeline from credit to income to demand. But there’s a catch: inflation and currency risks loom large. A consumption surge that relies on imported goods such as electronics or energy could backfire by widening the trade deficit and pressuring the rupee. The solution lies in targeting credit at sectors that stimulate local production renewable energy, food processing, and manufacturing to keep demand leakage in check. Banks must also avoid the trap of reckless retail lending, where easy EMIs today become NPAs tomorrow. The path forward demands precision. Fiscal policy must complement monetary easing think tax cuts for middle-income earners, better supply chains to curb food inflation, and incentives for domestic manufacturing. If executed right, India’s consumption story won’t just offset global drags; it could redefine emerging-market resilience. But if mishandled, we risk repeating the boom-bust cycles of the past. The RBI has fired the starting gun. Now, lenders and policymakers must run the race with discipline. RBI policy – A rate cut as expected, stance change to “accommodation” – growth support all the way. RBI as expected announced a 25 bp rate cut announcement, the second rate cut after the first one in Feb’25, taking repo to 6%. Alongside the stance change to “Accommodation” from “Neutral”. Furthermore, there was a clear message from the governor that the change in stance signaled ‘status quo’ or ‘rate cut’. In addition, with the message that growth inflation trajectory demands monetary policy to be growth supportive – RBI’s path ahead is likely to followed by rate cuts. While lowering growth estimates by 20 bp for FY26 to 6.5%, and inflation estimates also by 20 bp to 4%, clearly there is more support for growth amidst global uncertainties. While acknowledging that the global outlook is clouded with tariff uncertainties, it appears that RBI is more inclined to support growth. Domestic inflation has downside from crude prices and positive drivers from food inflation. While there is risk from imported inflation from currency, inflation is not as much of a concern as much as growth. Overall, the trajectory, despite being guarded has tilted towards a growth-inflation balance from inflation-growth in the previous regime, with a clear emphasis on supporting growth. While there is unknown from tariffs, another unknown is always the weather. While governor acknowledged that tariff related uncertainties are very high, if India is able to manage with lesser dent on inflation, then we can expect more rate cuts down the line.

RBI to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% and shift to an accommodative stance is a welcome move for SMEs . As a company operating in the 3D printing sector, this decision will not only reduce borrowing costs but also improve liquidity in the market, enabling businesses to invest in innovation and expansion. With inflation under control and a focus on stimulating economic growth, we are optimistic about leveraging these favourable conditions to drive technological advancements and contribute to the broader economy. Amicco, a vertical marketplace empowering independent garages, has successfully secured $1 million in seed funding to modernise and streamline India’s automotive aftermarket. The funding round, led by Eximius Ventures, with participation from other investors, including FJ Labs, will enable Amicco to expand its network of garages, streamline its procurement platform and sharpen its go-to-market strategies — all aimed at eliminating the sourcing challenges facing by these garages. “We see RBI’s change in stance to ‘accommodative’ as an intent for a deeper rate cut cycle. This is in line with our view of another 75-100 bps of rate cuts in FY2026E, implying repo rate at 5-5.25% by end-FY2026E. The benign outlook on inflation (favorable monsoon, lower crude oil prices to offset INR depreciation) and downside risks to growth will provide room for this deeper rate cut cycle. The RBI’s focus remains on addressing growth concerns as inflation is expected to remain around the 4% handle. We also expect the RBI to keep liquidity conditions ample to ensure smooth monetary policy transmission.” The shares of Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Limited (GRSE) were trading at ₹1,524.85 down by ₹40.95 or 2.62 per cent on the NSE today at 11.25 am. RBI governor's announcement on gold loan regulations causes major gold loan company stocks to plummet. RBI delivered a 25bps rate cut, in line with market expectation. The policy stance has been changed to accommodative. The policy and stance continue to remain Growth supportive, as inflation is expected to remain benign. Both Inflation and GDP growth rates have been revised lower. We expect the monetary policy to support greater transmission to help Economic grow in the current uncertain global environment. We expect market rates to remain well supported with 10-yr continue to trade in 6.40%-6.60% range, with positive bias. Short-term yields upto 1 year are also likely to trade in the current range after a sharp rally of 75-100 bps over the last one month. Beyond domestic monetary policy, markets will take further cues from current Global Tariff Wars and its impact on macro-economic parameters and financial stability. “The RBI’s reduction in the policy rate by 25 bps is in line with market expectations and, coupled with the measures taken by them to infuse more liquidity, should signal good times for MSMEs. With much greater competition and global uncertainties, investment in up-to-date machinery is critical to maintaining our competitive edge. The cost of debt has been high in the past couple of years, and the signal towards a benign rate scenario should encourage MSMEs to plan capital investment.” “The RBI’s decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points and adopt an accommodative stance is poised to positively impact the real estate sector. Lower interest rates are expected to enhance home loan affordability, which can significantly boost housing demand, especially in the affordable and mid-income categories. For developers, improved liquidity conditions may ease financing pressures, enabling faster execution and delivery of ongoing projects. The move also bodes well for commercial real estate, as lower borrowing costs could encourage business expansion and increase demand for office and retail spaces. While the GDP outlook has softened, the real estate market stands to benefit from the policy’s clear intent to support growth and investment. Overall, the industry is likely to witness renewed interest and improved sentiment, setting the stage for a more active and stable period ahead.” “A cut in the repo rate can be a strong catalyst for the real estate sector. Lower interest rates translate into more affordable home loans, encouraging first-time buyers and investors alike to explore bigger and premium homes. Mid-range and high-end segments will also benefit as buyers feel more confident making long-term commitments. At the same time, the change in stance to being ‘accommodative,’ supports steady decision-making for both developers and homebuyers, reigniting buyer sentiment and boosting overall housing demand. Additionally, with ongoing economic uncertainties in the US and other global markets, many NRIs are turning their attention to their home land . A repo rate cut is likely to further strengthen this trend, as more NRIs see real estate in India as a stable and attractive investment opportunity. This could lead to a significant uptick in NRI-driven investments across the Indian real estate sector.” RBI MPC: Keeping the guards ready ✓RBI’s unanimous 25bps rate cut and stance change to “accommodative” reflect the uncertain global environment and benign inflation environment; the change in stance provides a directional easing bias going forward. Given global volatility and uncertainty, the MPC chose not to frontload all its actions and thus kept its powder dry for rainier days. The fluid global dynamics will require RBI to be nimble in managing any risk of tighter financial conditions, especially as the shock to sentiment/capital flows will likely require higher risk premia from EMs. The RBI may want to keep ammunitions ready, given fluid global markets, apart from conventional easing. Options like (i) non-conventional easing in the form of easier regulatory (lending) norms, (ii) lower daily CRR maintainance requirement for banks to sub 90%, (ii) sterilised INR management, etc. may be used, if needed. ✓ One does not know the extent to which this global trade war could stretch. Monetary policy may have to do the heavy lifting in India by being more counter-cyclical than fiscal this year. While June 25bps cut is a given, we no longer rule out another 25-50bp cut from there, which could take the terminal rate to 5.25% in this cycle – of course contingent on the extent of the global slowdown/recession ✓ While the 20bp growth downgrade by the RBI to 6.5% for FY26 reflects the uncertain global environment, we think there would be material downward risk to their growth forecast – to the tune of ~50-70bps. This would emanate from a much higher risk of a US/global recession if these global tariffs are maintained, while domestic private economic agents stay largely absent. ✓We reckon with the RBI that FY26 inflation would have a net disinflationary impulse (CPI revised down 20bps to 4%) which could emanate from lower global commodity prices/supply glut of goods. China’s survival response to massive tariff blow will matter for India, amid its excess industrial capacity and dumping in the world/Asia and use of FX as a policy tool. “MPC has delivered almost everything that was anticipated by the market. A 25 bps rate cut and change of policy stance to accommodative are welcome steps. FY 25 growth and inflation projection have been revised downwards by 20 bps to 6.5% and 4%, respectively. Dissipating food inflation, falling crude and uncertainty related to global growth environment seem to have led to this decision. On liquidity though, there is no fresh announcement but there is an assurance on liquidity provision as and when required.” The outcome of the RBI meeting was largely in line with expectations, with a unanimous decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6%. In a notable move, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also shifted its stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative’, signaling the possibility of further rate cuts in the coming months. Forecast revisions further reinforced this shift in priorities. GDP growth for FY26 has been revised downward from 6.7% to 6.5%, while inflation expectations have been eased from 4.2% to 4%. This suggests that the RBI is placing greater emphasis on supporting growth, particularly in the face of rising external risks such as global trade tensions, while remaining confident that inflation will stay within manageable levels. Overall, the message is clear: the RBI is now more focused on its growth mandate. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, we expect an additional 50–75 basis points of rate cuts in FY26, contingent on how the global trade situation evolves. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra said on Wednesday it would issue comprehensive regulations on prudential norms and conduct related aspects for gold loans, sending gold loan company stocks sharply lower. RBI governor's announcement on gold loan regulations causes major gold loan company stocks to plummet. The RBI’s 25 basis points reduction in the repo rate to 6% is a timely intervention. Change in stance to accommodative is sentimentally positive, allowing room for better liquidity and growth. Together, they will support both MSME and retail demand. The MSME sector which contributes nearly 30% to India’s GDP and accounts for over 40% of exports, will benefit from this move as it will ease credit costs and improve cash flows, which are critical for recovery and growth in the evolving market dynamics. We foresee improved credit appetite at Indian Bank as MSMEs form a vital part of our lending portfolio. Increasing scope of colending will further strengthen lending to these sectors. This cut is likely to spur demand for home, auto, and personal loans, especially in tier 2 and tier 3 markets, where interest sensitivity is higher. Retail loans grew over 18% YoY as per recent trends and a lower rate environment could further accelerate consumption and support economic momentum. Indian Bank is fully geared to pass on the benefits swiftly and responsibly to our customers, ensuring inclusive credit growth.

The substantial infusion of liquidity into the banking system ahead of the decision had already signalled the central bank’s full commitment to easing financial conditions. The growth-inflation outlook had also become supportive of a shift to an ‘accommodative’ policy stance at this meeting, as recent inflation prints have surprised to the downside, while growth risks have intensified amid rising economic uncertainty. The implementation of reciprocal tariffs by the US is expected to dampen global growth and weigh heavily on export-oriented sectors.

BharatPe, India’s leading financial services and UPI payments platform, today announced that Resilient Payments Private Limited, a BharatPe Group company, has received final authorisation from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to operate as an Online Payment Aggregator. This development reflects BharatPe’s commitment to building a business rooted in compliance, strong governance, and long-term value. It is a recognition of the company’s consistent efforts to maintain operational discipline, uphold transparency, and stay aligned with regulatory expectations. The company has taken clear steps to professionalise its operations, investing in leadership, processes, and risk controls. Nalin Negi, CEO of BharatPe, said, “We deeply value the trust placed in us by the regulatory authorities. This final authorisation is not just a milestone, but a responsibility we take seriously. It speaks to the strength of the governance practices and operational frameworks we’ve put in place over the years.

With a strong footprint in the offline payment space and a network of millions of merchants, BharatPe Group is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between offline and online commerce. Sandeep Indurkar, CEO of Resilient Payments said, “Resilient Payments will carry its online business under brand name ‘BharatPe X’. This sets the stage for us to accelerate our plans to build a scalable, merchant-first payments platform. We’re looking to broaden our footprint across high-potential markets, enhance our product suite, and bring more innovation to how businesses accept and manage digital payments. The focus now is on execution—building with intent, speed, and reliability.” RBI’s 25 bps rate cut to 6% and shift to an accommodative stance signals a growth-focused policy. I view this as positive for liquidity and demand recovery. Rate-sensitive sectors like banks, NBFCs, real estate, and autos stand to gain. While banks may see some NIMs compression (Fitch estimates ~10 bps in FY26), improved credit offtake could balance it. Lower rates should boost home and vehicle loan demand. However, global headwinds—especially rising US tariffs—pose risks to export-driven sectors like IT and pharma. Overall, a supportive step for domestic growth with some caution on external pressures. “We welcome the Reserve Bank of India’s mature and forward-looking move to adopt an accommodative policy stance, underpinned by a balanced view on inflation and growth. The repo rate cut, coupled with the commitment to maintain adequate liquidity, reflects a timely and prudent response to evolving macroeconomic challenges. This stance is a positive step toward reinvigorating demand and catalyzing investments across sectors. For the NBFC sector, in particular, it signals a conducive environment to deepen credit access and drive inclusive growth. We believe the proposed policy revisions will stimulate the banking and financial services ecosystem in the right direction and support the broader goal of sustaining a healthy and resilient economy.” Signature Global (India) Limited announced its highest-ever annual pre-sales of ₹10,290 crore for fiscal year 2025, surpassing company guidance with 42 per cent year-on-year growth. “We welcome the RBI’s decision to lower the repo rate to 6.00%, a move that reinforces its balanced approach toward fostering growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability. At a time when global uncertainties persist due to trade disruptions and geopolitical developments, this proactive stance signals confidence in the country’s inflation outlook. The anticipated moderation in CPI inflation creates room for monetary support, and this rate cut is well-positioned to boost consumer confidence and enhance credit accessibility. For the housing sector, particularly the mid-income and affordable segments, improved affordability is expected to drive demand and support broader economic momentum.” RBI cut repo rate by 25 basis points as widely expected. RBI changed its stance to accommodative from neutral, which was not on expected lines given the global background. RBI seems to be comfortable with currency depreciation in the coming months. RBI has reduced its GDP growth forecast to 6.5 from 6.7 percent and CPI inflation has been revised to 4 from 4.2 percent. They highlighted future expectation of CPI over a 3 and 6 month time frame is lower. The governor highlighted lower commodity prices specially oil prices due to tariff war and on the growth downside due to lower investments by companies. RBI made it clear they will provide liquidity in the banking system to support growth Rate cuts in India is expected to be deeper to support growth as CPI inflation is below target of 4 percent for most of the year as per RBI projections. The terminal rate on repo can go towards 5.25 levels from 6 percent at present. The ten-year yields can move towards 6 to 6.25 percent in the coming years as globally growth slows down. The RBI has delivered what the market expected – a 25-bps cut and a change in stance to “accommodative”. It was also explained that being “accommodative” means that there would be no chance of a rate hike at this point, even as the RBI stays vigilant with the evolving macro scenario of tariff wars and geopolitical risks. Both inflation and growth forecasts were lowered by 20 bps. There were no fresh liquidity measures that were announced in this policy. The space for policy rate cuts were predicated by a decisive change in the inflation outlook, led by food prices and more specifically vegetable prices. Given projections by the Skymet of a normal monsoon, the risks to food inflation is likely reduced. At the other end of the spectrum, global growth risks have unleashed a sharp softening in crude oil and other commodity prices, and this is also a positive for India’s inflation dynamics. Overall, the confidence that inflation would remain aligned to the 4% target has magnified. Given a 4% inflation target, the scope of pushing repo rate down to 5.50% in this cycle has opened. Consequently, we expect the RBI to cut in June and also in August. “The RBI’s 25 bps rate cut, bringing the repo rate down to 6%, along with a shift to an accommodative stance, reflects a proactive policy response to escalating global trade uncertainty and rising export headwinds — notably as India’s merchandise exports have been contracted since November 2024. With CPI inflation softening and crude oil prices easing, the external disinflationary environment has provided the RBI with policy space for calibrated easing. This move not only cushions domestic demand but also offers timely support to MSMEs and corporates facing tighter global conditions while macroeconomic stability remains well-anchored by $676 billion in forex reserves” “Housing demand has been robust in the last 4-5 years, driven by stable macros, strong consumer sentiment, income and wealth growth. However, an increase in capital values has started impacting sales across segments. A further rate cut of 25 bps with an accommodative stance announced today, post a 25-bps rate cut in February 2025, is likely to further improve affordability. The falling interest rate cycle is likely to sustain consumer sentiment to some extent which has started seeing signs of weakening amid the current global turmoil and uncertainty.” “RBI’s Monetary Policy outcome was in line with consensus estimates and a 25 bps rate cut should augur well both for the financial system and the economy. Given the ongoing tariff war across the world, an accommodative stance along with a stable inflationary scenario would ensure buoyant credit growth and support our domestic environment. The rate cut is indeed positive for our bond markets but the ongoing pressure on the US bond yield restricts the full extent of the impact in India.” “The policy announcements come against the backdrop of increased volatility across asset classes, fear of a sharp global slowdown due to tariff shock. We believe the policy announcements were balanced and prudent, especially given the current uncertainties. The change in stance highlights the MPC’s resolve to support growth, as inflation risks have come down while risks to growth have increased. On the liquidity front, we expect the RBI to remain proactive and ensure sufficient liquidity conditions in the banking system. Going forward, we believe that the global growth outlook is expected to be highly uncertain and may have potential negative implications for our growth. Inflation is expected to be within MPC’s target of 4% due to lower crude, food. We expect the RBI to continue to provide required support to growth through various measures.” RBI Cuts Rates, Turns Accommodative: Growth is the Focus The RBI’s April policy action—a widely anticipated 25 bps rate cut taking the repo to 6.00%, alongside a shift in stance to ‘accommodative’—reflects a calibrated but decisive pivot toward supporting domestic growth amid escalating global uncertainties. With CPI inflation revised down to 4.0% for FY26 from 4.2%, and Q1FY26 inflation expected at just 3.6%, the real policy rate has widened to 2.4% (actual) and ~2.0% (forward-looking). This is materially above the RBI’s internal neutral real rate estimate of 1.4–1.9%, clearly indicating monetary space to ease further. Growth-wise, the RBI’s revision of FY26 GDP to 6.5% (from 6.7%) appears cautious, especially given strong underlying domestic fundamentals. Improving rural demand, resilient services exports, uptick in urban discretionary consumption, and accelerating investment momentum—driven by healthy corporate balance sheets and sustained public capex. Indeed, India remains an outlier in a decelerating global landscape, where tariff-induced frictions, manufacturing softness, and higher-for-longer rates are dragging global trade and investment activity. Inflation, on the other hand, is not just moderating—it is durably anchored. Headline CPI has averaged ~3.8% in Q4FY25, with vegetable prices registering a sequential decline for four consecutive months. NHB data points to a further 2% m-o-m decline in March, strengthening the disinflation narrative. A normal monsoon scenario could keep FY26 inflation in the 4% range, particularly given benign global commodity and crude trends (Brent below $70/bbl). Add to this China’s excess industrial capacity and weak global demand—both feeding into regional disinflation—and the inflation-growth mix for India is now the most conducive in years. On the liquidity front, RBI has managed a structural transition efficiently. After an average LAF deficit of ₹1.65 tn in Q4FY25, the system moved into surplus by March-end. Planned OMO purchases of ₹800 bn (₹200 bn each tranche) and an expected RBI dividend transfer of ₹2.5–3 tn in Q1FY26 will ensure that liquidity conditions remain conducive for rate transmission. With 60%+ of bank loans benchmarked to EBLR, policy transmission is more responsive than in prior cycles—50–75 bps of additional rate cuts could translate to 25–30 bps of GDP impulse via lower borrowing costs. Globally, policy uncertainty remains high. The U.S. tariff hikes (equivalent to a ~20% increase in average import duty) represent the steepest protectionist move in over a century. While India’s direct exposure remains modest—non-pharma exports to the U.S. are just ~1.4% of GDP—the broader impact of weaker global demand, tighter financial conditions, and deflated business confidence cannot be ignored. Yet, the lack of systemic financial stress, continued resilience in services exports and remittances, and a manageable current account trajectory (well below 2.0% of GDP) offer India insulation. In this context, the RBI has struck a prudent balance—neither flinching from external risks nor front-loading rate cuts aggressively. The shift to an accommodative stance, while decoupled from liquidity operations, signals policy optionality in favour of growth. We anticipate a cumulative 75–100 bps of further easing in 2025, contingent on monsoon outcomes, evolving global financial conditions, and inflation pass-through risks. The policy’s core message is subtle but strong: inflation containment is no longer the constraint; sustaining growth momentum without fuelling imbalances is now the monetary priority. The RBI has chosen to lead with calm conviction rather than reactive intervention—anchoring expectations while keeping its powder dry in an uncertain world. “The RBI’s move to cut the repo rate to 6 per cent and adopt an accommodative stance is a timely and growth-supportive measure. This decision is expected to inject greater liquidity into the market and bring down borrowing costs, thereby improving sentiment across the real estate sector. Amid global headwinds, including the recent U.S. tariffs of 26 per cent on Indian exports and a slower GDP growth rate of 6.5 per cent, this rate cut signals the central bank’s proactive approach to sustaining economic drive. With enhanced access to capital and improved investor confidence, the industry is poised to witness increased momentum in both residential and commercial segments. The move also reinforces trust in the RBI’s commitment to long-term financial stability, making this an opportune moment for buyers and investors to act with optimism.” Trade war escalates as US imposes 104% tariffs on Chinese imports •\u0009The US has put a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, raising tensions between the world’s two largest economies and causing market volatility. The White House acknowledged that the new tariff structure, which takes effect on April 9, follows President Donald Trump’s ultimatum to Beijing to reverse its retaliatory 34% taxes on American imports. •\u0009This adds to concerns that an all-out trade war could force the global economy into a recession, triggering a new wave of risk-aversion trading and reviving demand for the safe-haven gold price. •\u0009Investors increased their bets that a tariff-induced US economic slowdown would prompt the Federal Reserve to resume its rate-cutting cycle shortly. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicates that traders are pricing in a more than 60% possibility that the Fed will decrease borrowing costs in May. Furthermore, the US central bank is predicted to provide five rate cuts by 2025. Technical Triggers\u0009 •\u0009The gold active June contract has significant support at $3000 (~Rs 87000). However, if prices remain below $3000, they may fall below $2900 (~Rs 84500). •\u0009Silver has excellent support at $29 (about Rs 87000). I do not believe Silver can remain below this level. Every decline below $30 (~Rs 89000) should be viewed as a buying opportunity for targets of $32 (~Rs 94000). “Undertaking a second successive step to ease policy, the Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously in favour of a 25bp rate cut. In line with our view, the stance was revised to ‘accommodative’, reflecting policymakers’ comfort with the evolving inflation trajectory and providing room to support growth. This was reinforced by the modest downward revision in growth projections. Recent liquidity management measures have underscored the preference to maintain a surplus balance, thereby keeping the banking system well-oiled and aiding policy transmission. Overall, policy guidance remained dovish, while keeping an eye on global uncertainties and the consequent need to maintain stability in domestic financial markets. We expect a further 50bp of cuts this year.” Copper futures has seen a sharp drop in price recently. The continuous contract, after hitting a high of ₹922.20 on March 26, declined in the following sessions and closed at ₹797.85 on April 8, losing about 13 per cent. Copper futures experience sharp drop, with support at ₹790 and resistance at ₹825, traders advised to stay out. “The decision by RBI to reduce the repo rate to 6% is a welcome move as it aligns with broader goal of fostering economic growth. Pertaining to gold industry, the anticipated lower interest rates should further drive investor interest towards safe-heaven assets like gold, resulting into increasing momentum in the sector. We expect this to bolster the demand for gold. We believe that the monetary easing will encourage consumers and investors to consider gold as a safe bet amidst all the ongoing global uncertainties. With an approach to control inflation and borrowing costs reduced as well, we predict increased consumer spending power that will eventually benefit the gold industry.” The RBI has proven yet again that it is an ahead-of-the-curve central bank. The RBI has not only cut rates to support growth amid global turmoil, but also swiftly changed its stance from ‘Neutral’ to ‘Accommodative’. The policy change indicates the RBI is in a good position to cut rates if needed going forward. The RBI indicating that the inflation is benign, and the economic growth will be non-inflationary going forward, was one of the highlights of the policy. The RBI has done its part and delivered the much-needed relief to the industry on time. The government should make efforts to engage with the US government to find a solution to the trade tariff issue. The Indian economy remains strong, with key risks of a global slowdown due to trade tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and protectionism. “The RBI MPC meeting led by governor Sanjay Malhotra has announced a repo rate reduction of 25 basis points to a 6% cut .The rate has remained unchanged since February 2023. The rate cut will benefit homebuyers, since there will be a reduction in interest rates on home loans, leading to affordability. Loan EMIs will also reduce, which will be beneficial to refinance existing home loans.” Gold prices inched higher in the early Asian trade rebounding form a three-week low as investors sought safety amidst escalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Benchmark 10-year note yields rose to a one-week high reversing from recent low of ~4%, while dollar index stayed firm hovering around 103. In the previous session, rupee also depreciated sharply by ~40 paise supporting domestic prices. Concerns over a global trade war since U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs on April 2 have raised fears of a slowdown and prompted investors to take refuge in the safe-haven assets like gold. In fresh updates regarding tariff war, President Trump to proceed with extra 50% tariff on China as trade war escalates. The tariffs will be especially steep for China, as U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up duties on Chinese imports to 104% to counter Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs. China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and has vowed to “fight to the end”. Physically backed gold exchange-traded funds registered largest quarterly inflow in three years in January-March 2025, data from the World Gold Council showed. Market participants will now keep an eye on RBI policy meeting and FOMC meeting minutes. Focus this week will be on US CPI and PPI data. A 25 basis points rate cut by RBI is a welcome and timely move. It has reinforced the central bank’s commitment to support economic growth, especially at a time when inflation appears to be within manageable limits. A lower interest rate environment has always provided relief to businesses and consumers alike, potentially spurring credit demand, investments, and job creation. Rate cuts amidst tariff turmoil also signals that RBI sees enough macroeconomic stability to continue with an accommodative stance. However, we must ensure that this liquidity gets translated into tangible gains for sectors that need it most, particularly MSMEs, housing, and infrastructure. Economy should realize the full benefits of lower rates through policy support and sustained reform The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced its key repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% during its April policy meeting, marking the second consecutive rate cut. This move, in line with market expectations, lowers borrowing costs to the lowest level since November 2022, amid easing inflation and slowing economic growth. The RBI revised its GDP growth forecast for FY2025-26 to 6.5%, down from 6.7%. The inflation projection was also lowered to 4% from 4.2%, remaining within the target range of 2-6%. Growth projections for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 are 6.5%, 6.7%, 6.6%, and 6.3%, respectively, while inflation is forecasted at 3.6% in Q1, rising to 4.4% by Q4. With global uncertainties, this rate cut may support economic growth. The USD/INR pair is expected to trade between 86.00 and 86.90 next week, shortened by holidays. “The RBI’s decision to cut rates by another 25bps was largely on expected lines. It also changed its stance from neutral to accommodating. This paves the way for further rate cuts in the upcoming meetings. With inflation cooling off, the regulator has revised its inflation forecast for FY26 downwards to 4% vs 4.2% earlier. However, amidst global challenges, the GDP growth rate has also been tweaked downwards to 6.5% compared to 6.7% earlier. During the rate easing cycle, a general trend emerges: improved CASA ratios for banks. This has not been the case in Q4, with deposit growth being led by both CASA and TDs based on the provisional updates released by banks thus far. Systemic liquidity has been in deficit for the more significant part of the quarter, though it eased into surplus as banks exit Q4FY25. We expect the transmission on the CoF side to be slower vs the pace of transmission on the yields. Regarding margins for banks, we expect the full impact of the rate cut to reflect from Q1FY26, with a partial impact visible in Q4. We believe NBFCs like Bajaj Finance, Shriram Finance, SBI Cards and Cholamandalam Inv. & Fin. would benefit not only from the rate cuts but also from the RBI’s decision to roll back the higher risk weight on bank loans to NBFCs. Amongst banks, we prefer large private banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank and ICICI Bank”. “The awaited RBI MPC meeting announcement has arrived. The committee has announced a 25 basis point reduction to 6% from 6.25%. For homebuyers, it is a positive news, making it a lenient approach on the part of the committee. The reduction will make home loans and EMIs affordable. Homebuyers can also go for floating rate loans for more affordable housing.” Sandeep Bagla, CEO, TRUST Mutual Fund on RBI MPC: “RBI MPC cut repo rate by 25 bps, which was as per expected lines. It also changed its stance to neutral, which denoted that RBI is now unequivocal in its support of domestic growth and confident that inflation will move towards its desired rate of 4%. I expect the curve to steepen with the shorter end of the curve benefitting more. In the US, the tariff induced inflation fears are rising, which will lead to rising long bond yields. High global yields will influence the longer end bond yields in India as well. Investors should stick to Short duration funds, which offer a good risk reward trade off” MAHINDRA TO DELIVER ASSEMBLIES TO AIRBUS HELICOPTERS’ FACILITY IN EUROPE STARTING MARCH 2027- STATEMENT - [RTRS] - MAHINDRA TO PRODUCE H130’S MAIN FUSELAGE ASSEMBLY - STATEMENT - [RTRS] - MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA - UNIT MAHINDRA AEROSTRUCTURES SELECTED BY AIRBUS FOR MANUFACTURING H130 HELICOPTER FUSELAGE - [RTRS] - MAHINDRA AEROSTRUCTURES SELECTED BY AIRBUS FOR MANUFACTURING H130 HELICOPTER FUSELAGE - STATEMENT - -> KRW -0.3% weakest since 2009 -> AUD hits touches lowest level since 2020 -> IDR -0.5% trades at worst since 1998 -> INR -0.35% (all time low was 87.95) Beijing’s Ministry of Commerce says it “strongly opposes” Trump’s proposed 50% tariffs and urges Washington to return to dialogue. “If the U.S. insists, China will fight until the end,” the ministry warned — escalating an already intensifying global trade standoff.

With inflation pressures abating in the last several months and a repo rate already lowered to 6.25% in the previous meeting, the committee again must address a long-standing question of how to support growth while not permitting inflation pressures to run up again. The backdrop globally is still tense, as fears of trade wars and a potential global slowdown are pressing nerves. While there can be another small rate cut coming through, the views of the MPC would prefer an interim pause in order to allow time and space to properly evaluate the current backdrop. Attention may shift more towards financial stability measures and ensuring there is enough liquidity in the system. I feel the RBI will remain cautious, assessing how both global and domestic conditions play out before looking to intervene again.

Gold prices surged back above the $3,000 mark on Wednesday as mounting global trade tensions and rising recession fears drove investors toward safe-haven assets. The move comes amid escalating US-China tariff threats, with the White House confirming a 104% tariff on Chinese imports effective today. Markets are also pricing in multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, weighing on the US Dollar and supporting gold. However, rising US Treasury yields—fueled by speculation that China is dumping bonds in retaliation—could limit gains. Traders now await FOMC minutes and US inflation data later this week for fresh cues on the Fed’s rate path. The RBI’s decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% and shift its stance to ‘accommodative’ reflects growing confidence in the disinflationary trend and a clear pivot toward supporting growth. The recent drop in CPI inflation to 3.62% in February well below the RBI’s mid-point target of 4% provides ample room for easing. While wholesale inflation inched up slightly to 2.38%, it remains within a manageable range, reinforcing the view that inflationary pressures are abating. This policy shift is likely to lower borrowing costs, boost liquidity, and support domestic demand—especially as fiscal measures and improving rural prospects kick in InCred Alternatives announced the ﬁnal close of its maiden private equity fund - InCred Growth Partners Fund-I. The fund has secured capital commitments in excess of ₹575 crore, well above its target size of ₹500 crore (after exercising the greenshoe option), with support from large family oﬃces, UHNI and HNI investors Given the changing world order, with significant tariff imposition by the US, global growth is likely to be impacted, which may have an impact on Indian growth also. RBI has moderated its GDP growth projection for FY2025-26 by 20 bps to 6.50%, similarly moderated its headline inflation projection to 4.00% (vs previously 4.20%). Keeping this growth-inflation dynamic in mind, Monetary Policy Committee (MCPC) of RBI has decided to further cut the repo rate by 25 bps to 6% and change the stance to accommodative from neutral, indicating RBI will support the growth in this global uncertain times. We expect further 50 bps rate cut in next six months by RBI. Eternal Ltd, formerly known as Zomato Ltd, saw its shares decline by 1.84 per cent in early trading today, with the stock priced at ₹211.30 on BSE and ₹211.22 on NSE as of 10:25 am. The RBI’s 25 basis points repo rate cut to 6.00%, coupled with a unanimous shift in stance to “accommodative,” signals a decisive pivot towards growth. With inflation expectations anchored FY26 CPI forecast now revised lower to 4% the central bank has found room to support demand without risking macro stability. Governor Sanjay Malhotra’s tone struck a balance: confident on domestic resilience, yet cautious of global headwinds. The US tariff escalations, weaker dollar, and volatile crude prices pose potential risks to India’s exports and imported inflation. Yet, the RBI believes the domestic economy is well-positioned to weather these shocks. GDP growth for FY26 is projected at 6.5%, with strong traction in agriculture, a revival in manufacturing, and healthy urban consumption. System liquidity has turned surplus in April crossing ₹1.5 lakh crore offering further tailwind to credit growth. This rate cut will likely translate into lower EMIs, spur home loan demand, and eventually stimulate private capex. Structural reforms continue in parallel, with gold loan norms and expanded co-lending frameworks aimed at improving credit delivery and financial stability. Despite some moderation in net FDI due to repatriation, India’s long-term story remains intact reflected in sustained capital inflows and a robust banking sector. In short, the RBI has signaled its intent: revive growth while keeping inflation in check. For equity markets and investors, this marks the start of a more supportive monetary cycle, aligning well with India’s long-term structural growth trajectory. Nifty Bank opened today’s session lower at 50,487 versus yesterday’s close of 50,511. It is now hovering around 50,320, down 0.3 per cent.

Under normal market conditions, the previous day’s high of 22,700 and low of 22,270 would act as immediate resistance and support levels, respectively. A breakout above or below these levels could indicate direction of the market. The global seesaw continued, and GIFT Nifty points towards a tepid opening for Indian equities. For BankNifty, 50,800 serves as a crucial resistance level, while 50,050 remains support. With the MPC meeting outcome and weekly expiry in focus, increased volatility can be anticipated. Until a clear trend emerges, it is advisable to stay sideways.

Title: Big rebound in US stocks meets scepticism

NEW YORK - US stocks soared early on Tuesday after the biggest three-day rout in five years, fuelled by the most oversold conditions since the depths of the pandemic and optimism the Trump administration will water down its harsh tariff regime. The S&P 500 Index was up 3.34% as of 9.30am in New York, heading for its best day since November 2022. The cash index shed more than $5 trillion in three days, with Monday’s lows taking it more than 20% from its latest record. Rumours of a possible tariff delay sparked a massive rebound before the index found support at 5,000. Treasuries also reversed a rally, with the 10-year yield pushing back above 4%. “It’s a normal reflexive bounce you tend to see after plunging into oversold territory so quickly,” said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co. “We’re in an environment of extreme volatility, and that counts both the downside and upside.” The Cboe Volatility Index soared past 50 Monday and was still near 40 early Tuesday, well above its long-term average. More than 29 billion shares exchanged hands in yesterday’s wild ride. While stocks looked set to recover some Tuesday, the S&P 500 Index still remains 15% off its Feb. 19 peak. The 14-day relative strength index sank to 23 Monday — its lowest since 2020 and well below levels that historically suggest the S&P 500 is ripe for a bounce. Tuesday’s relief rally has forced big-money speculators to unwind bearish bets in droves as oversold stocks recovered, leaving many scrambling to unwind short positions, according hedge-fund manager Jim Roppel, founder of Roppel Capital Management. “This rebound feels very much like a telltale sign of a short squeeze,” Roppel said by phone. “But things are so brutally oversold it makes perfect sense for stocks to rally.” Adding to optimism Tuesday were comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said there is the potential for advantageous trade deals with major US trading partners. “I’ve seen the call list at the White House, and it’s substantial — we were having a discussion last night about which countries to prioritise,” Bessent said on CNBC Tuesday. “You are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits come forward very quickly.” China, however, was not among them, with Beijing saying late Monday it is prepared to “fight to the end”. Japan looks set to get priority in talks to roll back President Donald Trump’s duties, which are scheduled to kick in at 12.01am Wednesday Washington time. “The market is set up for a relief rally, while the ex-China headlines point to negotiations with Japan driving markets more than the retaliation risks with China and the European Union,” said Andrew Tyler, head of global market intelligence at JPMorgan Chase & Co. The chances of the stock market staging a tactical rebound have increased after the recent selloff, according to JPMorgan Chase trategists. Market technicians are monitoring The Arms Index, also called TRIN, an indicator that tracks the relationship between the number of stocks increasing or decreasing in price and the volume associated with those stocks. Readings below 0.5 suggest more demand for stocks and dictates how oversold the market is, while readings above 2.0 are a sign that investors are dumping equities and that stocks are overbought. On Monday, the index fell to 0.47, helping drive a short-term bounce for equities. After hedge funds sold global stocks last Thursday by the most since the first half of 2020, the group, along with long-only funds, were both net buyers Monday at $1.5 billion — the highest buy skew for hedge funds since January, according to Goldman Sachs. That comes after bets against the world’s largest exchange-traded fund — the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) — climbed to the highest since December on Monday.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Fundamental News and Triggers Risk-off mood triggers broad-based liquidation · Following the initial tariff pronouncements in the United States, investors thought that the worst of the uncertainty would pass. Instead, the reality has proven to be more severe. With tariffs exceeding forecasts and little indication of discussions, markets are rapidly pricing in the prospect of a worldwide recession, beginning with the United States. The risk-off mood has resulted in widespread liquidation across asset classes. Traditional safe havens like gold have not been spared. · Despite the short-term fear, the medium- to long-term outlook for gold remains favourable. The current climate, which is characterized by volatility, economic uncertainty, and central bank buying, tends to favour gold. · Fed Chair Jerome Powell repeated the Fed’s “wait-and-see” approach to the emerging volatility last week. The announcement of the March CPI this week will be key. If inflation data continues to soften, it may bolster the case for further rate reduction, thus reigniting demand for gold. Technical Triggers · The gold active June contract has significant support at $3000 (~Rs 87000). However, if prices remain below $3000, they may fall below $2900 (~Rs 84500). · Silver has excellent support at $29 (about Rs 87000). I do not believe Silver can remain below this level. Every decline below $30 (~Rs 89000) should be viewed as a buying opportunity for targets of $32 (~Rs 94000). 1. Sahaj Solar: PERFORMANCE UPDATE For FY25, the company’s standalone sales were INR 307 Cr, compared to INR 179 Cr in FY24, an increase of 71%. 2.

Company has also introduced a new range of high-quality tiles and stones, aligned with evolving market trends. The collection includes Glue Finish Tiles, Exotic Stones, Wooden Planks, and Next-Gen Quartz Stones, further enhancing its diverse product portfolio. 3. GP Eco: NEW PRODUCTS Company has launched new products, namely Off-Grid Inverters - Eco and Off-Grid Inverters - Premium, effective 6th Apr-25. 4. Techknowgreen: RESEARCH LABORATORY Company has successfully inaugurated its state of the art Research Laboratory 9.0 (TRL 9.0), dedicated to delivering scientific accuracy and reliability in environmental assessments.

Aluminium futures price falls sharply, bears in control with strong support at ₹230, resistance at ₹238, wait for breakout. “Despite the widespread fear gripping global markets, fueled in part by recent tariff announcements from President Trump, I believe we are nearing the end of a bottoming process in US markets. In my view, this final phase will give way to a sharp, euphoric rally that could mislead many into thinking stability has returned. While sentiment remains bearish, I foresee a surge in the S&P with potential upside targets of 6300–6700 over the next 6–8 months, marking what could be a classic blow-off top before a significant correction. This is a personal take based on current market signals, and while risks persist, I believe we’re on the cusp of a powerful, albeit temporary, upswing.” Bharat Electronics shares gained 3% on the NSE to ₹280.25 as at 11.11 am, after hitting a high of ₹288.

Commenting on the successful close of the Fund, Vivek said, “The close of IGPF-I marks a signiﬁcant milestone for InCred Alternatives and reﬂects the conﬁdence that the investors have placed in our strategy and approach.

Economy ▶\Economic Update ▶\April 7, 2025 ▶\ The swift shift in global sentiment, high market volatility, and fear of US/global recession amid the tariff shock cement our conviction of a 25bps cut this week, with possible change in stance to ‘accommodative’ to give directional easing bias. The fluid global dynamics will require the RBI to be nimble in managing any risk of tighter financial conditions, especially as the shock to sentiment/capital flows is likely to require higher risk premia from EMs. While the extent of trade war pain is unclear, monetary policy may have to do the heavy lifting in India. FY26 growth and inflation risk are skewed to the downside. However, we do not see RBI front-loading its ammunition, rather it may keep it ready for rain(ier) days. We will keep a lookout for any overhaul of the current liquidity framework in the near term and fiddle with non-conventional easing tools ahead apart from conventional easing, if the growth situation worsens or financial stability is disrupted. 1) Global uncertainty to dominate policy discussions Global sentiment has seen a shift and is rippling through the equity, bond, and FX markets in the thick of tariff shock and geopolitical concerns. Amid great policy and trade uncertainty, the overarching theme is increasing recessionary fears in the US and possibly even the global economy, led by macroeconomic shocks if these policies are sustained. Over this period, the Fed’s policy choices will become complicated with too many moving parts, as the US moves over time/swiftly from stagflation to recession. However, the eventual response will be counter-cyclical. Market pricing for Fed cuts has increased to five cuts from two, while market recession probability has crossed 60%. EM central banks, including the RBI, may follow suit eventually, but will also need to confront various push-and-pull factors via the financial market route, even with increasing easing biases. We believe the readiness of possible policy tools would dominate policy discussion within the MPC. 2) Liquidity management to remain swift amid global sell-off The tariff shock has increased our conviction that the RBI will cut 25bps this week, with further easing ahead. This could also be accompanied by a change in stance to ‘accommodative’ from ‘neutral’ to give directional easing bias. The aim would be to facilitate faster monetary policy transmission – something that the RBI has evidently displayed by the swift liquidity injection. System liquidity has swung from the super high deficit of Rs3.2trn in Jan-25 to a surplus of Rs800bn by end Mar-25. This has been partly helped by a durable liquidity injection of nearly Rs6trn in 4QFY25, followed by another round of Rs800bn OMO calendar in April. We see 1QFY26E to be in surplus liquidity, led by ~30% higher-than-budgeted RBI dividend and a sharp seasonal moderation in currency in circulation, albeit countered by i) continuous need for spot FX intervention amid tariff led volatility – May is historically poor for the rupee, and ii) maturity of RBI’s heavy forward net short FX book, unless rolled over. The RBI is likely to assure prompt actions amid any tightening in financial conditions. 3) India’s FY26 growth and inflation risk skewed to the downside It may be too early to consider actual forecast changes, but to state the obvious: risks to the RBI’s FY26 growth of 6.7% are materially downward. This will emanate from a much higher risk of a US/global recession if such global tariffs are maintained. The disinflationary impulse for Indian industry could emanate from lower global commodity prices/supply glut of goods. Asia has been hit much more than India on tariffs, and India is less export-exposed vs EM Asia, but is unlikely to be non-synced with EM Asia on the cyclical downturn. China’s survival response to the massive tariff blow will matter for India, amid its excess industrial capacity and dumping in the world/Asia. FX as a counter tool may be used by China, and will have FX implications for rest of Asia/India. 4) RBI to keep policy options handy amid global uncertainty The extent to which this global trade war could stretch is unclear. Monetary policy may have to do the heavy lifting in India by being more countercyclical than fiscal this year. Implications for India could stem from both, global financial market disruptions and real sector hit. While there is scope for negotiation and de-escalation, we think this could be a pivotal turning point for EM assets in coming months, as the shock to sentiment/capital flows is likely to require higher risk premia. The RBI may not want to use all the ammunition too soon, given fluid global markets, and may thus not frontload cuts in April. Options like i) non-conventional easing in the form of easier regulatory (lending) norms, ii) lower daily CRR requirement for banks to sub 90%, ii) sterilized INR management, etc may be used, if needed. Near-term, however, there may be some overhaul of the liquidity framework in favor of daily VRRs instead of 14-day VRR, as the primary tool for easier ALM and liquidity management for banks. Gift Nifty’s 331-point jump comes after a sharp market sell-off yesterday, where India VIX spiked 66% to 22.79, reflecting a collapse in bullish sentiment amid global turmoil. The catalyst? Trump’s aggressive tariff stance, triggering fears of a full-blown trade war with China hiking tariffs to 34%. Until tensions cool, Nifty may face continued pressure. Traders are watching for the RBI’s potential 25bps rate cut on April 9th and corporate earnings led by TCS on April 10th. Key support for Nifty lies at 21,281. Meanwhile, bearish bets are on stocks like ADANI ENTERPRISES, OBEROI REALTY, and M&M, with Adani seen slipping from overbought zones.

The most reliable bulls on Wall Street are ringing the alarm bells as President Trump's tariffs plunge markets into chaos. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory on Monday, following the footsteps of the Nasdaq 100, which closed in bear territory on Friday. The three-day decline has grown to as much as 14%. These charts show just how painful the market implosion has been. The S&P 500 peaked at 6,144 on February 19, putting the bear market "line in the sand" for the benchmark index at about 4,915. The index hit an intraday low of 4,835 on Monday. What were the stock market's biggest winners over the past decade turned into the biggest losers so far this year. Year-to-date, Tesla is down 43%, Nvidia is down 30%, Apple is down 27%, Alphabet is down 23%, Amazon is down 21%, Microsoft is down 16%, and Meta Platforms is down 14%. The Hang Seng Index plunged 13.2% on Monday, its biggest one-day decline since 1997. Investors aggressively sold shares on fear of an escalating trade war between the US and China. On Friday, China retaliated against the US with its own tariffs on US imports. Oil prices were already depressed over the last year, but the rollback of OPEC production cuts and fears of an economic slowdown have hammered US and global crude prices, with the commodity down 15% in three days. A potential recession would reduce demand for the commodity just as supply is increasing. Meanwhile, some of Wall Street's most enduring bulls have been forced to change their tunes as the sell-off ramps up. Here's what the three commentators have to say amid the market chaos: "If these tariffs (in current forms/rates) hold there is no debate… it would set the US tech world back a decade in our opinion while China is the clear winner… and we see no debate," Ives said in a note on Saturday. Ives has historically been an ardent tech bull, able to see the silver lining even in some of the most dire market scenarios over the last few years. But even for him, the trade war is hard to sugarcoat. "In one day this tariff policy if enacted will create an upside down supply chain, massive costs, major Cap-Ex delays due to uncertainty, and slow down US tech innovation… not a debate." "These reciprocal tariffs (trade deficit converted into some odd calculation) implemented would cause an economic Armageddon and stop the US tech world in its tracks...and wipe out a bright future ahead in one global policy mistake that will reverse US tech dominance in our view." "The resulting market fury is not due to a reaction to a trade war, but rather, in our view, the fact the White House broke a core covenant of capitalism — stable and predictable regulatory environment," Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a note on Sunday. "The White House's sudden and aggressive executive orders left companies without the predictability they need to recoup capital investments, prompting vocal corporate backlash." Lee has often used stock market declines as moments to highlight opportunities for investors, but not this time. He highlighted the pain set to hit companies like Apple, which Lee noted is facing a 54% increase in production costs as a result of the tariffs on China. The result would be effectively nationalizing a third of its assets by redirecting its gross margins into tariff revenues." "On Saturday morning, I nearly gagged on my bagel listening to a CNN interview with Peter Navarro. The President's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing declared that the tariffs are aimed at benefiting Main Street, not Wall Street. Other senior officials in the Trump administration, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have said the same," Ed Yardeni said in a note on Saturday. "I have news for them: Wall Street is Main Street. Wall Street matters a great deal to Main Street. Main Street owns lots of stocks in American corporations that are facing massive disruptions as a result of Trump Tariffs 2.0." "The President wasn't negotiating trade deals this weekend. He was too busy relaxing on the links." Jump to
