Title: 3 Mistakes Smart People Make Investing In AI Stocks

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the strongest trends on Wall Street in 2025. I began trading in the 1990’s and the AI trend reminds me of the early stages of the dot-com boom during the late 1990s (in excitement, hype, and lofty expectations). When we look back in history the creation of the internet will likely go down with the same impact as fire, the wheel, or the printing press. Now, investors are wondering will AI have the same impact? The short answer is, only time will tell. In the rush to find the next big monster stock, many investors are repeating old patterns that have historically ended with disappointment. The AI revolution is real, but investing successfully in it requires discipline, patience, proper risk management, and rational analysis. Remember, most dot com stocks are not around today. The same is true for other major technological disruptions like the airlines, railroads, and countless other examples. Here are three common mistakes I see smart people making when they invest in AI stocks. Mistake 1: Chasing Hype Without FundamentalsThe allure of the next big winner is extremely powerful and that causes many smart people to make emotional, not rational, decisions with their money. One common emotional mistake I see people make time and time again is thinking this time might be different and they jump in, after a big move up, and chase a big winning stock. The solution here is to have a plan, respect risk, and remember, this time is not different. After you buy a stock, it can only do one of three things, go up, down, or sideways. It doesn’t matter if it is an AI stock, gold stock, or railroad. All stocks go up, down, or sideways. Even great companies that are around today that survived the dot com boom and bust, had huge swings in their prices and those swings would knock out most investors. It’s easy to get caught up in the hype and excitement. It happens to most people but respecting risk, focusing on fundamentals, and making rational decisions are keys to long-term success in the market. It is also important to note that AI is full of visionaries, bold promises, and captivating stories. It’s easy to be pulled in by exciting headlines about startups developing new AI models, or tech giants unveiling massive investments in training computers to think “like humans.” Just like in the dot-com boom, the stories feel groundbreaking. The problem? Many companies riding the AI hype lose money. Some are even startups with barely any revenue. The same was true during the dot com boom and subsquent bust. Typically, what happens is investors pile in hoping to capture outsized returns, but they often end up buying into businesses that can’t support their lofty valuations and ultimately lose money when the stock falls. The history lesson: dot-com déjà vuIn 1999, companies with “.com” in their names raised billions, even when they had no plan to generate lasting cash flow. When the bubble burst, most collapsed. A similar pattern can’t be ruled out for AI. While some winners will emerge and dominate, many current players may fade into irrelevance or bankruptcy. What fundamentals still matter in AIA lesson often forgotten during speculative booms is that traditional financial metrics matter. Cash flow, balance sheet strength, and proven demand should anchor investment decisions. For chipmakers like NVIDIA that already generate substantial profits, the AI boom supports a strong existing foundation. But for early-stage firms, the risks can outweigh the potential if investors ignore fundamentals. Investor takeaway: Always separate visionary storytelling from hard financial data. A revolutionary technology is not a guarantee of revolutionary profits. Mistake 2: Overconcentration in One or Two Big NamesThe temptation to “go all in” is real and is another common mistake I see very smart people make in various market cycles. NVIDIA’s meteoric rise has transformed it into one of the best-performing stocks of the decade, largely due to AI. Its chips are essential for training AI models, and its revenue has exploded as demand for data center hardware soars. For many investors, the temptation is to put a disproportionate share of their portfolio into one strong idea. The temptation is there for just about any stock, it especially when the stock is going up. The same happened in past cycles. During the dot com boom, names like Intel, Cisco, Qualcomm, and Microsoft raced higher. During the smartphone revolution, it was Apple. Those who bet heavily on a single titan enjoyed enormous returns—but timing and risk management matter. Investors who bought those names at their peak lost a lot of money during the dot com crash. Investor takeaway: AI is bigger than one or two companies. Proper risk management and proper diversification across the value chain can help reduce risk while maintaining upside potential as long as AI stocks remain in favor. Mistake 3: Ignoring Cycles and ValuationsThe myth of endless growth and this time is different are very powerful.Boom cycles make it feel like the good times will never end. In 2023 and 2024, AI fueled explosive stock runs, with market leaders adding billions to their market caps in months. The narrative was simple: AI will reshape everything, and therefore valuations don’t matter. That mindset is very dangerous. No matter how transformative a technology, growth slows and expectations reset. Even industry titans experience profit cycles, regulatory pressures, and increased competition. Assuming AI leaders will post quarter after quarter of uninterrupted growth ignores how markets function. Why valuation discipline matters in AIWhen investors pay 100-400+ times earnings, they are essentially betting that hypergrowth will continue for years without fail. That leaves no margin of safety. If growth merely slows rather than collapses, stocks priced for perfection can still fall by double digits. Tesla, for example, soared on future-oriented narratives about electrification. Yet periods of slower sales or increased competition triggered sharp corrections in the stock, even though the long-term thesis hasn’t disappeared. AI stocks face the same risk: growing markets, but volatile share prices. Liquidity, rates, and market sentimentAnother overlooked factor is the broader economic cycle. AI companies thrive in markets with plentiful liquidity, like when interest rates are low and growth capital is abundant. Markets and the economy move in cycles. Investors who ignore this reality may get caught in market downturns that can be far more brutal than expected. Investor takeaway: Even the best AI stocks can tumble if valuations get too stretched. A disciplined entry point, and strong respect for risk, matters as much as believing in the long-term story. Putting It All Together: An Investor PlaybookAI is unlike any other technological wave because of its scope, touching everything from healthcare and finance to defense and entertainment. Yet human behavior in markets has not changed, and the same investor mistakes recur. To avoid missteps, investors can build a playbook: Prioritize fundamentals: Separate hype from balance sheet strength. Profitable companies with durable moats offer safer long-term prospects. Diversify exposure: History has taught me that it is usually a good idea not to put all your money in one “hot” stock. Respect cycles: Recognize AI leaders can endure corrections when valuations run too hot—patience, timing, and risk managemnet always matter. Stay adaptive: The winners today may not be winners tomorrow. New stocks come all the time and shifts in regulation can disrupt even dominant players. Measure conviction against risk: Ask whether your excitement is based on headlines—or on sustainable advantages. Conclusion: Riding the AI Wave WiselyInvestors are right to be excited about AI. It will likely be as transformative as the internet, smartphones, or electrification. But the stock market has a way of turning great technologies into poor investments when enthusiasm divorces from discipline. The good news: by avoiding these three mistakes—chasing hype without fundamentals, overconcentrating in one name, and ignoring valuation cycles—investors can improve their odds of capturing long-term gains without succumbing to short-term pain. There is a very strong chance that over time, AI will create trillion-dollar companies. It will also produce plenty of losers. The key is remembering that markets ultimately reward patient, rational investors who separate stories from substance.

Title: Seoul Exchange, One of Only Two Licensed Platforms For Unlisted Securities, Will Exclusively Use Story To Settle Tokenized RWAs

Seoul, South Korea, September 22nd, 2025, Chainwire Seoul Exchange, One of Only Two Licensed Platforms For Unlisted Securities, Will Exclusively Use Story To Settle Tokenized RWAs Partnership set to bring programmable assets to Korea’s $450b crypto market, the world’s second largest by trading volume Seoul Exchange and Story Protocol have entered into an agreement to build Korea’s first dedicated blockchain exchange for tokenized cultural and intellectual property assets. The collaboration outlines how Seoul Exchange will launch a regulated RWA trading platform powered entirely by Story’s blockchain infrastructure for the next 3 years. Seoul Exchange is a fintech company that provides brokerage services for unlisted stocks of startups and venture companies through its unlisted securities trading platform “Seoul Exchange.” It is one of only two platforms officially selected by the Korean government to operate under the financial regulatory sandbox. Seoul Exchange has received investment from leading Korean and global VCs such as Hashed, SoftBank Ventures, Capstone Partners, and POSCO Technology Investment. Under the agreement, Seoul Exchange will use Story as the sole infrastructure provider for registering and settling tokenized offerings. For an initial term 3 years, all listings on the exchange ranging from music IP and webtoons to patents and private securities, will be recorded on Story’s network, leveraging its composable architecture and native $IP token economy. IP is expected to become Korea’s leading real-world asset (RWA) category, with Story positioned as the exclusive chain for Seoul Exchange’s IP tokenization. Story is a Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built to make intellectual property programmable. Backed by $136 million from a16z, Polychain, and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has quickly become a leading infrastructure for tokenized IP. Korea is home to some of the world’s most successful creative exports, but monetizing IP remains limited to insiders. This new trading platform aims to change that. By bringing IP onchain, Story and Seoul Exchange are unlocking a new class of fractional, transparent, and globally accessible digital securities. Global IP is valued at over $80 trillion, yet most of it remains illiquid and inaccessible. This partnership aims to unlock IP and other real-world assets (RWAs) via blockchain, allowing global investors to own, trade, and earn from high-value creative works. Korean storytellers have captured the world’s imagination. Global hits like K-POP Demon Hunter became Netflix’s most-popular film of all time with 236 million views in the first nine weeks. Parasite won Best Picture at the Oscars. Squid Game became Netflix’s most-watched show. Baby Shark is a global phenomenon. But behind this success lies a structural problem: creators rarely retain ownership or share in the long-term upside. Platforms like Netflix own the IP. Studios operate on thin margins. Even as Korean content goes global, the value flows elsewhere.This imbalance has sparked growing debate in Korea, with many voices calling for a new model that allows creators to break free from reliance on upfront financing and pre-production deals. Story is introducing such an alternative through content tokenization. By enabling global fans to directly participate in fundraising, production companies can retain ownership of their IP and instead engage in distribution agreements that ensure fairer and more sustainable revenue models. This approach not only protects creators’ rights but also opens the door to a new, fan-driven economy in entertainment. The platform will combine retail accessibility with institutional-grade compliance under Korean regulations. Should a Korean won-pegged stablecoin be approved by regulators, the platform is designed to support its integration it may be integrated for native currency settlement, further aligning with domestic financial infrastructure. Tokenized content, including music rights, game universes, can be listed and traded by retail and institutional investors alike, all within Korea’s evolving STO regulatory sandbox. Story Protocol is the world’s first Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for IP. It enables IP to be registered, licensed, and monetized in real time, embedding royalties and usage terms directly into the tokenized representation of creative assets. Backed by investors including a16z, Polychain, Hashed and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has already rapidly expanded its ecosystem and onboarded a diverse music collectives, DeFi protocols, and global entertainment IPs. For example, Story has already begun tokenizing major K-culture IP, including the music rights of leading K-pop artists (BTS, BLACKPINK, Psy, BIGBANG) and global artists (Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus) Seoul Exchange’s integration makes Story the de facto infrastructure for Korea’s next wave of tokenized RWAs, positioning it as the blockchain gateway for cultural capital. This partnership bridges Korea’s booming cultural industries with the world’s capital markets. The platform will prioritize assets with strong fan engagement and long-term value potential, and will also support future integrations with financial products, remix licenses, and governance layers, bringing programmability to previously static IP rights. JD Yang, CEO, Seoul Exchange: “Through this collaboration, Seoul Exchange has further strengthened the stability and trust in the process of building our STO exchange. We aim to become Korea’s leading STO exchange through a differentiated tokenization model centered on IP and content.” Seung-yoon “SY” Lee, Co-founder & CEO, Story Protocol: “We see this as a landmark step in making Korea’s world-class cultural IP accessible to global investors. Story enables creators and platforms like Seoul Exchange to go beyond traditional licensing models to build liquidity, loyalty, and monetization around programmable IP. Intellectual property is the largest untapped asset class in the world, worth over $80 trillion, and with Korea now the second-largest crypto trading market in the world, the opportunity to pioneer new asset classes is massive. This partnership brings us one step closer to unlocking that value at global scale. With this move, Story will be one of only two chains powering RWAs in Korea, the second-largest crypto market in the world, confirming IP’s place at the center of Korea’s next blockchain growth cycle.” About Story Story is a Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built to make intellectual property programmable. Backed by $136 million from a16z, Polychain, and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has quickly become a leading infrastructure for tokenized IP. The network enables creators, developers, enterprises, and AI labs to register content as on-chain assets with embedded rights, turning media, data, and AI-generated works into legally enforceable digital property. By bridging the gap between outdated legal frameworks and the realities of the AI era, Story makes it possible to track provenance, automate licensing, and unlock new markets for ideas. As the foundation for IP’s evolution into an internet-native asset class, Story powers a more open, equitable, and composable creative economy. Copyright © 2025. All Rights Reserved By Media Fuse LTD

Title: What’s Up with the Crazy Flow Volatility at ARK’s ETFs?
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/investing-strategies-etf/whats-up-with-the-crazy-flow-volatility-at-arks-etfs/

Competing theories have been proposed to explain why billions of dollars have gone into and out of several ARK ETFs in recent weeks. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Something strange has been happening to several of ARK’s ETFs recently: Assets have been spiking like blood sugar after a pumpkin spice latte. There has been speculation about the causes, but no one, other than the unidentified traders, knows why. One explanation is that the activity is merely heartbeat trades that were used to wash taxes. Another is that a zealous bunch of retail investors wanted exposure to a few IPOs. But the most interesting theory, from the Financial Times’ Robin Wigglesworth, is that someone gamed the creation and redemption process to ultimately pocket a cool $21 million in just a matter of days. Just before the Bullish IPO in August, someone could have borrowed shares of constituent stocks that are in the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and used the holdings to create about 70 million ETF shares, Wigglesworth wrote. After ARKK bought Bullish shares in the IPO, the person or group seemingly redeemed their ETF shares for the constituents, able to then sell the Bullish stock at a premium, he said. A twist is that the same thing appeared to have happened ahead of Klarna’s Sept. 10 IPO, “with one crucial, hilarious twist … ARKK didn’t actually invest in the Klarna IPO!” Wigglesworth noted. If the theory is correct, it would be an uncommon approach to profiting within ETFs, said Todd Sohn, senior ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities. Many ETFs don’t buy stocks at the time of an IPO, he said. “This activity is happening outside the fund in the primary market through the APs/market makers; they are bearing the cost of the activity.” Other ETF shareholders are insulated from the effects of such tactics, he said. Regardless of what’s happening, it’s interesting. “It’s an incredibly unique situation,” Morningstar principal US equity strategist Robby Greengold said. “Three of ARK’s ETFs have been swept up in these violent flow patterns that don’t really happen anywhere else. This is fascinating to watch unfold, but it’s also extremely difficult to know who’s behind it.” There is a potential downside for other investors in the ARK funds, as the ETFs significantly increased their cash allocations after the share creations. The flow activities showed dramatic changes: Low Point in the Arc: As of Friday, the data didn’t show a massive exit from ARKK, and what’s happening isn’t clear. ARK did not comment on any of the recent flow activity. “Effectively, it’s dilutive to any of ARK’s pre-existing fund holders,” Greengold said of the big fluctuations that hiked cash allocations. “That post-IPO pop wasn’t felt as strongly as it otherwise would have been.” Big, multinational firms have regional expertise and may be able to swallow the costs, but smaller companies will have a harder time. Investors in YieldMax ETFs may have lost about 11% per year since late 2022, according to a recent Morningstar report. ETF uptake varies significantly across generations. This gap presents a major growth opportunity for the industry. The Federal Reserve’s decision may not have been a surprise, but ripple effects are already being felt across the industry. Generic listing standards for crypto exchange-traded products could open the floodgates for ETPs beyond spot Bitcoin and Ethereum. The New York-based firm is planning to launch some of the first tokenized ETFs, according to a report. The company filled a hole in its fixed-income ETF line — but the timing may not be ideal, given relatively low yields in junk bonds relative to Treasurys, one observer said. Reckoner Capital Management, which added its Leveraged AAA CLO ETF in July, has aspirations of building out a global credit business. As new ETFs launch at breakneck speed, expensive products are raking in revenue. The firm’s founder claims a new ETF using fundamentals beyond market-cap weighting to determine holdings is the next big thing. Funds holding large financial institutions have significantly outperformed broad market indices this year. The exchange could start offering tokenization of securities, including exchange-traded products and stocks, next year. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Stocks Over Spot: The Case For Buying Bitcoin Treasury Companies Instead Of BTC
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/the-case-for-buying-bitcoin-treasury/
Time Published: 2025-09-21T00:00:34Z

Bitcoin is among the world’s most important assets, but owning it directly is not the only way to get exposure. A growing number of public companies hold massive amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. For investors buying these stocks, it can sometimes offer even greater upside than holding BTC itself. In a thought-provoking post on X, Adam Livingston, author of the Bitcoin Age and the Great Harvest, offers a compelling argument for why investors should consider buying the stock of Bitcoin treasury companies, rather than just BTC itself. His perspective goes beyond a simple leveraged play and speaks to a long-term vision of a new financial infrastructure built on a BTC foundation. Livingston’s thesis is that a new paradigm-shifting financial infrastructure built over the coming years will take Bitcoin to $100-200 trillion BTC market, supporting an equal magnitude of Bitcoin-denominated credit and equity. This new infrastructure would enable global transactions at light speed on open ledgers, providing everyone with a censorship-resistant, inflation-proof yield stream. The key takeaway from the recent unconference is that this infrastructure needs to be built because it is where solving complex issues, such as custody, compliance, and distribution across different jurisdictions, comes into play. It also involves creating products that cater to traditional investors who may not want or need a volatile, infinite-duration asset like Bitcoin itself. Thus, these products can strip away volatility, manage duration, or FX risk, allowing institutions and individuals to gain the spread and recycle profits back into BTC collateral. However, Livingston argues that Bitcoin can enable the exact instruments they do want. If BTC is to reach $1,000,000, it will require a robust financial infrastructure to funnel global capital into the asset. Crypto analyst Rajatsonfinance has highlighted a contrarian perspective on Bitcoin investing, urging people to abandon the common strategy of waiting for a bear market to start buying. Instead, he advocates for a more proactive approach centered on value creation and consistent accumulation. According to Rajatsonfinance, trying to time the market is a flawed and often unsuccessful endeavor. He argues that waiting for a crash could be used to build skills and create value in the real world. His primary advice is to focus on earning more money and then exchanging that income for Bitcoin, whether by selling services for dollars and converting them or by accepting BTC directly as payment. The analyst emphasized that if executed with a solid idea, passion, and consistent effort, it can lead to a far more significant BTC stack than one could ever accumulate by trying to buy the dip. He suggests that a successful business or a well-executed side hustle has the potential to generate far more than a modest $10,000 to $15,000, which would result in a holding far exceeding 0.1 BTC.

Title: BlockDAG Leads the Pack: The Best Crypto Presale of 2025 Holders Can’t Ignore

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. The crypto market is entering one of its most exciting phases yet, and presales are at the heart of this momentum. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate headlines, the real upside often comes from presales that combine utility, community growth, and visionary roadmaps. Among the flood of projects vying for attention, a few stand out for their strong numbers and ambitious goals. BlockDAG, in particular, is rewriting the rules of what a presale can achieve, while others, such as BlockchainFX, JetBolt, and Little Pepe, are building strong momentum. Below, we break down why these coins are generating hype and why BlockDAG is emerging as the clear frontrunner. BlockDAG is proving to be one of the most explosive presales the crypto market has seen in years. With nearly $410 million already raised and more than 26.3 billion BlockDAG coins sold, this project is racing toward its ambitious $600 million goal at record speed. Right now, the coin sits at just $0.0013 in Batch 30, but this golden entry point won’t be around for long as it ends in the next 24 hours. Once it hits its confirmed listing price of $0.05, current holders are guaranteed a 3,746% ROI from day one of trading. But the hype isn’t just numbers on paper. BlockDAG already has 312,000+ holders, has started shipping over 19,900 ASIC miners worldwide, and is powering a massive base of 3 million X1 mobile miners actively running every day. Add in the soon-to-launch Awakening Testnet, which will showcase its technology in real time, and it’s clear this project has execution, not just promises. BlockchainFX has already raised $7.24 million from more than 9,000 participants, making it one of the most promising best crypto presale contenders in the fintech app sector. At a token price of $0.023, early holders are securing a steep discount before its official $0.05 launch price. What sets BFX apart is its “super app” positioning: it connects crypto, stocks, forex, and commodities in a single trading ecosystem. With a beta app already live and presale bonuses, including a 30% token boost for early holders, BlockchainFX is gaining strong momentum. JetBolt is another project generating hype as a fresh best crypto presale option. Built on the SKALE network, it offers zero gas fees, AI-powered utilities, staking rewards, and scalable smart contracts. However, details around tokenomics and pricing remain scarce. While the buzz is strong, JetBolt is still in a very early stage, meaning the upside could be significant if execution follows through, but so could the risks. Little Pepe has taken the meme coin space by storm, raising over $25 million in presale funds. Now priced at $0.0021 in Stage 12, the project has already sold out over 15 billion tokens across earlier rounds. Unlike many meme tokens, LILPEPE runs on its own Ethereum-compatible Layer-2, featuring near-instant transactions, zero trading tax, and anti-sniper bot protection. With additional incentives like mega giveaways and staking rewards, analysts project this presale could deliver 25× returns post-listing, making it another hot contender for the best crypto presale list. The search for the best crypto presale of 2025 is heating up, and holders have no shortage of options. BlockchainFX is building a multi-asset super app, JetBolt promises next-gen scalability, and Little Pepe combines meme power with serious Layer-2 utility. Each has potential, but none match the scale, adoption, and guaranteed ROI of BlockDAG. With nearly $410 million raised, a $0.0013 entry price, and a locked-in 3,746% ROI at launch, BlockDAG is emerging as the best crypto presale opportunity. BlockDAG’s real-world adoption: 312,000+ holders, 19,900 ASIC miners being shipped, and 3 million X1 app users, shows momentum that most projects never achieve. In 2025, the winners will be the buyers who recognized early that BlockDAG was not just another presale, but a game-changing crypto revolution.
