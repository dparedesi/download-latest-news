Title: Estimating MicroStrategy’s Timeline to 1 Million Bitcoin

Current Bitcoin Holdings of MicroStrategy MicroStrategy (now rebranded as Strategy Inc. as of early 2025) is the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. As of September 2025, the company holds approximately 638,460 BTC in its treasury . This massive stash – roughly 3% of all bitcoins that will ever exist – reflects an aggressive accumulation strategy that began in 2020 and has accelerated in recent years. MicroStrategy’s Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, has made it clear the company views Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset and has no intention of selling. As Saylor famously stated: “Never. No. We’re not sellers. We’re only acquiring and holding bitcoin… that’s our strategy.” This long-term “HODL” stance underpins MicroStrategy’s goal of continually increasing its bitcoin holdings regardless of market fluctuations. Historical Bitcoin Acquisition Timeline MicroStrategy’s path to 1 million BTC can be understood by looking at how rapidly its holdings have grown: Summary of Holdings by Year: MicroStrategy’s BTC stack grew from ~70k in 2020 to ~447k by end of 2024, and ~638k by late 2025. This exponential trajectory underscores the company’s increasing conviction (and available capital) for Bitcoin acquisitions. Public Statements on Future Bitcoin Plans MicroStrategy’s leadership has been very transparent about their long-term commitment to Bitcoin. Key insights from executives include: In summary, all public communications from MicroStrategy’s team convey unwavering bullishness on Bitcoin and an intention to keep buying for years to come. The company positions itself as a pioneer of the “Bitcoin standard” for corporations, frequently evangelizing Bitcoin’s virtues to other CEOs (e.g. via its annual Bitcoin for Corporations conferences). MicroStrategy’s message: they’re all-in on Bitcoin and still just getting started. Financial Capacity for Future Purchases How can MicroStrategy actually fund a march to 1 million BTC? The company’s financial strategy provides the answer: raise capital aggressively and plow it into Bitcoin. Key elements of their financing capacity include: Bottom Line: MicroStrategy has built an extensive capital arsenal for future Bitcoin purchases – including authorized but unused capacity in the tens of billions of dollars across common and preferred stock programs. In total, by mid-2025 the company had already raised about $47 billion in equity capital over five years for its Bitcoin strategy, and it signaled plans to raise yet more. With these financing mechanisms, MicroStrategy theoretically has the firepower to acquire the remaining Bitcoin needed to reach 1 million BTC (though practical and market constraints, discussed next, will influence the timing). Market Conditions Influencing the Acquisition Rate Several market and macroeconomic factors will affect how quickly MicroStrategy can continue buying Bitcoin and reach 1,000,000 BTC: In summary, favorable market conditions – a rising Bitcoin price, strong investor appetite for MicroStrategy’s stock/preferreds, and accessible capital – would enable MicroStrategy to keep an aggressive pace. Unfavorable conditions – a stagnant or falling BTC price, shareholder fatigue, or tight credit/low equity premiums – could slow the pace. The company’s recent behavior (continuing to buy despite some criticism) suggests that as long as they can secure funding, they will push forward, even if it means weathering short-term stock volatility. Investors should thus expect MicroStrategy to remain a bold buyer, adjusting speed as needed but not fundamentally altering course. Timeline Projections to 1,000,000 BTC Taking into account MicroStrategy’s current holdings (~638k BTC) and its historical and potential acquisition rates, we can outline scenarios for how long it might take to reach 1,000,000 bitcoins. Below we consider a Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive case, based on different annual purchase rates. These scenarios are illustrative – the actual outcome will depend on the factors discussed (market conditions, financing success, etc.): The table below summarizes these scenarios with a simple year-by-year estimate of total BTC holdings, assuming a starting point of ~640k BTC (around late 2025 levels) and constant annual purchase rates in each case: Table: Projected Bitcoin holdings under different annual accumulation scenarios. Bold entries indicate crossing 1,000,000 BTC. Under the Conservative path, MicroStrategy would not hit 1 million BTC within this 5-year window (reaching ~840k by 2029, and only in the early 2030s would it cross seven figures). The Moderate path achieves the milestone by about 2029. The Aggressive path has MicroStrategy breezing past 1 million as early as 2027, and potentially holding 1.3+ million BTC by 2029 if that pace were sustained. It’s important to stress that these are simplified projections. In reality, MicroStrategy’s annual BTC accumulation has varied wildly – from just +8k in 2022 to +234k in 2024 – depending on market opportunities. The company tends to be opportunistic, as seen in late 2024 when it accelerated buys during a Bitcoin price surge and favorable stock conditions. Future purchases will likely come in spurts rather than a steady linear rate. For example, MicroStrategy might conduct another big raise during the next crypto bull run (if Bitcoin, say, pushes well beyond $100k) and add a large block of coins in a short time. Alternatively, if the market is lukewarm, it might accumulate more slowly quarter by quarter. Conclusion How long might it take MicroStrategy to acquire 1,000,000 bitcoins? Based on current holdings (~638k BTC) and past trends, it could be as soon as 2–3 years in a bullish, capital-rich scenario, or closer to 7–10 years under more cautious conditions. MicroStrategy’s own actions suggest a strong desire to reach this milestone sooner rather than later. The company has explicitly built the capacity to raise tens of billions more dollars and has demonstrated willingness to deploy huge sums into Bitcoin at every opportunity. As of early 2025, management said they had already executed $20 billion of a planned $42 billion capital deployment for Bitcoin – well ahead of schedule – indicating an accelerated timeline. Crucially, MicroStrategy’s ability to continue at an aggressive pace will hinge on external factors: the trajectory of Bitcoin’s price, investor tolerance for its high-risk strategy, and macroeconomic liquidity. The firm’s stock performance and status (e.g., inclusion in major indices, or competition from a Bitcoin ETF) will also influence how much fuel it can add to the fire. So far, Saylor and his team have been adept at navigating these factors, keeping MicroStrategy at the forefront of Bitcoin accumulation. If Bitcoin’s market remains strong and MicroStrategy retains investor confidence, reaching 1,000,000 BTC by the latter half of this decade is plausible under an aggressive strategy. In any case, MicroStrategy has cemented itself as a unique corporate entity – essentially a Bitcoin holding company – and its quest for 1 million BTC exemplifies the boldest expression of the “Bitcoin standard” in the corporate world. Every quarter brings them closer to that historic figure. Given the company’s track record and statements, it wouldn’t be surprising if MicroStrategy ultimately becomes the first corporation to hold one million bitcoins, whenever that day comes.

Title: Tempus AI: Is TEM Stock A 10x Growth Story?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/12/tempus-ai-is-tem-stock-a-10x-growth-story/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T13:59:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Great news for Tempus AI stock! The company has just received FDA approval for an upgraded version of its Tempus Pixel platform — a cardiac imaging system that uses advanced AI to deliver highly accurate images of a patient’s heart. Remember when we talked about TEM last month and how it might double to $130? Well, it’s already climbed more than 33% in just a month. But here’s the surprising part: the opportunity for Tempus AI may not stop at a 2x return. It could potentially be a 10x story or more. Sounds too good to be true? It’s not—once you understand what Tempus AI actually does. Think of Tempus as the “Google of healthcare data.” The company has built the world’s largest library of clinical and molecular data and uses AI to turn this information into insights for precision medicine. While it started in oncology, it has since expanded into cardiology, radiology, and even mental health. Tempus doesn’t just gather data—it transforms it into real-time insights that help doctors make better treatment decisions. It’s like giving physicians a supercomputer that analyzes millions of patient cases to recommend the best care for each individual. Let’s talk numbers. Tempus has grown its revenue at an average rate of 50% over the past three years. In Q2 2025 alone, revenue grew 90% year-over-year, and the company raised its full-year outlook to $1.26 billion—over 80% growth from last year. Looking for more – revenue is expected to double over the next three years. The company is also nearing EBITDA profitability. This isn’t just growth—it’s accelerating growth with improving margins. Of course, these strong numbers come with the volatility typical of high-growth stocks. If you’re looking for upside with less risk than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with over 91% returns since inception. Also see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Tempus AI’s potential for explosive growth isn’t wishful thinking—it’s supported by solid fundamentals. Beyond profits, there’s a bigger reason Tempus AI must grow: healthcare justice. AI can help correct systemic disparities in care that affect underserved communities. Some populations face higher mortality from certain diseases due to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, creating major burdens. By using AI to tailor treatments and improve accuracy, Tempus could help close these gaps—making precision medicine accessible to everyone, not just patients at top hospitals. This mission could fuel broad social support. Let’s crunch the numbers. Tempus is projected to make about $1.26 billion this year. Imagine it scales revenue 15x. Of course, not overnight, think long term. With the AI healthcare market forecast to top $800 billion, could Tempus claim just 2.5% of that? It’s possible, especially if it captures more R&D spending from big pharma. For context, just five companies—Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Roche, AbbVie, and Eli Lilly—spent over $75 billion on R&D last year alone. If Tempus grows to $20 billion in revenue, it could become highly profitable. With medtech firms typically earning net margins of 22–25%, that implies about $5 billion in profit. At a median multiple of 35 times earnings, Tempus’s valuation could hit $175 billion—up from $15 billion today. This level of growth isn’t unprecedented. Look at Intuitive Surgical, which jumped 8x in value over the past decade—from $20 billion to $165 billion. The best part? We don’t think ISRG stock is done yet. Tempus AI could follow a similar trajectory. Despite its promise, Tempus faces major risks. Regulatory approvals for each AI tool are slow, and new data privacy laws could bring hefty fines. The company is also still unprofitable with high R&D spending, meaning it may need to raise more capital, diluting shareholders. Competition is intense—from giants like Roche and tech titans like Google with deep pockets. And its valuation is steep: a $15 billion market cap on $1.3 billion in 2025 revenue. Any stumble could send its stock plunging, making that 10x dream a long shot. Remember, single-stock investing always carries meaningful risk. Consider the Trefis High-Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which holds 30 stocks and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4 years. Why? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered stronger returns with lower volatility than the index, offering a smoother ride as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Overall, Tempus AI is a bold bet on the future of healthcare AI. The key question isn’t if it will succeed—it likely will. The real challenge is whether that success can deliver outsized returns from today’s lofty valuation. The next three to four years will be pivotal as it races to scale while the healthcare AI market matures and competition intensifies.

Title: 10x Upside For IONQ Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/12/10x-upside-for-ionq-stock/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), a quantum computing company, has taken a major leap by figuring out how to mass-produce high-quality synthetic diamond films. Think of it this way: they can now bond these specialized diamonds onto standard computer chips—a potential game-changer for building quantum computers. Developed with Element Six, this breakthrough enables the company to manufacture these components at scale. It’s a core element of IonQ’s plan to reach a 2-million-qubit quantum system by 2030. In fact, IonQ’s acquisition of the UK quantum computing startup Oxford Ionics a few months ago was a pivotal step to speed up this goal. With this advance, the big question is whether it can drive even more explosive gains in IonQ’s stock. The stock has already surged 500% in the last year, but could it climb another 10x from here, reaching $400 a share? It can. In the sections below, we outline what could enable that outcome. That said, if you want upside exposure with lower single-stock risk, consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which has delivered >91% returns since inception while outperforming the S&P 500 with lower volatility. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? IonQ is a high-risk, high-reward name with significant upside potential. Its trapped-ion technology and cloud-first strategy could provide an edge. To realize that potential, the company must sustain technical leadership, convert research into real-world applications, and monetize partnerships. For investors comfortable with risk, IonQ offers a way to invest directly in the future of quantum computing. However, meaningful risks remain in this early-stage space. Alternatively, explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to capitalize on strong markets while limiting downside when conditions deteriorate, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano Could Lead Explosive Altcoin Rally, Analyst Says

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Crypto markets are “on the edge” of a broad altcoin breakout, with XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano positioned to lead, according to technical strategist CryptoInsightUK. In a video analysis released today, the analyst argues that structural signals across major charts—supported by improving macro conditions—tilt the risk-reward toward a decisive upside move, provided US inflation data doesn’t deliver a negative surprise. The setup begins with Bitcoin grinding higher into range highs while still sitting in what he calls “a position of potential reversal,” a juncture he links to today’s US CPI print after a softer-than-expected PPI reading. “If CPI comes in weak today, I think the markets will rip,” he said, framing inflation as the swing factor that could unlock risk appetite across crypto. He contends the strongest signals are emerging away from Bitcoin and Ethereum. On Ethereum, liquidity “still” sits below price around $4,100, with a pocket of resting orders above, leaving open the possibility of “a quick flush… to take that” before higher levels are attacked. “How much of a drop would we need to sweep this liquidity? Six percent,” he said, adding that the base of recent transactions “looks pretty good as a support,” even if a brief downside wick cannot be ruled out. The case for altcoins rests largely on visible liquidity concentrations and higher-timeframe structures. Cardano (ADA), he said, exhibits a favorable imbalance with “a… load of liquidity” stacked above “around one dollar,” and additional magnets in the $1.21 and $1.40 areas if momentum expands. He emphasized the sequence of higher lows and higher highs that preceded a consolidation, a pattern he compared across several charts. Dogecoin (DOGE), in his view, mirrors the same anatomy on a larger timeframe: a prior higher-high/higher-low sequence, a tightening range, and “liquidity above us,” with a push through $0.29 opening a path to targeting $0.45. “I’ve been saying for a while tokens like DOGE look like they are going to absolutely send it,” he said. For XRP, he argued that price action has “led the cycle” and recently broke a well-tracked downtrend on the daily and four-hour charts, while shorter-term liquidity maps now show concentrations overhead. Beyond single names, he anchored his thesis in market-wide breadth gauges. He highlighted “Total 3”—the combined market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—pressing against prior highs and “knocking at the door… for price discovery.” In a closely related lens, he said “Total 2” (market cap ex-Bitcoin) is one incremental push away—“half a percent higher”—from a highest-ever weekly close, with three days left in the candle. The evolving formations, he added, can be interpreted as an “ascending wedge” that morphs into a “cup and handle” after a textbook Wyckoff-style accumulation and back-test, the kind of structural progression that often resolves with a powerful range break. Rotation dynamics are at the core of his call. Drawing on an ETH-vs-BTC dominance composite, he said the tape “looks like weakness” for the pair, with heavier volume on down moves in that ratio—an indication, he believes, that capital is migrating from Bitcoin and Ethereum into the broader altcoin complex. “If [Bitcoin] dominance breaks down… it’s better for altcoins,” he said. “As long as capital’s flowing into the market, I don’t really mind which starts to outperform which… but if we have a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price and a drop in dominance, it means that altcoins are going to be absolutely sending it.” At the same time, he flagged the near-term fork in the road. Markets are testing “decision” levels into macro data, and a brief liquidity sweep lower—on Bitcoin and ETH in particular—remains plausible before any sustained impulse. “We’re not in a breakout territory here yet,” he cautioned. “We’ve seen the first signs of it… [and] we could reject here and consolidate for a little bit longer… but one catalyst here and it’s green season in my opinion for crypto generally.” Throughout the analysis, the analyst returned to a handful of price signposts traders are likely to watch: ADA gravity around $1.00 with follow-ups near $1.21 and $1.40; DOGE confirmation above ~$0.29 and then $0.45 as the next objective; and XRP’s break of descending resistance with liquidity pools sitting overhead on intraday maps. If the macro side cooperates, his base case is unambiguous. “I think the breakout is imminent,” he said, pointing to synchronized strength across Total 2 and Total 3, gold’s recent breakout, and equities at or near all-time highs. “This is the sort of time where we’re going to break out,” he added. “Massive breakouts” in altcoins, when they come, often unfold as “a few weeks or a few days of massively green candles.” Even so, he closed with a reminder that timing remains hostage to catalysts. “It’s decision time for the market,” he said. “Could reject here and consolidate… but one catalyst here and it’s green season.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.99.

The domestic wood panel industry is gearing up for a robust revival, driven by a surge in housing handovers, large-scale capacity expansions and easing timber prices, said analysts. Shares such as Greenply Industries, Century Plyboard, Greenpanel, Greenlam Industries, Archidply Industries and Rushil Decor gained sharply in today’s trade. In the three months, these stocks have generated handsome returns between 3 and 29 per cent. While plywood remains the dominant category, Medium-Density Fibreboard (MDF) is witnessing rapid adoption, especially in commercial and OEM segments. MDF demand grew at a 22 per cent CAGR during FY21-FY25, said Yes Securities, expecting this momentum to continue as pricing stabilises and margins recover. In Q1FY26, wood panel companies reported modest operating performances. “Plywood segment exhibited mixed volume growth, but OPM was subdued y-o-y. MDF segment saw muted volume growth (except CPBI) and operating margins continued to be mixed across companies, said ICICI Securities. According to analysts, operating margins should stay healthy in the plywood segment as timber prices have stabilised. Besides, the government is taking steps to ensure BIS on furniture by February 26. While the import inventory has also died down, there is still competition for pricing from the unorganised players. This, combined with the softening of timber prices, will act as a tailwind for the plywood business, said Axis Securities.. Yes Securities, in a recent thematic report, said the sector is entering a multi-year upcycle, with top players like Century Plyboards and Greenply Industries expected to lead the charge. India’s real estate market has seen a massive presales boom over the past four years, with a significant portion of inventory now entering the handover phase. The average area of homes scheduled for delivery between 2024 and 2029 is nearly double that of the previous decade, implying higher interior spends and increased demand for furniture — a key driver for woodpanel consumption. “The MDF industry has faced oversupply challenges in recent years, creating pricing pressure and materially impacting margins. However, with most large capacity expansions already commissioned and demand growth likely to sustain, utilisation levels should improve, aiding margin recovery. Furthermore, the imposition of anti-dumping duty has curbed imports substantially, and the existing inventory of low-cost imports is nearing exhaustion. Consequently, we expect improvement in the overall scenario for MDFs hereon,” the Yes Securities’ report noted. Top listed players have invested over ₹5,000 crore in capacity expansion across plywood, MDF, laminates and particle boards. With major capex behind them and demand set to rise, analysts anticipate a strong earnings trajectory. On the cost side, timber prices, which account for up to 65 per cent of raw material costs, are showing signs of cooling after an 18-24 month rally. This should aid margin recovery across companies. With timber prices showing signs of cooling and anti-dumping duties curbing cheap imports, the woodpanel sector is set for margin expansion. Analysts highlight that PEG ratios for top players are below 1x, indicating attractive valuations relative to growth. As the housing handover cycle accelerates and furniture demand rises, investors may find compelling opportunities in select woodpanel stocks — especially those with diversified portfolios and completed capex cycles. With furniture demand rising and capacity in place, brokerages see woodpanel companies entering a margin-accretive earnings cycle. Analysts prefer diversified players like CPBI and Greenply for re-rating potential, while niche MDF player Greenpanel may see steady but limited upside.

Title: Rigetti Computing: How RGTI Stock Falls To $2?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/10/rigetti-computing-how-rgti-stock-falls-to-2/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:25:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rigetti Computing's stock has soared 2,000% over the past year. Why? It’s been a perfect storm of catalysts. There’s been intense hype around quantum computing and significant capital flowing into the space, which energized investor sentiment. Add the massive AI boom, and many market participants began grouping quantum names like Rigetti into that broader narrative. With only a handful of publicly traded quantum companies, RGTI became a scarce—and therefore hot—stock to own. On top of that, large institutional investors started building positions, lending further credibility. The result was powerful momentum, with retail investors piling in for fear of missing out and pushing the price even higher. Here’s the catch: quantum may be the future, but widespread commercial adoption is still years away. Today’s use cases are limited, with most work concentrated on simulating chemistry and physics. Look at RGTI's fundamentals: We agree, quantum stocks hinge on future growth—and we’ve already explored the upside potential. But have you weighed the downside risks? We cover them below. That said, if you want upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – Oracle Stock To $900. Markets don’t trend in one direction forever—as we’ve seen recently—and quantum computing remains years from broad commercialization. There are several risks that could derail Rigetti’s growth narrative. When sentiment sours, speculative stocks don’t just dip—they get hammered. This isn’t theoretical. In 2022, high inflation spurred rate hikes, and the market fell roughly 25% from its peak. Do you know how much RGTI sank? It was a whopping 96% decline from $9 to $0.40. What could trigger the next collapse? What’s the realistic downside for RGTI from around $16? If history rhymes, it’s under $2. Are you ready for that? The 2022 slide wiped out 96% of RGTI’s value. Even a “moderate” 75–80% correction implies $3–4. Given the speculative setup and weak fundamentals, a return to sub-$2 isn’t just possible—it has precedent. This analysis isn’t bearish for its own sake; it’s about recognizing risk. The probability may be uncertain, but the magnitude is high, and anyone holding RGTI should be prepared for potentially severe drawdowns. For investors seeking growth exposure without the extreme swings of speculative single names, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 indices) to deliver strong returns. Why? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks adapts to strong markets while limiting downside when conditions deteriorate, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics. Remember: in speculative growth stocks, the same momentum that fuels spectacular gains can drive equally spectacular losses. The question isn’t whether RGTI will be volatile—it’s whether you can withstand what the downside might look like.

Title: Oracle Stock Up 94% On Growth Forecast. Learn Whether To Buy $ORCL

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Oracle's stock soared after a report of a cloud contract with OpenAI and an optimistic forecast for its AI-driven cloud infrastructure.The company projects aggressive eight-fold growth in cloud revenue by FY30, leveraging its unique database and networking advantages for AI training and inference services.Key risks include high market expectations, intense competition, significant capital expenditure, and the potential for AI spending to slow. Oracle shares have soared 99% since the beginning of 2025 – with more than half of that gain coming in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Why did this happen? After all, the Austin-based tech company announced results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026 that fell short of expectations. What sent Oracle stock soaring another 54 percentage points was the company’s outlook for the future of its cloud infrastructure business, according to CNBC. The future didn’t take long: The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday afternoon that Oracle and Open AI agreed to “one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed," worth a reported $300 billion over five years. Will Oracle stock keep rising? The answer depends on whether the tech giant can beat investor expectations and raise guidance in future quarters. I think there is more upside to the stock for two reasons: However, over the longer-term, Oracle stock may plunge if companies stop investing so heavily in artificial intelligence. That could happen unless more of them reap economic benefits – such as faster revenue growth and considerable boosts in productivity. Oracle envisions very fast growth in its cloud infrastructure business. "We expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year — and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years," CEO Safra Catz in a statement. The OpenAI deal is a big a step in that direction. Oracle’s results for the quarter fell flat while the company’s growth forecast generated an outpouring of enthusiasm. Here are the key numbers: The question for investors is whether Oracle’s bullish growth forecasts suggest a continued rise in its stock. Here’s the bull case: Oracle’s latest earnings report suggests growth in demand and much higher revenue driven by companies seeking to benefit from AI. Oracle’s backlog is likely to grow even more. "We signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1," Catz said in a statement. Oracle expects to contract with several additional multibillion-dollar customers and for its RPO to exceed half a trillion dollars, Catz added. "We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who’s who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, and many others," Catz said in investor call featured by Yahoo! Finance. Oracle is targeting two related AI markets – services for training large language models and for inference – generating content from a trained AI model. “Millions of customers are using those AI models to run businesses and governments,” Oracle co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison said in the investor conference call featured by the Wall Street Journal. “AI inference will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic greenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug designs,” he added. Oracle’s unique advantage for AI inference is its databases that store private business data. The company’s “new AI database will make it easy for those businesses to query or ask questions of their private data, all of which adds to the bill for Oracle’s AI inference services,” Ellison said, according to the Journal. Oracle is also investing in AI agents – which help people to achieve specific goals such as selecting, booking, and paying for flights and hotels for a journey, as I described in my book Brain Rush. “The new [applications] that we’re building, they’re nothing other than a bunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow,” he added. Oracle enjoys another advantage over cloud services rivals. “I know some of our competitors, they like to own buildings,” Catz said, according to CNBC. “That’s not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique technology, the unique networking, the storage — just the whole way we put these systems together,” she added. However, this potential comes with significant risks. The stock’s premium valuation reflects high market expectations – if the market shifts money out of big tech companies or Oracle fails to beat and raise every quarter, its stock could fall. Moreover, the high capital expenditure required to fund its expansion could reduce cash flow and highlights the financial risks involved in its ambitious plans. In addition, Oracle faces significant competition from AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. While the urge to spend more on AI is currently powerful, if the economy goes into a recession, companies who buy cloud services may need to cut costs quickly to preserve cash. And since AI has yet to generate enough of a payoff to justify the investment, as I wrote last month in a Forbes article, such spending could be curtailed if the economy contracts. Last September, generative AI was looking to me like a big dud. While people were using ChatGPT to help them draft emails and reports, there was no killer app – akin to what the iTunes store did for the iPod or the electronic spreadsheet did for personal computers, I wrote in the Boston Globe. Last month, MIT reinforced this point with hard numbers. "Despite $30B-$40B in enterprise investment into generative AI, this report uncovers a surprising result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return," according to a study – based on 150 interviews with professionals, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments – from MIT’s NANDA Institute featured by SeekingAlpha. The main problem appears to be integrating AI into the enterprise. "Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable profit and loss impact," noted the MIT NANDA Institute report. If companies find ways to make AI pay over the next four years, Oracle’s cloud services rapid growth could continue. Analysts are mostly enthusiastic about Oracle’s prospects: One note of caution came from D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. While Lauria said Oracle’s projected cloud revenue figure was “absolutely staggering,” according to CNBC, the business is coming from Microsoft and Google who are “offloading their capacity to other data center providers. These are not organic customers to Oracle,” he added. While Wall Street is optimistic, 35 analysts who cover the stock set a price target of $263.93, according to TipRanks – meaning Oracle stock is 25% over-valued. I see the stock continuing to rise – at least until the company’s next earnings report.

Title: Oracle Stock To $900: Its Simple Math

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Oracle’s meteoric rise continues to defy expectations. With a 36% surge following its latest earnings and a cumulative 3x gain since early 2023, the enterprise software giant is rewriting the playbook for cloud transformation. But here’s the million-dollar question: Can Oracle realistically triple again from current levels to reach $900 per share? The numbers suggest it's not just possible—it might be inevitable. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – JNJ Stock To $250? Oracle just dropped a bombshell that caught even the most bullish analysts off guard. The company’s remaining performance obligations (RPO) exploded 359% year-over-year to $455 billion from the previous quarter's $138 billion figure. What does this actually mean? Think of RPO as Oracle’s locked-in revenue pipeline—contracts already signed and sealed, just waiting to be delivered. This isn't wishful thinking or ambitious projections; it's money already committed by customers. Oracle didn’t just report numbers—they laid out a clear trajectory for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue that reads like a growth investor's dream: Here’s what makes them credible: most of this revenue is already baked into the reported RPO. Oracle isn't gambling on future demand—they're simply executing on contracts already in hand. Why is everyone suddenly throwing money at Oracle’s cloud? The AI revolution requires massive computational infrastructure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has positioned itself as a premier destination for AI workloads. As companies race to implement AI solutions, they need reliable, scalable cloud platforms—something that Oracle provides. The timing couldn’t be better. While competitors face capacity constraints and pricing pressures, Oracle is expanding aggressively and capturing market share in the highest-growth segments. Let’s break down the path to a $900 stock price with simple, conservative assumptions: Assuming Oracle maintains its operational leverage and margins improve modestly with cloud scale: From today’s levels, that represents a roughly 3x upside. Is a 40x P/E reasonable for 2030? For a company growing cloud revenue at a projected 34% average annual rate with locked-in contracts extending years into the future, a 40x multiple seems conservative, especially in a market that regularly assigns higher multiples to companies with less predictable growth. Note that tech stocks like Microsoft and Amazon currently trade at 35-40 times trailing earnings. Look at Oracle’s Valuation Ratios for more details. No investment thesis is complete without acknowledging potential headwinds. Oracle faces several challenges that could derail this optimistic scenario. Competition intensifies as cloud becomes table stakes. Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud aren’t sitting idle. They have deeper pockets and broader ecosystems. Oracle’s advantage in AI infrastructure could erode if competitors aggressively price or innovate their way back into contention. Economic headwinds could pressure enterprise spending, and companies might delay cloud migrations or renegotiate contracts. While Oracle’s RPO provides some insulation, large enterprise deals can still be postponed or downsized during tough times. Execution risk on this massive scale-up. Growing from $59 billion to $200 billion in annual revenue requires flawless execution across hiring, infrastructure buildout, and customer delivery. Any stumbles could shake confidence in these ambitious projections. Multiple compressions could be more severe than expected. As Oracle matures further, the market might assign lower multiples than our 40x assumption, particularly if interest rates remain elevated. Our separate analysis focusing on the downside risk for Oracle offers more details. Oracle’s latest results represent more than just a good quarter—they signal a fundamental shift in the company’s trajectory and market position. With $455 billion in locked-in future revenue and a clear path to $200 billion in annual sales by 2030, the case for $900 per share is surprisingly straightforward. That said, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the Trefis High-Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. So is this a slam dunk? Not quite. Execution risks are real, competition is fierce, and market conditions can change rapidly. But for investors willing to bet on Oracle’s ability to capitalize on the AI-driven cloud boom, the risk-reward equation looks compelling. The 30% after-hours pop might actually be the conservative reaction. When a company provides this level of revenue visibility with this kind of growth trajectory, a 3x move over the next four to five years starts looking less like speculation and more like inevitability. The question isn’t whether Oracle can reach $900—it's whether investors have the patience to ride the journey.

(Negative) Gold – Glinting & Blazing and approaching $4000 US Federal Reserve Policy Outlook, Central Bank Accumulation, Geopolitical Tensions, ETF and Institutional Flows remains the key drivers behind the rally. US inflation hasn’t been fully caged with FED independence remaining under pressure and geopolitics also adding sparks. This may not last forever, but the near-term tide and current is in favor of gold. Gold is turning out to be the main course, serving hot, in one’s portfolio. New highs are in the face of a fresh political crisis in France, Japan and the US sanctions against Russia. Rate cuts bets have intensified after a weaker-than-expected US jobs report last Friday. Generally risk and refuge (Stocks & Gold) do not rally together but this cycle seems diƯerent with lingering inflation, US federal reserve rate cuts and tariƯ driven backdrops. Gold rallying is not a speculative froth but a diversification game by the Central Banks from dollar monopoly to gold. Traders might view it as a hot money chase, but the Central Banks preservation leads to built up in the gold vault and pulling it oƯ the market, creating a scarcity premium. Just an arithmetic of 1% movement from treasuries into bullion could lead to a gold rise beyond $4000 an ounce, or even more. Headwinds Bullish moves may be challenging on growing skepticism over the impact of the Supreme Court verdict (October 14th) on Trump’s plea on the tariƯ matter. US inflation data for August is due this week with an expected upside due to tariƯs, which may have a bearing on the US Fed rate cut decisions. Markets are on a close watch. Levels On any eventuality of a gold correction, immediate support is seen at $3616 and $3578. Up to 16th Sept’25 the gold volatility could witness rally beyond $3700 for a $3781 target which acts as a stoploss for the shorts targeting $3422. In the short-term gold seems to be overbought, but the broader trend is still positive. Weaker numbers of the US inflation data this week could boost gold further.

A major downward revision to Nonfarm Payrolls showed 911,000 fewer jobs added between March 2024 and March 2025 than previously reported. Coupled with last week’s weak labor data, markets are now pricing in three rate cuts this year, including one at next week’s Fed meeting. Inflation figures due later this week could further shape rate expectations. Meanwhile, gold’s rally is also being supported by safe-haven demand amid geopolitical risks, US tariff concerns, and strong central bank buying. The metal is up 39% year-to-date. On Tuesday, the 10Y benchmark (6.33 GS 2035) opened 1 bps lower at 6.46% vs 6.47% tracking the fall in US Treasury yields as the sharply lower US non-farm payrolls data induced traders to fully factor in a 25bps rate cut by the Federal Reserve on Sep 17 policy. However, the fall was short lived, and yields surged to end at 6.49% as market participants booked profits amid lack of fresh triggers. Market participants now await India’s CPI inflation data due to be released on Sep 12, Friday for further directions. The cut-offs for SDL auction amounting ~$1.69 Bn (INR 149 Bn) was in line with the expectations. The latest system liquidity stands in surplus of ~$26.8 Bn (~INR 2360 Bn). >>> INR local credit: Yields were steady across the curve, with the 10Y point closing at 7.19%.

The deceleration in growth is due to a slowdown in government capex (fiscal consolidation and execution limits in key sectors) and due to heightened caution in the private sector (muted near-term demand, tariffs, etc.). While high growth (20%+) seen post COVID-19 is unlikely anytime soon, we believe ~10-11% growth in capex is very much achievable and sustainable given the continuing policy focus (central govt capex is up sharply YTD), very strong power-related capex (which should continue for the next several years), solid balance sheets, strong cash flows, and healthy capex intentions of corporates. A 10% growth environment offers pockets of opportunity for healthy earnings growth – we prefer industrial names with stronger tailwinds and optionality (CG Power), strong and diversified end markets (Cummins India), and the possibility of an uptick in margins (Thermax). We initiate coverage of ABB India at Neutral, and of Siemens and BHEL at UW. Our order of preference in industrials is L&T, CG Power, Cummins India and Thermax. Stick to growth and visibility: Prefer L&T, CG Power, Cummins and Thermax – L&T remains our top pick with its attractive valuation (24x core FY27E P/E) with high RoCEs (30%+) and EPS growth (18%+). In this report, we initiate coverage of: 1) CG Power at OW (strong growth, supported by expanding transformer capacity and optionality from OSAT), 2) Cummins India at OW (demand visibility, strong margin performance), 3) Thermax at OW (margin tailwinds as low margin projects end). We also initiate coverage of ABB India and Praj at Neutral, and Siemens and BHEL at UW.

The stock of Piramal Pharma bounced off the support at ₹182 early this month. Last week, it closed above a key resistance at ₹195, turning the short-term outlook positive. Also, the price is now above both 21- and 50-day moving averages. While the price action shows that the stock has been flat in the past few sessions, the breakout remains valid, and we expect it to soon see another leg of uptrend.
