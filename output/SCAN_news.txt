Title: Strategy saved from Index expulsion, yet a hidden clause effectively kills the infinite money loop for investors

With MSCI freeze blocking automatic buys, Strategy must pivot to active investors for new funding, challenging its Bitcoin acquisition model. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The threat of a massive forced sell-off in crypto-linked equities has been averted. However, that reprieve comes with a structural catch that fundamentally alters the economics of the “Bitcoin Treasury” trade. On Jan. 6, the dominant benchmark provider for global equity and ETF markets, MSCI Inc., announced it will retain “Digital Asset Treasury Companies” (DATCOs) in its global indices for the February 2026 review, sparing firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) from expulsion. It stated: “For the time being, the current index treatment of DATCOs identified in the preliminary list published by MSCI of companies whose digital asset holdings represent 50% or more of their total assets will remain unchanged.” Following the news, Michael Saylor, Strategy's executive chairman, touted the victory of remaining in the benchmark. However, the index provider has simultaneously introduced a technical freeze on share counts for these entities. It explained: “MSCI will not implement increases to the Number of Shares (NOS), Foreign Inclusion Factor (FIF) or Domestic Inclusion Factor (DIF) for these securities. MSCI will defer any additions or size-segment migrations for all securities included in the preliminary list.” Through this decision, MSCI has effectively severed the link between new equity issuance and automatic passive buying. This move simply meant the “downside” of a forced liquidation has been removed, but the “upside” mechanics of the index trade have been dismantled The immediate market reaction, a surge of over 6% in Strategy’s stock, reflected relief that a catastrophic liquidity event was off the table. Notably, JPMorgan suggested that a full exclusion could have triggered between $3 billion and $9 billion in passive selling of MSTR. MSCI consultation paper and JPMorgan's positioning resulting in some major fallout across social media to defend DATs like Strategy. This volume would likely have crushed the stock price and forced the liquidation of Bitcoin holdings. However, the removed threat of exclusion masks a new reality where the automatic demand lever for the stocks is gone. Historically, when Strategy issued new shares to fund Bitcoin acquisitions, the index provider would eventually update the share count. As a result, passive funds tracking the index were then mathematically compelled to buy a pro rata portion of the new issuance to minimize tracking error. This created a guaranteed, price-insensitive source of demand that helped absorb dilution. Under the new “freeze” policy, this loop is broken. Even if Strategy significantly expands its float to raise capital, MSCI will effectively ignore those new shares for index calculation purposes. The company’s weight in the index will not increase, and consequently, ETFs and index funds will not be forced to buy the new paper. Market analysts note that this shift forces a return to fundamentals. Without the backstop of benchmark-tracking demand, Strategy and its peers must now rely on active managers, hedge funds, and retail investors to absorb new supply. To understand the magnitude of this shift, market researchers are modeling the “lost bid” that issuers must now navigate. Bull Theory, a crypto research firm, quantified this liquidity gap in a note to clients. The firm posited a hypothetical scenario involving a treasury company with 200 million outstanding shares, of which roughly 10% are typically held by passive index trackers. In the Bull Theory model, if that company issues 20 million new shares to raise capital, the old index mechanics would eventually mandate that passive funds purchase 2 million of those shares. At a theoretical price point of $300 per share, that represents $600 million of automatic, price-insensitive buying pressure. Under MSCI’s new freeze, Bull Theory noted that the $600 million bid falls to zero. Considering this, it stated: “Strategy now must find private buyers, offer discounts, or raise less money.” This means that the forced demand from index funds has been eliminated. Thus, it presents a significant hurdle for Strategy, which issued more than $15 billion in new shares throughout 2025 to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin. The arbitrage trade allowing firms to print equity for crypto is dead, leaving their $60 billion hoard structurally exposed. If the company attempts to replicate that scale of issuance in 2026, it will do so in a market void of passive support. Without that structural bid, the risk of a price correction during dilution events increases significantly. MSCI's decision to cap these companies rather than expel them or leave them alone has also significantly altered the competitive dynamics in the asset management sector. Over the past year, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have matured as an asset class and have seen significant institutional interest. In fact, this rise led MSCI's former parent company, Morgan Stanley, to file for its own Spot Bitcoin ETF. From this vantage point, Strategy competes with these fee-bearing Bitcoin ETFs, offering investors a way to gain passive Bitcoin exposure through an operating company structure. By freezing the index weighting of DATCOs, the new rule degrades their ability to efficiently scale via equity markets. If Strategy’s ability to raise cheap capital is curtailed, large allocators may rotate capital out of the corporate equity and into Spot ETFs, which do not carry the operational risks of a company or the premium-to-NAV volatility. This flow of funds would directly benefit issuers of spot ETFs, including major Wall Street banks, effectively capturing the fees previously reflected in equity premiums. Inflows hit $697 million in days, yet the charts remain frozen because structured demand is neutralizing the rally. By neutering the “flywheel” effect of the treasury strategy, the index provider may have inadvertently, or intentionally, leveled the playing field in favor of traditional asset management products.

Title: Can Retirees Count on QYLD’s Amazing 11% Dividend Any More?

Investing QYLD’s annual distributions have dropped 24% from $2.67 per share in 2021 to roughly $2.04 in 2025. QYLD returned 44% over five years while QQQ delivered 100%. The covered call strategy sacrificed over half the market’s gains. JEPQ uses active management to adjust option coverage instead of selling calls on 100% of holdings. It yields 9% with better total returns. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Inside Creative House / Shutterstock.com The Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (NYSEARCA:QYLD) has attracted income-seeking investors with its impressive 11% yield, but recent trends suggest retirees should approach this fund with caution. The sustainability of this income stream faces meaningful headwinds. QYLD produces income through a covered call strategy on the NASDAQ 100 index. The fund holds the same tech-heavy stocks as the index—with top positions including NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) (9.2%), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) (8.1%), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (7.3%)—but simultaneously sells call options on these holdings. When investors buy these call options, they pay premiums that become the fund’s primary income source. This generates consistent monthly cash flow but caps upside potential when markets rally. QYLD’s distribution history reveals a troubling pattern. Annual payouts have declined 24% from their 2021 peak of $2.67 per share to approximately $2.04 in 2025. Monthly payments now fluctuate between $0.16 and $0.19, reflecting the volatility-dependent nature of option premium income. When market volatility drops—as it has during recent periods of steady gains—the premiums QYLD can collect shrink accordingly. The mechanics are straightforward: covered call funds cannot grow dividends like traditional dividend stocks. They can only redistribute the option income they collect, which varies with market conditions. In low-volatility bull markets, QYLD’s income generation weakens. More concerning for retirees is QYLD’s massive underperformance relative to simply holding the NASDAQ 100. Over the past five years, QYLD returned 44% while the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) delivered 100%—a 56 percentage point gap. Even accounting for QYLD’s distributions, investors sacrificed more than half the market’s gains. The 10-year comparison is starker: QYLD’s 131% total return versus QQQ’s 447%. As Seeking Alpha analyst The Alpha Analyst noted in October 2025, “GPIQ’s active and flexible coverage is shown to outperform QYLD in various market conditions, offering better upside capture and reasonable downside protection.” Newer covered call strategies with dynamic approaches are now outpacing QYLD’s static methodology. The JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) employs an actively managed equity-linked notes strategy that provides similar income—currently yielding around 9%—while maintaining more flexibility to participate in market gains. The fund’s active approach allows managers to adjust option coverage based on market conditions rather than mechanically selling calls on 100% of holdings. With lower expenses and stronger total returns than QYLD, JEPQ represents an evolution in covered call strategies that addresses many of QYLD’s structural limitations. For income investors in 2026, JEPQ offers a more balanced approach to generating yield without completely sacrificing growth potential. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

However, there were some other notable insider purchases as well. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Brandon Bell / Getty Images News via Getty Images The so-called Warren Buffett of Canada and a prominent American billionaire investor and financial analyst started the year with huge insider purchases. Some of the most prominent buying that has been reported so far this year were from return trips to build stakes in Under Armour Inc. (NYSE: UAA), W.R. Berkley Corp. (NYSE: WRB), and Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust (NYSE: GRX). Though these were the most prominent insider purchases, there were a handful of other notable ones as well. Let’s take a quick look at these transactions. What does insider buying tell us? A well-known adage reminds us that corporate insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company because they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. Thus, insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors. This is especially so during times of market uncertainty, and even when markets are near all-time highs. The fourth-quarter earnings-reporting season is yet to begin, so few insiders are prohibited from buying or selling shares. Below are some of the most notable insider purchases that were reported recently, starting with the largest and most prominent. This buyer, led by billionaire V. Prem Watsa, sometimes called the Warren Buffett of Canada, also scooped up $70 million worth of shares prior to this purchase. The stake is now up to more than 41.9 million shares, and the investment helped boost the stock still suffering after the brand parted ways with spokesperson Steph Curry. Shares were last seen trading for more than the purchase price range above. The stock is still more than 23% lower than six months ago. Given the Wall Street consensus target of $6.07, the analysts anticipate 8.2% upside in the next 12 months. However, only five of 26 analysts recommend buying shares. Guggenheim initiated coverage recently with a Buy rating with a $6 price target. Watsa, founder and CEO of Fairfax, maintains a controlling interest in the company but reportedly is stepping back from some roles to plan for succession. Last spring, this buyer reached an agreement to acquire 15% of W.R. Berkley’s shares. Mitsui Sumitomo expects to complete its investment in this Connecticut-based insurance holding company during the first quarter of 2026. Its stake is up to more than 50.7 million shares, or over 13%. The share price was last seen within the buyer’s latest purchase price range. Yet, the stock is 2.6% lower than six months ago because of recent volatility due to profit-taking. But note that shares are up 20.2% year over year, outperforming the S&P 500 in that time. Analysts are cautious, with only four out of 18 of them recommending buying shares. The mean price target of $73.06 is 3.2% higher than the current price but less than the recent all-time high of $78.96. Mitsui Sumitomo is a massive Japanese financial conglomerate. Note that it also recently acquired an 18% stake in MassMutual’s Barings. This purchase followed on a 100,000-share buy reported at the end of last month. Gabelli also acquired shares of Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (NYSE: GDV) and Gabelli Equity Trust Inc. (NYSE: GAB) in December. Note that another beneficial owner also picked up some shares of Gabelli Healthcare & WellnessRx Trust earlier in the month. Shares were last seen trading for less than the $10 purchase price. They have underperformed the S&P 500 in the past year but are 4.2% higher than 90 days ago. In addition, Gabelli also boosted his stake in Florida-based electronic equipment and components maker LGL Group Inc. (NYSE: LGL) in late December. These were not the only notable insider purchases of the past week. Here is a quick look at some others. Some smaller insider buying was reported at CME, Gitlab, Joby Aviation, SAIC, and Simon Property as well.

Title: Tech companies may only get half the profit they need to justify AI investment, Goldman analyst warns

The S&P 500 hit a new record high yesterday, up 0.62% at 6,944.82. Futures are marginally down this morning, as might be expected from traders who want to sell up and lock in some of those gains. The STOXX Europe 600 also hit a new high yesterday and was flat in early trading this morning.Much of the bullishness is coming as analysts realize that the massive amounts of capital expenditure (capex) on building out AI data centers isn’t likely to stop anytime soon.The result of all that new spending will be that “we expect another year of solid gains for U.S. equities in 2026. We forecast an S&P 500 total return of 12% to a year-end level of 7,600,” Goldman Sachs analyst Ben Snider and his colleagues told clients in a note sent this morning.However, the wrinkle for 2026 will be that AI capex growth will start to slow down, he said. In turn, the amount of profit needed to justify all that capex won’t show up, Snider et al argue, and that will cause traders to pick and choose winners and losers among the big tech firms of the S&P 500. “The 10 largest stocks in the S&P 500 account for 41% of market cap and drove 53% of the S&P 500 2025 return. We expect AI spending will exceed consensus estimates this year but begin to decelerate in growth terms while corporate adoption increases, causing rotations among the largest U.S. tech stocks that create two-way risk for the aggregate index,” he told clients. Capex spending by the big “hyperscalers” (Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, etc.) was roughly $400 billion in 2025, up 70% annually, Goldman calculates. The big tech companies have also started to fund much of that growth with debt. “As spending and debt grow, so do the necessary eventual profits to justify ongoing investments,” Snider says. So far, tech companies have been happy to spend that money because the profits they generated were two or three times as much as they invested, Goldman estimates. The problem is that that might be unsustainable, Snider says. “Given consensus estimates for an annual average of $500 billion in capex from 2025-2027, maintaining the returns on capital to which their investors have become accustomed would require these companies to realize an annual profit run-rate of over $1 trillion, more than double the 2026 consensus estimate of $450 billion in income,” he wrote. While some of these companies will successfully generate the profits they need, others won’t, he says. “The magnitudes of current spending and market caps alongside increasing competition within the group suggest a diminishing probability that all of today’s market leaders generate enough long-term profits to sufficiently reward today’s investors.” Analysts at Vanguard and Piper Sandler are also focused on the AI-capex-profit story. Piper chief global economist Nancy R. Lazar and her colleagues anticipate that tech companies have not yet reached the ceiling of their capex budgets, especially as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA) grants new tax breaks on companies’ capital spending. “Tech capex has been a huge story for a while now, but against history, it’s still not ‘too high’ vs. GDP. And there’s plenty of upside ahead, given OBBA’s full capex expensing, Fed easing, and banks easing lending standards,” they told clients. Vanguard’s Qian Wang, global head of capital market research, also warned that if profits don’t follow capex then investors should expect a downturn. “We are bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy. But transformative technology needs profitable business models to win. And, in the financial markets, returns hinge on expectations. Tech companies’ earnings have been strong so far, but their valuations may have gotten ahead of themselves. When expectations get too far out of whack, it is not surprising to see markets pull back,” she said in an email sent to Fortune. Here’s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:

Title: AI Growth Scare Worries? 2 Low-Tech Growth Stocks to Rotate Into

Investing Shake Shack targets 1,500 stores long-term and trades 41% below its all-time high. Celsius Holdings acquired Alani Nu to expand its health and wellness portfolio. Celsius trades at 32x forward P/E after rising 65% last year. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 2022 Getty Images / Getty Images News via Getty Images Many investors and analysts are bullish on the stock market and the state of the AI trade going into the new year. And while it’s sure to be another pivotal year for the technology, investors should also consider the low-tech names that might be better able to withstand tech-driven market corrections. Undoubtedly, the broad market went into 2026 with a fairly high multiple and while this alone doesn’t mean we’ll spend a big chunk of the year in a bear market, I do think that some of the neglected non-AI and non-tech plays might be in a position to do well in their own right, especially if an AI bubble (if it even exists) finally does go bust, dragging down the broad stock market along with it. It’s all right to be bullish and overweight in the top AI names, provided you’re comfortable with increased volatility. But if you’re at all fearful of an AI bubble or rolling sector-based corrections, I’d argue that a bit of diversification can never hurt. In this piece, we’ll look at two low-tech stocks that have impressive growth rates and the means to sidestep a potential AI growth scare should one happen in 2026. Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) stands out as a compelling buy on the dip after shedding more than 41% from its all-time highs. Undoubtedly, it’s been a sharp implosion, but one that might be overdone, especially if the $3.5 billion premium fast-food firm can successfully shift gears from recovery to acceleration. As a relatively small chain with a ton of expansion potential in the quick-serve restaurant scene, Shake Shack might be the restaurant growth play to stick with, especially if you’re looking for an impressive low-tech growth profile. With its ambitious 1,500-store long-term expansion plan, efforts to drive same-store sales growth (think loyalty and new burgers like the Big Shack), and the potential to drive operating efficiencies via the incorporation of new tech, I see an earnings growth pathway that could help shares of Shake Shack recover quite swiftly from here. Though Raymond James may have dropped Shake Shack stock from its “Favorites List” last month, I still think recent trends shouldn’t take away from the long-term growth story at hand. If you’re a fan of the chain, it might be finally time to nibble while shares are under $85 per share. Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a relatively small $12.4 billion beverage company that’s fresh off a decent recovery year. Last year, the stock rose more than 65%, and while such an upside move hasn’t allowed shares to touch prior all-time highs (believe it or not, shares are still down 50% from their peak), I do think recent momentum and progress going on behind the scenes is worth getting behind. The company can keep gaining market share while making further margin improvements, allowing the stock to comfortably grow into its seemingly frothy multiple. With the acquisition of healthy supplement market Alani Nu last year, I view Celsius’ health and wellness moat as increasing in size. Undoubtedly, the deal not only makes Celsius a bigger force in “healthy” energy beverages, but it also could give the firm a front-row seat to the protein supplements market. Like Celsius, Alani Nu is a fast-moving up-and-comer that’s capable of massive market disruption. At 32.0 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), I view Celsius as a very reasonably-priced mid-cap growth stock that can do well, even if the AI trade were to run out of its steam in this new year. With such an impressive growth rate and a broader portfolio of products that have resonated with health-conscious consumers, I think 2026 could be the year Celisus’ stock really heats up.
