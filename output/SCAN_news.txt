Title: Dogecoin Isn’t Done Yet – Grok’s Surprising Price Prediction & $MAXI Recommendation
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-grok-buy-maxi-doge/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T07:04:05Z
Full Content:
Dogecoin’s name is written in golden letters in meme coin lore. After all, it was the first major meme coin that really showed to the world that humor and finance can indeed blend, and blend beautifully, and that an investment opportunity doesn’t need to titillate a Harvard graduate’s intellect to be wildly profitable. Currently trading at $0.2202, $DOGE has climbed a chunky 27% over the past month. With a new altcoin bull run seemingly on the horizon, speculation is rife on whether this dog-themed token could turn back the clock and deliver mind-boggling rallies once again. To find out, we turned to Grok for Dogecoin’s price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Why Grok? Because it’s one of the best AI chatbots out there, and the only one directly integrated with X, the hub of pipping-hot crypto updates from both under-the-radar crypto wizards and mainstream industry voices. This gives Grok a unique ability to sweep the floor and piece together a sharper, more accurate narrative on what’s next for $DOGE. Keep reading to see why Grok thinks $DOGE could hit $0.50 (a bold call, to say the least) by the end of 2025, the forces driving it higher, and why buying a Doge-based presale meme coin like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could be the best way to ride Doge’s next leg up. The biggest reason behind Grok’s bold $DOGE price prediction is that the token is sitting in a rare sweet spot where both fundamental and technical factors are flashing green. For starters, Dogecoin is preparing to integrate a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verification system, which would allow transactions to be verified without revealing sensitive information, boosting both privacy and scalability. This kind of tech upgrade strengthens Dogecoin’s long-term credibility and makes it more attractive for mainstream adoption. Why is an ETF approval such a big deal? Because it would open the floodgates for institutional investors and everyday traders to buy $DOGE through regular brokerage accounts, potentially triggering a surge in demand and liquidity. On the daily chart, Dogecoin has just broken above the 10 and 20 EMAs with a fat green candle. Even better, this bounce is coming straight from the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci zone (drawn from the $0.14287 low) – a ‘golden pocket.’ In simple words, this setup makes it highly likely that the bullish momentum will continue, potentially pushing $DOGE to $0.28746, i.e., the high of the Fib range. Even more interesting? The rebound is happening exactly at a long-standing upward trendline, the same one that kicked off a 400% price surge back in December 2024. If history repeats, $DOGE could be on track to blast through Grok’s $0.50 target and potentially even challenge its all-time highs. So, buying $DOGE now at just $0.2202 could potentially set you up for 100%+ gains in the coming months. Awesome, innit? After all, these are returns most investors would likely never see even in multiple years in stocks. However, in the wild world of crypto, the real moonshots come from looking for low-cap, low-priced tokens ready to ride a major wave. As for the Dogecoin wave, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could be the next crypto to explode, with the potential to deliver 1000x gains once it hits the exchanges. Like all explode-worthy meme coins, Maxi Doge is built around a mascot with undeniable gravitas. A Shiba Inu dog with revenge in his eyes, protein shakes in his veins, and big, bulky muscles to intimidate every cutesy, wholesome mascot in the meme coin space, Maxi has the kind of presence that stops you in your tracks. Bold. Iconic. Impossible to ignore. But revenge from whom? Dogecoin, Maxi’s distant cousin. The one who hogged all the limelight at every family gathering, leaving poor little Maxi with a cocktail of insecurity, self-hatred, and loneliness. Determined to dethrone Dogecoin’s dominance, Maxi hit the gym and stared at candlestick charts all day, and all night. His reasoning? The crypto market never sleeps, so why should you? And that’s exactly the raw, untamed energy $MAXI embodies. A place with no rules to follow, no mould to fit into. Here, ‘gainz’ is the only religion, even if it takes 1000x leveraged YOLO bets to get there. While Maxi Doge is a meme coin through and through – meaning it doesn’t have any underlying value, utility, or rEvOlUtIoNaRy mission to sell you – holding $MAXI tokens unlocks a bunch of community benefits, including: Even better? Maxi Doge has reserved a chunky 40% of its total token supply for marketing. This will include influencer partnerships and gamified trading challenges. This shows how serious the devs are about $MAXI’s virality. Despite being one of the newest crypto presales on the market, Maxi Doge has already raked in an impressive $470K in early investor funding, proving that if you’ve got a viral idea, a loyal community, and hype, the money pours in fast. Right now, you can scoop up 1 $MAXI for just $0.000251. The easiest way to buy is through Best Wallet, where you can purchase from directly within the app. Alternatively, you can head to Maxi Doge’s official website, connect your crypto wallet, and buy from there. Learn all about this rage-fueled degen project in its whitepaper. And follow its X and Telegram to catch every update before the next pump. With Dogecoin poised for a 100%+ rally in the coming months, thanks to bullish price action, upcoming tech upgrades, and the looming possibility of an ETF approval, now’s the perfect time to back Doge-inspired, low-cap, high-upside meme coins like Maxi Doge ($MAXI).

Title: How AMD Stock Falls To $80
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/07/how-amd-stock-falls-to-80/
Time Published: 2025-08-07T12:34:19Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AMD stock (NASDAQ:AMD) has had a strong run this year so far, rising nearly 35% since early January, driven by recovering CPU demand and investor enthusiasm around generative AI. But with the stock now trading at a lofty 42x forward earnings, investors may want to pause and ask: how much of this valuation is justified, and how much is riding on high expectations? Here’s the thing, a 50% drawdown from current levels would not be unprecedented. It happened in 2022, when AMD stock lost over 60% of its value in just a few quarters. With the stock now around $163, a return to $80 levels isn’t out of the question. And after a mixed Q2 earnings report and mounting macroeconomic pressures - including tariffs under President Donald Trump - a reality check may be in order. See our counter scenario on AMD Stock upside to $330. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that AMD is a pretty volatile stock. Valuation Rests on AI Hope. But Are Things Going To Plan? A key driver of AMD's premium valuation is its potential in the AI chip space. However, Q2 revenues from the company’s data center division, which houses its AI accelerator business, fell short of expectations with revenue rising just 14% to $3.2 billion. What's worse - AI chip sales appear to have declined year-over-year, held back by export restrictions to China and a pause as customers await the next-gen Instinct MI350. Compare this with Nvidia, which reported over 70% growth in its data center business to $39 billion last quarter. AMD’s AI efforts remain a distant second, and it may be missing out on a significant chunk of the capital pouring into generative AI infrastructure. Should you buy or fear AMD stock? For perspective, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet together spent roughly $222 billion in capex in 2024, projected to surge to $360 billion in 2025. AMD's inability to capture a larger share of that spend raises concerns about whether its AI narrative can continue to support such a high multiple. There are some positives as well. The Trump administration recently eased restrictions on AMD’s MI308 chip shipments to China, which could provide a near-term revenue boost. However, Nvidia’s entrenched position - bolstered by its proprietary CUDA software ecosystem - makes customer switching harder and limits AMD’s upside. AI Spending Sustainability, Competition There are also broader risks to the AI story. Despite massive infrastructure spending, most companies have yet to figure out compelling monetization models for AI. Shareholder pressure could eventually mount to improve returns, and this could cause tech giants may slow their GPU spending. Meanwhile, many of the big tech companies are building their own custom AI chips. Google has its TPUs, Microsoft is rolling out Maia, Amazon has Trainium and Inferentia, and Meta is building in-house silicon optimized for its own AI workloads. These in-house efforts could reduce dependency on AMD (and Nvidia), and could meaningfully reduce their addressable market. Even if the GPU story stumbles, could AMD fall back on CPUs? Not without challenges. AMD’s bread-and-butter PC and server CPU businesses could face pressure as the U.S. economy softens. Inflation remains elevated, job growth is moderating, and President Trump’s new tariffs on key trading partners risk driving up costs, dampening consumer spending and business investment alike. That could impact PC sales and in turn hit CPU revenues. How resilient is AMD stock during a downturn? AMD stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on AMD stock? Our dashboard AMD Dropped 6.4% In A Day. Have You Fully Evaluated The Risk? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. Inflation Shock (2022) • AMD stock fell 65.4% from a high of $161.91 on 29 November 2021 to $55.94 on 14 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 January 2024 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $211.38 on 7 March 2024 and currently trades at around $163. Covid Pandemic (2020) • AMD stock fell 34.3% from a high of $58.90 on 19 February 2020 to $38.71 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 22 July 2020 Global Financial Crisis (2008) • AMD stock fell 91.2% from a high of $20.35 on 1 January 2007 to $1.80 on 25 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 21 August 2018 Premium Valuation In summary, it also doesn’t help that AMD stock is still expensive; it trades at almost 49x trailing earnings and 42x forward earnings. Sure, Advanced Micro Devices' Revenues have grown considerably over recent years, rising at an average rate of about 15% over the last 3 years (vs. 5% for S&P 500). However, this growth could fade quickly if the economy takes a turn for the worse and if the company fails to meaningfully capture share of the AI chip market. At current multiples, even modest disappointments could trigger an outsized correction in the stock. The rich valuation of AMD stock limits its upside potential in the near-to-mid term. As an alternative, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Time Published: 2025-08-07T08:34:52Z

Despite its fair share of ups and downs, 2025 has shaped up to be a banger year for crypto. Both market giants like $BTC and $ETH, and low-cap wildcards like $PENGU and $TROLL, have been painting the charts green, racking up good gains for early investors. Looking ahead, the momentum shows no signs of slowing. Big institutions are gobbling up $BTC and $ETH like it’s a Black Friday sale. Crypto ETFs are widely expected to get the green light by Q3 according to James Seyffart. And mainstream adoption continues to surge thanks to improving regulation and scalability breakthroughs. So, to help you unearth high-potential tokens, we turned to ChatGPT, the world’s most popular (and arguably most powerful) AI chatbot. Thanks to its ability to analyze massive troves of on-chain data, market sentiment, social trends, and real-time developments, GPT is surprisingly capable of spotting high-potential cryptos before the herd catches on. Sure, that was in stocks, but it proves the AI’s ability to crunch numbers and make smart picks in volatile markets. So, keep reading to discover ChatGPT’s top picks for the best crypto to buy right now, complete with insights into what makes these projects noteworthy. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building a new Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that will integrate with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). By adding Solana-style capabilities and bridging to the Bitcoin Layer 1, Hyper delivers ultra-fast transactions, low fees, and full Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin ecosystem – all while maintaining the network’s top-tier security. Given Bitcoin’s lofty price predictions – Standard Chartered says it could hit $200K by year-end – ChatGPT picking a Bitcoin-themed token as the best altcoin to buy now isn’t all that surprising. So, how does it work? A decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge will let you interact with the SVM-powered Web3 environment on Hyper’s Layer-2. The bridge mints an equivalent wrapped amount of your native $BTC on the Bitcoin Hyper network, ready for use on various side-chain platforms and dApps. These ‘wrapped’ tokens are fully compatible with the Layer 2 and can be used for: All without having to put up with Bitcoin’s painfully slow speeds. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin Hyper’s presale is progressing faster than Usain Bolt; it has already raised $7.4M+, with several whale purchases ($74.9K, $54.1K, $37.9K, and $19.6K) in past three months alone. As for the upside, $HYPER could surge up to 2,449% and hit $0.32 by the end of 2025. Right now, you can buy Bitcoin Hyper for a low price $0.01255. Visit Bitcoin Hyper for more information. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers Best Wallet, a free crypto wallet that solves the most common issues associated with crypto on-boarding – confusing tech and stressful secret key management. Best Wallet is not just easy to use, though. It’s also versatile, which perfectly positions it to benefit from the rapidly growing global crypto wallet market, which is expected to reach $57.61B by 2029 at a CAGR of 31.9%. Security-wise, this wallet is non-custodial and relies on Multi-Party Computation to secure private keys. In plain English, you won’t have to worry about data leaks or hacks. Your wallet’s secret key is split between your device and a private server, never being fully revealed to any external source. It’s also very intuitive. You can go from making your first wallet to swapping tokens across top blockchains within minutes. Holding the $BEST token also gives you lower fees. One of Best Wallet’s features worth mentioning is its Presale Aggregator, which lets you buy the best crypto presales directly from within the app. This sets a new benchmark for convenience in the wallet industry, as you don’t have to visit any external presale sites. Buying $BEST right now (at just $0.025445 per token) will give you early access to this presale aggregator, plus governance rights and generous staking rewards (currently 93% APY). The project has in total raised over $14.5M in early investor funding, with a new price increase due in 12 hours. Now’s a good time to buy $BEST if you want to support the project. Visit Best Wallet Token’s official website. The biggest hub of meme coins, Solana ($SOL), is currently riding both fundamental and technical tailwinds that could push it beyond the $200 mark – and possibly even $300 – by the time Santa Claus comes down through your chimney. One of the biggest reasons to remain bullish on $SOL is the overwhelming likelihood of a spot Solana ETF being approved by the SEC in the third quarter. According to Bloomberg, the chances now stand at a staggering 95%. Such approval could significantly increase retail participation, driving up both trading volume and demand. Things look positive from a technical analysis perspective, too. After bouncing off a key support zone, $SOL has now pulled back to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. This is considered a strong bullish signal because it’s often seen as the ‘golden pocket’ where asset prices tend to find support before continuing their upward trend. Interestingly, the support zone in question is the same one that triggered a ~100% rally back in October-November 2024. If a similar move plays out this time, $SOL could climb to around $250 in the current rally alone. The token is currently trading around $169, up 13% over the past month. The best part is that you can readily find Solana on Binance and other top crypto exchanges. Overall, ChatGPT’s list of recommendations included a fantastic blend of low-cap presale gems, like $HYPER and $BEST, and established, proven performers like $SOL. So, you can create a well-rounded portfolio for yourself for August and beyond. That said, this article is not financial advice. Remember that crypto is volatile.

More Info OPEC+ will complete the unwinding of its largest production cut next month after agreeing this weekend to boost output by 547,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September in a move that was widely expected by the market and oil industry analysts. What’s next for the OPEC+ oil production policy and the last remaining layer of production cuts of 1.66 million bpd is anyone’s guess. The group of OPEC and non-OPEC producers, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, left the door wide open to any further production adjustment – in either direction – and to all sorts of forecasts and analyses by market watchers and investment banks. The group of eight major OPEC+ producers agreed on Sunday, as expected, to continue with the rollback of the 2.2 million bpd cuts. This will see the alliance roll back all these cuts, and the UAE adding 300,000 bpd by the end of next month. The short-term strategy is clear. The strategy for after September—anything but. “The big question now remains whether prices can be sustained into the autumn months as global demand slows and Trump’s tariffs impact global trade,” analysts at Saxo Bank said in a note on Monday. Autumn Blues The OPEC+ producers cited “current healthy oil market fundamentals and steady global economic outlook” to justify the continued rollback of the output cuts, as they have been doing since early spring. The group is betting on peak summer fuel demand, but this will come to an end in September. Near-term fundamentals may be strong, but the market is bracing for a major surplus once the peak demand season ends. Related: Oil Drops as Markets Digest OPEC+ Supply Decision Current demand in the key crude-importing region, Asia, appears to be not as strong as OPEC+ suggests with every press release on its production policy. Crude oil imports into Asia fell in July to 25 million bpd, down from 27.88 million bpd in June, per data by LSEG Oil Research cited by Reuters columnist Clyde Russell. Asia’s July crude imports slumped to the lowest monthly level in exactly a year, according to the data. China is boosting imports, but it’s likely that these have been opportunistic purchases at lower oil prices when June and July-loading cargoes were arranged. Chinese refiners have been building up stockpiles in recent months, as it’s estimated that China has been adding just over 1 million bpd to its stockpiles so far this year. The volatile prices and the spikes in oil in June during the Israel-Iran war may have influenced buying for cargoes set to arrive in China in August and September, and these could be lower, due to the price hikes. Looking at fundamentals, the market appears to be headed to a glut in the fourth quarter of the year, analysts concur. “While OPEC+ policy remains flexible, we assume OPEC+ will keep its production quota unchanged after September as we expect the pace of builds in OECD commercial stocks to accelerate and seasonal demand tailwinds to fade away,” Goldman Sachs said earlier this week. The investment bank kept its oil price forecast for Brent crude, seeing the international benchmark averaging $64 over the fourth quarter of the year despite recent developments that have pushed both Brent and West Texas Intermediate higher than Goldman’s Q4 target. “We believe the group is finished with its supply hikes, as we move out of the stronger summer demand period and inventories start to rise,” ING commodities strategists Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey said on Monday. Geopolitical Upside The group hasn’t signaled any direction for after September, but the producers warned that the rollback of the cuts could be subject to change. “The phase-out of the additional voluntary production adjustments may be paused or reversed subject to evolving market conditions,” OPEC said. This leaves the market hanging and guessing which geopolitical or trade event could overshadow fundamentals and warrant a new OPEC+ intervention sooner than thought. The messaging from the latest meeting is “all options remain on the table — including bringing those barrels back, pausing increases for now, or even reversing the recent policy action,” Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Bloomberg. The most immediate material change in market balances could be the U.S. seeking to choke off Russian supply to India and Turkey, if Putin lets the August 8 deadline to seek peace in Ukraine lapse without any action. Analysts assume that Russia and China will find a way to keep crude trade flowing after a short period of adjustment or deeper price discounts for Russia’s crude. India and Turkey are more vulnerable, and if they stop buying Russian oil, OPEC+ will have to tap into the last layer of 1.66 million bpd production cuts and return them to the market sooner than planned, which is by late 2026. President Trump is threatening he would be “substantially raising” the tariff on India as “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine.” “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits,” President Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. The Trump Administration’s potential move to severely restrict Russian oil shipments could reduce and even erase the expected surplus on the market in late 2025. But it is uncertain how long President Trump’s campaign pledge “I’ll end the war in Ukraine on day one in office” will take and whether the U.S. will move to impose secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian oil. The Trump Administration wants low oil and energy prices, which would be inconsistent with hiking the barriers to Russian oil exports. Amidst all these geopolitical frictions and power plays, OPEC+ is watching and waiting for the right time to unwind the last remaining production cuts and reclaim market share lost to U.S. shale.
