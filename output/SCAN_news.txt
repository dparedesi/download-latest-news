Title: As activist Starboard engages constructively, here’s a potent prescription for Pfizer’s future success under Dr. Bourla’s watch

Full Content:
Last week, we stood in support of Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla, responding to unfounded attacks on him in the media from anonymous sources, and we expressed our initial skepticism about aspects of Starboard Value’s activist position in our Fortune column. This was fortified by a meticulously detailed, original 36-page research slide deck. We received thunderous positive feedback—and many experts joined us in questioning the activist assault on Pfizer. That chorus of public skepticism grew louder after Starboard’s Jeff Smith presented his highly-anticipated slide deck yesterday during a special CNBC interview with David Faber and at Ken Squire’s 13D Conference, with critics noting it contained a lengthy case for change but few remedies or solutions. However, what we noted was a subtle shift in Starboard’s approach, with Smith asserting “We’re excited about what’s there… and we think the future [of Pfizer] will be better than people think.” He refused to be baited into calling overtly for CEO change, declaring “I don’t know why we need to be nasty. We like to work with everybody [there]”. Smith is right: Pfizer’s future, under Dr. Bourla’s leadership, could indeed be much brighter than many expect. Here’s how Dr. Bourla is already well on his way toward getting Pfizer back on track—as well as the next steps Pfizer needs to take to turbocharge its prescription for success. As Smith accurately pointed out yesterday, Pfizer’s stock is trading at a historically depressed valuation (low multiple of 10x earnings), largely the result of low expectations from Wall Street analysts and investors for Pfizer’s future growth. A series of high-profile recent misses over the last two years—ranging from COVID-19 vaccine demand collapsing faster than Pfizer expected to capital allocation concerns with a slump in sales of Nurtec after Pfizer acquired the migraine drug from Biohaven for ~$11.6 billion to the recall of Oxbryta after Pfizer acquired the sickle cell disease drug from GBT for ~$5.4 billion to setbacks in GLP-1 drug development—hasn’t helped. As a result of these setbacks, as Smith pithily noted, “investors and analysts just don’t believe that [Pfizer] is going to produce what they hoped to produce…but for sure, those [low expectations] aren’t right. Could Pfizer do better? Of course.” Smith is correct: Not only could Pfizer prove these low expectations wrong but it also appears Pfizer is already back on track operationally and poised to raise the bar significantly. Investors and analysts should be paying much closer attention to at least three key near-term revenue drivers that they are currently underappreciating. First and foremost, much of Pfizer’s future comes down to whether or not its bet-the-farm, transformative $43 billion acquisition of Seagen will pay off, especially since the Seagen acquisition was bigger than all of Pfizer’s other recent acquisitions combined. Analysts were bearish on the Seagen deal from the outset, and that hasn’t really changed, but the facts are that the returns on investment from Seagen so far are surpassing even the most optimistic expectations, as we describe in more depth in our 36-page slide deck. If anything, with flagship cancer drug PADCEV continuing to outperform, it looks like Pfizer may have gotten a steal and underpaid for Seagen, paying one of the smallest acquisition premiums of any recent comparable pharma. Second, while migraine drug Nurtec got off to a slow start, this was fully expected and anticipated by Pfizer management, who expected it would take at least a year to plug it into a very different distribution, staffing, and marketing system. But now, thanks in part to proactive advice from the highly respected Biohaven team, which remains highly incentivized financially to ensure Nurtec succeeds, sales have re-accelerated in recent quarters, and the drug seems to be well on its way towards becoming one of the blockbuster drugs (generating at least $1 billion in annual sales) in the crown jewels of Pfizer’s portfolio. Furthermore, Pfizer retains further upside optionality around oral Nurtec candidates still in the research and development (R&D) pipeline. Third, the COVID-19 vaccine franchise may be showing promising signs of stabilization after Pfizer dramatically overestimated vaccine demand last year, with many expecting earnings beats and upward revisions from resurgent waves of COVID-19 around the world, especially with many contracts set to re-price. At a minimum, Pfizer is likely now past rock bottom in vaccine demand. Even beyond Pfizer’s operational misses over the last two years, another key reason why Wall Street has such low expectations for Pfizer’s future growth may be because, plainly, they have little understanding of Pfizer’s pipeline, little visibility into what might hit and when, and what Pfizer’s own outlook is moving forward. As some analysts have aptly observed, “There is a lot of value to be unlocked across vaccines, oncology, and obesity, but the Street is unsure of what it will take to move shares higher or get investors to own the stock”. Dr. Bourla is already well on his way towards getting Pfizer back on track operationally—but the more pressing challenge for Pfizer at this point may be in communicating their story more proactively and attractively to the investment community. In the near term, upcoming quarterly earnings calls will be crucial opportunities to provide detailed updates on the successes of the Seagen, Nurtec, and COVID-19 franchises; but all eyes will be on earnings guidance provided for 2025. Analyst expectations are low, and some seem to think an earnings-per-share (EPS) forecast in the ~$2.75 – $3.00 range would go a long way towards restoring investor faith and management credibility. Furthermore, Pfizer can reclaim the narrative when it comes to capital allocation by reiterating its commitment to shareholder returns, not only through its ~6% dividend but also by defining the prospect of potential share repurchases down the road. In the longer term, it’s hard to see any downside to hosting an R&D Day that provides investors with a better understanding of the vaunted Pfizer pipeline, which is widely considered to be best-in-class but may not be priced adequately into Pfizer’s valuation due to investors and analysts having little visibility. Alternatively, an Investor Day could help clarify catalysts for a potential re-rating of the stock. These don’t have to be progress on a potential GLP-1 drug. Yes, GLP-1 companies such as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are having their moment, but the see-saw swings of the pharmaceuticals stock market are notoriously fickle. After all, those now-soaring stocks looked weak during the pandemic for having missed the COVID-19 vaccine boom. If there is an eventual market regime shift away from the exclusive focus on GLP-1s and toward any of a number of emerging fields within pharma with a large total addressable market, such as oncology, vaccines, or neurological drugs, Pfizer would be uniquely well positioned to benefit with deep, durable pipelines in each of those fields. Not all activist engagements are alike. We have never hesitated to call out misguided activists when they fall into bullying and bluster—and have advocated strongly against over-the-top activist assaults at Disney, Norfolk Southern, DuPont, and many other companies. However, we also enthusiastically celebrate activists when they work constructively to drive greater shareholder returns and defend them from unfair attacks. In this case, we’ve been vocal in our skepticism about certain aspects of Starboard Value’s activist campaign against Pfizer, but just as we called out the misleading ad hominem attacks on Dr. Bourla that some anonymous sources blundered into previously we also find recent ad hominem attacks on Jeff Smith by anonymous sources in the media to be deeply unfair. Unwarranted and inaccurate anonymous hatchet whispers that Starboard’s launch was “the worst first week in an activist campaign in the history of Wall Street” are just too much. At a minimum, Starboard—and Smith—deserve much more credit than what has been accorded so far for their relentless focus on driving investment returns at Pfizer, and for taking a constructive, savvy approach since meeting with management last week. Similarly, critics unfairly bemoaned what they perceived to be a loss of credibility for Starboard after former Pfizer CEO Ian Read and CFO Frank D’Amelio apparently switched sides, but as we explained previously, we believe Read’s excessive cost-cutting approach left Pfizer’s pipeline depleted, and left deep challenges for Bourla to clean up. Perhaps Starboard could do without the occasional asides about removing CEOs at other companies, which ended up getting misquoted and misconstrued into highly disrespectful, unwarranted, and premature calls for Bourla’s removal. Nevertheless, as Pfizer shareholders ourselves with small positions, and knowing and respecting both sides, we objectively, independently, hope and believe Smith’s encouragingly constructive engagement could potentially turn into a positive for all involved. Listening to activist investors can be a chore for many management teams and boards, who tend to think of activists as massive distractions taking them away from the business of actually running their enterprises or attention-hungry gadflies who merely take credit for changes already underway. While these critiques are not without truth, the savviest leaders know how to leverage activist involvement to accelerate turnarounds. There can be nothing quite as effective as the specter barbarians at the gates to rally employees, sharpen organizational focus, and accelerate changes that may otherwise be hard to pull off. Pfizer’s board needs no prodding, as they have shown their responsiveness to shareholders by having two of its three largest shareholders represented on the board, through State Street CEO Cyrus Taraporevala, the recent addition of former Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley, alongside other stars such as Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey and former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb. Pfizer is already getting back on track, but an even more potent prescription for success could be in the cards for the pharmaceutical giant under Dr. Albert Bourla’s continued leadership.

Title: Tesla's Surprise Earnings Beat
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/24/teslas-surprise-earnings-beat/
Time Published: 2024-10-24T16:00:58Z

This photograph shows the logo of US company "Tesla" displayed at the Paris Motor Show at Paris Expo ... [+] Porte de Versailles in Paris on October 16, 2024. (Photo by JULIEN DE ROSA / AFP) (Photo by JULIEN DE ROSA/AFP via Getty Images) Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted a better-than-expected set of Q3 2024 earnings. Revenue for the quarter rose 8% year-over-year to $25.18 billion a year earlier, while net income was up almost 17% to $2.17 billion. The earnings beat and commentary from CEO Elon Musk indicating that volume growth for next year could be much stronger sent the stock up by close to 12% in after-hours trading. Notably, much of the upside came from regulatory credit sales and Tesla’s often-overlooked energy business. A couple of factors have driven Tesla's earnings bump. Deliveries for the quarter rose by about 6.4% compared to last year to 462,890 vehicles, marking the company's first quarter of growth in 2024. Average selling prices continued to trend lower, coming in at under $40,700 for Q3, down almost $1,000 compared to the previous quarter as price cuts, weaker product mix for the mainstream S, X, Y and 3 models, as well as highly discounted financing options. Now a bulk of Tesla's earnings lift came from the sales of about $739 million in automotive regulatory credits. As an EV manufacturer, Tesla earns regulatory credits that it can sell to traditional automotive manufacturers who are unable to meet government-mandated zero-emission vehicle sales targets. These credit sales, which we estimate are almost pure profit, are likely to have been a key driver of margins for the quarter. Gross margins for automotive sales stood at 16.4%, up from 15.7% in the year-ago quarter likely driven by lower costs, better scale and higher revenue recognition relating to fully self-driving software. Read more about Tesla's recent troubles in China. Tesla's Energy business, which includes energy storage products and solar energy systems, was a bright spot. In Q3, revenue rose 52% to $2.38 billion, driven by strong Powerwall deployments and progress in scaling the latest Powerwall 3 and the Lathrop Megafactory. Storage deployments grew 75% year-over-year, and profitability too improved, with gross margin hitting a record 30.5%, up from 24% a year ago. The Shanghai Megafactory is on track to start shipping Megapacks in Q1 2025, which could further boost sales. Demand for energy storage solutions is expected to grow alongside increased installations of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Overall, the performance of TSLA stock with respect to the index over the last 4-year period has been quite volatile. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -65% in 2022, and 102% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could TSLA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? We maintain our view that Tesla will be a big beneficiary of the long-term transition to cleaner transportation and energy generation, given its well-oiled supply chain, superior battery, and drive-train technologies, and its lead with car software and self-driving technology. That said, the company's overall deliveries are facing pressure, falling well below the company's multi-year target of 50% annual growth in deliveries. A lack of extensive charging networks in many countries, and falling resale values for EVs are likely discouraging potential buyers in the interim. However, Tesla's CEO indicates that 20% to 30% delivery growth next year is a possibility. Tesla could also see some upside from its robo-taxi business. While the company unveiled the new cabs earlier this month, it intends to officially roll out ridesharing in Texas and California sometime next year and this could also drive growth, given the massive size of the ride-sharing market. Learn more about the robo-taxi business Waymo Is Worth $5 Trillion For Alphabet Stock. We value Tesla stock at $240 per share, which is roughly in line with Thursday's pre-market price of $239 per share.

Read more We initiate coverage on Hyundai Motor India (HMIL) with REDUCE (TP of Rs1,750, at ~23x core Sep-26E PER, similar to MSIL) amid a lackluster ~5% EPS CAGR over FY24-27E. HMIL has established a strong franchise in India; however, lack of major launches (key growth driver historically in PVs) over the next 12-18M, muted ~5% capacity CAGR, higher royalty, and lower treasury income are likely to restrict EPS growth. While MSIL (REDUCE) also faces similar near-term growth challenges, we prefer it over HMIL given its catch-up on operational and financial metrics (even on lower SUV mix) with a much diversified product and powertrain mix and a higher growth optionality (potential small-car recovery, aggressive 8% capacity CAGR, 7-seater SUV launch in H2FY26E, and 10 new models by 2030) driving a superior 6%/10% revenue/EPS CAGR over FY24-27E. Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) shares listed at ₹1,934 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) today, marking a discount of 1.3 per cent to its issue price of ₹1,960. The stock further declined to ₹1,923.25 in early trading, down 0.56 per cent from its opening price. On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the shares opened at ₹1,931.00. The ₹27,870 crore initial public offering (IPO), the largest in India’s history, had received a lukewarm response during its three-day subscription period.

The IPO witnessed a moderate subscription, with an overall bid of 2.3 times. The subdued grey market premium (GMP) of ₹67 (3.42%) ahead of listing had already indicated limited enthusiasm for listing gains, and the company’s fully priced valuation contributed to the muted debut. Despite the discounted listing, Hyundai Motor India’s strong fundamentals, being the second-largest passenger vehicle manufacturer in India and its strategic focus on the SUV segment, continue to support its long-term growth prospects. Investors who entered with a long-term perspective may consider holding the stock, as future performance will likely be driven by the company’s competitive market position and product innovations.

This increase follows a five-year low of 3.65% in August. 2)The food inflation, which accounts for around half of the overall CPI basket, jumped to 9.24 per cent in September from 5.66 per cent in the previous month, the data showed. The inflation rate for vegetables grew 35.99 per cent in August as against 10.71 per cent in the previous month, while pulses & products inflation eased to 9.81 per cent as against 13.6 per cent in August. 3)Rural inflation quickened to 5.87 per cent as against 4.16 per cent in August, whereas urban inflation accelerated to 5.05 per cent as compared to 3.14 per cent in the previous month. 4)India’s wholesale inflation rose to 1.84% in September from 1.31% in August, driven by changes in the Wholesale Price Index covering primary articles, fuel, and manufactured products. The RBI’s MPC retained the repo rate and adjusted inflation projections, maintaining a neutral stance amidst varied inflation and growth trends. 5)India’s forex reserves contracted by $10.7 billion to $690 billion as of October 11, with foreign currency assets reducing by $10.5 billion to $602 billion. Gold reserves and SDRs also saw a dip, while the RBI continues managing market volatility to prevent steep rupee depreciation. 6)India’s merchandise trade deficit narrowed to a five-month low of $20.78 billion in September as imports grew at the slowest pace in six months and exports rose marginally after two months of decline, the official data showed. The trade deficit, or the gap between imports and exports, had widened to a 10-month high of $29.65 billion in August. Goods worth $55.36 billion were imported last month, up 1.62 per cent compared to the year-ago period, amid softening global petroleum prices. In September, exports rose by 0.5 per cent to $34.58 billion due to muted global demand amid geopolitical challenges, according to the data. 7)According to Primedatabase, in H1FY25, funds raised by NBFCs from debt capital markets totaled to Rs 3.23 trillion, up 3.11 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) during the same period last year. In 2024 so far (upto September), this number adds up to Rs 5.09 trillion, up almost 4 per cent Y-o-Y. 8)India’s GDP is expected to grow at 6.95% in the current financial year, which is about 25 basis points (bps) lower than the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) forecast, according to a note by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). 9)At the India Credit Forum hosted by Bloomberg, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das addressed key economic concerns, stating that inflation in October is expected to remain sticky but may ease in November and December, although upside risks persist. He emphasized that the RBI is not behind the curve on policy rates and the upcoming December decision will hinge on the inflation outlook rather than external factors like U.S. elections. Das clarified that the RBI doesn’t manage exchange rates but responds to market demand and supply, countering market assumptions. Regarding growth, he highlighted that India, as a large economy, must rely on multiple growth levers, not solely manufacturing or services. He also noted the need for more institutional investors, especially Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), in India’s bond markets, where only 15% of the allocated space is currently utilized. However, FIIs’ biggest hurdle remains the complex KYC process and UBO declarations, which are constrained by FATF regulations. 10)The mutual fund industry AUM hit an all-time high of Rs 67.90 lakh crore in September, led by net inflows across open-ended categories and mark-to-market (MTM) gains in the equity market. The industry’s AUM increased from Rs 66.70 lakh crore in August, reflecting growth of Rs 0.39 lakh crore or 0.58% over the previous month, according to a monthly note by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). WORLD 1)OPEC said in its monthly report that the world oil demand will rise by 1.93 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 -106,000 barrels per day less previously estimated, or the growth of 2.03 million bpd it expected last month. 2)As of October 17, 2024, the US initial jobless claims were 241,000, which is a 7.31% decrease from the previous week and a 14.22% increase from one year ago. 3)The price index for US exports fell 2.1% year-on-year in September, the largest 12-month decrease since January 2024. This was due to lower prices for nonagricultural exports, which more than offset higher agricultural export prices. The price index for US imports fell 0.1% year-on-year in September. This was due to cheaper energy products. 4)Retail Sales in the United States increased 1.7% year-on-year in September 2024, the smallest yearly gain since January, following an upwardly revised 2.2% rise in August. Retail Sales YoY in the United States averaged 4.74 percent from 1993 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 52.50 percent in April of 2021 and a record low of -19.90 percent in April of 2020. 5)Industrial Production in the United States decreased 0.6% year-on-year in September 2024, the biggest decline in five months, following a downwardly revised 0.2% fall in August. Mining sank 2.2% and manufacturing contracted 0.5% while production of utilities increased 0.6%. 6)The United States saw a 0.5% year-on-year decline in manufacturing production in September 2024, following a downwardly revised flat reading in August. Over the long term, U.S. manufacturing production has averaged 3.56% from 1920 to 2024, with an all-time high of 67.90% in July 1933 and a record low of -39.40% in February 1946. 7)The United Kingdom’s (UK) ILO Unemployment Rate eased to 4.0% in the three months to August, following July’s 4.1% reading, the data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed. Additional details of the report showed that the number of people claiming jobless benefits increased by 27.9K in September, compared with a gain of 23.7K in August, missing the expected 20.2K print. 8)The annual inflation rate in the UK fell to 1.7% in September 2024, the lowest reading since April 2021 and driven down by lower airfare and petrol prices, compared to 2.2% in each of the previous two months and forecasts of 1.9%. Meanwhile the core inflation rate fell to 3.2% from 3.6% in the previous months. 9)In the UK, producer input prices fell by 2.3% in September 2024, further declining from a revised decrease of 1.0% in August, while producer output (factory gate) prices dropped by 0.7%, down from a revised increase of 0.3% in the previous month. On a monthly basis, input prices decreased by 1.0%, and output prices fell by 0.5% in September 2024. In contrast, UK services producer prices rose by 3.3% in the year to Quarter 3 (July to September) 2024, slightly up from a revised increase of 3.2% in Quarter 2 (April to June). 10)The Retail Price Index in the United Kingdom advanced by 2.7% year-on-year in September 2024, easing from a 3.5% rise in the previous month and below market expectations of a 3.1% gain. On a monthly basis, the RPI fell by 0.3%, reversing from a 0.6% increase in the prior period and compared to market forecasts of a 0.1% rise. 11)The Governing Council decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rates on the deposit facility, the main refinancing operations and the marginal lending facility will be decreased to 3.25%, 3.40% and 3.65% respectively, with effect from 23 October 2024. 12)The euro area annual inflation rate was 1.7% in September 2024, down from 2.2% in August. A year earlier, the rate was 4.3%. European Union annual inflation was 2.1% in September 2024, down from 2.4% in August. The core inflation rate in the Eurozone was 2.7% in September 2024, down from 2.8% in August 2024. 13)The Euro Area recorded a trade surplus of 4583.60 EUR Million in August of 2024. Balance of Trade in Euro Area averaged 5584.95 EUR Million from 1999 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 29946.10 EUR Million in July of 2015 and a record low of -55033.30 EUR Million in August of 2022. 14)Japan’s trade balance shifted to a deficit of JPY 294.24 billion in September 2024 from a surplus of JPY 60.56 billion in the same month a year earlier. It was the third straight month of a trade gap, coming in worse than market forecast of a shortfall of JPY 237.6 billion, with exports unexpectedly shrinking while imports grew. Sales declined by 1.7% to JPY 9,038.20 billion, marking the first drop since November 2023 and missing consensus of a 0.5% rise. Meantime, imports rose 2.1% to JPY 9,332.55 billion, pointing to the sixth straight month of expansion but falling short of estimates of 3.2%. 15)Japanese inflation slowed in September with prices up 2.4 percent on-year, not including volatile fresh food, official data showed Friday. The core Consumer Price Index eased from 2.8 percent to 2.4% percent in August as the pace of increase in electricity and gas prices relented, the internal affairs ministry said. 16)China’s debt-to-GDP ratio hit a jaw-dropping 366% in Q1 2024, a new all-time high. Since the 2008 Financial Crisis, the ratio has doubled. To put this differently, for 1 unit of GDP, the Chinese economy has produced 3.66 units of debt burden. 17)China recorded a trade surplus of 81.71 USD Billion in September of 2024. Balance of Trade in China averaged 16.08 USD Billion from 1981 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 125.16 USD Billion in February of 2024 and a record low of -61.99 USD Billion in February of 2020. 18)The Chinese economy expanded 4.6% yoy in Q3 of 2024, compared with market forecasts of 4.5% and a 4.7% rise in Q2. It marked the slowest annual growth rate since Q1 2023, amid persistent property weakness, shaky domestic demand, deflation risks, and trade frictions with the West. 19)China’s retail sales climbed by 3.2% year-on-year in September 2024 from 2.1% gain in the previous month, easily beating market estimates of 2.5% rise. 20)In September 2024, China’s industrial production increased by 5.4% year-on-year, which was higher than the 4.6% market forecast and the 4.5% increase in August. This was the fastest expansion in industrial output since May and the first acceleration in five months. 21)China’s surveyed unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in September 2024, compared to market estimates and August’s reading of 5.3%. This marks the lowest reading in three months. The jobless rate for locally registered residents decreased by 0.2 percentage points to 5.2%, at which non-local registrants had a rate of 4.8%, while the rate for non-local agricultural registrants stood at 4.6%. In 31 major cities, the urban unemployment rate was also 5.1%. 22)The Philippine central bank reduced its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday for a second meeting and left the door open to further cuts with medium-term inflation expected to stay within its 2%-4% target range.

and Sensex clocked new peaks in September, with the former crossing the psychological 26,000 mark. A bumper rate cut by the US Fed and a resilient American economy bolstered investors’ confidence. FIIs remained net sellers in domestic equities for the fourth consecutive month. Yet, the markets had a hard landing as they set foot into October, facing the sharpest decline since June. Rising tensions in the Middle East and a fresh set of derivative norms did dent sentiments. But the key trigger for correction was the huge selling pressure by FIIs in early October. The massive stimulus by the Chinese government created an opportunity for hot money to look for tactical trade in terms of buying China at the expense of other emerging markets. In fact, the selloffs from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) amounted to Rs. 27,142 crore in just the first three days of October, leading to a decline of 5-5.5% in the Nifty from its recent peak. Fortunately, the BJP pulled off a miraculous victory in Haryana state elections that suddenly changed the mood in the Indian equity markets. The opposition had the advantage of a two-term incumbency against the ruling party, BJP, along with some other crucial factors. However, the BJP has romped home with a comfortable majority which is far ahead of even the most optimistic expectations. The victory in Haryana would boost confidence of their cadre in Delhi and Maharashtra – the two states scheduled to go for elections soon. In terms of events ahead, the market has to deal with Q2 results season, which is likely to turn out to be another quarter of muted growth in Nifty earnings. The consensus is building 4-4.5% growth in the Nifty earnings due to high base effect, pressure on margins and moderation in earnings growth in heavyweight sectors such as banking and energy. Globally, there are elections scheduled in the US. Also, the market would want to watch for progress in the rate cut cycle along with impact of the intensifying Middle East crisis on the crude oil and commodity prices. Given the macro environment and valuation concerns post the rally in post couple of months, it would be healthy if the markets take a breather and consolidate in a range. Moreover, the stock-specific volatility could rise in the Q2 result season as some of the pockets of stocks in the broader market do look overheated with little valuation comfort at the current level. The consolidation phase could offer an opportunity for investors to accumulate good quality stocks at prices that are 10-25% lower than their recent peak. Do keep the big picture in mind. The Indian economy is on a multi-year upcycle with all engines of growth firing like rising infrastructure spending, real estate upturn and beginning of a new privatesector capex cycle.
