(Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is set to announce its earnings on Tuesday, June 3, 2025. For traders focusing on events, grasping the stock's historical behavior around earnings announcements can provide valuable insights. Over the last five years, CrowdStrike's shares have exhibited a pattern of positive one-day returns following earnings announcements in 55% of cases. The median positive return on these days was 9.3%, with the highest single-day gain reaching 13.6%. While the actual outcomes relative to consensus and expectations will significantly impact the stock's trajectory, historical trends can give traders an advantage. Traders may contemplate two primary strategies: Analysts expect CrowdStrike to report earnings of $0.66 per share on revenue of $1.11 billion. This compares to the same quarter last year, when the company disclosed earnings of $0.93 per share on revenue of $921 million. From a fundamental standpoint, CrowdStrike currently holds a market capitalization of $117 billion. Over the previous twelve months, the company realized $4.0 billion in revenue. Nonetheless, it reported operational losses, with -$120 million in operating losses and a net income of -$19 million. That being said, if you’re looking for upside with reduced volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative—having surpassed the S&P 500 and yielding returns greater than 91% since its launch.

View earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights regarding one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional information regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post-earnings is compiled along with the statistics in the table below. CRWD 1D, 5D, and 21D Post-Earnings Return A relatively less risky strategy (although it may not be effective if the correlation is low) is to analyze the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post-earnings, identify a pair that demonstrates the highest correlation, and make the necessary trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader can take a "long" position for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. CRWD Correlation Between 1D, 5D and 21D Historical Returns Sometimes, the performance of peers can impact post-earnings stock reaction. In fact, the pricing-in may commence even before the earnings are revealed. Below is some historical data regarding the past post-earnings performance of CrowdStrike stock in comparison with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings shortly before CrowdStrike. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also reflect post-earnings one-day (1D) returns.

Additionally, if you desire upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock like CrowdStrike, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception.
