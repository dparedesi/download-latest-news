September 28, 2024 15:40 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike faced intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill on September 24 as lawmakers demanded answers for a catastrophic software update that crippled essential services across the nation. Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Nov. 29, 2023 – July 29, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Sept. 30, 2024Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/CRWD Contact the Firm Now: CRWD@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-Tenn.) castigated the company's CEO, George Kurtz, for evading direct testimony and dispatching a subordinate to address the crisis. “This was a systemic failure with far-reaching consequences,” Green declared, “and we cannot let it happen again.” Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s senior vice president, offered a mea culpa for the incident, attributing the widespread outage to a faulty configuration update that caused a "Blue Screen of Death" on millions of Windows devices. However, his apology fell short of assuaging lawmakers' concerns. Congress’ interrogation of CrowdStrike comes on the heels of a September 12 report by SEMAFOR, wherein former CrowdStrike employees painted a picture of a company culture that prioritized speed over quality. Multiple sources described a workplace where mistakes were commonplace, and workers were often undertrained. One former manager even recalled warnings about the potential for catastrophic failures if the company continued to release untested products Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): The outage has also sparked litigation against CrowdStrike, with plaintiffs alleging that the company misled investors about the reliability of its flagship Falcon Sensor product. The complaint accuses CrowdStrike of failing to disclose significant risks associated with its update process and of downplaying the potential consequences of a major outage. The truth began to emerge on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down nearly 16% since the outage.

September 28, 2024 08:07 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
