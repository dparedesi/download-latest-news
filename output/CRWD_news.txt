Shares of Netskope (NTSK) surged Friday, extending gains after making their debut on the Nasdaq Thursday. The stock was up close to 7% around $24 in recent trading, after finishing Thursday's session 18% above their initial public offering (IPO) price of $19 per share. The IPO price was at the high end of the company’s expectations, and the 47.8 million shares sold helped Netskope raise $908.2 million. CEO Sanjay Beri told Yahoo! Finance in a televised interview that he expects going public could help boost the company's credibility and customer awareness. Netskope, which counts companies like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Zscaler (ZS) as competitors, reported a 31% year-over-year jump in revenue to $328 million for the six months ended in July, according to a regulatory filing. It's $170 million net loss over that period narrowed from $207 million a year ago. This has been a strong year so far for a number of cybersecurity stocks, amid expectations the sector could get a boost from strong demand trends as AI-driven threats grow. Zscaler shares have added over 60% of their value in 2025, while CrowdStrike (CRWD) has climbed close to 50%. Palo Alto Networks shares have added about 13%, roughly in line with the S&P 500's rise over the same period.

Title: CleanSpark: Buy The CLSK Stock Rally Before It's Too Late?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CleanSpark stock (NASDAQ:CLSK) has seen a sharp rise, gaining over 40% in the past month. This surge comes after the company reported a 38% increase in bitcoins mined during August, driven by a significant boost in its operational hashrate, which reached 50 EH/s (Exahashes per second)—a critical measure of computing power on the Bitcoin network. The company achieved this milestone in June 2025. The broader cryptocurrency market has also shown strong momentum. Other Bitcoin miners, like IREN and MARA, have posted gains recently. This upward trend has been supported by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates, with further cuts expected—an environment generally seen as favorable for cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin’s near-term outlook looking positive, we expect Bitcoin mining companies to continue growing. A few months ago, we noted that the initial jump in CLSK could mark the start of a larger rally. Since then, the stock has climbed over 30%, and we still see it as well-positioned for further gains. In the following sections, we’ll take a deeper look at CLSK—comparing its current valuation with its operational performance over recent years and reviewing its financial health. That said, if you’re looking for upside potential with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Separately, see – CrowdStrike: What’s Happening With CRWD Stock? Looking at what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CLSK stock appears slightly undervalued compared to the overall market, especially considering its strong revenue growth. Cleanspark's Revenues have grown rapidly in recent years. Cleanspark’s profit margins lag behind most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Cleanspark’s balance sheet appears very strong. CLSK stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during recent downturns. While investors hope for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, what if another recession hits? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash shows how major stocks fared during and after the last seven market crashes. Summarizing Cleanspark’s metrics: • Growth: Very Strong• Profitability: Weak• Financial Stability: Very Strong• Downturn Resilience: Weak• Overall: Strong Overall, CleanSpark has performed well across the metrics we’ve analyzed. Given its moderate valuation, we believe the stock still has significant upside potential. When we look at the competition, CleanSpark appears undervalued. For example, IREN trades at 17 times its trailing revenue, MARA at 8 times, and RIOT at 11 times. In comparison, CleanSpark’s valuation is much lower at 6 times revenues, suggesting it could be poised for growth to catch up to its peers. Now, of course, we could be wrong in our assessment, and investors might continue to value CLSK conservatively, especially considering its historical volatility. We think the long-term outlook is positive. For investors with a risk tolerance and a 3-to-5-year investment horizon, we continue to believe CLSK stock could deliver substantial returns. Still, single-stock investing carries risk. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio—a collection of 30 stocks—has consistently outperformed its benchmark (the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000). This is because HQ Portfolio stocks have offered better returns with lower risk than the index, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
