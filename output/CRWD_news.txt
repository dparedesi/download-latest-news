Title: Paying To Observe It All: Palo Alto Networks Acquisition Of Chronosphere
URL: https://www.forrester.com/blogs/paying-to-observe-it-all-palo-alto-networks-acquisition-of-chronosphere/

Carlos Casanova, Principal Analyst Allie Mellen, Principal Analyst Carlos Rivera, Senior Analyst Joseph Blankenship, VP, Research Director Cybersecurity behemoth Palo Alto Networks (PANW) recently announced the acquisition of observability vendor Chronosphere for $3.35 billion. The acquisition is a departure from PANW’s security pure-play roots, as it will now also sell into technology buyers. This blog explores the reasons behind the acquisition and what it means for PANW and Chronosphere customers going forward. This acquisition has parallel purposes. First and most topically, it provides PANW with visibility as AI systems proliferate. Security vendors can’t secure AI agents if they can’t see what they are doing. Chronosphere provides PANW a data visibility pipeline to feed its XSIAM (extended security intelligence and automation management) solution and future AI detection engines. Chronosphere’s real-time telemetry and data visibility pipelines help PANW move its security platform, Cortex, one step closer toward additional visibility. If PANW successfully integrates CyberArk’s deep identity governance alongside Chronosphere’s observability data, it will have built up foundational capabilities for the discovery, governance, and security of AI agents and agentic AI workflows. As the risks escalate around an expanding attack surface driven by privileged AI workloads, this unification for visibility and control will be vital for closing a significant gap in the security stack for nonhuman entities. Second, as PANW moved into the security imformation and event management (SIEM) market, it recognized the overlapping use cases that many SIEM vendors address: security and observability. Think of vendors such as Splunk, Sumo Logic, Elastic, and CrowdStrike, which have solutions for both use cases. Many Forrester clients use their SIEM vendor for security and observability, thereby reducing vendor sprawl and centralizing data collection and storage. Security observability and operational observability have underpinning similarities in their data pipelines. Some enterprises, especially financial services, value the crossover. Prior to this acquisition, PANW had limited answers to the observability question, but now it has an opportunity to extend its capabilities into the adjacent observability market. This is more than just another headline. It’s a clear signal that traditional buying pattens and personas are under pressure. IT and security leaders are being challenged with platform strategies that dominate and as vendor trust becomes a critical differentiator. A buyer’s journey is often a process of confirmation, not selection. Consumers and stakeholders must: Forrester clients who want to continue this discussion or dive into Forrester’s wide range of AI, observability, and security research can set up a guidance session or inquiry with us.
