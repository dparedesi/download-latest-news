The stock market is in the red, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunging more than 1% on Monday morning as new regulatory measures introduced by President Biden have severely impacted artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. These changes have raised concerns among investors, leading to a sharp sell-off in AI-related companies. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, called the policies “unprecedented and misguided.” In a company blog post, he slammed the outgoing administration for jeopardizing global progress on AI. “In its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America’s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review,” Finkle said. “This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems and even software are designed and marketed globally.” Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+2.85%) fell 3.7% on Monday as the Biden administration unveiled rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. Several AI-related stocks were also down on the Nasdaq, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI+1.93%), Micron (MU+5.68%), and Palantir (PLTR+3.11%), with declines of 10%, 5.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. Other tech stocks listed on the Nasdaq were also down Monday morning, with Apple (AAPL+1.84%), Meta (META+4.19%), and CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD+3.84%) down by 2.2%, 1.8%, and 1.9%, respectively. —Rocio Fabbro and Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Crowdstrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. “Stocks don’t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that’s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it’s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.” If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it’s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea “bogus” and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. “The simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they’re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that’s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,” Cramer added.

Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 74 Jim Cramer was recently asked about Palo Alto Networks. He instead recommended Crowdstrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) as a better buy. ” Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell precipitously, almost 10% over a week, with nothing going on whatsoever. Therefore, that was a disparity with the fundamentals, which I think are excellent. The one to buy right now, at this moment, is Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD), as it’s starting to bounce back. That’s the one now playing offense after we had George Kurtz, the CEO, visit 130 companies in 100 days as part of what you’d call the apology tour for what occurred in the third week of July. I really like that one better now.” Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “A non-benchmark stake in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) (-40%) was the biggest detractor among individual stocks. The shares of this cybersecurity platform provider fell precipitously in July, after a glitch in a CrowdStrike software update led to a global outage for many of its customers that, among other impacts, caused the mass cancellation of flights around the world. After bottoming out in early August, the stock made a partial rebound by quarter end, but we exited the fund’s holding during the summer.” Overall, CRWD ranks 5th on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round.
