CrowdStrike’s senior vice-president for counter adversary operations, Adam Meyers, reiterated his company’s apology today during a House subcommittee hearing and went on to say that the company has launched a configuration update for its Falcon Sensor software system. Meyers was grilled Tuesday afternoon by lawmakers from the House’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection subcommittee over the company’s failure to properly address its faulty software update that led to a global IT outage in mid-July. Following the global outage, companies across the airlines, banking, telecommunications, and healthcare industries were deeply affected for weeks. The outage disrupted internet services, affecting about 8.5 million Microsoft (MSFT) Windows devices, per Reuters. “We are deeply sorry this happened, and we are determined to prevent this from happening again,” Meyers said at the hearing. “We have undertaken a full review of our systems and begun implementing plans to bolster our content update procedures so that we emerge from this experience as a stronger company.” During the grilling session, which was led by Republican Rep. Mark Green from Tennessee, Meyers said CrowdStrike (CRWD) takes “full responsibility” for the international system crashes. He also deemed that the issues were not the result of a cyberattack, nor was it induced by artificial intelligence. “The July 19 incident stemmed from a confluence of factors that ultimately resulted in the Falcon sensor attempting to follow a threat detection configuration for which there was no corresponding definition of what to do,” Meyers said. After the IT incident, CrowdStrike lost about $60 million in contract sales. The cybersecurity firm said that the incident scared off customers who were looking to close deals during the final weeks of the second quarter. Meyers announced during the hearing that the company had taken several steps to sharpen its system and would prevent another outage from happening at this level again. He stated that CrowdStrike will no longer unveil its software updates internationally to all customers in a single session. The company will also allow customers to select when they receive their updates. They have the option of waiting to be the second or third group of clients who will receive the update after it goes public. “Mistakes can happen,” Green said. “However, we cannot allow a mistake of this magnitude to happen again. A global IT outage that impacts every sector of the economy is a catastrophe that we would expect to see in a movie. It is something that we would expect to be carefully executed by a malicious and sophisticated nation-state actor.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

NerdWallet, Inc. does not offer advisory or brokerage services, nor does it recommend or advise investors to buy or sell particular stocks, securities or other investments. In the early hours of July 19, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (CRWD) published a faulty software update that temporarily disabled more than 8.5 million PCs that use its services. The outage caused chaos across banking, airlines, health care and several other industries, and it sent CrowdStrike shares plummeting more than 20% over the following two trading days. It also drew attention to the importance of reliable cybersecurity companies — and to the potential volatility of cybersecurity stocks. Cybersecurity stocks are shares of publicly-traded companies that protect computer systems from digital threats. Some, such as CrowdStrike, Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks, are completely focused on cybersecurity, while others, such as Datadog, Cisco, Broadcom and Dell, are diversified technology companies that provide cybersecurity services along with other offerings. According to Roosevelt Bowman, an investment strategist with Bernstein Private Wealth Management, the effect of major technical outages on cybersecurity companies is hard to predict. “It’s not often that you see a single event ‘doom’ a company,” Bowman says. However, he described two ways in which a bad-news event such as an outage can push down a stock’s price in the long term. The first is if the event in question pushes down a company’s expected future earnings to a point where it looks too expensive at its current price. The second way in which a scandal such as a technical outage can hurt the long-term trajectory of a stock, according to Bowman, is if there are “subsequent failures.” CrowdStrike’s software has been linked with minor computer outages before, although it has never experienced an outage on the scale of the July 19 incident. Only time will tell if it can rebuild its reputation from here.

Bowman says that his firm is “following” cybersecurity stocks, in light of the rising volume of consumer data that needs to be protected from threats. He notes that the shift from in-person shopping to online shopping over the last decade has created “opportunity” for the industry. You’ll need a brokerage account to buy cybersecurity stocks — and you’ll also need to choose between buying individual cybersecurity stocks, like the ones shown in the tables above, or cybersecurity exchange-traded funds (ETFs). There are four cybersecurity ETFs with at least $500 million in assets on the market today. They’re listed below in order of one-year performance.

Title: Alaska Airlines Says IT Issue Led to Delays, Seattle Ground Stop

Time Published: 2024-09-23T15:04:40Z
Full Content:
Alaska Airlines (ALK) said an IT issue was behind an issue with its system that caused flights to be delayed and a ground stop to be issued in Seattle Sunday night. The airline said the issue was resolved around 1 a.m. ET Monday, and told users flight operations and the airline's website should be back to normal. A total of 249 flights from Alaska Airlines were delayed Sunday, about 30% of their total schedule, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. "Last night, we experienced an IT issue that caused significant disruption to our operation—including delayed flights," the airline said in a statement. "The issue has been resolved, but we expect residual impacts to our operation. We sincerely apologize to our guests who are impacted and are working to get all our guests to their destinations." The company also told Reuters that the incident was not the result of a hack or any malicious activity. Earlier this month, the airline lifted its revenue and profit projections for the current quarter, in part thanks to the struggles of competing airlines during this summer's CrowdStrike (CRWD) outage that delayed or canceled thousands of flights. Alaska Air Group shares were up 2.5% to $41 in early trading Monday and have gained close to 5% since the start of the year.

Title: TD Cowen backs CrowdStrike with Buy rating, highlights $116B market opportunity by 2025
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/td-cowen-backs-crowdstrike-with-buy-rating-highlights-116b-market-opportunity-by-2025-93CH-3626848
Time Published: 2024-09-22T23:05:56Z
Full Content:
On Friday, TD Cowen maintained its Buy rating on shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) with a steadfast price target of $380.00. The firm's outlook remains positive as CrowdStrike introduced a comprehensive range of updates to its Falcon platform, which is anticipated to broaden its total addressable market (TAM) to $116 billion by the calendar year 2025. The firm acknowledged potential challenges, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s likely move to limit kernel level access for security vendors. Nevertheless, the firm is confident that such changes will not undermine CrowdStrike's long-term competitive position, citing the critical nature of the Falcon platform's mission. TD Cowen also addressed the issue of customer retention, noting that there have been no significant signs of client turnover following service disruptions. This observation supports the firm's belief that the forecasts for CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue (ARR) by fiscal year 2026 are on the conservative side. The firm's endorsement of CrowdStrike's stock reflects confidence in the company's growth prospects and the strategic value of its product offerings. The Falcon platform's innovations are viewed as a key driver for expansion within the cybersecurity market. The $380.00 price target suggests that TD Cowen sees substantial upside potential for CrowdStrike's stock. The firm's rating and target are based on the company's strategic updates, market opportunity, and resilience in the face of industry challenges. In other recent news, CrowdStrike Holdings has been the focus of several analyst reviews and strategic initiatives. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed a Buy rating on CrowdStrike with a revised price target of $324, following the cybersecurity firm's Fal.Con 2024 conference. The company's Falcon Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) product was highlighted, contributing to more than a 65% average increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). Scotiabank, Truist Securities, CapitalOne, and Piper Sandler maintained their respective ratings, reflecting confidence in CrowdStrike's growth potential despite uncertainties surrounding near-term financial projections. CrowdStrike exceeded expectations in its second fiscal quarter in terms of ARR, revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share, although the guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2025 fell short of consensus estimates. The company's management reiterated their long-term ARR goal of $10 billion by the fiscal year 2031. To achieve this, CrowdStrike launched strategic initiatives such as CrowdStrike Financial Services and established partnerships with Dazz and 1Password to enhance cloud security measures. These recent developments follow CrowdStrike's successful navigation through a major challenge earlier this year when a software update led to global outages. The company's crisis management skills were put to the test and subsequently showcased at their Fal.Con 2024 event. The company's ability to acquire new customers, as well as its strategies for upselling and cross-selling, are expected to be key factors influencing the company's revenue through 2025. As CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) continues to innovate and expand its Falcon platform, real-time data from InvestingPro aligns with TD Cowen's optimistic view of the company's growth potential. With a robust market cap of $67.99 billion, CrowdStrike's financial health is underlined by a substantial cash position that eclipses its debt, suggesting a solid foundation for future investments and growth. Additionally, the company's impressive revenue growth of over 33% in the last twelve months as of Q2 2025 highlights its strong performance in the cybersecurity sector. InvestingPro Tips further reveal that analysts are expecting net income growth this year for CrowdStrike, which could reinforce investor confidence. While the company trades at high valuation multiples, such as a P/E ratio of 396.59 and a Price/Book ratio of 23.83, these figures reflect its high growth trajectory and market confidence in its strategic direction. Moreover, the company has demonstrated a high return over the last year, with a price total return of 62.99%, showcasing its strong market performance.

September 22, 2024 12:21 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

September 22, 2024 12:03 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 12, 2024, SEMAFOR reported that software engineers at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike “complained about rushed deadlines, excessive workloads, and increasing technical problems to higher-ups for more than a year before a catastrophic failure of its software paralyzed airlines and knocked banking and other services offline for hours.” Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 29, 2023 – July 29, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Sept. 30, 2024Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/CRWD Contact the Firm Now: CRWD@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): According to the September 12, 2024 reporting by SEMAFOR, in the wake of CrowdStrike’s disastrous update to its flagship Falcon Sensor security product that contained a bug that caused a massive overnight outage affecting 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, a certain former employee said “‘[s]peed was the most important thing’” and “‘[q]uality control was not really part of our process or conversation.’” The SEMAFOR article, “CrowdStrike ex employees: ‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” states “[a]lmost two dozen former software engineers, managers, managers and other staff described a workplace where executives prioritized speed over quality, workers weren’t always sufficiently trained, and mistakes around coding and other tasks were rising.” SEMAFOR also reported that “[o]ne former senior manager said they sat in multiple meetings where staff warned company leaders that CrowdStrike would ‘fail’ its customers by releasing products that couldn’t be supported.” The pending litigation focuses on the propriety of CrowdStrike’s representations concerning the efficacy of its AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform, including assurances that its technology was “validated, certified, and tested.” The complaint alleges that CrowdStrike’s assurances were false and misleading because the company failed to disclose that: (1) it instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to the company. The company’s assurances came into question beginning on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” The news was accompanied by several analyst downgrades with one at Guggenheim downgrading CrowdStrike from buy to neutral, reportedly writing that “[t]he restoration of its reputation may take more time and will likely affect new business signings at least in the near-term.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down $84.24 (-24%) since July 18, 2024.

September 21, 2024 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD), DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC), and Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV) Class Period: February 22, 2024 - July 8, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants (1) grossly overstated their ability to forecast the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior products, which forecasting ability was far less capable and effective than Defendants had led investors and analysts to believe; (2) overstated the financial prospects of SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE, and thus overstated the Company's anticipated revenue and other financial metrics; (3) knew or recklessly disregarded that because of the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior's products, Indivior was unlikely to meet its own previously issued and repeatedly reaffirmed FY 2024 net revenue guidance, including its FY 2024 net revenue guidance for SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE; (4) knew or recklessly disregarded that Indivior was at a significant risk of, and/or was likely to, cease all sales and marketing activities related to PERSERIS; and (5) knew or recklessly disregarded that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

(NASDAQ: CRWD) Class Period: November 29, 2023 - July 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit. For more information on the CrowdStrike class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CRWD DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) Class Period: May 26, 2021 - May 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants misrepresented its ongoing “transformation journey” and the Company’s ability to integrate previously acquired companies and business systems. While touting its ongoing success in implementing that integration, DXC repeatedly stressed its commitment to reducing the Company’s restructuring and transaction, separation, and integration (“TSI”) costs in order to increase its free cashflow and “unleash [its] true earnings power.” In truth, Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the Company was only able to reduce its restructuring and TSI costs by limiting its integration efforts. The complaint alleges that on August 3, 2022, DXC reported disappointing first quarter results, despite having reiterated its guidance just six weeks prior. DXC blamed its poor performance on the fact that its “cost optimization efforts have moved at a slower pace than anticipated.” These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline by 17%, from $31.52 per share to $26.15 per share. Then, on May 16, 2024, DXC’s CEO admitted that “the previous restructurings did not set a real, clean, solid, fully integrated baseline for profitable growth” because the systems that were acquired over time were “never integrated, never deduped,” and admitted that the Company was “not [a] fully functional organization.” DXC also announced it would need to spend an additional $250 million to achieve the restructuring and integration process it falsely claimed to have been successfully implementing during the Class Period. These disclosures caused the price of DXC common stock to decline nearly 17%, from $19.88 per share to $16.52 per share. For more information on the DXC class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DXC Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE) Class Period: December 1, 2022 - July 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided investors with false and/or materially misleading information about Five Below’s financial strength and operations, including its outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024. This information included Five Below’s statement that net sales are expected to be in the range of $826 million to $846 million based on opening approximately 55 to 60 new stores in the first quarter. Further, Five Below claimed that net sales for the full year are expected to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $4.07 billion based on opening between 225 and 235 new stores. Investors discovered that these statements were false and/or materially misleading when, on June 5, 2024, Five Below announced disappointing first quarter 2024 sales result and cut its full year 2024 guidance stating, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $3.79 billion to $3.87 billion based on opening approximately 230 new stores.” At the same time, Five Below claimed that for the second quarter, “Net sales are expected to be in the range of $830 million to $850 million based on opening approximately 60 new stores.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
