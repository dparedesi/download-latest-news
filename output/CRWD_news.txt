Here’s a look at what investors should watch in the days ahead. Target (TGT-1.91%) is set to release its earnings report on Tuesday morning, providing insights into the retail giant’s performance amid shifting consumer spending trends. Later that day, after the closing bell, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (CRWD-9.27%) will announce its earnings.

On Wednesday, semiconductor company Marvell Technology (MRVL-1.56%) will report its earnings after the market closes.

Earlier in the day, grocery chain Kroger (KR-1.23%) and department store giant Macy’s (M-1.09%) will announce their earnings, shedding light on consumer spending habits. The week kicks off with the release of S&P’s final U.S. Manufacturing PMI for February on Monday morning.

Additionally, the Federal Reserve will release its Beige Book, a comprehensive survey of economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. This report is closely watched for its qualitative assessment of inflationary pressures, labor market trends, and overall economic momentum, which could shape the Fed’s future policy decisions. On Thursday, investors will turn their attention to the latest weekly initial jobless claims data along with the U.S. trade deficit report. The week concludes with a highly anticipated set of labor market indicators on Friday, including the official U.S. jobs report, the unemployment rate, and data on hourly wage growth.
