We recently published a list of 10 Must-Watch AI Stocks Dominating Headlines. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other must-watch AI stocks dominating headlines. The artificial intelligence story continues to grow more compelling with each passing day. In the latest news, a top executive at Russia’s biggest bank told Reuters that Sberbank is planning to collaborate with Chinese researchers on joint AI projects. The emergence of DeepSeek has already sparked a rout in the artificial intelligence world owing to its acclaimed cheap and efficient AI models. Ever since its emergence, the race towards AI supremacy has taken on a new turn.

They have talked about cooperation in AI but nothing ever came to public knowledge before this. Sberbank, a Russian banking and financial services company headed by CEO German Gref, has since transformed itself from a former state savings bank into one of the country’s leading players in artificial intelligence. The company released its GigaChat model in 2023. “Sberbank has many scientists. Through them, we plan to conduct joint research projects with researchers from China”. Vedyakhin did not specify who the bank plans to collaborate with, in China. Regardless, a potential partnership between Russia and China over the development of AI is in the works and will be seen as a major threat to the West. This is particularly for the US which is doing everything in its power to acclaim AI supremacy. Putin has directed Sberbank to build cooperation with China and other BRICS nations in AI to encounter U.S. dominance. Similar to China, the country is currently struggling to develop domestic computing capacity as a result of sanctions restricting imports of innovations from the West. Discussing DeepSeek, Vedyakhin has noted that since the launch of its models, Sberbank has compared them to GigaChat MAX, its most advanced model. The comparison has led them to the conclusion that the Chinese rival was superior in scientific tasks, while GigaChat was on par or better in banking. “DeepSeek has proven that even with reduced capabilities, it is possible to achieve quality on par with American models. This raises questions about the necessity of extreme investments when there are engineering innovations”.
