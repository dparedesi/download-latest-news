On Wednesday, semiconductor company Marvell Technology (MRVL+0.88%) will report its earnings after the market closes.

This report is closely watched for its qualitative assessment of inflationary pressures, labor market trends, and overall economic momentum, which could shape the Fed’s future policy decisions. On Thursday, investors will turn their attention to the latest weekly initial jobless claims data along with the U.S. trade deficit report. The week concludes with a highly anticipated set of labor market indicators on Friday, including the official U.S. jobs report, the unemployment rate, and data on hourly wage growth.
