Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher in the first session of the new trading week as tech gains helped pushed major indexes to new highs, with earnings season set to pick up steam later in the week. The S&P 500 advanced 0.8% on Monday, adding to the benchmark index's all-time high Friday for a second straight record close. The Dow was up 0.5%, closing above the 43,000 level for the first time, and the Nasdaq gained 0.9%. Shares of power generator Vistra (VST) jumped 5.6% on Monday to notch the best daily performance of any S&P 500 constituent after BNP Paribas initiated coverage on the stock with an "outperform" rating. BNP also established a price target of $230 on Vistra shares, representing upside potential of around 74% from Monday's close. Vistra surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) last month as the S&P 500's top performer for 2024, riding a wave of enthusiasm around the company's opportunity to provide nuclear-generated power for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. It was also a strong day for semiconductor stocks, with shares of AI darling Nvidia reaching an all-time high after several bullish comments from Wall Street analysts. Citi analysts said yesterday Nvidia is “still king” when it comes to its client base in the AI accelerator market, and that its GPU sales to hyperscalers like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (MSFT) could double this year. Shares of Amentum (AMTM), which began trading last month following a spinoff from the engineering and construction firm Jacobs Solutions (J), were up 5.5%. The gains on Monday came after Truist initiated coverage of Amentum shares with a "buy" rating and $31 price target, suggesting over 9% upside as the company could outperform cost-savings forecasts. Shares of discount retailer Dollar General (DG) dropped 3.3%, marking the heaviest losses in the S&P 500 on Monday. Investment management firm Heartland Advisors published a report pinpointing Dollar General as one of the weakest-performing stocks in its midcap value fund during the third quarter. Shares of competitor Dollar Tree (DLTR) ended the session 3.1% lower. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) shares sank 3%. The downturn reversed a portion of the strong gains posted by the stock last week after RBC Capital analysts included CrowdStrike stock among their top picks in the software space, contending that the cybersecurity firm is successfully navigating the fallout from an incident in July when a malfunctioning software update caused extensive tech outages. However, CrowdStrike still faces potential repercussions from the incident. In its earnings report released last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL) cited the negative impact of the outage and said the carrier continues to seek compensation from the cybersecurity firm. Arch Capital Group (ACGL) shares slipped 2.9% after the specialty insurer announced a shakeup of its executive team. The company tapped Nicolas Papadopoulo to step into the chief executive officer (CEO) role and join the board of directors, effective immediately. Papadopoulo takes the reins from retiring CEO Marc Grandisson, who held the position since 2018. Shares of lithium producer Albemarle (ALB) fell 2.4% on Monday. The British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) announced last week that it would acquire Albemarle competitor Arcadium Lithium (ALTM) in an all-cash deal worth $6.7 billion. Albemarle was reportedly on Rio Tinto's radar as a potential takeover target before the multinational miner decided on Arcadium.

Title: What Happens When a Stock Is Dropped From the S&P 500?

Being listed on the S&P 500 is a hallmark of success for many companies, symbolizing market leadership and investor confidence. However, it's not uncommon for companies to sometimes be delisted from this prestigious index. In fact, the average life span of a company on the S&P 500 is about 21 years. Delisting can occur for several reasons and may have immediate negative consequences for the company and its investors, affecting stock prices and market perceptions. Understanding what happens when a stock is delisted from the S&P 500 is crucial for investors and stakeholders. Read on to better understand the reasons behind delisting, its impact, and how recent examples shed light on this aspect of the stock market. The S&P 500, short for Standard & Poor's 500, is one of the most widely followed stock market indexes in the world. It represents the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. Along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 is considered one of the main benchmarks of the U.S. stock market's health and performance. The index is host to many of the world's most important companies and household names, including the following (by market cap weight as of the fourth quarter of 2024): The S&P 500 has specific criteria for including companies in the index. While the choice by S&P 500 about inclusion is more than just specific measures, these are the main thresholds a company must meet: The S&P 500 is not simply a list of the 500 largest companies by market capitalization. The inclusion process involves careful consideration by the index committee. They meet quarterly to review which companies to add or drop. The committee also monitors for significant developments (such as mergers, bankruptcies, or restructuring) that might affect index composition. While meeting the inclusion criteria is necessary, it doesn't guarantee being included. The committee has discretion when adding new companies. When adding or removing companies, the committee aims to decrease index turnover while ensuring the index represents the large-cap U.S. equity market. The index's composition changes are typically announced with several days' notice. This allows index funds and other market participants time to prepare for the change. Companies can be removed from the S&P 500 for various reasons, which we can broadly categorize into voluntary and involuntary delistings: Some companies delist themselves from the S&P 500 or other major indexes. Reasons for voluntary delisting include the following: More commonly, companies are involuntarily removed from the S&P 500 because of failing to meet the index's criteria. Reasons can include the following: When a stock is removed from the S&P 500, it typically has significant effects on the stock and its investors. Short-Term Consequences: Long-Term Consequences: Companies that fall out of the S&P 500 can be included again. For example, Dell was in the S&P 500 before going private in 2013. The company was relisted in the index Sept. 23, 2024, to mark its 40th anniversary. Being added to the S&P 500 is often a significant achievement for a company. It brings several benefits, many of which are the opposite of being removed from the index: Here are several of the major companies removed from the index in 2024: Whirlpool, a major U.S. manufacturer of home appliances, was removed from the S&P 500 index in early 2024. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of American Airlines (AAL) from the S&P 500 in 2024 reflected broader challenges facing the airline industry and the company's specific financial struggles. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of Etsy Inc. (ETSY) from the S&P 500 was driven by changes in consumer behavior and ever more competition in ecommerce. Reasons for delisting: Effects: Other companies removed from the S&P 500 in 2024 include the following firms: As companies are moved out of the S&P 500 index, new companies are added to take their place. In 2024, the following were some of those added: You don't get your money back when a stock is removed from the index. You still own the same number of shares in the company. However, the value of those shares may decrease, and it may become more difficult to sell them. Index funds are mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. It provides investors with broad market exposure and typically offers lower fees than actively managed funds, as it simply mimics the composition of the chosen index rather than trying to outperform it. This depends on your investment strategy and the specific circumstances of the stock's removal. Stock prices are often negatively affected following its removal. In any case, it's important to reassess the company's fundamentals and prospects. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice if needed. Being delisted from the S&P 500 is a significant event for any company, often leading to immediate and negative consequences, such as a drop in stock price and reduced visibility. It can be voluntary because of a merger, going private, a falling market cap, or not meeting other index criteria. However, it's important to remember that delisting doesn't necessarily mean a company is doomed to fail. Some companies use this as a chance to restructure, refocus, and potentially return more robust than before. For investors, a stock's delisting from the S&P 500 should prompt a careful reassessment of the investment.
