Title: Why CrowdStrike Stock Was Climbing Today
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/20/why-crowdstrike-stock-was-climbing-today/
Time Published: 20240920T160834
Summary: Positive commentary from Wall Street helped lift the stock.
Content: Shares of CrowdStrike (CRWD 8.10%) were moving higher today after the company got a bullish analyst note from Citigroup. The analyst built on earlier Wall Street comments that the company seems to have escaped the worst of the backlash that followed its July incident when a faulty software update shut down flights and banking operations, and disrupted other industries.
As of 11:11 a.m. ET, CrowdStrike stock was up 4.5% on the news.

Wall Street thinks the worst is behind CrowdStrike
This morning, Citi was the latest Wall Street firm to issue a bullish rating on the stock following the Fal.Con conference earlier this week. Citi commended management's transparency on the earlier software update debacle and cited evidence of customer resilience, noting churn is lower than expected and the cybersecurity company has done a good job of maintaining its pricing. 
Citi reiterated a buy rating on CrowdStrike with a $300 price target. While that implies just a 4% rise in the stock, the note is clearly a positive as CrowdStrike is still trading below where it was before the incident happened.
Earlier in the week, a number of other research firms, including DA Davidson, Evercore ISI, Jefferies, and Truist all reiterated buy ratings on the stock and said the customer backlash following the software incident had largely passed.






Can CrowdStrike keep gaining?
It's certainly a good sign that CrowdStrike has survived the worst of the incident, but the stock is still expensive and growth was slowing prior to the outage.
If the company is truly back on track, the stock should move higher, but investors should be mindful of the valuation as its price-to-sales ratio was 20. Expect the volatility in the stock to continue.

Time Published: 20240918T140000
Summary: The cybersecurity stock has been in recovery mode of late, but can it sustain its momentum for the next year?
Content: Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 8.10%) have delivered healthy gains of 56% in the past year. But a closer look at the recent stock price action makes it clear that the high-flying cybersecurity company's rally has come to a screeching halt, thanks to a faulty software update that knocked down many global IT systems on July 19.
More specifically, CrowdStrike stock is down 34% from the 52-week highs it hit in early July. However, the cybersecurity specialist has witnessed a recovery recently. Its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results (for the three months ended July 31) seem to have eased investors' concerns about the fallout of the outage.

Does this mean investors should consider buying CrowdStrike stock now following its recent pullback, in anticipation of more gains in the coming year? Let's find out.
Wall Street seems to be bullish about CrowdStrike stock
Out of 51 analysts covering CrowdStrike stock, 82% rate it as a buy, while only 2% rate it as a sell. It's also worth noting that the stock has a 12-month median price target of $315, which points toward a 21% jump in its shares from current levels. The Street-high price target of $540 suggests that CrowdStrike could jump an impressive 108% from current levels.
The bullish analyst outlook despite the global IT outage a couple of months ago -- which reportedly led to a massive loss of $5.4 billion at Fortune 500 companies, according to cloud monitoring and insurance services provider Parametrix -- stems from the company's modest guidance cut. CrowdStrike has reduced its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance to a range of $3.89 billion to $3.9 billion, down from the earlier range of $3.98 billion to $4.01 billion. That translates into a reduction of 2.5% at the midpoint.





The updated guidance means that CrowdStrike's top line is on track to grow 27.5% in the current fiscal year. Management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the compensation packages to make up for the outage would affect its subs

Title: Major News for CrowdStrike Investors
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/18/major-news-for-crowdstrike-investors/
Time Published: 20240918T090500
Summary: The stock has climbed in the triple digits over five years.
Content: Until July, shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 8.10%) were flying high, having gained more than 50% since the start of the year. And that was part of a triple-digit increase over the past five years. That's as the company wowed existing customers and potential ones with its platform powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to protect their businesses from cyberattacks.
In fact, CrowdStrike has become such a cybersecurity powerhouse that when the company launched a faulty software update in July, the world seemed to screech to a halt. Airlines, hospitals, and other businesses across sectors faced blue screens and couldn't continue with their daily operations.
It launched a fix within about an hour, but some customers took weeks to recover. And the outage could have cost Fortune 500 companies more than $5 billion, according to insurance firm Parametrix.
Following this outage -- which experts call the world's biggest ever -- investors fled CrowdStrike stock, worried about the impending impact. But now, some major news from CrowdStrike offers us an encouraging clue about how this might affect the cybersecurity provider in the coming months.

CrowdStrike's Falcon platform
First, a few details about CrowdStrike's cybersecurity platform, Falcon, which gathers data from across an enterprise and beyond in order to determine potential threats. Customers can choose among 28 modules according to their specific security needs. And a significant number of customers have signed on for several, with adoption rates for five or more modules at 65% in the recent quarter.





All of this has helped earnings to soar. For example, in the recent quarter, ended about two weeks after the July outage, the company reported a 32% increase in annual recurring revenue, a subscription gross margin of 78% under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and record operating cash flow and free cash flow. On top of this, CrowdStrike has more than $4 billion in ca

(NASDAQ: ZS), the leader in cloud security, today announced a new set of AI and Zero Trust integrations with the CrowdStrike Falcon® cybersecurity platform to advance security operations. The latest integrations with Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange™ Platform, Zscaler Data Fabric for Security, and CrowdStrike Falcon® Next-Gen SIEM modernize security operations to provide advanced threat detection, response, and risk management. Security operations center (SOC) teams are under constant pressure to assess and manage risks, detect threats early, and respond swiftly to security incidents–all while facing an increasingly complex threat landscape. Siloed security data streams from disparate sources and arbitrary risk assessment mechanisms across diverse environments create operational inefficiencies and delay response times that increase an organization’s cybersecurity risks and possibility of a breach. “Zscaler’s latest integrations with CrowdStrike represent a significant step forward in our collective mission to ease day-to-day work streams for IT security and SOC teams,” said Punit Minocha, EVP of Business Development and Corporate Strategy, Zscaler. “Together, we can deliver a synergistic approach to risk management, threat detection, and policy enforcement.” “To defeat today’s threats, organizations must transform the SOC by harnessing the power of AI and automation to eliminate blind spots and stop adversaries,” said Daniel Bernard, chief business officer at CrowdStrike. “CrowdStrike’s partnership with Zscaler is a critical step in advancing zero trust enforcement, empowering organizations to transform their SOC, closing the gap between security and IT operations.” The latest collaboration between Zscaler and CrowdStrike delivers: Coordinated Threat Sharing, Detection and Response: Through the Falcon Foundry for Zscaler app, which serves as a foundation for Zscaler’s int

Title: Here's What Delta Air Lines Big News Means to Investors
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/17/heres-what-delta-air-lines-big-news-means-to-inves/
Time Published: 20240917T111000
Summary: The headline numbers were mixed, but management's commentary on industry dynamics was bullish.
Content: The devil is in the details. Despite some mixed-headline numbers from Delta Air Lines' (DAL -0.40%) latest investor update, one aspect of management's commentary is bullish for the company and much of the industry. Here's an unpacking of what management says and why you can feel more comfortable holding the stock afterward.
Mixed-headline numbers
For those investors unaware of summer events, airlines suffered flight delays and cancellations due to a CrowdStrike software update that crashed Microsoft operating systems. Delta Air Lines was particularly badly hit, impacting its revenue and earnings lines.

Investors need to account for the impact (hopefully, a one-off issue) when gauging the company's third-quarter performance and full-year guidance. In doing so, it's clear that two of the three key-operating metrics the airline guides toward align with prior guidance; but one, cost-per-available seat mile (CASM-Ex) adjusted for fuel, is slightly disappointing.
The table below shows that the midpoint of the implied guidance excluding CrowdStrike (fourth column) is 3%, the same as the guidance given in the Q2 earnings presentations. Similarly, implied guidance excluding CrowdStrike is similar for available seat miles.
However, the implied guidance for CASM-Ex is higher than the prior estimate. While a difference of 2.5% compared to 1% to 2% may not appear to be a big deal, it's a closely followed number in the industry, and increasing CASM-Ex will decrease profit margins.

That's one reason the stock sold off initially after the recent trading update on the Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference. The other reason is that management told investors that its full-year earnings per share would be at the midpoint or above the initial guidance of $6 to $7 when excluding the $0.45 impact from CrowdStrike.
On balance, guidance for underlying earnings at the midpoint of prior guidance, but with costs (CASM-Ex) rising more than expected, is a slight ov

Title: Uh-Oh! Alphabet Is Selling Its Stake in 2 Historically High-Flying Artificial Intelligence  ( AI )  Stocks
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/17/alphabet-selling-stake-in-2-high-flying-ai-stocks/
Time Published: 20240917T090600
Summary: These once-sizable artificial intelligence (AI) holdings for Google parent Alphabet have been paired down big-time over the last two quarters.
Content: Five weeks ago, what can arguably be described as the most important data release of the third-quarter occurred -- and I'm not talking about the July inflation report.
No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter (Aug. 14 in the latest instance), institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a clear-cut rundown of which stocks Wall Street's brightest, and often richest, investors bought and sold in the latest quarter. Even though these snapshots are up to 45 days old when filed, it offers invaluable insight into the stocks, industries, sectors, and trends have the attention of money managers.

However, 13F filings are a necessity for more than just investment institutions. Some of Wall Street's largest and most-successful companies hold sizable stakes in other businesses, including Nvidia, and are required to file a 13F on a quarterly basis.
One such company, which has nearly $2 billion invested across 42 stocks, is Alphabet (GOOGL 0.89%) (GOOG 0.86%), the parent of search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous ride-hailing service Waymo, among other ventures.
Alphabet is a search engine juggernaut... and much more!
Most investors are familiar with Alphabet because of its world-leading Google search engine.





In August, Google accounted for a mammoth 90.48% share of worldwide search, per GlobalStats. In fact, Google has held at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back more than nine years. This makes it the undisputed go-to for businesses wanting to target users with their message(s) and affords parent Alphabet unbelievable ad-pricing power.

You're probably also familiar with YouTube, the second most-visited social media site on the planet, with approximately 2.5 billion monthly active users. The launch of Shorts -- short-form videos lasting 60 seconds or
