Title: Best Stocks To Buy If Trump Or Harris Wins In 2024

As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, investors are closely watching how the political landscape might impact their portfolios. Whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris emerges victorious, certain sectors and stocks are likely to benefit. Here's a look at some of the best investment opportunities for each potential outcome. If Trump Wins Energy Stocks. Trump's presidency was marked by deregulation in the energy sector, particularly for fossil fuels. Companies like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) could see significant gains under a second Trump term. Additionally, keep an eye on smaller, more agile players in the shale industry, such as Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). Defense Contractors. Trump's emphasis on military spending could benefit major defense contractors. Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) are worth considering. Financial Services. Trump's administration was known for rolling back financial regulations. Banks and financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) might see reduced regulatory burdens and increased profitability. Infrastructure. Trump has consistently pushed for infrastructure development. Companies involved in construction and materials, such as Caterpillar (CAT) and Vulcan Materials (VMC), could benefit from increased government spending in this area. Pharmaceutical Companies. Trump's policies have generally been favorable to the pharmaceutical industry. Companies like Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) might see continued support and less pressure on drug pricing. If Harris Wins Clean Energy and Electric Vehicles. Harris's focus on combating climate change could further boost the already growing clean energy sector. Consider companies like First Solar (FSLR), NextEra Energy (NEE), and Tesla (TSLA). Infrastructure with a Green Focus. While both candidates support infrastructure spending, Harris's plan emphasizes green initiatives. Look at companies that blend traditional infrastructure with sustainability, such as Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) and Eaton Corporation (ETN). Healthcare Services. Harris's plans to expand the Affordable Care Act could benefit health insurers and hospital operators. UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Cigna (CI), and HCA Healthcare (HCA) are worth watching. Cannabis Industry. Harris has indicated support for federal decriminalization of marijuana. This could be a boon for cannabis companies like Canopy Growth (CGC) and Tilray (TLRY), though investors should be cautious of this still-volatile sector. Technology with a Focus on Cybersecurity. Harris has emphasized the need for improved national cybersecurity. Companies like CrowdStrike (CRWD), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), and Fortinet (FTNT) could see increased demand. Stocks That Could Perform Well Regardless of the Outcome The First Investment to Consider: IWM iShares Russell 2000 ETF (iShares Russell 2000 ETF). Small cap stocks historically rally significantly between election and the inauguration. This exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracks the Russell 2000 Index, representing the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity market. By including IWM in your portfolio, you're gaining broad exposure to a significant segment of the U.S. market, which can help buffer against policy-specific impacts on individual sectors or companies. Big Tech. Despite facing scrutiny from both parties, tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) have shown resilience and continue to dominate their respective markets. Consumer Staples. Companies producing essential goods tend to perform steadily regardless of political climates. Consider stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO), and Walmart (WMT). Healthcare Innovation. The healthcare sector, particularly companies focused on innovation and biotechnology, may thrive under either administration. Look at firms like Moderna (MRNA) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). Investment Strategies to Consider Diversification: Regardless of the election outcome, maintaining a diversified portfolio is crucial. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, even if you're confident in a particular election result. Long-term Perspective: While elections can cause short-term market volatility, historically, the market has trended upward over the long term regardless of which party is in power. Sector ETFs: For those preferring a broader approach, consider sector-specific ETFs aligned with the potential winner's policies. This strategy can provide exposure to benefiting sectors while mitigating single-stock risk. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Given the potential for market volatility around the election, implementing a dollar-cost averaging strategy can help mitigate timing risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of policy proposals and their potential impacts on various sectors. Be prepared to adjust your strategy as the political landscape evolves. While the outcome of the 2024 presidential election will undoubtedly impact the stock market, it's important to remember that other factors, such as global economic conditions, technological advancements, and unforeseen events, also play crucial roles in stock performance. As always, consult with a financial advisor to align your investment strategy with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Tech Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other promising tech stocks. Big tech is expected to outperform in the coming months. On October 2, Ari Wald, Oppenheimer's Head of Technical Analysis, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis and explain why investors must consider high-growth companies. Wald highlights that market breadth is expected to remain high supporting extended highs throughout the end of 2024. In addition to that, he expects the bull cycle to remain intact and believes the trend will continue in 2025. During the late summer, the market saw a change in the high beta versus low volatility ratio stocks. It was seen that high-beta stocks could not keep up with high dividend-paying and lower-volatility names. Given the rotational nature of the market, Wald expects higher beta names to make a strong comeback and reclaim their leadership position. Wald suggests that investors should consider investing in higher growth companies, as the Nasdaq and Russel 100 are expected to lead again. Trends show that the mag seven is growing and climbing, as the market conditions continue to settle. Technology stocks have more room to run. On October 14, Malcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the technology market outlook and revealed his favorite picks. Ethridge suggests that judging stocks based on their valuations alone is a big mistake, especially in the current market cycle which is heavily influenced by the AI boom. Looking at the broader perspective, he believes there are a lot of positive opportunities among the magnificent seven and outside of it. He adds that companies among the mega tech have been pouring billions into generating large language models and the likes of it. He also suggests that most of this technology is yet to be understood and therefore the true value we can derive from these technologies is yet to come. These companies also have a lot of intrinsic value and there is more to be realized soon. Now that we have studied the technology market outlook, let's take a look at the most promising tech stocks according to hedge funds. You can also read our piece on the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. Our Methodology To come up with the most promising technology stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising tech stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?
