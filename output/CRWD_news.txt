Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: FedEx Stock Plunges as Earnings Fail To Deliver

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on the final day of a trading week that saw the financial headlines dominated by the latest Federal Reserve policy meeting. A day after notching an all-time closing high in the wake of the Fed's decision to lower interest rates, the S&P 500 slipped 0.2% on Friday. After wavering for much of the session, the Dow rallied in the afternoon to close with a gain of less than 0.1%, eking out its second straight record close. The Nasdaq ended Friday's session 0.4% lower. FedEx (FDX) shares plummeted 15.2%, the steepest drop of any S&P 500 stock, after the package delivery giant reported lower-than-expected quarterly results and trimmed its full-year forecasts. The company cited soft demand trends, especially in U.S. markets. Following the earnings release, analysts at the investment bank Jefferies reduced their price target on FedEx stock. Lennar (LEN) topped sales and profit estimates with its fiscal third-quarter results, but shares of the homebuilder fell 5.4% after it predicted its gross margin on home sales would remain flat quarter-over-quarter. Friday's downdraft reversed the gains posted by Lennar stock in the previous session following the Fed's rate-cut announcement. Shares of Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) also gave back the gains they notched after the Fed's decision, dropping 5.2% on Friday. The less-than-truckload (LTL) freight company is navigating numerous headwinds, with shipment volumes and rates coming under pressure amid soft freight demand, increasing capital expenditures and a shortage of drivers. Electric utility Constellation Energy (CEG) announced plans to restart operations at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant to provide environmentally friendly energy for Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. Constellation said it inked a 20-year deal with the software giant to create the Crane Clean Energy Center, generating carbon-free electricity to power Microsoft's data centers on the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland power transmission system. Constellation Energy shares soared 22.3% on Friday, notching the top performance in the S&P 500. Constellation's announcement also helped lift shares of other electricity generators, including those of power utility Vistra (VST), which jumped 16.6%. Vistra also announced it will acquire the remaining 15% stake that it does not currently own in its subsidiary Vistra Vision, which includes nuclear, solar, and energy storage assets. Meanwhile, shares of fellow Texas-based power generator NRG Energy (NRG) added 6.4%. Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) gained 8.1% following positive comments from analysts at Citigroup. The cybersecurity firm drew negative attention in July when a faulty update of its security software caused widespread technology outages worldwide. However, analysts applauded transparency from the company's management team following the incident. Citi also pointed to CrowdStrike's success in limiting customer churn and maintaining pricing.

September 19, 2024 12:43 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 12, 2024, SEMAFOR reported that software engineers at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike “complained about rushed deadlines, excessive workloads, and increasing technical problems to higher-ups for more than a year before a catastrophic failure of its software paralyzed airlines and knocked banking and other services offline for hours.” Hagens Berman urges CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 29, 2023 – July 29, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Sept. 30, 2024Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/CRWD Contact the Firm Now: CRWD@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Securities Class Action Against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD): According to the September 12, 2024 reporting by SEMAFOR, in the wake of CrowdStrike’s disastrous update to its flagship Falcon Sensor security product that contained a bug that caused a massive overnight outage affecting 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, a certain former employee said “‘[s]peed was the most important thing’” and “‘[q]uality control was not really part of our process or conversation.’” The SEMAFOR article, “CrowdStrike ex employees: ‘Quality control was not part of our process,’” states “[a]lmost two dozen former software engineers, managers, managers and other staff described a workplace where executives prioritized speed over quality, workers weren’t always sufficiently trained, and mistakes around coding and other tasks were rising.” SEMAFOR also reported that “[o]ne former senior manager said they sat in multiple meetings where staff warned company leaders that CrowdStrike would ‘fail’ its customers by releasing products that couldn’t be supported.” The pending litigation focuses on the propriety of CrowdStrike’s representations concerning the efficacy of its AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform, including assurances that its technology was “validated, certified, and tested.” The complaint alleges that CrowdStrike’s assurances were false and misleading because the company failed to disclose that: (1) it instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to the company. The company’s assurances came into question beginning on July 19, 2024, when CrowdStrike issued an automatic update for its flagship Falcon Sensor security product which contained a bug and caused a massive overnight outage that affected 8.5 million Windows computers around the world, disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters, and the healthcare sector. Many affected machines were unable to restart, instead showing a blue error screen sometimes called “the blue screen of death.” The news was accompanied by several analyst downgrades with one at Guggenheim downgrading CrowdStrike from buy to neutral, reportedly writing that “[t]he restoration of its reputation may take more time and will likely affect new business signings at least in the near-term.” Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that one of CrowdStrike’s customers (Delta Airlines) which suffered more than 6,000 flight cancellations hired a prominent attorney to seek damages caused by the faulty update. These events have driven the price of CrowdStrike shares down $84.24 (-24%) since July 18, 2024.

Title: BofA bullish on CrowdStrike stock despite near-term nnARR and cash flow pressures
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-bullish-on-crowdstrike-stock-despite-nearterm-nnarr-and-cash-flow-pressures-93CH-3622922
Time Published: 2024-09-19T10:23:35Z
Full Content:
On Thursday, BofA Securities expressed a continued positive outlook on CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock, maintaining a Buy rating and a price target of $365.00. The firm highlighted CrowdStrike's strategic initiatives aimed at accelerating growth, including the Falcon Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) program and newly introduced vendor financing options. The company's efforts to drive growth through product and go-to-market strategies were acknowledged, with the expectation that these would sustain the company's growth momentum. Despite potential short-term impacts, such as pressure on Net-new Annual Recurring Revenue (nnARR) growth and cash flow due to incentives like discounting and extended contract terms, BofA Securities anticipates these measures to foster broader platform adoption and enhance customer retention over time. The analyst noted that the impact of vendor financing on free cash flow (FCF) is anticipated to diminish as the financing programs reach their one-year mark. The firm's endorsement of the Buy rating is rooted in CrowdStrike's product leadership, attractive growth prospects, and the potential for total addressable market (TAM) expansion. CrowdStrike's strategic actions, including discounting and contract elongation, are seen as incentives that could potentially affect nnARR growth and cash flow in the near term. However, these initiatives are also viewed as catalysts for long-term platform adoption and customer loyalty. In summary, BofA Securities reaffirms its confidence in CrowdStrike's market position and future prospects, emphasizing the company's strong product offerings and the opportunities for market growth. The firm's maintained Buy rating and price target reflect a steady belief in CrowdStrike's continued success in its sector. In other recent news, CrowdStrike Holdings has been making notable strides in its operational and financial performance. The cybersecurity firm exceeded expectations in its second fiscal quarter with annual recurring revenue, revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share. However, guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2025 fell short of consensus estimates, leading to adjustments from various analyst firms including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Deutsche Bank. CrowdStrike has also announced several strategic initiatives, such as the launch of a new Financial Services arm to facilitate easier terms and access to its Falcon platform. Additionally, it has established partnerships with Dazz and 1Password to enhance cloud security measures and simplify security for small and midsize businesses. The company also appointed Kartik Shahani as the Vice President of India and SAARC to expand its reach in the region. Mizuho Securities, DA Davidson, and Citi have all maintained positive ratings on CrowdStrike, citing the company's unique cloud security platform, superior go-to-market strategy, and success in expanding beyond traditional endpoint security markets. These recent developments reflect CrowdStrike's commitment to maintaining healthy financials and robust security offerings. In light of BofA Securities' optimistic stance on CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD), recent data from InvestingPro shows that the company holds a substantial market capitalization of $65.48 billion, signaling strong investor confidence. This is further bolstered by a significant revenue growth rate over the last twelve months, coming in at 33.07%, which underscores the company's robust growth trajectory as highlighted by BofA Securities. While the company's P/E ratio stands at a high 382.02, indicating a premium valuation, this is reflective of CrowdStrike's strong market position and growth potential. The high price/book ratio of 22.95 also suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets and future growth prospects. An InvestingPro Tip to note is that CrowdStrike is expected to be profitable this year, aligning with the positive outlook presented by BofA Securities. For investors seeking a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers additional insights, including 39 analysts having revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, potentially providing a more conservative outlook on the company's near-term performance. Moreover, there are 15 more InvestingPro Tips available for CrowdStrike, which can be accessed for those looking for a comprehensive investment analysis.

Mizuho Securities has maintained its positive stance on CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:CRWD), reasserting an Outperform rating and a price target of $300.00. The firm's confidence follows attendance at CrowdStrike's annual user conference, Fal.Con 2024, and its investor meeting, held in Las Vegas this week. The analyst noted that despite prevailing uncertainties, conversations with partners and customers at the conference were more favorable than expected. Management's strategy to drive transactions with customers was highlighted as sound and flexible, anticipated to yield increasingly favorable results over time. CrowdStrike's management also conveyed a strong belief in the company's long-term Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) prospects. They reiterated their long-term Free Cash Flow (FCF) margin guidance, aiming for 34%-38%. This is in line with the company's continued success in extending its reach beyond traditional endpoint security markets. Mizuho's evaluation further emphasized CrowdStrike's unique position in the cloud security platform landscape, with unmatched go-to-market strategies. The analyst expects that CrowdStrike's normalized Free Cash Flow margins will sustain at approximately 30% over the medium term. In other recent news, CrowdStrike Holdings has been the focus of several analyst ratings and strategic initiatives. Rosenblatt Securities maintained its Buy rating and $325.00 price target on shares of CrowdStrike, highlighting the company's recovery and progress since a recent incident.

These ratings reflect the company's strategic direction and the continued demand for its cybersecurity solutions. Analyst firms such as BTIG, Wolfe Research, and Mizuho Securities have maintained their respective ratings on CrowdStrike, highlighting the company's strategic initiatives and positive customer feedback. Despite near-term challenges, these firms' outlook on CrowdStrike is bolstered by the company's strategic moves and a clear path to growth. CrowdStrike's management reiterated their long-term annual recurring revenue (ARR) goal of $10 billion by the fiscal year 2031. This target reflects the company's confidence in its strategic direction and the continued demand for its cybersecurity solutions. CrowdStrike has also launched several strategic initiatives, including CrowdStrike Financial Services, a subsidiary designed to provide financing solutions for customers. The company has established partnerships with Dazz and 1Password to enhance cloud security measures and simplify security for small and midsize businesses. In light of Mizuho Securities' reaffirmed confidence in CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD), current InvestingPro data provides additional context. The company's market capitalization stands at a robust $65.48 billion, underscoring its significant presence in the cloud security space. Despite a high P/E ratio of 382.02, reflecting a premium valuation, CrowdStrike's revenue growth remains impressive, with a 33.07% increase over the last twelve months as of Q2 2025. This growth trajectory is further supported by a solid gross profit margin of 75.37%, indicating efficient operations and strong demand for its services. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that CrowdStrike holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which is a positive sign of financial health and may provide resilience in uncertain market conditions. Another tip points out that analysts expect net income growth this year, suggesting potential upside despite the stock trading at high earnings and revenue valuation multiples. Interested investors can find 39 additional InvestingPro Tips on CrowdStrike, offering deeper insights into the company's financial health and market position by visiting https://www.investing.com/pro/CRWD. It's worth noting that CrowdStrike's price has experienced a significant drop over the last three months, yet the company has delivered a high return over the last year. These mixed signals reflect the dynamic and sometimes volatile nature of the tech sector, but also the potential for recovery and growth as indicated by the analyst's projections and the company's strong fundamentals.

On Wednesday, Citi expressed continued confidence in CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD), maintaining a Buy rating and a price target of $300.00. The firm anticipates gathering firsthand accounts and evidence at the fully booked Fal.Con conference, which will shed light on various aspects of CrowdStrike's operations and market position. The insights sought to include the level of competition, particularly from a key competitor identified only as 'S', and customer and partner feedback on pricing and discounting strategies. Additionally, Citi is interested in the reception of CrowdStrike's post-outage customer commitment packages and initial reactions to the newly announced CRWD Financial Services. Citi analysts are also looking forward to the investor briefing scheduled for September 18, 2024, where they expect CrowdStrike to reaffirm its goal of reaching a $10 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR). This comes amid considerations of discounting, pricing power, and the financial implications of CRWD Financial Services. Moreover, Citi is seeking detailed updates on the uptake of customer commitment packages two months following an outage, as well as specific information on profitability and free cash flow. These factors are crucial to short-term model estimates, with investors potentially unprepared for discussions on net retention rate compression and the recalibration of costs associated with doing business. While Citi maintains its Buy rating on CrowdStrike, it anticipates that the shares may experience volatility as the market digests new information and adjusts to the evolving competitive landscape and financial metrics. In other recent news, CrowdStrike, a leader in cloud-delivered cybersecurity, has been making significant strides in both operational and financial aspects. The company recently announced a strategic partnership with Dazz to enhance cloud security measures. Additionally, CrowdStrike unveiled a fully-owned subsidiary, CrowdStrike Financial Services, aiming to simplify procurement and accelerate the consolidation of cybersecurity technologies for organizations. CrowdStrike also expanded its collaboration with 1Password to bolster cybersecurity for small and midsize businesses. The company appointed Kartik Shahani as the Vice President of India and SAARC, to boost the adoption of the CrowdStrike Falcon cybersecurity platform in the region. Financially, CrowdStrike's second fiscal quarter results surpassed expectations in terms of annual recurring revenue, revenue, and non-GAAP earnings per share. However, the guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2025 fell short of consensus estimates, leading to various adjustments from analyst firms. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its Buy rating on CrowdStrike's shares, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan maintained their Overweight ratings, and Deutsche Bank increased its price target due to revised revenue forecasts for FY25 and FY26. As CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) continues to capture the attention of investors and analysts alike, recent data from InvestingPro underscores some of the key financial metrics and trends that may influence investment decisions. CrowdStrike's market capitalization stands robust at approximately $65.87 billion, reflecting the market's valuation of the company. Despite trading at a high earnings multiple with a P/E ratio of 384.18, which suggests a premium on its earnings, the company's revenue growth remains strong. Over the last twelve months leading up to Q2 2025, CrowdStrike has experienced a significant revenue growth of 33.07%, underscoring its expanding market presence and business scale. Furthermore, the gross profit margin is notably high at 75.37%, indicating the company's efficiency in maintaining profitability while scaling its operations. An interesting point to consider is that CrowdStrike has been trading at a high Price / Book multiple of 23.09, which can be indicative of investor confidence in the company's future growth prospects. Additionally, the company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, as highlighted by one of the InvestingPro Tips, providing a cushion for operational flexibility. With 39 analysts having revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, it suggests a cautious outlook on the company's immediate earnings potential. For investors seeking a deeper analysis, there are more than 15 additional InvestingPro Tips available, which can provide further insights into CrowdStrike's financial health and market position. These tips, accessible at InvestingPro's dedicated page for CrowdStrike, can help refine investment strategies and decisions in the context of the company's current and projected performance.

September 17, 2024 14:00 ET | Source: Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC NEW YORK, Sept. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attorney Advertising--Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, a nationally recognized law firm, notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (“CrowdStrike” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: CRWD) and certain of its officers. Class Definition This lawsuit seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired CrowdStrike securities between November 29, 2023, and July 29, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: bgandg.com/CRWD. Case Details The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants repeatedly touted the efficacy of the Falcon platform while assuring investors that CrowdStrike’s technology was “validated, tested, and certified.” The Complaint alleges that these statements were false and misleading because Defendants had failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the Company’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. What's Next? A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to review a copy of the Complaint, you can visit the firm’s site: bgandg.com/CRWD or you may contact Peretz Bronstein, Esq. or his Client Relations Manager, Nathan Miller, of Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC at 332-239-2660.

The reaffirmation follows observations from the first day of CRWD's annual user conference, Fal.Con 2024, held in Las Vegas. During the conference, the firm engaged in numerous discussions with partners and customers. The feedback received was notably more positive than expected, with several large partners reporting no signs of customers moving away from CrowdStrike's services despite the recent high-profile IT outage. Additionally, current discounting practices were found to be limited, though experiences varied. The company is scheduled to hold its investor briefing later on Wednesday, which is expected to provide further insights. Mizuho's stance on CrowdStrike remains firm, citing the company's unique cloud security platform, superior go-to-market strategy, and success in expanding beyond traditional endpoint security markets.

With a substantial market capitalization of $65.87 billion, CrowdStrike demonstrates its significant presence in the cybersecurity sector. InvestingPro data highlights the company's impressive revenue growth, with a 33.07% increase over the last twelve months as of Q2 2025, underscoring its expanding market reach and the effectiveness of its go-to-market strategy.

Moreover, CrowdStrike's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, indicating a strong liquidity position.

September 17, 2024 12:26 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) between November 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased CrowdStrike Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedures for updating its Falcon software platform, and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (2) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of the CrowdStrike’s customers; and (3) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. As a result of these materially false and misleading statements and omissions, CrowdStrike stock traded at artificially high prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the CrowdStrike class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=27534 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Indivior PLC (NASDAQ: INDV) Class Period: February 22, 2024 - July 8, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 1, 2024 The Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants (1) grossly overstated their ability to forecast the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior products, which forecasting ability was far less capable and effective than Defendants had led investors and analysts to believe; (2) overstated the financial prospects of SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE, and thus overstated the Company's anticipated revenue and other financial metrics; (3) knew or recklessly disregarded that because of the negative impact of certain legislation on the financial prospects of Indivior's products, Indivior was unlikely to meet its own previously issued and repeatedly reaffirmed FY 2024 net revenue guidance, including its FY 2024 net revenue guidance for SUBLOCADE, PERSERIS and OPVEE; (4) knew or recklessly disregarded that Indivior was at a significant risk of, and/or was likely to, cease all sales and marketing activities related to PERSERIS; and (5) knew or recklessly disregarded that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

(NASDAQ: CRWD) Class Period: November 29, 2023 - July 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2024 CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats.
