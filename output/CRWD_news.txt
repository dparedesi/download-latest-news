This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings There's no doubt that Big Tech is in the bull market's driver's seat — but it's got company. Though the major indexes are narrowly in the green this October, they have been boosted by third quarter earnings from Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which reported a big beat on investment banking fees. More significantly, the so-called "fins" have rallied alongside three others — tech, consumer discretionary, and industrials — to outperform the S&P 500 since the Japanese yen-induced panic of Aug. 5. All four sectors are up about 15%, with a slight edge to tech. (The low is important technically because it marks the bottom of the year's biggest decline — a quite normal 8.5%). It might seem familiar — and perhaps a bit unnerving — that "tech is leading" once again after the concentration hand-wringing over the "Magnificent Seven." But unlike other periods in this bull market — now two years old — tech has some company, thanks to money flowing, or rotating, into other sectors. It's a process as old as public markets. As the godfather of technical analysis, Ralph Acampora, CMT, famously quipped, "Sector rotation is the lifeblood of a bull market." Ralph's nephew, Jay Woods, who is an executive NYSE floor governor and chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, recently joined Stocks In Translation to break down the concept. "Money's not leaving the market, it's just going from one sector to the next to the next," said Woods, noting the strength in software stocks. He specifically highlighted cybersecurity plays like CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Cisco (CSCO) — both damaged stocks at one time that are now leading. Woods reflects on Cisco's round-trip journey right back to its dot-com bubble highs. "I hate that I like Cisco right now," Woods said. "I liked it in '99, and it's right where it was trading in 1999. That's amazing." In fact, the tech sector leadership of today stands in stark contrast with earlier in the year, when the Mag Seven stocks dominated. Although perennial leader Nvidia (NVDA) is up 30% since the Aug. 5 low, IBM (IBM) is close on its heels — rising from its legacy tech ashes to fresh records. For that matter, more than 20 stocks in the S&P 500 are doing better than Nvidia since the yen low, led by electric power company Vistra Corp. (VST) and United Airlines (UAL) — up 85% and 70%, respectively. Many of these stocks are simply laggards that got beaten up in the 2022 bear market and left behind. But even among the overextended, there are still potential winners to be found. "Put up a five-year weekly chart in utilities for me. Talk about a nice rounded base and then a breakout," Woods said, adding, "[These are] not your grandparents' utilities anymore."

Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher in the first session of the new trading week as tech gains helped pushed major indexes to new highs, with earnings season set to pick up steam later in the week. The S&P 500 advanced 0.8% on Monday, adding to the benchmark index's all-time high Friday for a second straight record close. The Dow was up 0.5%, closing above the 43,000 level for the first time, and the Nasdaq gained 0.9%. Shares of power generator Vistra (VST) jumped 5.6% on Monday to notch the best daily performance of any S&P 500 constituent after BNP Paribas initiated coverage on the stock with an "outperform" rating. BNP also established a price target of $230 on Vistra shares, representing upside potential of around 74% from Monday's close. Vistra surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) last month as the S&P 500's top performer for 2024, riding a wave of enthusiasm around the company's opportunity to provide nuclear-generated power for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. It was also a strong day for semiconductor stocks, with shares of AI darling Nvidia reaching an all-time high after several bullish comments from Wall Street analysts. Citi analysts said yesterday Nvidia is “still king” when it comes to its client base in the AI accelerator market, and that its GPU sales to hyperscalers like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (MSFT) could double this year. Shares of Amentum (AMTM), which began trading last month following a spinoff from the engineering and construction firm Jacobs Solutions (J), were up 5.5%. The gains on Monday came after Truist initiated coverage of Amentum shares with a "buy" rating and $31 price target, suggesting over 9% upside as the company could outperform cost-savings forecasts. Shares of discount retailer Dollar General (DG) dropped 3.3%, marking the heaviest losses in the S&P 500 on Monday. Investment management firm Heartland Advisors published a report pinpointing Dollar General as one of the weakest-performing stocks in its midcap value fund during the third quarter. Shares of competitor Dollar Tree (DLTR) ended the session 3.1% lower. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) shares sank 3%. The downturn reversed a portion of the strong gains posted by the stock last week after RBC Capital analysts included CrowdStrike stock among their top picks in the software space, contending that the cybersecurity firm is successfully navigating the fallout from an incident in July when a malfunctioning software update caused extensive tech outages. However, CrowdStrike still faces potential repercussions from the incident. In its earnings report released last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL) cited the negative impact of the outage and said the carrier continues to seek compensation from the cybersecurity firm. Arch Capital Group (ACGL) shares slipped 2.9% after the specialty insurer announced a shakeup of its executive team. The company tapped Nicolas Papadopoulo to step into the chief executive officer (CEO) role and join the board of directors, effective immediately. Papadopoulo takes the reins from retiring CEO Marc Grandisson, who held the position since 2018. Shares of lithium producer Albemarle (ALB) fell 2.4% on Monday. The British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) announced last week that it would acquire Albemarle competitor Arcadium Lithium (ALTM) in an all-cash deal worth $6.7 billion. Albemarle was reportedly on Rio Tinto's radar as a potential takeover target before the multinational miner decided on Arcadium.
