Title: CrowdStrike delivers better-than-expected Q3 print, lifts annual forecast

Investing.com -- Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) on Tuesday reported a better than expected quarterly earnings and raised annual outlook on the back of strong demand for its cybersecurity products at a time when there are rising online threats fueled by the use of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the company's shares fell 6% in premarket trading Wednesday after its fourth-quarter revenue guidance failed to impress investors. For the third quarter, CrowdStirke's revenue rose about 29% to $1.01 billion, beating estimates of $982 million. It reported a profit per share of 93 cents, above expectations of 81 cents. “CrowdStrike surpassed $4 billion in ending ARR in the quarter - the fastest and only pure play cybersecurity software company to reach this reported milestone - as our single platform approach and trailblazing innovation continue to resonate at-scale,” said CEO George Kurtz. For Q4, the company expects Q4 revenue to be between $1.03 billion and $1.04 billion, compared to consensus estimates of $1.03 billion. It now forecasts its annual adjusted profit per share to be between $3.74 and $3.76, up from its previous range of $3.61 to $3.65. "While the outage impact is still in play, Flex and financial services (CFS) are driving greater module adoption, larger deal sizes, and longer duration contracts," Oppenheimer analysts said in a post-earnings note. "This, combined with customers opting for more modules vs. extended deal terms as part of the Customer Commitment Package (CPP), suggests strong customer commitment and a likely recovery in 2HFY26." "We expect the stock to remain range-bound until investors gain greater clarity around ARR comments, which changed from ARR to NNARR re-acceleration in 2HFY26." RBC Capital Markets voiced similar comments, noting that CRWD management has executed well following the July outage. The incident led to near-term challenges but "should not impact customer lifetime value (LTV)," analysts noted. "The outage weighed on guidance, which we view as prudently conservative, but commentary around a 2H/26 net-new ARR re-acceleration shows confidence in the short duration of expected headwinds," they added. Pratyush Thakur contributed to this report.

The busiest shopping week of the year has arrived, bringing with it a frenzy of questions: What to buy? Where to buy? And how much to buy? Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday mark the start of the holiday shopping season, drawing millions of consumers to stores and online platforms in search of the best deals. And, of course, there’s excitement for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade later this month. More than just a shopping extravaganza, this period serves as a critical barometer of the nation’s economic health. Retail sales during these days offer valuable insights into consumer confidence, spending habits, and the overall financial pulse of the country. This year, holiday sales are projected to reach nearly $1 trillion, a 3.5% increase over the last year, according to the National Retail Federation. To help you navigate the excitement, here’s a curated list of retailers offering deals this holiday season, whether you’re shopping for tech, fashion, or home essentials. Walmart (WMT+0.43%) shoppers have a chance to score deals on both practical items and more extravagant gifts. While Black Friday discounts are available to all customers, Walmart’s loyalty members get exclusive perks, including early access to online deals. Additionally, Walmart is introducing “deal drops” and an AI shopping assistant to assist customers. On Amazon (AMZN+0.41%), Black Friday deals are available to all customers. Prime members often get extra perks, like early access to select deals – sometimes up to 30 minutes ahead of the general public. Target (TGT+1.50%) announced price cuts on 2,000 items in October, adding to the 5,000 products it marked down in May. Target shoppers have the opportunity to snag deals on everyday essentials and higher-end items. While Black Friday discounts will be available to all shoppers, Target’s loyalty members receive additional benefits, including early access to online deals and unlimited same-day delivery. If you want to buy fancy bags from Coach, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and others, check the list here for what they have to offer. This week, investors will see a lighter schedule for earnings reports, with no announcements expected on Thursday or Friday due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The stock market will be closed on Thursday, Thanksgiving day. However, the first half of the week remains eventful. On Monday, Bath & Body Works (BBWI+2.09%) is set to release its earnings results before the market closes. Tuesday will feature a flurry of activity from major retailers. Macy’s (M+1.85%), Burlington Stores (BURL-2.19%), Best Buy (BBY+2.74%), and Kohl’s (KKS) will announce their earnings before the market opens, providing insights into consumer spending trends as the holiday shopping season kicks off. Later in the day, tech giants Dell Technologies (DELL+2.62%) and HP (HPQ+2.74%) will report their earnings after the market closes. Also on Tuesday, cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike (CRWD+0.31%) will release its quarterly results post-market. This update will be closely watched, especially after the company faced a global outage earlier this year, raising questions about its resilience and operational performance. With key sectors including retail, technology, and cybersecurity in focus, these earnings could offer valuable indicators for broader market trends ahead of the holiday break. This week’s shortened schedule due to the Thanksgiving holiday means a lighter-than-usual release of macroeconomic data. However, several significant reports are still on the docket, providing valuable insights into the economy. On Tuesday, the Consumer Confidence Index for November will be released, offering a glimpse into consumer sentiment amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Additionally, new home sales data for October will be published, shedding light on activity in the housing market. In the afternoon, the FOMC minutes meeting will be made available, potentially offering clues about the central bank’s monetary policy outlook and inflation strategy. The economic focus continues on Wednesday, starting with the release of initial jobless claims, a weekly barometer of labor market health. Also on Wednesday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, a key measure of inflation tracking changes in consumer spending on goods and services, will be published. This data is closely watched by the Federal Reserve in shaping interest rate decisions. Additionally, the GDP’s first revision for Q3 will be released, providing an updated view of the economy’s performance during the third quarter. — Francisco Velasquez and Madeline Fitzgerald contributed to this article.

On November 22, KeyBanc raised the price target on the stock to $395 from $345 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The advisory sees a high bar for October security reporters given strong stock performance despite muted Q3 security earnings results thus far, saying its checks have been solid, the advisory told investors in a research note. Results for Crowdstrike were strong, with several partners noting a bounce back this quarter and no mentions of customer migrations away from them, the advisory says. Overall CRWD ranks 7th on our list of the stocks on Wall Street's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
