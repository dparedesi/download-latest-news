ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), a cybersecurity firm, is slated to release earnings on Wednesday, August 27, 2025. For event-driven traders, reviewing how the stock has behaved around prior earnings announcements can offer useful perspective. Over the past five years, CrowdStrike’s one-day move after earnings has been evenly split between gains and losses. In 50% of instances, the stock posted a positive one-day return with a median gain of 9.8%. In the remaining 50%, it recorded a negative one-day return with a median decline of -5.6%. Although the actual results and management guidance typically drive the largest moves, these historical tendencies can still inform positioning. Given the equal split between positive and negative one-day outcomes, trading solely on the event is challenging. Traders might weigh two broad approaches: While earnings can introduce volatility, the longer-term picture has favored investors: since early January 2021, CrowdStrike has advanced about 100%, rising from roughly $210 to $420, far outpacing the S&P 500’s approximately 70% increase over the same span. Analysts currently expect earnings of $0.83 per share on revenue of $1.15 billion for the latest quarter, versus $1.04 per share on revenue of $964 million a year ago. From a fundamentals angle, CrowdStrike’s market capitalization stands at $104 billion. Over the last twelve months, the company generated $4.1 billion in revenue but was not operationally profitable, with operating losses of $252 million and a net loss of $172 million. That being said, if you prefer upside potential with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 91% since inception.

See earnings reaction history of all stocks Some observations on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively lower-risk tactic (though not helpful if correlations are weak) is to study relationships between short-term and medium-term moves after earnings, identify the pair with the highest correlation, and trade accordingly. For example, if 1D and 5D exhibit the strongest link, a trader could lean “long” for the following 5 days when the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is correlation data using a 5-year history and a more recent 3-year window. Here, 1D_5D denotes the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. At times, peer outcomes can influence post-earnings reactions—sometimes even before the report as expectations get priced in. The chart below compares CrowdStrike’s past post-earnings one-day (1D) returns with peers that reported just ahead of CrowdStrike. Peer returns also reflect post-earnings 1D moves for a fair comparison.

Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like CrowdStrike, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception.

Title: What To Expect in Markets This Week: Nvidia Earnings, a Key Measure of Inflation, and More

After a sweeping rally for U.S. stocks Friday fueled by rising expectations of an interest rate cut next month, earnings from the world's most valuable company and a key measure of inflation could command the spotlight this week. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has been front-and-center in the AI boom, with surging sales on growing demand for the emerging tech. Investors will likely be watching for updates on its most advanced offerings, as well as its plans to navigate changing trade policies, when the company posts its quarterly results. Investors can also look forward to the latest release of the Federal Reserve's favored measure of inflation, which could influence whether the central bank makes its first interest rate cut of the year in September. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Nvidia’s second-quarter results due Wednesday could show whether the chipmaker continues to set the pace in the AI race, with analysts anticipating another sales record despite some headwinds from China export curbs. Nvidia said in May that it expects to report growing revenue, though it warned of a hit from China export restrictions to the tune of $8 billion. The company could offer more updates on its business in China after making a deal with the Trump administration to share revenue from its AI chip sales there. Nvidia is also considering offering a variety of new products for the Chinese market in advance of government approval. Some other companies set to report this week include chipmaker Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell (DELL), CrowdStrike (CRWD), cloud provider Snowflake (SNOW), and engineering software maker Autodesk (ADSK), along with several Canadian banks. A fresh update on inflation is set to come Friday, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index for July, after dovish remarks last week from Fed Chair Jerome Powell boosted expectations for a rate cut in September. The June PCE report showed that inflation ticked higher that month, but a similar inflation report released earlier showed price increases in July were lower than some feared. The PCE report is the Fed’s preferred measurement of inflation, giving its reading potentially more impact with central bankers ahead of September's interest rate decision. This week will also bring a pair of consumer surveys, data on the U.S. trade balance, and housing market data, among other things.
