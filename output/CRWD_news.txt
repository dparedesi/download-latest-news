(NASDAQ: CRWD) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against CrowdStrike on July 30, 2024 with a Class Period from November 29, 2023 to July 29, 2024. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of CrowdStrike have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit.

CrowdStrike (CRWD) shares are in the spotlight after Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Friday filed a lawsuit against the cybersecurity provider following a faulty software update in July that brought its operations to a standstill and caused mass flight cancellations. The Atlanta-based airline alleges that the incident, which also disrupted industries including banks, health care, and media outlets, cost it more than $500 million, along with loss of future revenue and reputational damage. Despite ongoing concerns of further litigation linked to the software update, CrowdStrike shares have gained around 50% from their early-August low as of Friday’s close amid growing consensus among analysts that the firm sits poised to move past the incident in a strong position. Below, we analyze the technicals on CrowdStrike’s chart and point out key price levels to watch out for. Since bottoming out in early August, CrowdStrike shares have oscillated within a rising wedge, a chart pattern featuring two upward sloping converging trendlines that signals weakening price momentum. More recently, the stock has broken below the pattern’s lower trendline, potentially setting the stage for a continuation of the downtrend that started in early July, just weeks before the company’s erroneous software update. The stock was little changed at around $300 in premarket trading Monday. Let’s identify four important lower price levels on CrowdStrike’s chart that may come into play if the shares continue their move lower from current levels. Upon an initial move lower, investors should monitor the $285 level, an area just above the 50-day moving average where the shares could encounter support near a trendline joining multiple peaks and troughs on the chart from January to August. A close below this level could see the shares decline to around $262. Investors may view this location on the chart as a buying opportunity, given it sits near a horizontal line linking a series of simar trading levels between December and September. Further selling in the stock opens the door for a bearish move down to the $244 region, where the price could attract support near the January pullback low and prominent early September trough. Finally, a longer-term downtrend could see the shares revisit lower support at $172, where bargain hunters may look to place buy limit orders around the September 2023 swing high and October 2023 swing low. This area on the chart also roughly aligns with a bars pattern downside price target that takes the stock’s sharp trend lower from July to August and repositions it from this month’s swing high.

Title: Delta Sues Crowdstrike Over July IT Outage That Affected Thousands Of Flights

Delta Air Lines (DAL) is suing cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Inc. (CRWD) over a faulty software update in July that brought its operations to a halt and affected more than a million customers. In a lawsuit Friday, Delta said the software update that affected Microsoft (MSFT) Windows-based systems across the world was "catastrophic" for the company, leading to days of canceled or delayed flights. The airlines estimates that the debacle cost it $500 million, along with loss of future revenue and damaged reputation. The complaint alleges breach of contract, gross negligence and intentional misrepresentation or fraud by omission on CrowdStrike's part. Delta, which was among the most severely affected by the outage, took this legal action after months of finger-pointing among the three companies. Previously, both CrowdStrike and Microsoft had criticized Delta's handling of the situation, saying that the airline refused offers for help. “While we aimed to reach a business resolution that puts customers first, Delta has chosen a different path,” a CrowdStrike spokesperson told CNBC. “Delta’s claims are based on disproven misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure.” CORRECTION: This article has been updated with the correct spelling of CrowdStrike in several instances, and of Delta Air Lines.
