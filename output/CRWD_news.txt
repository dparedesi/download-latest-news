Delta Air Lines (DAL) reports third-quarter results before the bell next Thursday, Oct. 10, its first report since July's worldwide IT outage caused by a CrowdStrike (CRWD) software update forced the carrier to cancel thousands of flights, costing it an estimated $500 million. Analysts expect a slight year-over-year gain in revenue to $15.69 billion, with net income projected to tick lower to $1.10 billion, according to analysts' consensus estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. All 10 analysts covering Delta tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating on the airline's stock, with an average target price of $61.40, about 30% above Thursday afternoon's share price of $47.38. In July, Delta posted record second-quarter revenue, but a number of costs rose at least 20%, leading profit to come in well below what analysts had expected, and shares fell 4% that day. Revenue could continue its strong pace set in the first two quarters of the year, as airlines have said travel demand has remained strong, with July 4 travel setting TSA checkpoint records. However, Delta is also likely to have lost out on some revenue and incurred costs handling the mid-July IT outage. Delta's Q2 results came about a week before the IT outage that hindered Delta's operations for several days. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ed Bastian estimated that the canceled flights and compensation for passengers cost the airline at least $500 million. Delta was the hardest hit of the major airlines, and said it has considered legal action against CrowdStrike and Microsoft (MSFT), but the tech companies have said they aren't responsible for the age of Delta's IT infrastructure or how the airline responded to the outage.

October 01, 2024 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Oct. 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against CrowdStrike on July 30, 2024 with a Class Period from November 29, 2023 to July 29, 2024. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of CrowdStrike have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. CrowdStrike is a global cybersecurity company that provides software that helps prevent data breaches. According to the complaint, CrowdStrike’s main product is the Falcon software platform, which purportedly uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, prevent, and respond to security breach threats. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) CrowdStrike had instituted deficient controls in its procedure for updating Falcon and was not properly testing updates to Falcon before rolling them out to customers; (ii) this inadequate software testing created a substantial risk that an update to Falcon could cause major outages for a significant number of CrowdStrike’s customers; and (iii) such outages could pose, and in fact ultimately created, substantial reputational harm and legal risk to CrowdStrike. The CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 19, 2024, news broke that a flawed Falcon content update caused major worldwide technology outages for millions of devices running Microsoft Windows. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 11%, according to the complaint. Then, on July 22, 2024, the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit further alleges that Congress called on CrowdStrike CEO, defendant George Kurtz, to testify regarding the crisis and CrowdStrike’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts such as Guggenheim and BTIG. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell more than 13%, according to the complaint. Finally, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from CrowdStrike following the software outage, according to the complaint. On this news, the price of CrowdStrike stock fell nearly 10%, according to the CrowdStrike class action lawsuit.
