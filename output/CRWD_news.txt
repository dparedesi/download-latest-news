By extracting security signals from the half a trillion daily transactions and analyzing them with advanced AI models in real-time, Zscaler has the ability to gain a comprehensive understanding of the evolving threat landscape. This advancement delivers customers superior threat detection, prevention, and response capabilities. The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange is the world’s largest security cloud that delivers comprehensive security for users, devices, workloads and applications.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Solar Stocks, AMD Fall; CrowdStrike Shares Climb

Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground after the latest Consumer Price Index report showed greater-than-expected price increases in September, driven by an uptick in grocery prices. In addition to weighing on household budgets, the hot inflation data could constrain the Federal Reserve as policymakers deliberate over further interest-rate cuts. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% on Thursday, while the Dow was down 0.1%. Both indexes receded from record closes posted in the previous session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also retreated, though it fared slightly better, closing with a minimal daily loss of less than 0.1%. Shares of solar panel producer First Solar (FSLR) plunged 9.3%, the most of any S&P 500 constituent, after Jefferies reduced its price target on the stock to $266 from $271. Research analysts warned of potential delays that could restrain First Solar's volumes in the current quarter and those to come. Other solar industry stocks also moved lower: Shares of solar technology firm Enphase Energy (ENPH) slipped 5.8%. Semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) unveiled new artificial intelligence (AI) chips at its "Advancing AI 2024" event in San Francisco on Thursday. Its shares dropped 4%, with some analysts suggesting that its presentation may not have been sufficient to convince investors that its new products will be able to compete with AI chips from Nvidia (NVDA). Shares of Generac Holdings (GNRC), which provides home generators and other power solutions, fell 3.5% as Hurricane Milton moved through Florida. Thursday's downturn reversed a portion of the gains posted by the stock ahead of the storm. The day's strongest performance in the S&P 500 belonged to shares of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), which climbed 5.6% after RBC Capital included the stock on its list of top picks in the software space. Analysts believe the company is successfully moving past an incident in July when a faulty software update caused widespread IT outages around the world. Shares of fertilizer maker Mosaic Co. (MOS) gained 4.4%. Based in Tampa, Fla., Mosaic faced uncertainties about the potential impact of Hurricane Milton on its operations. The company said Thursday that it will begin to assess the impact of the storm as soon as conditions allow. Shares of Micron Technology (MU) shares added 3.9%. Although AMD's AI event may have failed to generate much investor enthusiasm, its new chips included more memory than previous products, underlining the importance of high-bandwidth memory for AI processes. Micron, which manufactures memory chips, is a partner of AMD.

Title: An Analyst Cheered Crowdstrike's Recovery From Outages—and its Stock Surged

Shares of cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) added more than 5% on Thursday, notching the S&P 500's top performance of the day, after RBC Capital named the company one of its top investment ideas in North American software for 2025. CrowdStrike drew scrutiny in mid-July when the firm's defective software update caused widespread technology outages across the world. Fallout from that incident sent CrowdStrike shares tumbling, and it's still below the levels seen after those events—but the stock has been on a path of recovery since printing a low in early August. According to analysts at RBC, the negative headlines about the midsummer software update and subsequent technological interruptions generated "short-term noise" surrounding CrowdStrike stock, but the company appears poised to emerge from the situation in a strong position. RBC believes CrowdStrike could be on track to achieve $10 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company's management team recently reiterated its goal to achieve this ambitious milestone by fiscal 2031. CrowdStrike's ARR for fiscal 2024 came in at over $3.4 billion. CrowdStrike continues to face issues stemming from the July incident. When Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported lower-than-expected sales and profits in its quarterly report released Thursday, the carrier cited the negative impact of the CrowdStrike outage, which resulted in the cancellation of thousands of flights. According to Delta, the incident caused a $380 million hit to revenue in the quarter. The airline's CEO said Delta continues to seek compensation from CrowdStrike and Microsoft (MSFT) related to the outages. Following Thursday's gains, CrowdStrike shares are trading around 23% higher year-to-date but remain around 21% below the all-time highs seen this summer before the incident.

U.S. equities declined at midday, with the S&P 500 falling from its record high, as a report on consumer prices showed higher-than-expected inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq also fell. Pfizer (PFE) shares slid when two former executives released a statement supporting the current management in its battle with activist investor Starboard Value. Starboard accused people inside the company of threatening the pair. First Solar (FSLR) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 when Jefferies lowered its price target, warning that current-quarter earnings will come up short of expectations because of delays. Shares of solar power firms Enphase Energy (ENPH) and SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) dropped as well. PayPal Holdings (PYPL) shares tumbled when Bernstein downgraded the stock, saying there was no upside after recent gains. A Barclays upgrade lifted shares of CVS Health (CVS), with the analysts arguing the pharmacy chain and healthcare firm has a compelling margin recovery opportunity. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) shares advanced when RBC Capital named the cybersecurity provider one of the top software ideas for 2025. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was higher. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro and pound, but lost ground to the yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies dropped. TradingView

Title: Delta Stock Falls as Quarterly Results, Outlook Disappoint

Time Published: 2024-10-10T12:41:58Z
Full Content:
Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL) declined in premarket trading after the carrier's third-quarter results and fourth-quarter sales outlook came in below analysts' estimates. The carrier also confirmed costs of around $500 million that Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ed Bastian had estimated following the CrowdStrike (CRWD)-caused global IT outage in July that resulted in 7,000 Delta flight cancellations over a five-day period. Delta posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50 on revenue of $15.68 billion, below consensus expectations of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Delta also projected fourth-quarter revenue growth of between 2% and 4%, lower than estimates. Fleshing out details of the damage from the IT outage this summer, Delta said it lost out on direct revenue of $380 million, largely from refunds and customer compensation, and incurred additional costs of roughly $170 million. The costs were slightly offset by $50 million in saved fuel expenses from canceling the 7,000 flights over five days. Delta shares, which had risen by more then 25% this year through Wednesday's close, were down 3% less than an hour before the opening bell.
