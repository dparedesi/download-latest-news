Shares of CrowdStrike (CRWD) are falling Wednesday after the company's revenue forecasts came in short of estimates, but analysts are staying bullish on the cybersecurity software maker. Analysts from Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, and Oppenheimer all raised their price targets for CrowdStrike to $470, $450, $520, and $520, respectively. Of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 25 call CrowdStrike a "buy," while four others rate it as a "hold," with an average price target of $488.39. Bank of America analysts, lifting their price target but downgrading the stock to "neutral," said they "favor CrowdStrike's fundamentals and growth prospects, but believe the valuation leaves only limited upside from the current level," adding that they expect revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of this year but slow in the coming years. UBS analysts, retaining their $545 price target as one of the most bullish on Wall Street, said they are "inclined to look past some of the near-term revenue headwinds from the company’s outage-related discounting program," which pressured first-quarter revenue and CrowdStrike's second-quarter forecasts. Analysts from Deutsche Bank said they are "bullish on CEO George Kurtz's articulation of how AI is expanding the attack surface and driving the need for better cyber defense (and thus more CrowdStrike)." However, they added that they "remain on the sidelines given valuation and our concerns for consolidation cyclicality." CrowdStrike shares were down 4% in recent trading to roughly $466, but are still up about 37% since the start of the year.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Nearly a year after CrowdStrike's botched cybersecurity update crippled airlines, banks and hospitals for hours, the company is still reeling from the fallout. The company said on Wednesday U.S. regulators have asked it about certain transactions as well as the July 19 outage. It earlier forecast second-quarter revenue below estimates, partly due to an incentive program meant to retain customers after the outage. Its shares fell more than 5 per cent in afternoon trading. The program ended in the fourth quarter but continues to weigh on subscription growth, as it let customers pick more products or extend usage. The incentives reduced first-quarter revenue by about $11 million and will have a $10 million to $15 million impact each quarter for the rest of the fiscal year.

Title: How Did CrowdStrike Fare In Q1?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - JUNE 01: In this photo illustration, the logo of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is ... More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market chart visible in the background, reflecting recent trading activity and investor sentiment, on June 01, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) saw its stock fall about 7% in extended trading on Tuesday, June 3, despite reporting better-than-expected Q1 earnings. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.73 on sales of $1.10 billion, surpassing consensus estimates of $0.65 earnings per share on the same sales figure. CrowdStrike’s positive Q1 performance was overshadowed by a weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. CrowdStrike anticipates Q2 earnings of $0.82 per share on revenue of around $1.14 billion. This forecast fell short of street expectations, which projected $0.81 in earnings per share but $1.16 billion in revenue. Additionally, while Q1 revenue increased nearly 20%, the company’s adjusted operating margin plunged 500 basis points year-over-year to 18%, amid increased costs for its professional services business and higher R&D spending. On a more positive note, CrowdStrike raised its full-year earnings guidance, now expecting $3.44 to $3.56 in adjusted earnings per share, which is above the consensus of $3.43. However, it maintained its sales outlook of $4.74 billion to $4.81 billion, aligning with the consensus of $4.77 billion. The company also announced a $1 billion share buyback program. Given the upbeat Q1 results, raised full-year earnings guidance, and the share buyback program, the stock’s decline might seem puzzling. However, investors appear to be reacting to more than just the minor Q2 revenue forecast miss. CrowdStrike’s stock has surged a remarkable 40% this year, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 index's 2% rise. Trading at lofty valuations, even a slight miss on the revenue forecast was enough to unsettle investors. Now, the critical question is if CRWD stock is a buy at levels of $460. We answer this question here – Is CRWD Stock Overvalued At $460? – based on a comparison of CRWD’s current valuation with its recent operating performance and current and historical financial condition. Remember, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single stock or even a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/04/23: In this photo illustration, the CrowdStrike Holdings logo is seen displayed on ... More a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Yes, we think so. Trading at a whopping 122 times its adjusted trailing earnings, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), a security software company, looks expensive. Sure, the company’s growth has remained impressive lately. But the important question is whether this valuation is justified. And we don’t think it is. Our conclusion is based on a comparison of CRWD’s current valuation with its recent operating performance and current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of CrowdStrike, across key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, reveals a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. Now, to reduce stock specific risk, consider taking a look at the Trefis High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Also, see – How Did CrowdStrike Fare In Q1? CrowdStrike’s valuation appears significantly higher than the broader market, with its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio standing at 28.1 - well above the S&P 500’s 3.2. Our dashboard on CrowdStrike’s valuation ratios has more details. This high valuation comes despite the company demonstrating extremely strong top-line growth in recent years. Over the last three years, CrowdStrike’s revenue has expanded at an average rate of 40%, far exceeding the S&P 500’s 6.3%. Also, revenues grew 20% to $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter, outperforming the S&P 500’s growth rate. Regarding profitability, CrowdStrike’s reported operating income over the last twelve months was -$252 million, resulting in a negative operating margin of -6.1%, which is worse than most companies. However, on an adjusted basis, its operating margin was a healthy 20.3% for the same period. Adjusted operating income excludes stock-based compensation and certain one-time items such as acquisition-related expenses and other non-recurring costs. The company also shows strong cash generation, with an operating cash flow of $1.4 billion, leading to a high operating cash flow-to-sales ratio of 33.4%, significantly better than the S&P 500's 15.7%. CrowdStrike’s financial stability is very strong. With a debt of $785 million against a market capitalization of $122 billion, its debt-to-equity ratio is a very low 0.6%, indicating minimal reliance on debt compared to the S&P 500’s 19.0%. Furthermore, cash and cash equivalents of $4.6 billion make up 53% of its total assets, highlighting a robust cash-to-assets ratio compared to the S&P 500's 14.8%. Despite its strong growth and financial health, CRWD stock has shown weakness during market downturns. During the 2022 Inflation Shock, the stock fell 58.3%, a steeper decline than the S&P 500’s 25.4%. Similarly, during the 2020 Covid pandemic, it dropped 50.0% compared to the S&P 500’s 33.9%. While the stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peaks in both instances, its greater volatility suggests weaker resilience during market crashes. In summary, CrowdStrike shows strong performance across key financial metrics, and its profitability is good on an adjusted basis. We believe this positive performance is already reflected in the current stock price of $460, given its very high valuation. The stock trades at 28 times its trailing revenues and a significant 122 times its trailing adjusted earnings of $3.73 per share, which is much higher than its three-year average price-to-earnings ratio of about 80x. Furthermore, there’s a risk of a broader market downturn, which historically has impacted CrowdStrike’s stock more severely than the general market. Also, the growth is slowing. The consensus estimates project average sales growth of 21% over the next couple of years, compared to 40% average growth seen in the last three years. Considering these factors, we do not think now is a good time to buy CRWD stock. Investors would likely benefit from waiting for a further price dip. Surely, we could be wrong. There’s a chance investors might continue to value CRWD highly if sales grow faster than expected. But, the risk at the current valuation appears high. In fact, the risk assessment framework is something we focus on while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

It’s a new month, and investors are heading into it amid fresh inflation data and rising pessimism that’s dominating headlines. With the Fed’s next meeting now just weeks away, all eyes will be on Friday’s jobs report, which could shape expectations for rate cuts this summer. At the same time, President Trump’s legal battles continue to reverberate throughout the market, just as a whopping 83% of of CEOs say they’re bracing for a downturn. Add in jobs data and earnings from a host of consumer names like Lululemon (LULU-1.05%), MongoDB (MDB-2.23%), HP (HPQ-0.43%), and Dollar Tree (DLTR+1.07%), and the first week of June looks unlikely to be lacking in storylines. Here’s what to watch: Campbell’s Company – parent of popular shelf staples including Prego and Goldfish – will release earnings before the market opens, with a conference call scheduled for 8:00 a.m. ET. Analysts are expecting revenue of approximately $2.43 billion, reflecting 2% growth. On the macro side, at 10:00 a.m. ET, the U.S. Census Bureau will release the April 2025 Construction Spending report. This data provides insights into the health of the construction sector, which can influence economic growth projections and decision-making in closely related industries from real estate to manufacturing. Tuesday brings a greater mix of significant earnings reports and economic data releases that could sway market sentiment. Cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike (CRWD-1.28%) will share Q1 2026 earnings after the market closes. Analysts are closely watching for updates following the company’s recent announcement to cut approximately 5% of its workforce in one more corporate bid for AI-flavored “operational efficiency.” HP and Dollar General (DG+0.87%) also report. The discount retailer is mid-turnaround, with its stock price recovering around 30% this year but still well off 52-week highs. Looking to the hard-economics side, expect BLS data on job opening and labor turnover at 10:00 a.m., alongside the Census Bureau’s Factory Orders and the OECD’s globe-spanning Economic Outlook. Wednesday brings another dose of retail and tech earnings. Dollar Tree will report before the bell. With roughly 40% of its inventory sourced from China, investors will parse the results for tariffs’ effects on retail. After the close, MongoDB and Five Below (FIVE-3.42%) release their results, too. MongoDB’s earnings will offer a read on enterprise software spending amid a 40% drop in the company’s stock price since last year. Five Below’s report should reveal whether tween-and-teen discretionary spending on pool noodles, inflatable chairs, and Disney-branded collectibles is still chugging along. Economic data hits early, with the ADP private payrolls report for May landing around 8:15 a.m. ET, an important preview of government jobs numbers due later in the week. At 9:45 a.m., the final read on S&P Global’s U.S. Services PMI offers a snapshot of activity in the economy’s biggest sector, followed at 10:00 by the Census Bureau’s manufacturing shipments and inventory data. Thursday’s earnings lineup features Lululemon and DocuSign, both reporting after the bell. Lululemon’s results will shed light on a very important athleisure-maxi-dress debate (subject of much TikTok controversy), as well as international growth and inventory levels. DocuSign, meanwhile, will be watched for clues on whether demand for e-signatures and contract management is holding up in a tight corporate spending environment. Analysts expect modest growth but remain wary of margin pressures and customer churn. The macro calendar launches at 8:30 a.m. ET with revised productivity and labor cost data for Q1, which gives context regarding wage-inflation trends. Also at 8:30, the Census Bureau’s international trade report for April provides a look at goods and services flows amid the trade wars. Both reports could sway expectations heading into Friday’s closely watched jobs release. Friday is a pivotal day for markets. No major earnings releases are scheduled, but the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the May Employment Situation report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Expect a comprehensive look at job growth, unemployment rates, and the overall health of the job market. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
