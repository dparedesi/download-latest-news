ByNicolas Straut ByNicolas Straut, Contributor. While risks to Crowdstrike's growth do exist, the bull case for the stock seems more likely than the ... More bear case. CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) is a dominant player in the cybersecurity market known for its cloud-based endpoint protection and threat intelligence solutions. Investors have been impressed with CrowdStrike’s past growth and are curious about its longer-term prospects both as a company and a stock. This article will explore how Crowdstrike is currently performing, how you can expect it to perform in the future, and whether CRWD will remain one of the best stocks for 2025. CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 in Austin, Texas by George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston, with Kurtz serving as the current CEO of the firm. CrowdStrike changed the cybersecurity game with the launch of its Falcon platform which is a cloud-native solution that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide real-time threat detection and response. CRWD is used across industries and institutions from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies to government agencies. The firm’s business model is based on subscriptions paid by its clients, providing reliable, recurring revenue. Clients can choose their security solutions from CrowdStrike’s offerings from cloud security to ID protection, providing a suite of offerings depending on the client’s industry and needs. As of May 28, 2025, the CRWD stock closed at $468.83 a share, marking a 34.98% growth year-to-date. This strong growth is based on CrowdStrike’s reporting that they delivered $224 million of net new revenue in Q4 2025 and an annual revenue of $3.95 billion for fiscal year 2025, a 29.39% growth from 2024. While CRWD experienced a GAAP net loss of $92.3 million, they reached a non-GAAP net income of $987.6 million. CrowdStrike’s future outlook is influenced by a number of key features including expansion into new markets, more demand from the digitization of business, and global growth. CrowdStrike has heavily invested in artificial intelligence and machine learning to better respond and neutralize threats. For example, the firm’s Charlotte AI combines intelligent automation and human cyber expertise to find and address threats swiftly. The global cybersecurity market is expected to reach over $504 billion in revenue by 2030 based on the increasing digitization of business and the need for solutions to protect from cyber threats. CRWD is expected to continue to profit greatly from this rising demand. With notable rising cybercrime committed by malicious state actors, political activists and other bad actors, organizations are investing more in cybersecurity to defend themselves. CrowdStrike provides expansive security and fast response capabilities to their clients from these attacks and is even more in demand to provide protection. CrowdStrike currently has contracts with the Department of Defense as well as other government agencies which provides stable income as well as legitimacy as a trusted cybersecurity provider. CrowdStrike has seen more adoption by small-to-medium sized businesses due to the launch of Falcon Go built for the needs of SMBs. This move provided diversification and expansion for the business. Analysts rate CRWD as a strong buy, according to TipRank’s ratings from 38 analysts. The average price target for the stock by April 2026 is $431.97. The highest forecast stands at $520 and the lowest forecast is $347. Both strong revenue growth and its dominance in the cybersecurity market are some of the key factors in the stock’s positive ratings. Year-to-date, CRWD has grown by 26% compared to the S&P 500’s mere 0.6% rise. The bullish scenario for CRWD is that the company continues to grow based on increasing demand for cybersecurity products and that its adoption of AI will continue to accelerate its dominance in the market. The firm’s bullish prospects also seem realistic given that Barclays raised their price target for the firm to $500 and the total addressable market for cybersecurity services continues to rise. A bearish scenario could be caused by expanding competition, failure of technology offerings, or worse execution in new markets. If a recession were to occur and affect CrowdStrike’s markets, their revenue growth could also stall. In this scenario, the $347 bear case could unfold. According to some analysts, CrowdStrike is expected to rise to over $1,000 a share based on their market expansion into new markets both nationally and globally. With rising demand for cybersecurity solutions, the total addressable market (TAM) for CrowdStrike offerings would rise as would their market penetration if their technology investments pay off and their reputation holds. This prediction is highly reasonable given their current share price, as of May 28th, 2025 at $468 per share and their growth over the last 5 years of over 433%. Bottom Line CrowdStrike’s innovation in the cybersecurity space with AI and ML investments, major clients including SalesForce and government agencies, and industry growth have all caused this growth stock to rocket in price over the last five years. With strong financial performance, increasing demand for cybersecurity services, and an expanding arsenal of tools for businesses and organizations, it’s realistic to recommend CRWD as a buy for 2025. While risks to CRWD’s growth do exist, the bull case for the stock seems more likely than the bear case. Is CrowdStrike A Good Long-term Investment? Yes, CrowdStrike is considered a good long-term investment because of its AI-led technology, strong revenue and market performance, and increasingly-necessary need for cybersecurity protection. What Is Driving CrowdStrike’s Growth? CrowdStrike’s growth is driven by the increase of cybersecurity threats, the company’s AI adoption, and their expansion into global markets and more industries. Does CrowdStrike Pay Dividends? No, CrowdStrike does not pay a dividend currently as it is a growth stock which reinvests profits for growth. What Are CrowdStrike’s Biggest Competitors? CrowdStrike’s primary competitors in the cybersecurity space are Cynet, SentinelOne, and Symantec.

More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market performance and candlestick charts visible in the background, highlighting CrowdStrike's real-time financial trends, stock price fluctuations, market volatility, and investment developments within the cybersecurity, cloud security, and technology sectors, on March 3, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is set to announce its earnings on Tuesday, June 3, 2025. For traders focusing on events, grasping the stock's historical behavior around earnings announcements can provide valuable insights. Over the last five years, CrowdStrike's shares have exhibited a pattern of positive one-day returns following earnings announcements in 55% of cases. The median positive return on these days was 9.3%, with the highest single-day gain reaching 13.6%. While the actual outcomes relative to consensus and expectations will significantly impact the stock's trajectory, historical trends can give traders an advantage. Traders may contemplate two primary strategies: Analysts expect CrowdStrike to report earnings of $0.66 per share on revenue of $1.11 billion. This compares to the same quarter last year, when the company disclosed earnings of $0.93 per share on revenue of $921 million. From a fundamental standpoint, CrowdStrike currently holds a market capitalization of $117 billion. Over the previous twelve months, the company realized $4.0 billion in revenue. Nonetheless, it reported operational losses, with -$120 million in operating losses and a net income of -$19 million. That being said, if you’re looking for upside with reduced volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative—having surpassed the S&P 500 and yielding returns greater than 91% since its launch.

View earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights regarding one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional information regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post-earnings is compiled along with the statistics in the table below. CRWD 1D, 5D, and 21D Post-Earnings Return A relatively less risky strategy (although it may not be effective if the correlation is low) is to analyze the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post-earnings, identify a pair that demonstrates the highest correlation, and make the necessary trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader can take a "long" position for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. CRWD Correlation Between 1D, 5D and 21D Historical Returns Sometimes, the performance of peers can impact post-earnings stock reaction. In fact, the pricing-in may commence even before the earnings are revealed. Below is some historical data regarding the past post-earnings performance of CrowdStrike stock in comparison with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings shortly before CrowdStrike. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also reflect post-earnings one-day (1D) returns. CRWD Correlation With Peer Earnings Discover more about Trefis RV strategy, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), yielding strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you desire upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock like CrowdStrike, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception.
