Tech stocks surged in recent trading, pushing the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq to record highs. Intel (INTC) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in the struggling chipmaker, and the two agreed to co-develop new data center and PC chips. Nvidia (NVDA) shares were up as well. Shares of PayPal (PYPL) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) also gained following an agreement that will have PayPal use Google’s artificial intelligence tools to boost internet commerce. CrowdStrike (CRWD) shares jumped after the cybersecurity firm gave a better-than-expected forecast for annual recurring revenue. Darden Restaurants (DRI) shares slumped as the owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains missed profit estimates and warned higher costs could hurt future earnings. Shares of another restaurant operator, Cracker Barrel (CBRL), sank as the blowback from the restaurant chain’s location updates and logo change hit its results and guidance. A lower-than-anticipated outlook sent shares of Nucor (NUE) lower. The steelmaker said it sees weakness in all its segments. Oil futures rose and gold prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note advanced. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher.

Title: CrowdStrike: What’s Happening With CRWD Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/18/crowdstrike-whats-happening-with-crwd-stock/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has seen six consecutive days of gains, with a cumulative return of 5.2%. The stock continued to rise in extended trading on September 17 after the company’s recent Fal.Con 2025 conference. At the conference, CrowdStrike announced its focus on "securing the AI revolution" and set an ambitious goal of reaching $20 billion in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) by fiscal year 2036. The company also provided specific financial targets for fiscal year 2027, including over 20% net new ARR growth and a non-GAAP operating margin of 24% or more. These announcements, combined with some recent price target increases from Wall Street analysts, have contributed to the stock’s rally. In fact, the company has increased in value by approximately $5.8 billion over the last six days, bringing its current market value to around $111 billion. The stock is currently 30.2% higher than its value at the conclusion of 2024. This is in contrast to year-to-date returns of 12.2% for the S&P 500. CRWD offers cloud-based protection for endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data through its subscription-based Falcon platform and modules via direct sales and channel partners. Following this surge, is CRWD still a worthwhile investment – or is it time to secure profits? Explore further with Buy or Sell CRWD. The table below highlights the returns for CRWD stock compared to the S&P 500 index over various periods, including the ongoing streak: What is the point? Momentum frequently comes before conviction. A multi-day winning streak may indicate rising investor confidence or incite additional purchasing. Keeping track of such trends can assist you in capitalizing on the strength or getting ready for a timely entry if the momentum wanes. Nonetheless, large profits can lead to sharp reversals – but how has CRWD performed following previous declines? View CRWD Dip Buyer Analysis to discover more. Currently, there are 33 S&P constituents that have experienced 3 or more days of consecutive gains and 60 constituents with 3 or more days of consecutive losses. While CRWD stock appears appealing due to its winning streak, investing in a single stock without comprehensive and careful analysis can entail risks. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a less turbulent investment experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
