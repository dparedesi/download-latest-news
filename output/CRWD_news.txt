Shares of Netskope (NTSK) surged Friday, extending gains after making their debut on the Nasdaq Thursday. The stock was up close to 7% around $24 in recent trading, after finishing Thursday's session 18% above their initial public offering (IPO) price of $19 per share. The IPO price was at the high end of the company’s expectations, and the 47.8 million shares sold helped Netskope raise $908.2 million. CEO Sanjay Beri told Yahoo! Finance in a televised interview that he expects going public could help boost the company's credibility and customer awareness. Netskope, which counts companies like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Zscaler (ZS) as competitors, reported a 31% year-over-year jump in revenue to $328 million for the six months ended in July, according to a regulatory filing. It's $170 million net loss over that period narrowed from $207 million a year ago. This has been a strong year so far for a number of cybersecurity stocks, amid expectations the sector could get a boost from strong demand trends as AI-driven threats grow. Zscaler shares have added over 60% of their value in 2025, while CrowdStrike (CRWD) has climbed close to 50%. Palo Alto Networks shares have added about 13%, roughly in line with the S&P 500's rise over the same period.

Title: CleanSpark: Buy The CLSK Stock Rally Before It's Too Late?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CleanSpark stock (NASDAQ:CLSK) has seen a sharp rise, gaining over 40% in the past month. This surge comes after the company reported a 38% increase in bitcoins mined during August, driven by a significant boost in its operational hashrate, which reached 50 EH/s (Exahashes per second)—a critical measure of computing power on the Bitcoin network. The company achieved this milestone in June 2025. The broader cryptocurrency market has also shown strong momentum. Other Bitcoin miners, like IREN and MARA, have posted gains recently. This upward trend has been supported by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates, with further cuts expected—an environment generally seen as favorable for cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin’s near-term outlook looking positive, we expect Bitcoin mining companies to continue growing. A few months ago, we noted that the initial jump in CLSK could mark the start of a larger rally. Since then, the stock has climbed over 30%, and we still see it as well-positioned for further gains. In the following sections, we’ll take a deeper look at CLSK—comparing its current valuation with its operational performance over recent years and reviewing its financial health. That said, if you’re looking for upside potential with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Separately, see – CrowdStrike: What’s Happening With CRWD Stock? Looking at what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CLSK stock appears slightly undervalued compared to the overall market, especially considering its strong revenue growth. Cleanspark's Revenues have grown rapidly in recent years. Cleanspark’s profit margins lag behind most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Cleanspark’s balance sheet appears very strong. CLSK stock has underperformed the S&P 500 during recent downturns. While investors hope for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, what if another recession hits? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash shows how major stocks fared during and after the last seven market crashes. Summarizing Cleanspark’s metrics: • Growth: Very Strong• Profitability: Weak• Financial Stability: Very Strong• Downturn Resilience: Weak• Overall: Strong Overall, CleanSpark has performed well across the metrics we’ve analyzed. Given its moderate valuation, we believe the stock still has significant upside potential. When we look at the competition, CleanSpark appears undervalued. For example, IREN trades at 17 times its trailing revenue, MARA at 8 times, and RIOT at 11 times. In comparison, CleanSpark’s valuation is much lower at 6 times revenues, suggesting it could be poised for growth to catch up to its peers. Now, of course, we could be wrong in our assessment, and investors might continue to value CLSK conservatively, especially considering its historical volatility. We think the long-term outlook is positive. For investors with a risk tolerance and a 3-to-5-year investment horizon, we continue to believe CLSK stock could deliver substantial returns. Still, single-stock investing carries risk. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio—a collection of 30 stocks—has consistently outperformed its benchmark (the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000). This is because HQ Portfolio stocks have offered better returns with lower risk than the index, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (“KSF”), announces that KSF has commenced an investigation into CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) (NasdaqGS: CRWD). On July 19, 2024, an update pushed by the Company caused global outages for millions of users of Microsoft Windows devices, including financial institutions, airlines, government entities, and corporations, and left users vulnerable to potential hacking threats. Then, on July 22, 2024, it was revealed that Congress had called on CEO George Kurtz to testify regarding the catastrophe, and the Company’s stock rating was downgraded by analysts. Then, on July 29, 2024, news outlets reported that Delta Air Lines had retained noted attorney David Boies to seek damages from the Company following the outages. Thereafter, the Company and certain of its executives were sued in a securities class action lawsuit, charging them with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws, which remains ongoing. KSF’s investigation is focusing on whether CrowdStrike’s officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to its shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws.

Tech stocks surged in recent trading, pushing the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq to record highs. Intel (INTC) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in the struggling chipmaker, and the two agreed to co-develop new data center and PC chips. Nvidia (NVDA) shares were up as well. Shares of PayPal (PYPL) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) also gained following an agreement that will have PayPal use Google’s artificial intelligence tools to boost internet commerce. CrowdStrike (CRWD) shares jumped after the cybersecurity firm gave a better-than-expected forecast for annual recurring revenue. Darden Restaurants (DRI) shares slumped as the owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains missed profit estimates and warned higher costs could hurt future earnings. Shares of another restaurant operator, Cracker Barrel (CBRL), sank as the blowback from the restaurant chain’s location updates and logo change hit its results and guidance. A lower-than-anticipated outlook sent shares of Nucor (NUE) lower. The steelmaker said it sees weakness in all its segments. Oil futures rose and gold prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note advanced. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has seen six consecutive days of gains, with a cumulative return of 5.2%. The stock continued to rise in extended trading on September 17 after the company’s recent Fal.Con 2025 conference. At the conference, CrowdStrike announced its focus on "securing the AI revolution" and set an ambitious goal of reaching $20 billion in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) by fiscal year 2036. The company also provided specific financial targets for fiscal year 2027, including over 20% net new ARR growth and a non-GAAP operating margin of 24% or more. These announcements, combined with some recent price target increases from Wall Street analysts, have contributed to the stock’s rally. In fact, the company has increased in value by approximately $5.8 billion over the last six days, bringing its current market value to around $111 billion. The stock is currently 30.2% higher than its value at the conclusion of 2024. This is in contrast to year-to-date returns of 12.2% for the S&P 500. CRWD offers cloud-based protection for endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data through its subscription-based Falcon platform and modules via direct sales and channel partners. Following this surge, is CRWD still a worthwhile investment – or is it time to secure profits? Explore further with Buy or Sell CRWD. The table below highlights the returns for CRWD stock compared to the S&P 500 index over various periods, including the ongoing streak: What is the point? Momentum frequently comes before conviction. A multi-day winning streak may indicate rising investor confidence or incite additional purchasing. Keeping track of such trends can assist you in capitalizing on the strength or getting ready for a timely entry if the momentum wanes. Nonetheless, large profits can lead to sharp reversals – but how has CRWD performed following previous declines? View CRWD Dip Buyer Analysis to discover more. Currently, there are 33 S&P constituents that have experienced 3 or more days of consecutive gains and 60 constituents with 3 or more days of consecutive losses. While CRWD stock appears appealing due to its winning streak, investing in a single stock without comprehensive and careful analysis can entail risks. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a less turbulent investment experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
