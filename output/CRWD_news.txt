by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Scale The B2B markets bifurcated in 2025 — and the laggards all share one thing in common. Same macro environment. Same interest rates. Same customers. Completely different outcomes. What happened? And more importantly, what does it tell us about where B2B is headed? Let’s look at the data through mid-December 2025: HubSpot has fallen from ~$880 to ~$370 — a 51% decline that makes it the roughest performing major B2B SaaS stock of the year. The irony? The business is actually performing fine: So why the destruction? The market is pricing in maximum AI disruption risk for SMB-focused horizontal SaaS. HubSpot launched Breeze AI in September 2024, including customer agents, prospecting agents, and content agents. They’ve announced 200+ AI features. Their Breeze Customer Agent reportedly resolves 50%+ of support tickets. But here’s what the market is worried about: The Breeze platform is legitimately good. But the market isn’t convinced it changes the fundamental economics fast enough. This one is puzzling because Salesforce has actually shown real AI traction, and Q3 FY26 (reported December 3rd) showed growth reaccelerating: The Agentforce numbers are legitimately impressive: Marc Benioff has gone all-in on “Agentforce” as the company’s future. They acquired Informatica (closed November 2025), Regrello, and Waii to accelerate AI and data capabilities. So why is the stock still down 31%? The good news: Q3 may have been the turning point. Growth is reaccelerating, Agentforce adoption is inflecting, and the $60B revenue target by FY30 suddenly looks achievable. If Q4 delivers that 11-12% growth, 2026 could be a very different story for CRM. Adobe is down 35% despite legitimately impressive AI numbers: Adobe even admitted their own Firefly model wasn’t keeping pace with Google, OpenAI, and others — so they opened their platform to third-party models. That’s strategically smart. So why is the stock cratering? The market believes AI commoditizes creative tools. If Canva, Figma, and dozens of AI-native startups can generate images, videos, and designs at near-Adobe quality for a fraction of the price, Adobe’s moat erodes. Adobe’s defense is integration — Firefly embedded in Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and the entire Creative Cloud suite. But the market isn’t sure that’s enough when standalone AI tools are “good enough” for 80% of use cases. The other concern: AI is expensive. Adobe’s profits are up 9%, but the cost of running AI inference at scale will only grow. How long can they absorb those costs without raising prices? Bill.com (BILL) is down 43% YTD. Bill provides financial operations software (AP/AR automation) primarily to SMBs. The thesis was that SMBs would continue digitizing their back-office operations. The problem: AI makes this category look commoditizable. If AI agents can handle invoice processing, payment approvals, and vendor management, why do you need specialized Bill.com software? QuickBooks + AI agents might be “good enough.” Bill’s challenge is similar to HubSpot’s: their SMB customer base is the most vulnerable to AI-driven seat compression. The companies that need 3 people in the finance function today might need 1 person + AI tomorrow. Looking at HubSpot, Salesforce, Adobe, Bill, and Asana, clear patterns emerge: Every major loser serves broad horizontal use cases (CRM, marketing, creative, work management, finance). The winners (Veeva, Guidewire) serve specific verticals where domain expertise creates defensibility. Horizontal tools are easier to disrupt because the problem space is general. AI can attack general problems more easily than specialized ones. HubSpot and Bill.com serve primarily SMBs. SMBs have smaller teams, simpler processes, and less switching cost inertia. An AI-native competitor can win an SMB customer with a good demo. Enterprise deals require years of relationship building. SMBs are also more price-sensitive, so they’ll switch faster if AI enables cheaper alternatives. The entire SaaS industry was built on the assumption that more users = more value = more revenue. AI inverts this: more value often means fewer users. Companies that can pivot to consumption-based, outcome-based, or agent-based pricing will adapt. Companies stuck on seats will struggle. Every loser has shipped AI features. HubSpot has Breeze. Salesforce has Agentforce. Adobe has Firefly. But adding AI to existing products isn’t the same as building an AI-native business. The winners in 2025 — Palantir, the security companies — didn’t “add AI.” They are AI companies that solve specific, mission-critical problems. The data tells a clear story: If you’re building a B2B company in 2025, the market is sending a clear message: Horizontal tools are under pressure. Vertical solutions with deep domain expertise are defensible. Veeva for life sciences. Guidewire for insurance. Procore for construction. The best opportunities are in verticals that haven’t been AI-transformed yet. Don’t build a SaaS product and add AI. Build an AI-native product from day one. The architecture is different. The economics are different. The customer expectation is different. Seat-based pricing made sense when software helped humans do their jobs better. Consumption-based or outcome-based pricing makes sense when AI does the job instead. HubSpot is moving toward credits-based pricing for Breeze Customer Agent. Salesforce is experimenting with Agentforce pricing models. The transition is happening. The market is rewarding companies whose software customers literally cannot live without. Security. Data infrastructure. Compliance. Healthcare. Defense. “Nice to have” software is getting crushed. “Must have” software is thriving. SMB SaaS is harder in 2025. The customers are price-sensitive, AI-curious, and have low switching costs. Enterprise and government customers take longer to close but are stickier and less vulnerable to AI commoditization. One analyst note from Morningstar estimates: The median SaaS stock they cover is 30% undervalued. “That is pretty extreme.” If you believe: …then 2025’s losers might be 2026’s winners. Salesforce, HubSpot, and Adobe aren’t going away. These are great names with extremely strong logo retention. They have cash, distribution, and customer relationships. The question is whether they are adapting fast enough. They’re already adapting. 2025 exposed a brutal truth about B2B software: AI isn’t a feature, it’s a wedge. Companies that built AI-native, mission-critical, vertical products are winning. Companies that added AI to existing horizontal SaaS products are struggling. The market isn’t being irrational. It’s pricing in a future where: HubSpot, Salesforce, Adobe — these are great companies with great products and great teams. They’re not going anywhere. But the market is telling them: “Show us the AI numbers. Show us the new business model. Show us that AI makes your customers pay more, not less.” Until they do, the stocks stay under pressure. The SaaS playbook that worked from 2010-2023 — land, expand, seats, seats, seats — is being rewritten. 2025 is the year we learned what the new playbook looks like. It’s easy to focus on the carnage. But the market cap winners of 2025 are equally instructive — and they share a playbook that every B2B founder should study. Palantir has been the undisputed winner of 2025, and it’s not close. The Numbers Are Absurd: What happened? Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) became the enterprise standard for deploying AI in mission-critical environments. Why Palantir Won: The Lesson: Palantir proves that AI-native architecture + mission-critical use cases + enterprise/government customers = market leadership. They didn’t add AI to existing products. They built an AI operating system from scratch. The valuation is insane (70x+ forward P/S). But the growth justifies the multiple — for now. CrowdStrike has quietly become one of the best-performing B2B stocks of 2025, up 51% YTD despite a major outage in July 2024 that rattled customers and investors. The Numbers: Why CrowdStrike Won: The Lesson: CrowdStrike proves that mission-critical + platform consolidation + non-discretionary spending = pricing power. Security is the one category where enterprises will pay more, not less, even in a tough macro. Snowflake had a rough 2024 but staged an impressive recovery in 2025 as the market recognized that data infrastructure is the foundation for enterprise AI. The Numbers: Why Snowflake Won: The Lesson: Snowflake proves that data infrastructure companies benefit from AI rather than being disrupted by it. AI needs data. Companies with the data win. Cloudflare has quietly become one of the biggest B2B winners of 2025, up 80%+ YTD. Why Cloudflare Won: The Lesson: Cloudflare proves that infrastructure positioning beats feature positioning. They’re not selling AI features — they’re selling the pipes that AI runs on. MongoDB had the most dramatic turnaround of 2025. Down mid-year, then two consecutive blowout quarters sent the stock soaring 70%+ YTD. The Numbers: Why MongoDB Won: The Lesson: MongoDB proves that data layer companies can be AI beneficiaries — if they position correctly. AI doesn’t threaten databases. AI creates more data that needs to be stored and queried. Shopify’s 51% YTD gain shows that not all horizontal SaaS is struggling. Why Shopify Won: The Lesson: Shopify proves that platform companies with true merchant-level embedding can still win — even in a tough SaaS environment. When you’re the operating system, not just a tool, you have pricing power. Perhaps the most instructive story of 2025 is Oracle — the 47-year-old database giant that somehow became an AI infrastructure play, hit an all-time high of $346 in September, and then crashed 45% to ~$188 by December. The Rollercoaster: Why Oracle Won (Until It Didn’t): Why Oracle Crashed: The Lesson: Oracle proves both that legacy doesn’t mean left behind AND that AI momentum can reverse fast. The 47-year-old company is still up 14% YTD and positioned in AI infrastructure — but the September euphoria was clearly overdone. Looking across Palantir, Cloudflare, MongoDB, Snowflake, CrowdStrike, and Shopify, clear patterns emerge: The winners either built AI-native products from scratch (Palantir) or positioned as essential AI infrastructure (MongoDB, Snowflake, Cloudflare). They didn’t just “add AI” to existing products. Every winner solves problems that enterprises literally cannot ignore: The winners serve enterprises and governments — not SMBs. Or like Shopify, they have such platform stickiness that SMB churn is still manageable. These customers have longer sales cycles but stickier relationships and less price sensitivity. CrowdStrike’s multi-module strategy, Palantir’s operating system approach, Snowflake’s data cloud — winners built platforms that expand within accounts, not point solutions that get replaced. The winners either already have consumption-based pricing (Snowflake) or are positioned to move there. They’re not dependent on seat counts that AI might compress. 2025 taught us that the SaaS playbook from 2010-2023 is being rewritten. The ones who took a market cap hit in 2025 — HubSpot, Salesforce, Adobe, ServiceNow, Monday.com, Atlassian — are great companies that are adapting. Breeze, Agentforce, and Firefly are real products with real adoption. But the markets aren’t patient. Especially in the Age of AI. The market wants proof that AI makes customers pay more, not less. That AI creates new revenue streams, not just features. That seat-based models can transition to consumption-based models without destroying economics. The winners — Palantir (+142%), Cloudflare (+80%), MongoDB (+70%), Shopify (+51%), CrowdStrike (+51%), Snowflake (+47%) — already have that proof. The losers are still building it. If you’re a founder, the lesson is clear: Don’t build SaaS and add AI. Build AI and add SaaS economics. If you’re an investor, the contrarian opportunity might be massive: HubSpot at -51%, Monday.com at -36%, Atlassian at -34%, Salesforce at -31%, ServiceNow at -26% — if they successfully navigate the transition, these could be the buys of the decade. But “if” is doing a lot of work in that sentence. Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.
