As Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms analyze huge amounts of data to detect configurations indicative of cyber threats. Additionally, AI can scan complete networks for faults to help avoid common types of cyberattacks. AI predominantly monitors and examines activities and patterns. By leveraging a baseline of normal behavior, AI can identify anomalies and limit illegal access to systems. A report from Fortune Business Insights projected that the global AI in cybersecurity market size was valued at USD 26.55 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow from USD 34.10 billion in 2025 to USD 234.64 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 31.70% during the forecast period. North America dominated the market with a share of 36.31% in 2024. The report said: "Leveraging Generative AI Capabilities to Detect Emerging Threats Creates Lucrative Market Opportunities: To protect their operations, enterprises need to develop a clear approach to incorporating AI and generative AI technologies into their present security systems. This involves continuously reevaluating the security setting to detect emerging risks and ensuring the necessary infrastructure is in place. Key components include advanced data management solutions, cloud computing resources, strong governance, and policies to safeguard data integrity and safety.
