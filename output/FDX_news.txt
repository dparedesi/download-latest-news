Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on the final day of a trading week that saw the financial headlines dominated by the latest Federal Reserve policy meeting. A day after notching an all-time closing high in the wake of the Fed's decision to lower interest rates, the S&P 500 slipped 0.2% on Friday. After wavering for much of the session, the Dow rallied in the afternoon to close with a gain of less than 0.1%, eking out its second straight record close. The Nasdaq ended Friday's session 0.4% lower. FedEx (FDX) shares plummeted 15.2%, the steepest drop of any S&P 500 stock, after the package delivery giant reported lower-than-expected quarterly results and trimmed its full-year forecasts. The company cited soft demand trends, especially in U.S. markets. Following the earnings release, analysts at the investment bank Jefferies reduced their price target on FedEx stock. Lennar (LEN) topped sales and profit estimates with its fiscal third-quarter results, but shares of the homebuilder fell 5.4% after it predicted its gross margin on home sales would remain flat quarter-over-quarter. Friday's downdraft reversed the gains posted by Lennar stock in the previous session following the Fed's rate-cut announcement. Shares of Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) also gave back the gains they notched after the Fed's decision, dropping 5.2% on Friday. The less-than-truckload (LTL) freight company is navigating numerous headwinds, with shipment volumes and rates coming under pressure amid soft freight demand, increasing capital expenditures and a shortage of drivers. Electric utility Constellation Energy (CEG) announced plans to restart operations at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant to provide environmentally friendly energy for Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. Constellation said it inked a 20-year deal with the software giant to create the Crane Clean Energy Center, generating carbon-free electricity to power Microsoft's data centers on the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland power transmission system. Constellation Energy shares soared 22.3% on Friday, notching the top performance in the S&P 500. Constellation's announcement also helped lift shares of other electricity generators, including those of power utility Vistra (VST), which jumped 16.6%. Vistra also announced it will acquire the remaining 15% stake that it does not currently own in its subsidiary Vistra Vision, which includes nuclear, solar, and energy storage assets. Meanwhile, shares of fellow Texas-based power generator NRG Energy (NRG) added 6.4%. Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) gained 8.1% following positive comments from analysts at Citigroup. The cybersecurity firm drew negative attention in July when a faulty update of its security software caused widespread technology outages worldwide. However, analysts applauded transparency from the company's management team following the incident. Citi also pointed to CrowdStrike's success in limiting customer churn and maintaining pricing.

Title: FedEx downgraded to hold, price target cut to $300

On Friday, HSBC adjusted its stance on FedEx (NYSE:FDX), shifting the rating from Buy to Hold and lowering the price target to $300 from the previous $350. The decision was influenced by revised earnings expectations, with the firm's forecast for fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP EBIT dropping by 8% to $6.8 billion. This figure falls 3% short of the company's guidance midpoint of $7.0 billion and is 4% below the consensus. The analyst from HSBC highlighted a decrease in projected volumes and yields as the primary reasons for the downgrade. Alongside the EBIT revision, the firm's forecast for non-GAAP EPS for fiscal year 2025 was also reduced by 6% to $20.09, which is 2% below the midpoint of guidance and consensus estimates. The target price adjustment reflects a lower target PE multiple of 15.1x, down from 16.6x. FedEx's stock performance was part of the evaluation, with a notable 21% rally year-to-date, mirroring the S&P 500's performance but outperforming its competitors. UPS's shares fell by 13%, and DHL's by 7% in the same period. The analyst pointed out that over the past two years, FedEx's share price has nearly doubled, increasing by 92.5% compared to a 20% decline for UPS and a 51% increase for the S&P 500. This surge in FedEx's stock was attributed to the success of its restructuring plan, which the analyst believes is now largely factored into the current share price. In other recent news, FedEx has experienced a series of adjustments following its first-quarter financial results for fiscal year 2025. The delivery giant reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60, falling short of market expectations due to a shift in the types of shipments it handled. Despite these challenges, FedEx management has maintained a positive outlook, citing cost-saving measures and revenue management initiatives expected to increase sequentially throughout the year. Raymond James reduced its price target for FedEx to $310, while maintaining an Outperform rating, citing ongoing strategic initiatives such as the DRIVE program. TD Cowen reduced its price target to $328, but maintained a Buy rating, reflecting cautious optimism about FedEx's long-term potential. Jefferies, on the other hand, reduced its price target to $275, maintaining a Hold rating due to weaker than anticipated margins. Susquehanna lowered its price target for FedEx to $330, but maintained a Positive rating, expressing optimism for the company's potential rebound. Stifel also adjusted its price target for FedEx to $321, retaining a Buy rating despite the company's underperformance. As FedEx (NYSE:FDX) navigates through a period of recalibrated expectations, it's essential to consider the broader financial landscape and performance indicators that InvestingPro offers. The company boasts a market capitalization of $73.58 billion and trades at a P/E ratio of 17.26, which is noteworthy given the recent analyst downgrades and the high P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth.

FedEx (FDX) shares plunged 15% Friday, a day after the package delivery giant missed quarterly estimates and reduced its forecast as it faced what Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Rajesh Subramaniam called a "challenging Q1 demand environment," especially in the U.S. Subramaniam told analysts that weakness in the industrial economy dragged down business-to-business (B2B) volumes. Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere added that the drop in B2B sales led to a 3% volume decline in U.S. domestic express services. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) John Dietrich noted that the results "were negatively affected by soft revenue trends, with a global decline in priority volume and growth in deferred volume." Deitrich said in light of the first-quarter performance, FedEx was cutting the top end of its full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) outlook to $21 from $22. FedEx also sees revenue growth to be in a low-single-digit percentage, down from its earlier forecast of a low- to mid-single-digit percentage. Following the report, Jefferies reduced its price target to $275 from $300. The analysts argued that with the current quarter expected to be pressured and its first-half EPS estimates down 20%, "we do not think the company can achieve the low end of its EPS guide." Shares of FedEx plunged more than 15% in late-morning trading Friday to $254.30, less than 1% above where they began the year.

Title: FedEx stock target cut, retains hold rating on 1Q results

On Friday, Jefferies made an adjustment to its outlook on FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares, reducing the price target on the company's shares to $275 from the previous $300, while keeping a Hold rating on the stock. The adjustment follows FedEx's recent earnings report, which revealed first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal year 2025 that fell more than 25% below market expectations. This shortfall was attributed to weaker than anticipated margins in both the Federal Express and Freight segments. According to the financial firm, FedEx's adjusted operating profit saw a year-over-year decline of $380 million, or 24%. This significant drop was noted even though FedEx had realized $1.8 billion in cost savings last year from its DRIVE initiative. The DRIVE program was designed to increase efficiency and reduce operational costs across the company's various business units. The analysis further highlighted that the margin for the Federal Express segment was at its lowest since the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. The anticipated pressure on the second quarter's performance and a 20% downward revision of first-half EPS estimates have led to skepticism about FedEx's ability to meet the lower end of its EPS guidance for the year. The report from Jefferies suggests caution, indicating that the upcoming second quarter could present additional challenges for FedEx. The company's financial performance in the first half of the fiscal year has prompted a reassessment of its earnings potential, leading to the revised price target. Despite the cost-saving measures implemented by FedEx, the current financial results have not met the expectations set by previous forecasts. In other recent news, FedEx's financial performance has been the subject of various adjustments by financial firms. Susquehanna cut its price target for FedEx to $330, while maintaining a positive rating, following the company's first-quarter results for fiscal year 2025, which missed expectations with an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60. Similarly, Stifel revised its price target for FedEx to $321 from $327, maintaining a buy rating despite the company's underperformance. Baird also adjusted its price target for FedEx, reducing it to $320 from $340, but retained an outperform rating. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley downgraded FedEx stock from Equalweight to Underweight, reducing the price target to $200, citing FedEx's forecasted EPS for fiscal year 2025 as significantly below the guidance provided by FedEx's management. FedEx's first-quarter results showed a shift in the types of shipments it handled, impacting the company's blended yield and leading to higher costs associated with purchased transportation. However, the company's management indicated that cost savings are expected to increase sequentially throughout the year, with revenue management initiatives in place to mitigate the pressure on yields. FedEx is implementing the 'DRIVE' initiative as part of its restructuring plan, aimed at reducing costs and enhancing operational efficiency. These are all recent developments for FedEx, providing insights into the company's performance and strategic initiatives. Following Jefferies' revision of FedEx's price target, it's pertinent to consider additional insights from InvestingPro to gauge the company's financial health and market position. According to InvestingPro data, FedEx's market capitalization stands at $73.58 billion, with a P/E ratio of 17.26, indicating investor sentiment on its earnings potential. The company has experienced a revenue decline over the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, with a -2.73% change, yet it maintains a strong gross profit margin of 27.32%. InvestingPro Tips highlight that FedEx has consistently raised its dividend for the last three years and has maintained dividend payments for 23 consecutive years, showcasing its commitment to returning value to shareholders. Moreover, FedEx has shown a strong return over the last three months, with a price total return of 19.31%, and analysts predict the company will remain profitable this year. These factors underscore FedEx's resilience and the potential for long-term investor confidence. For those seeking further insights, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available, which provide deeper analysis into FedEx's performance and future outlook (https://www.investing.com/pro/FDX).

Title: Why Did FedEx Stock Fall 13%?

FedEx truck is seen in New York City, United States on July 16, 2024. (Photo by Jakub ... [+] Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) FedEx stock (NYSE: FDX) saw a 13% fall in after-market hours on Thursday, September 19, after it reported Q1’25 results (fiscal ends in May) far worse than the street estimates. FDX stock is up 7% year-to-date, compared to -15% returns for its peer – UPS stock. FedEx reported revenue of $21.6 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share, well below our estimates of $22.1 billion, and $4.90, respectively. The company’s results were also lower than the consensus estimates of $22.0 billion and $4.83, respectively. Not only did FedEx report a downbeat quarter, it cut its full-year outlook, weighing on its stock. Overall, the performance of FDX stock with respect to the index has been quite volatile in recent years. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could FDX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We now estimate FedEx’s Valuation to be $285 per share, reflecting just 9% upside from its levels of around $260. Our forecast is based on a 14x forward expected adjusted earnings of $20.85, broadly aligning with the stock’s average P/E ratio over the last five years. FedEx’s Revenue fell 0.5% y-o-y to $21.6 billion in Q1, due to lower express and freight segment sales. The average daily volume was flat y-o-y for the express segment, but the average daily shipments were down 3% for the freight segment. FedEx also saw its adjusted operating margin contract by 170 bps to 5.6% in Q1’25. This resulted in its bottom line of $3.60 on an adjusted basis, down 21% y-o-y. This dismal performance by FedEx can be attributed to continued weakness in shipping demand. With continued price increases, consumers have become more cautious and are opting for lower priced services. FedEx will also lose the U.S. Postal Service as its client, likely resulting in around a $500 million headwind for the company. Looking forward, FedEx expects a low single-digit rise in total revenues for fiscal 2025, slightly more cautious than its prior outlook of a low to mid-single-digit rise. Although, its focus on cost-cutting initiatives should bode well for the bottom-line growth. FedEx is in the midst of its $4 billion cost-saving efforts by the end of fiscal 2025. Still, it lowered its earnings outlook to now be in the range of $20 and $21 per share, versus $20 and $22 per share earlier. We now forecast the 2025 revenue to be around $89.7 billion, reflecting a 2% y-o-y rise, and adjusted earnings to be $20.85, versus $17.80 in fiscal 2024. While FedEx will likely benefit from its focus on improving margins, the company faces headwinds amid soft demand, which may continue to weigh on its stock performance in the near term. While FDX stock posted a downbeat Q1, it is helpful to see how FedEx’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession?
