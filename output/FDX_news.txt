FedEx (FDX) shares plunged 15% Friday, a day after the package delivery giant missed quarterly estimates and reduced its forecast as it faced what Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Rajesh Subramaniam called a "challenging Q1 demand environment," especially in the U.S. Subramaniam told analysts that weakness in the industrial economy dragged down business-to-business (B2B) volumes. Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere added that the drop in B2B sales led to a 3% volume decline in U.S. domestic express services. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) John Dietrich noted that the results "were negatively affected by soft revenue trends, with a global decline in priority volume and growth in deferred volume." Deitrich said in light of the first-quarter performance, FedEx was cutting the top end of its full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) outlook to $21 from $22. FedEx also sees revenue growth to be in a low-single-digit percentage, down from its earlier forecast of a low- to mid-single-digit percentage. Following the report, Jefferies reduced its price target to $275 from $300. The analysts argued that with the current quarter expected to be pressured and its first-half EPS estimates down 20%, "we do not think the company can achieve the low end of its EPS guide." Shares of FedEx plunged more than 15% in late-morning trading Friday to $254.30, less than 1% above where they began the year.

Title: Why Did FedEx Stock Fall 13%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/20/why-did-fedex-stock-fall-13/
Time Published: 2024-09-20T12:11:04Z
Full Content:
FedEx truck is seen in New York City, United States on July 16, 2024. (Photo by Jakub ... [+] Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) FedEx stock (NYSE: FDX) saw a 13% fall in after-market hours on Thursday, September 19, after it reported Q1’25 results (fiscal ends in May) far worse than the street estimates. FDX stock is up 7% year-to-date, compared to -15% returns for its peer – UPS stock. FedEx reported revenue of $21.6 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share, well below our estimates of $22.1 billion, and $4.90, respectively. The company’s results were also lower than the consensus estimates of $22.0 billion and $4.83, respectively. Not only did FedEx report a downbeat quarter, it cut its full-year outlook, weighing on its stock. Overall, the performance of FDX stock with respect to the index has been quite volatile in recent years. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could FDX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We now estimate FedEx’s Valuation to be $285 per share, reflecting just 9% upside from its levels of around $260. Our forecast is based on a 14x forward expected adjusted earnings of $20.85, broadly aligning with the stock’s average P/E ratio over the last five years. FedEx’s Revenue fell 0.5% y-o-y to $21.6 billion in Q1, due to lower express and freight segment sales. The average daily volume was flat y-o-y for the express segment, but the average daily shipments were down 3% for the freight segment. FedEx also saw its adjusted operating margin contract by 170 bps to 5.6% in Q1’25. This resulted in its bottom line of $3.60 on an adjusted basis, down 21% y-o-y. This dismal performance by FedEx can be attributed to continued weakness in shipping demand. With continued price increases, consumers have become more cautious and are opting for lower priced services. FedEx will also lose the U.S. Postal Service as its client, likely resulting in around a $500 million headwind for the company. Looking forward, FedEx expects a low single-digit rise in total revenues for fiscal 2025, slightly more cautious than its prior outlook of a low to mid-single-digit rise. Although, its focus on cost-cutting initiatives should bode well for the bottom-line growth. FedEx is in the midst of its $4 billion cost-saving efforts by the end of fiscal 2025. Still, it lowered its earnings outlook to now be in the range of $20 and $21 per share, versus $20 and $22 per share earlier. We now forecast the 2025 revenue to be around $89.7 billion, reflecting a 2% y-o-y rise, and adjusted earnings to be $20.85, versus $17.80 in fiscal 2024. While FedEx will likely benefit from its focus on improving margins, the company faces headwinds amid soft demand, which may continue to weigh on its stock performance in the near term. While FDX stock posted a downbeat Q1, it is helpful to see how FedEx’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

A FedEx Express plane prepares for landing at the Beijing Capital International airport in Beijing ... [+] on September 6, 2024. (Photo by ADEK BERRY / AFP) (Photo by ADEK BERRY/AFP via Getty Images) FedEx (NYSE: FDX) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2025 results on Thursday, September 19 (FedEx’s fiscal year ends in May). We expect the company to post an upbeat quarter, driven by an overall improvement in volumes. Furthermore, its cost reduction actions are expected to bolster its bottom-line growth. Although we think FedEx navigated well in Q1, its stock appears to have little room for growth from its current levels of around $300. Our interactive dashboard analysis of FedEx’s Earnings Preview has more details on the company’s revenues and earnings for the quarter. So, what are some trends likely to drive FedEx’s results? Firstly, let us look at FedEx’s performance in the previous quarter. FedEx’s Revenue rose 1% y-o-y to $22.1 billion, primarily due to slightly higher yields for both Express and Ground segments. The average daily volume was down 1% for Express but up 1% for the Ground segment. FedEx also saw its adjusted operating margin expand by 40 bps to 8.5% in Q4’24. This clubbed with a 2% decline in average shares outstanding, amid share repurchases, resulted in a 10% rise in the bottom line to $5.41 on an adjusted basis. Coming to the latest quarter, we expect revenues to be around $22.1 billion, reflecting a roughly 2% y-o-y rise - slightly ahead of the consensus estimate of a little under $22 billion. FedEx has had a tough few quarters amid falling delivery volumes. The weakening consumer demand in the wake of high inflation has weighed on overall volumes. However, the company has seen market share gains lately and this should aid overall sales growth. Average daily volumes are also expected to now improve after seeing weaker demand over last year. Additionally, FedEx’s Q1 results should benefit from its ongoing cost-cutting initiatives that aim to reduce $4 billion in costs by the end of fiscal 2025. We estimate the bottom line to be $4.90 on an adjusted basis, reflecting 8% y-o-y growth. With the U.S. Fed expected to announce a rate cut now, consumer sentiment is expected to improve over the coming quarters. However, the broader markets will react to the quantum of the rate cut. A lower-than-expected rate cut will likely result in a correction. Curious about the impact of a market crash on FDX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can FedEx Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. Looking at FDX stock now, we think it has little room for growth. We estimate FedEx’s Valuation to be $318 per share, reflecting an upside of less than 10% from its current levels of around $300. FDX stock is already trading at 14x forward expected adjusted earnings of $21.00 per share, which is aligned with the stock’s average P/E ratio seen over the last five years. Even if we look at a slightly longer term, FDX stock, with 15% gains since early 2021, has underperformed the broader markets. Its annual returns are considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Overall, we think FedEx will post an upbeat Q1, and it will likely have more positives to look forward to on the back of improving volumes and margin expansion. While much of this appears to be priced in, the stock could still see higher levels if the company were to raise its full-year outlook and the overall volume shows further signs of improvement. While FDX stock will react to its Q1 results, it is helpful to see how FedEx’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: FedEx stock target cut, retains hold rating on 1Q results
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/fedex-stock-target-cut-retains-hold-rating-on-1q-results-93CH-3625468
Time Published: 2024-09-20T12:12:29Z

On Friday, Jefferies made an adjustment to its outlook on FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares, reducing the price target on the company's shares to $275 from the previous $300, while keeping a Hold rating on the stock. The adjustment follows FedEx's recent earnings report, which revealed first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal year 2025 that fell more than 25% below market expectations. This shortfall was attributed to weaker than anticipated margins in both the Federal Express and Freight segments. According to the financial firm, FedEx's adjusted operating profit saw a year-over-year decline of $380 million, or 24%. This significant drop was noted even though FedEx had realized $1.8 billion in cost savings last year from its DRIVE initiative. The DRIVE program was designed to increase efficiency and reduce operational costs across the company's various business units. The analysis further highlighted that the margin for the Federal Express segment was at its lowest since the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. The anticipated pressure on the second quarter's performance and a 20% downward revision of first-half EPS estimates have led to skepticism about FedEx's ability to meet the lower end of its EPS guidance for the year. The report from Jefferies suggests caution, indicating that the upcoming second quarter could present additional challenges for FedEx. The company's financial performance in the first half of the fiscal year has prompted a reassessment of its earnings potential, leading to the revised price target. Despite the cost-saving measures implemented by FedEx, the current financial results have not met the expectations set by previous forecasts. In other recent news, FedEx's financial performance has been the subject of various adjustments by financial firms. Susquehanna cut its price target for FedEx to $330, while maintaining a positive rating, following the company's first-quarter results for fiscal year 2025, which missed expectations with an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60. Similarly, Stifel revised its price target for FedEx to $321 from $327, maintaining a buy rating despite the company's underperformance. Baird also adjusted its price target for FedEx, reducing it to $320 from $340, but retained an outperform rating. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley downgraded FedEx stock from Equalweight to Underweight, reducing the price target to $200, citing FedEx's forecasted EPS for fiscal year 2025 as significantly below the guidance provided by FedEx's management.

UPDATE—Sept. 19, 2024: This article has been updated to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price information. FedEx (FDX) is set to report fiscal 2025 first-quarter earnings after the bell Thursday, with analysts expecting the shipping giant to post year-over-year revenue and profit gains. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expect net income of $1.16 billion on revenue of $21.95 billion, up from $1.08 billion and $21.68 billion, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Analysts are largely optimistic about FedEx's stock, with 11 "buy" ratings and just "hold" and one "sell" rating apiece, according to Visible Alpha's database, with an average price target of $323.50, about 6% above Thursday's intraday price of $303.97. In its fourth-quarter report in June, FedEx introduced its projections for fiscal 2025. It guided low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth, while analysts expect growth of just over 2% from last year's $87.69 billion. The company also saw earnings per share (EPS) between $18.25 and $20.25, 6% to 18% better than the $17.21 generated in fiscal 2024, while analysts expect $19.87. FedEx will be losing out on one source of revenue later this month, when its contract with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) officially ends and shipping rival UPS (UPS) takes over as the USPS' official air freight carrier. In April, FedEx said it was unable to reach "mutually agreeable terms" with the USPS, and said it planned to "implement adjustments" to its shipping network to adjust for the lost volume and further improve profitability. In April 2023, FedEx announced plans to restructure and cut an estimated $4 billion in costs by 2025. The plan largely has paid off, with FedEx mostly posting substantial profit improvements despite revenue declines or slight gains in recent quarters. FedEx looked to cut costs after shipping demand fell from its pandemic-fueled peak, with UPS also reporting revenue declines amid lower volumes. Last quarter, FedEx said it expected to cut about $2.2 billion in costs over fiscal 2025, up from $1.8 billion in fiscal 2024. FedEx Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said in its June earnings call that the company expects "the demand environment to moderately improve as we move through the year." FedEx shares were up close to 2% in intraday trading Thursday, ahead of the company's earnings report after the bell. They've gained about 20% since the start of the year.
