We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. BofA Securities analyst Ken Hoexter reiterated a Buy rating on FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), raising the price forecast to $348 from $325. Yesterday, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.05 per share, beating the $3.91 consensus estimate. Quarterly revenue came in at $22 billion, missing the $22.11 billion analyst consensus estimate. FedEx now expects approximately flat revenue year-over-year, versus its prior forecast of a low single-digit percentage increase. The analyst mentions that CEO Raj Subramaniam highlighted the potential for significant value creation through improved strategic, operational, and financial execution for FedEx. Hoexter writes that the sum-of-the-parts valuation suggests a potential value of $348 per share. Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Weight-Loss Market Experts Scoop Up Novo Nordisk Stock After Worst Drop Since 2002 Following Drug Trial Miss This apart, according to the analyst, FedEx Freight will retain its name, collaborate with FedEx, expand its dedicated sales force by about 300, launch a new pricing and invoicing system for Less-than-truckload, and reduce vendor spending through increased automation. The analyst writes the separation will unlock value, positioning the company as the largest pure-play public North American less-than-truckload carrier. Hoexter increased EPS estimates for FY25 and FY26 by 2%, raising them to $19.45 and $23.15, respectively, from $19.15 and $22.80. Overall, the analyst notes that FedEx benefits from cross-border trade growth and demonstrates structural pricing gains as carriers work to improve investment returns.

Title: What's Next For FDX Stock?

FedEx stock (NYSE: FDX) is expected to see higher levels after it announced the spin-off of its freight business. While this move was awaited, it bodes well for the stock, unlocking shareholder value. The division is estimated to be worth over $30 billion. [1] Although FedEx’s freight business accounted for only 10% of the company’s total revenues in fiscal 2024, it was far more profitable, with 20% operating margin, versus 2% for Express and 12% for the Ground segment. The spin-off will help FedEx focus on the core delivery business and improve its profitability. While FDX stock may see higher levels in the near term, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. FDX stock has fared well in recent years, with 66% gains since early 2023. This can be attributed to a 2x rise in the company’s trailing P/E ratio from 8x to 16x; partly offset by an 18% fall in adjusted earnings from $20.61 in 2022 to $16.92 now. The earnings decline is a result of lower revenues and margin contraction. FedEx’s revenue declined 6% from $93.5 billion in 2022 to $87.6 billion now, due to lower e-commerce volumes compared to the peak during the pandemic, rising costs pushing customers to cheaper alternatives, and a reduced international shipping demand, among other factors. The company’s adjusted net margin declined by 110 bps over this period due to higher operational costs, including labor and rentals. Notably, the increase in FDX stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 1% in 2021, -32% in 2022, and 49% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and the changes in the White House, could FDX face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? After today’s expected rise following the spin-off development, we think FDX stock will be fairly priced. At levels of around $285, FDX stock trades at 17x trailing adjusted earnings of $16.92 per share, versus the stock’s average P/E ratio of 16x over the last two years. Now, with the freight business spin-off, a rise in valuation multiple for FDX seems justified, and the stock may see higher levels. We currently estimate FedEx’s Valuation to be $285 per share, aligning with its current levels. We will soon update our model to reflect the impact of the spin-off. While FDX stock looks fairly priced, it is helpful to see how FedEx’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

$1 Billion Share Repurchases Completed During QuarterFull-Year Fiscal 2025 Earnings Outlook RevisedFedEx Completes FedEx Freight Assessment, Will Pursue Full Separation and Create a New Publicly Traded LTL Company MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) today reported the following consolidated results for the second quarter ended November 30 (adjusted measures exclude the item listed below): Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2024 As Reported(GAAP) Adjusted(non-GAAP) As Reported(GAAP) Adjusted(non-GAAP)Revenue $22.0 billion $22.0 billion $22.2 billion $22.2 billionOperating income $1.05 billion $1.38 billion $1.28 billion $1.42 billionOperating margin 4.8% 6.3% 5.8% 6.4%Net income $0.74 billion $0.99 billion $0.90 billion $1.01 billionDiluted EPS $3.03 $4.05 $3.55 $3.99This year's and last year's quarterly consolidated results have been adjusted for:Impact per diluted share Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2024Business optimization costs $1.02 $0.44Our second quarter results demonstrate that our efforts to transform our operations are working. The Federal Express segment delivered operating profit growth despite several headwinds, including the continued weak U.S. domestic demand environment as well as the expiration of our U.S. Postal Service contract, said Raj Subramaniam, FedEx Corp. president and chief executive officer. I am proud of the team for continuing to deliver solid service to our customers throughout the Peak season, as we create a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. Consolidated operating results were negatively affected by lower-than-expected FedEx Freight revenue and profit, as sustained weakness in U.S. industrial production continued to pressure less-than-truckload industry demand. The lower FedEx Freight results were mostly offset by cost reduction benefits at Federal Express from DRIVE program initiatives and higher base yields at each transportation segment. Federal Express segment adjusted operating results improved during the quarter, driven by cost reduction benefits from DRIVE, higher base yield, and increased international export volume. These factors were partially offset by higher wage and purchased transportation rates, the expiration of the U.S. Postal Service contract for transportation services on September 29, 2024, and U.S. domestic package demand weakness. FedEx Freight segment operating results decreased during the quarter due to fewer shipments, lower fuel surcharges, and reduced weight per shipment, partially offset by higher base yield. Last year's second quarter operating income included a $30 million gain on the sale of facilities. Share Repurchase Program FedEx completed $1 billion in share repurchases via open market and accelerated share repurchase transactions during the quarter. Approximately 3.7 million shares were delivered from the transactions, with the decrease in outstanding shares benefiting second quarter results by $0.07 per diluted share. The company expects to repurchase an additional $500 million of common stock during fiscal 2025, for a buyback total of $2.5 billion. As of November 30, 2024, $3.1 billion remained available for repurchases under the company's 2024 stock repurchase authorization. Cash on-hand as of November 30, 2024, was $5.0 billion. FedEx Freight Assessment Earlier today, FedEx announced that its Board of Directors has concluded a comprehensive assessment of the role of FedEx Freight as part of its portfolio and has decided to pursue a full separation through the capital markets, creating a new publicly traded company. The separation is expected to be achieved in a tax-efficient manner for FedEx stockholders and executed within the next 18 months. Additional information can be found in the related press release at investors.fedex.com. Outlook FedEx is unable to forecast the fiscal 2025 mark-to-market ("M™") retirement plans accounting adjustments. As a result, FedEx is unable to provide a fiscal 2025 earnings per share ("EPS") or effective tax rate ("ETR") outlook on a GAAP basis and is relying on the exemption provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). It is reasonably possible that the fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments could have a material effect on fiscal 2025 consolidated financial results and ETR. FedEx is revising its fiscal 2025 revenue and earnings forecasts, and now expects:Approximately flat revenue year over year, compared to the prior forecast of a low single-digit percentage increase;Diluted EPS of $16.45 to $17.45 before the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments compared to the prior forecast of $17.90 to $18.90 per share; and $19.00 to $20.00 per share after also excluding costs related to business optimization initiatives, compared to the prior forecast of $20.00 to $21.00 per share; andETR of approximately 24.0% prior to the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments, compared to the prior forecast of approximately 24.5%.FedEx is reaffirming its forecast of:Permanent cost reductions from the DRIVE transformation program of $2.2 billion; andCapital spending of $5.2 billion, with a priority on investments in network optimization and efficiency improvement, including fleet and facility modernization and automation.These forecasts assume the company's current economic forecast and fuel price expectations, successful completion of the planned stock repurchases, and no additional adverse economic or geopolitical developments. FedEx's ETR and EPS forecasts are based on current law and related regulations and guidance. I remain confident FedEx will continue to grow earnings this year despite the challenging demand environment, as we focus on transforming operations and improving revenue quality, said John Dietrich, FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer. We are resolute in our strategy to prudently manage our capital expenditures, and expect to deliver on our commitment to return $3.8 billion to stockholders this fiscal year. Corporate Overview FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. With annual revenue of $87 billion, the company offers integrated business solutions utilizing its flexible, efficient, and intelligent global network. Consistently ranked among the world's most admired and trusted employers, FedEx inspires its more than 500,000 employees to remain focused on safety, the highest ethical and professional standards and the needs of their customers and communities. FedEx is committed to connecting people and possibilities around the world responsibly and resourcefully, with a goal to achieve carbon-neutral operations by 2040.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We do not undertake or assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. The financial section of this release is provided on the company's website at investors.fedex.com.RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 Results The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP or reported). We have supplemented the reporting of our financial information determined in accordance with GAAP with certain non-GAAP (or adjusted) financial measures, including our adjusted second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 consolidated operating income and margin, income taxes, net income and diluted earnings per share and adjusted second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 Federal Express segment operating income and margin. These financial measures have been adjusted to exclude the effects of business optimization costs incurred in fiscal 2025 and 2024. In fiscal 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company's long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We incurred costs associated with our business optimization initiatives in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. These costs were primarily related to professional services and severance. Costs related to business optimization initiatives are excluded from our second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 consolidated and Federal Express segment non-GAAP financial measures because they are unrelated to our core operating performance and to assist investors with assessing trends in our underlying businesses. The income tax effect of the business optimization initiatives is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. The impact of these non-GAAP items on the company's effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-GAAP adjustment. We believe these adjusted financial measures facilitate analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the company's and our business segments' core operating performance, and may assist investors with comparisons to prior periods and assessing trends in our underlying businesses. These adjustments are consistent with how management views our businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluating the company's and each business segment's ongoing performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement and should be read together with, and are not an alternative or substitute for, and should not be considered superior to, our reported financial results. Accordingly, users of our financial statements should not place undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. As required by SEC rules, the tables below present a reconciliation of our presented non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Fiscal 2025 Earnings Per Share and Effective Tax Rate Forecasts Our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments and estimated costs related to business optimization initiatives in fiscal 2025. Our fiscal 2025 ETR forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes the effect of fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments. We have provided these non-GAAP financial measures for the same reasons that were outlined above for historical non-GAAP measures. Costs related to business optimization initiatives are excluded from our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast for the same reasons described above for historical non-GAAP measures. We are unable to predict the amount of the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments, as they are significantly affected by changes in interest rates and the financial markets, so such adjustments are not included in our fiscal 2025 EPS and ETR forecasts. For this reason, a full reconciliation of our fiscal 2025 EPS and ETR forecasts to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is impracticable. It is reasonably possible, however, that our fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments could have a material effect on our fiscal 2025 consolidated financial results and ETR. The table included below titled Fiscal 2025 Diluted Earnings Per Share Forecast outlines the effects of the items that are excluded from our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast, other than the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments.

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 Results The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP or reported). We have supplemented the reporting of our financial information determined in accordance with GAAP with certain non-GAAP (or adjusted) financial measures, including our adjusted second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 consolidated operating income and margin, income taxes, net income and diluted earnings per share and adjusted second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 Federal Express segment operating income and margin. These financial measures have been adjusted to exclude the effects of business optimization costs incurred in fiscal 2025 and 2024. In fiscal 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company's long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We incurred costs associated with our business optimization initiatives in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. These costs were primarily related to professional services and severance. Costs related to business optimization initiatives are excluded from our second quarter fiscal 2025 and 2024 consolidated and Federal Express segment non-GAAP financial measures because they are unrelated to our core operating performance and to assist investors with assessing trends in our underlying businesses. The income tax effect of the business optimization initiatives is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. The impact of these non-GAAP items on the company's effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-GAAP adjustment. We believe these adjusted financial measures facilitate analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the company's and our business segments' core operating performance, and may assist investors with comparisons to prior periods and assessing trends in our underlying businesses. These adjustments are consistent with how management views our businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluating the company's and each business segment's ongoing performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement and should be read together with, and are not an alternative or substitute for, and should not be considered superior to, our reported financial results. Accordingly, users of our financial statements should not place undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. As required by SEC rules, the tables below present a reconciliation of our presented non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Fiscal 2025 Earnings Per Share and Effective Tax Rate Forecasts Our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments and estimated costs related to business optimization initiatives in fiscal 2025. Our fiscal 2025 ETR forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes the effect of fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments. We have provided these non-GAAP financial measures for the same reasons that were outlined above for historical non-GAAP measures. Costs related to business optimization initiatives are excluded from our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast for the same reasons described above for historical non-GAAP measures. We are unable to predict the amount of the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments, as they are significantly affected by changes in interest rates and the financial markets, so such adjustments are not included in our fiscal 2025 EPS and ETR forecasts. For this reason, a full reconciliation of our fiscal 2025 EPS and ETR forecasts to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is impracticable. It is reasonably possible, however, that our fiscal 2025 M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments could have a material effect on our fiscal 2025 consolidated financial results and ETR. The table included below titled Fiscal 2025 Diluted Earnings Per Share Forecast outlines the effects of the items that are excluded from our fiscal 2025 EPS forecast, other than the M™ retirement plans accounting adjustments.
