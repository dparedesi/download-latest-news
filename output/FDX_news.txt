Title: Why UPS Stock Is Falling Today

Summary: FedEx results indicate investors should not expect a quick recovery in the transport sector.
Content: FedExÂ sounded the alarm, and investors in its archrival are taking notice.
Shares of United Parcel Service (UPS -2.67%) traded down 3% as of 2 p.m. ET after FedEx missed quarterly expectations and lowered its full-year forecast.
Falling in sympathy
Transportation companies have been stuck in traffic for the last few years. A surge in shipments after the height of the pandemic gave way to a slowdown as the economy cooled and interest rates spiked higher, leading to soft pricing.
The question for investors has been how long the down cycle will last. Judging from FedEx's results, there will be no quick recovery.
FedEx missed top- and bottom-line expectations and cut its guidance for full-year profits. Although UPS is separate and its business mix is a little different from FedEx, investors are understandably concerned that the "challenging" market impacting FedEx will also eat into UPS' results in the quarters to come. The outlook was weakest for FedEx's premium offerings, suggesting a lack of pricing power in the months ahead.






Is UPS stock a buy?
UPS, like FedEx, is a stalwart of the global economy. The company's services are hard to replace, and there is a good chance that over time the company, and the stock, can outperform the market.
That said, it is hard to outrun the business cycle. And UPS' new labor contracts, reached after difficult negotiations last year, will weigh on results in the near term. Investors should feel no urgency to rush in and buy the dip.

Summary: A weak quarterly report shows the logistics giant's turnaround efforts will take time to show results.
Content: FedEx (FDX -15.23%) reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results after the closing bell Thursday, and lowered its profit outlook for the fiscal year.
Investors Friday don't appear interested in going along for the ride -- they've sent FedEx shares down by more than 14% as of 10:45 a.m. ET.
Challenging times
It has been a difficult few years for transportation companies. Rising interest rates and fears about the health of the economy have led many companies to cut back on inventories, which has in turn led to less demand for business-to-business shipments.
Those pressures do not appear to be easing. In its fiscal 2025 first quarter, which ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $3.60 per share on revenue of $21.6 billion, falling short of Wall Street's consensus estimates for earnings of $4.76 per share on sales of $21.9 billion.
Revenue was down slightly year over year, with FedEx reporting decreased demand for its higher-margin priority services.





"Despite a challenging quarter, we remain focused on transforming our network, improving our efficiency, lowering our cost-to-serve, and enhancing our ability to adapt with speed to evolving market dynamics," CEO Raj Subramaniam said in the earnings release.

Is FedEx stock a buy?
FedEx cut its guidance for fiscal 2025 earnings per share to a range of $20 to $21 (down from $20 to $22 previously), and cut its outlook for revenue growth to a low-single-digit percentage from the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range it had earlier targeted. Management has rolled out a cost-cutting program, but that will take time to fully implement.
"Overall, I remain confident in the value-creation opportunities ahead as we focus on reducing our structural cost, growing revenue profitably, and leveraging the insights from our vast collection of data as we continue to build the world's most flexible, efficient and intelligent network," Subramaniam said.
FedEx is an integral part of the global supply chain, and the company should do well over

Summary: The Oracle of Omaha has purchased shares of this company for 24 consecutive quarters, dating back to the midpoint of 2018.
Content: Few investors receive as much attention on Wall Street as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.34%) (BRK.B -0.96%) CEO Warren Buffett. This is because the Oracle of Omaha has lapped Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500, many times over.
Since taking the reins at Berkshire in the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares of more than 5,400,000%. Comparatively, the S&P 500 has increased in value, including dividends, by around 37,000% over the same span.
Buffett's well-publicized recipe for success has involved buying stakes in time-tested businesses that offer clear-cut competitive advantages and strong management teams. Most importantly, he looks to the horizon when investing and tends to hold on to positions in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio for years, if not decades, at a time.

But the Oracle of Omaha is also a big-time believer in portfolio concentration. This is to say that his best ideas are deserving of outsize investment capital.
While mirroring Buffett's investment activity has, for decades, been a moneymaking strategy, investors will have to do some unconventional digging to locate his favorite stock to buy.





Warren Buffett has been a very selective buyer of stocks for nearly two years
No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides an easy-to-understand snapshot of which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends Wall Street's best money managers bought into and sold out of in the latest quarter.
Warren Buffett's 13Fs for the last seven quarters (Oct. 1, 2022 to June 30, 2024) show that he and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been unabashed sellers, with net stock sales totaling close to $132 billion. With Berkshire's chief sending roughly
