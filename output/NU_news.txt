The Dow Jones Industrial Average logged a record close on Monday, as U.S. Treasury bonds saw their biggest rally in nearly four months after President-elect Donald Trump selected Scott Bessent as his nominee for Treasury secretary. President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices on everything from gas to automobiles. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that on his first day in office he will impose a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The announcement sparked a dollar rally. It rose 1% against the Canadian dollar and 2% against the Mexican peso, while share markets in Asia fell, as did European equity futures ratcheting up concerns about his America First policies. Crude oil prices on Monday settled sharply lower on the back of speculation over a cease-fire in Lebanon, combined with what appears to be restraint on the part of Iran. U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to announce a ceasefire in Lebanon between armed group Hezbollah and Israel imminently, four senior Lebanese sources said on Monday. Asian shares were mostly lower on Tuesday on the back of Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on China, which could have an impact on other Asian economies. Nifty rose again on Nov 25 adding nearly 4% in two consecutive sessions of gains to regain its losses on a month-on-month basis. At close, Nifty was up 1.32% or 314.7 points at 24221.9. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates an upside breakout for the Nifty with an unfilled opening upside gap. If this gap remains unfilled for the next few sessions, it may mean formation of an important bottom reversal for Nifty around 23263 levels. In the near term 24500 could still pose some resistance for the Nifty while 23900 could offer support.
