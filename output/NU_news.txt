We view this change of leadership as pro USA but not that positive for rest of world. Based on policies that Donald Trump has communicated like corporate and individual tax cuts, import restriction and action against illegal immigrants, if implemented, will definitely be pro growth and employment for US. For India, IT and other export oriented sectors like textiles, auto ancillary etc will tend to benefit. However sanctions and tafiffs on imports from rest of the world may hurt global growth and eventually lead to higher inflation on back of shortage of good and services. Also to combat the same China may announce large stimulus further fuelling inflation restricting FED from cutting rates. So broadly, we believe policies are self-offsetting to some extent and needs to be seen what gets implemented.

Swiggy remained optimistic of growth in quick commerce amid growing competition from deep pocket players and said it has grown amid intense competition over the past decade, an official said on Thursday. In an interview to PTI, CEO Food of Swiggy, Rohit Kapoor, acknowledged the possibility of the entry of Jio into the hyperlocal delivery market as a competitor, but underscored that building a successful business in this sector requires more than just capital. Speaking on the competitive dynamics, Kapoor said that while funding is important, it is not the sole determinant of long-term success, referencing examples of well-capitalised players in India who failed to establish a lasting presence. “Just having a lot of capital has not resulted in great businesses in India,” the official said, adding that success hinges on several other elements,” he said. “You need a strong ability to hire top technical talent, and that’s something traditional companies often struggle with. Beyond talent, a deep understanding of the Indian consumer – something we’ve developed over a decade of experience in kitchens across the country – is essential,” Kapoor said. Reflecting on Swiggy’s experience in the evolving food delivery landscape, the company noted that agility and rapid decision-making are crucial to staying competitive. “Our orientation towards speed allows us to launch a new category quickly, while others might take months to finalize their plans,” the official explained, highlighting the company’s proactive approach in an industry where consumer expectations are high and competition is intense. The official highlighted the changing nature of the sector, noting that 10 years ago, the Indian food delivery market was crowded with players like Foodpanda, TinyOwl, and even global major Amazon. Many of these companies have since exited, unable to maintain traction, reflecting the challenges within the sector. “Our focus remains on understanding consumer needs and rapidly adapting to trends, which we believe provides us an edge, irrespective of who enters the market,” Kapoor stated. Quick Commerce remains a major growth potential with the industry growing at 60-80 per cent.

Read more Gold price rally to continue as we advance into a low-rate era “Gold prices in the international market rallied over 1% to trade over the $2710 level. The move is primarily due to the 25 bps rate cut announced by the US Fed last night. The rate cut led to a cooloff in DXY and subsequently a rally in gold. The yellow has recovered much of the fall witnessed earlier this week. Gold prices normally tend to rise in a low-interest regime. We are currently in a low-interest regime, post two straight cuts announced by the US Fed, and the RBI is expected to cut rates next month. Thereby fuelling the rally in gold further. As we are expected to be in a lower for longer interest rate regime, gold prices are expected to stay elevated. The geopolitical tensions are expected to support the yellow metal further. We reiterate our view on the gold price trajectory. In the long term, gold prices will touch $3000 globally, and Rs 86,000 in the domestic markets.” Track live updates here Sensex opened at 79,611.90, up from its previous close of 79,541.79, and is currently at 79,577.86, reflecting a slight increase of 36.07 points or 0.05 per cent.

FOMC cut its target rate by 25 bps, as expected, to 4.5-4.75% 2. The decision to cut rates was unanimous 3. The post-meeting statement had no real meaningful changes. 4. FOMC statement continues to note that the risks to inflation & employment are roughly in balance, and most importantly continues to provide the same noncommittal guidance that “in considering additional adjustments” to the funds rate the FOMC will be data dependent 5. Chair Powell’s comments at today’s FOMC meeting were on balance dovish: he expressed confidence that inflation & inflationary drivers were well-behaved, saw further cooling in the labor market as unwelcome, and endorsed a plan to gradually ease back toward neutral 6. Chair Powell said a pick-up in inflation could cause the Fed to slow rate cuts as policy rates approach neutral. But that is not the scenario that Powell sees as likely. Instead, he rhetorically asked “Where is the inflation coming from?” and stated ‘the economy is not tight’ 7. Chair Powell was asked multiple times about his interpretation of the rise in treasury yields & whether it might affect Fed policy. He responded that the move has not been sustained long enough for officials to react to 8. When questioned if he would resign if asked by Trump, he said ‘No’ 9. When asked if he’d be legally required to leave, he had another simple one-word answer ‘No’ 10. In addition to being asked whether he would leave, Powell fielded several questions about the election and potential policies of the incoming administration, all of which he avoided giving direct answers Shyam Metalics and Energy Ltd (SMEL), a leading multi-metal conglomerate with footprints in carbon steel, stainless steel, speciality alloys and aluminium foil along with a captive power plant announced its Financial Results for the quarter ended 30th September 2024.

These stocks have been meticulously filtered through our proprietary “AQCG” model, ensuring a rigorous analysis. Investment thesis: ~ We initiate coverage on Polyplex Corporation (PPC) with a BUY rating and TP of Rs 2,464 (valued at 12.0x FY27E EPS). We believe that this less known and under-owned business has all the right ingredients for re-rating and is poised for accelerated growth on the back of: i) increasing share of margin accretive value-added/D-PAC sales, ii) Rising commodity spreads, iii) Strategic acquisition by Al Ghurair group bringing in synergy gains. ~ PPC is the only global packaging company having resin plants at all manufacturing locations. This integration optimizes the supply chain, reduces costs, and accelerates time to market new products. The company focuses on creating an innovative, highly customized, and differentiated products, forming a portfolio of value-added offerings, and differentiated products, applications, and customers (D-PAC) that preserves profitability. ~ The demand-supply mismatch has started to narrow given the robust demand in domestic and global markets. This coupled with limited capacity addition, we believe will aid in spreads bottoming out. We expect the BOPET commodity spread to normalize at Rs 40-45 per kg over H2FY25-26E. ~ With Al Ghurair group capacity of over 500k metric tons per annum (MTPA) mirroring PPC’s capacity, the combined entity is set to set to become one of the largest players in the entire packaging space (BOPP and BOPET combined), offering immense growth potential. ~ Comfortable balance sheet positioning, robust CUF, synergies via a strategic promoter, we see revenue / earnings be on an upward trajectory. We value the business at 12.0x its FY27E estimates, to arrive at a TP of Rs 2,464 and initiate with a BUY . Our BULL/BEAR case scenario suggests a TP of Rs 3,288/1,020.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he would not resign from his role if asked to do so by a re-elected Donald Trump, following the Fed’s decision Thursday to lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Deepak Nitrite’s stock, after witnessing a sell-off in the third week of October, found support at ₹2,640, which arrested the decline. Over the past couple of weeks, it fluctuated within the price band of ₹2,640-2,760. On Wednesday, the stock saw a high-volume breakout, hinting at a potential reversal in the trend.
