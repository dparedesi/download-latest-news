The BSE Sensex plunged 984.23 points or 1.25 per cent to close at 77,690.95, while the broader NSE Nifty50 fell 324.40 points or 1.36 per cent to end at 23,559.05. The market breadth was heavily skewed towards decliners, with 3,299 stocks falling against 670 advances on the BSE. “Relentless selling by FIIs amid weak corporate earnings and a sharp surge in domestic inflation to a 14-month high have further impacted investor sentiment, dashing hopes for a near-term rate cut by the RBI,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Read more The rupee moved in a narrow range and appreciated 1 paisa to close at 84.38 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, as persistent foreign fund outflows and a muted trend in domestic equities weighed on the local unit. The USD/INR pair is trading in a narrow range as the strength of the American currency in the overseas market dented investor sentiment, while suspected intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the rupee supported at lower levels, forex traders said. Read more As India’s 2024 wedding season approaches, gold prices are expected to be impacted by both local demand and global market dynamics. Traditionally, India’s wedding season drives significant gold purchases, and with an estimated 48 lakh weddings from November to December, demand is forecast to remain high, potentially keeping prices elevated. However, record-high prices in 2024 may temper demand, leading some consumers to seek smaller quantities or alternative investment forms. Discounts and jeweller incentives might help moderate prices, yet global factors like US interest rates could keep prices volatile. Kalyan Jewellers India Limited reported a consolidated revenue of ₹11,601 crore for the first half of FY25, marking a 32 per cent increase from ₹8,790 crore in the same period last year.

The correction reflects investors’ growing caution amid rich valuations and macroeconomic uncertainties, with both Nifty and Sensex falling to their respective five-month lows today. This latest downturn was intensified by sustained foreign investor outflows, disappointing corporate earnings, and rising inflation. Since late September, foreign investors have withdrawn approximately $14 billion from Indian equities Corporate earnings have also failed to reassure markets, with several companies reporting their weakest quarterly performances in over four years. Adding to the strain, October’s retail inflation reached a 14-month high of 6.21 percent, dampening hopes of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India in the near future. Further, with today marking the end of weekly Bank Nifty derivatives contracts, traders are expected to be unwinding positions, possibly weighing on banking stocks.

Swiggy Swiggy, the leading food delivery and e-commerce platform in India, made a decent debut on the stock market, listing at around Rs 420, a 7.6% premium over its issue price of Rs 390. This performance is better than expected, considering the moderate subscription of 3.59 times and the initial muted investor response reflected in the low grey market premium. The listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term. Investors should approach Swiggy with a balanced perspective, considering the potential for future growth and the associated risks. Those who are holding it may keep a stop at around the issue price. Acme Clean Energy Acme Clean Energy Limited made a disappointing debut on the stock market, listing at Rs. 251 per share, a 13% discount to its issue price of Rs. 289. This negative listing, despite a moderate subscription of 2.89 times, indicates a subdued investor response. While the company operates in the promising renewable energy sector and has demonstrated strong growth and improved profitability, the high debt-to-equity ratio and the overall market sentiment might have influenced the negative listing. Investors who participated in the IPO should carefully consider their investment strategy and may want to reassess their holding based on the company’s future performance and market dynamics Top gainers on the NSE as at 12.13 pm: NTPC (1.28%), Trent (0.42%), Tata Motors (0.34%), Bharti Airtel (0.33%), Britannia (0.25%) Top losers: Hindalco (-3.74%), Eicher Motors (-3.63%), Tata Steel (-3.32%), M&M (-3.23%), Hero Motocorp (-3.07%) A fire occurred at IndianOil’s Mathura Refinery (on Nov 12 ) during the start-up of the Crude Distillation Unit following a planned maintenance shutdown.

Except realty and IT, all sectoral indices ended in the red with Auto and PSU banks being the top losers. A combination of global and domestic pressures continues to dampen investor sentiments. There are concerns over the US President-elect Donald Trump’s potential aggressive trade policies. This has led to strengthening of dollar and a fall of rupee to fresh low earlier today, which triggered fears of further foreign outflows. Persistent FII selling since late September along with softer-than-expected Q2 earnings are the major reasons behind the decline. Markets will be seen reacting to domestic CPI and Industrial production data to be announced later today while US CPI numbers will be out tomorrow. Investors will also look forward to the IPO listing of Swiggy and Acme Solar shares tomorrow. We expect markets to remain volatile with stock specific action on account of balance Q2 numbers to be announced this week. Key results tomorrow include Eicher Motors, Torrent Power, Kalyan Jewellers, PI Industries amongst others. -- Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities sharing his views: Wall Street’s three major indexes closed lower on Tuesday as investors booked some profits from a post-election rally and waited eagerly for U.S. inflation data due this week. Treasury yields soared and the dollar hit the highest level in two years ahead of a key inflation report. European shares lost 2% as European Central Bank policymakers warned that increased tariffs from Trump would hamper global growth. The US consumer-price index is forecast to rise 0.2% in October based on a survey of economists polled by the Wall Street Journal. The CPI report comes out Wednesday morning. India’s retail inflation rose to a 14-month high of 6.2 percent in October compared with 5.5 percent in the previous month, as food inflation galloped on the back of rising vegetable prices. The annual retail inflation was higher than the estimate of 5.81% in a Reuters poll of 45 economists. In September, inflation stood at 5.49%, which was a nine-month high. CPI breached RBI’s upper band target of 6 percent for the first time in over a year, raising fears that the Reserve Bank of India may hold rates for the eleventh consecutive time at its meeting in December. India’s factory output, measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), grew 3.1% YoY in September, as against (-)0.1% in August, mainly due to an uptick in manufacturing activity. On a sequential basis, the IIP grew 0.7% in September, marking the first month-on-month acceleration in activity since May. Asian stocks fell to the lowest level in almost two months before US inflation data that may further cut confidence in the pace of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. Nifty fell for the fourth consecutive session on Nov 12 and closed at the lowest in 4.5 months amidst dull buying interest which failed to offset the FPI sales. IT stocks are proving to be resilient in this down trending market. Nifty formed a long bear candle on Nov 12 and broke the near term supports in the fall seen over the last few days. It now seems headed to 23670. On bounces 24151 may be tough to breach in the near term. While Nifty has remained oversold for some time and it may be late for some profit booking, we may still see sell on rises in the near term.

We expect Nov’24 inflation numbers are likely to be closer to 5.3% and the average FY25 inflation numbers are now trending at 4.8%-4.9%, against RBI 4.5%. Inflation is only likely to dip from January onwards, but this will be driven by base effects. We are now less hopeful of a February rate cut. We believe the first rate cut is now effectively pushed back beyond Feb’25. If we look the State-wise Inflation, inflation in bigger states continue to outstrip the all India inflation rate of the same month. Among the States, Chhattisgarh clocked the highest inflation rate of 8.8% in Oct, followed by Bihar at 7.9% and Odisha at 7.5%. Interestingly, a comparison of year on year changes and year to date changes reveal that year on year changes are far outpacing year to date changes. For example, there are 7 states, whose year-on year inflation has crossed more than 2% in a year. These indicates that the momentum of food prices has continued to climb up. The gap between urban and rural consumers’ inflation trends was sharp for the 8th consecutive month, with rural households paying 1.07% higher than urban India. This is mainly due to the higher food prices and the rural basket of food items weight (54.2%) is higher than the urban weights (36.3%). We believe that there will be some moderation in vegetable prices in month of November. The retail prices data till 11 Nov, indicate decline in vegetable prices. CPI headline inflation has peaked in Oct’24, but November and December numbers could still be higher than 5%. With the currency market being subject to turbulence , we believe a higher inflation number could act as a blessing in disguise for RBI not to signal a rate easing cycle.

Shares of ACME Solar Holdings will be listed at the bourses on Wednesday after successful IPO that subscribed 2.75 times. The company has fixed the IPO price at ₹289, at the upper end of the price range of ₹275-289. The IPO received bids for approximately 16 crore shares against the 5.82 crore shares available.

The issue, which struggled on the first two days, sailed through with an oversubscription of 3.60 times, thanks to QIB investors. Given the faltering of large IPOs such as LIC and Hyundai India, marketmen expect only a muted listing from Swiggy. 19.00 U.S. CPI m/m (Expected: 0.2% versus Previous: 0.2%) 20.15 U.S. FOMC Member Logan Speaks 23.30 U.S. FOMC Member Musalem Speaks CyberArk Software Ltd (Pre market) (Sector- Technology) Cisco Systems, Inc.

(Post market) (Sector- Infrastructure) YPF Sociedad Anonima (TENT) (Sector- Energy) Doms Industries has reported another strong quarter amid a slowdown in the broader consumption space. Its Q2-FY25 revenue/EBITDA/PAT growth at 20/32/43 per cent y-o-y were ahead of BNP Paribas expectation. We raise our FY25-27E EPS by 3-5 per cent and expect Doms to double its earnings over FY24-27. ONGC’s Q2-FY25 standalone EBITDA, at ₹18,200 crore, was slightly lower than JM Financial’s expectation of ₹18,800 crore (but in line with consensus of ₹18,200 crore) due to crude sales volume being 3 per cent below JMFe, but that was partly offset by net crude realisation being $1/bbl above JMFe at $ 74.3/bbl. Gas sales volume and realisation were largely in line. However, ONGC’s standalone PAT, at ₹12,000 crore, was significantly above JMFe/consensus of ₹9,200 crore due to higher other income, lower dry well write-off and lower tax-rate. OVL’s crude and gas production continued to be weak; PAT was also lower QoQ due to higher opex. Gift Nifty at 23,870 indicates a gap-down opening of about 100 points for Nifty on Wednesday amid weak global cues. The market is now facing a double whammy of earnings slowdown and higher inflation. With foreign portfolio investors continuing their selling without relaxing, analysts expect the market to remain under a bear grip, they added.
