Two stocks purchased by investment legend Warren Buffett’s firm in the first quarter of the year have witnessed significant gains in 2025. Filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year indicate Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought 238,613 new shares of Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) in Q1, worth approximately $204 million. The Omaha-based holding company also bought 112,401 new shares of Heico Corporation (HEI), an aerospace and electronics firm. Those new shares were worth nearly $50 million in Q1. Domino’s stock is up more than 2.5% in the past five days, more than 4% in the past month and more than 13.5% year-to-date. Heico’s stock is up more than 35% in 2025. Berkshire Hathaway added shares in both firms while hawking $3.23 billion worth of stock in the financial giants Citigroup, Bank of America and Capital One in Q1. Buffett’s firm completely exited Citigroup in the first quarter, unloading its remaining 14,639,502 shares worth about $1 billion. Berkshire sold an additional 48.7 million Bank of America shares in Q1, worth about $2.19 billion, and 300,000 shares in Capital One exposure, worth more than $46 million. Buffett’s firm also sold all of its remaining 40,180,168 shares of the Brazilian fintech Nu Holdings, which were worth more than $416 million. Beyond banking, Berkshire also reduced positions in Charter Communications, DaVita, T-Mobile and Liberty Media’s Formula One stock.
