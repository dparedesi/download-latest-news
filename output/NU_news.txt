Rupee weakens against dollar due to crude oil prices, dollar demand, and foreign fund outflows, closing at 87.57. Indian equity markets ended the last trading session before Independence Day holiday with modest gains, demonstrating resilience amidst mixed global cues and pre-holiday caution. The BSE Sensex closed up 110 points (0.14%) at 80,649 while the NSE Nifty 50 gained 30 points (0.12%) to settle at 24,649, marking the second consecutive day of positive closing and successfully breaking a six-week losing streak. The market’s positive momentum was primarily driven by a historic sovereign rating upgrade by S&P Global, which raised India’s long-term credit rating to ‘BBB’ from ‘BBB-’ with a stable outlook. This significant upgrade, citing India’s robust economic growth, sustained fiscal consolidation, and policy stability, provided substantial confidence boost to investor sentiment. S&P projected that India’s real GDP growth would average 6.8% annually over the next three years, reinforcing the country’s economic resilience. Technology stocks emerged as the standout performers, with the Nifty IT index surging 1.7% as global tech optimism spilled over into domestic markets. This was owing to strong performances from Infosys, Tech Mahindra, and Bajaj Finserv, each rising up to 3%. The wholesale inflation data also provided support, with July WPI falling to -0.58% compared to -0.13% in June, indicating continued disinflation trends. Domestic institutional investor support remained unwavering, with DIIs maintaining their buying streak and purchasing equities worth ₹5,624 crore on August 13, effectively offsetting the FII selling of ₹3,644 crore. This marked the 28th consecutive session of DII buying, demonstrating the strength of domestic liquidity in stabilizing markets against foreign outflows. Mangal Electrical Industries IPO opens on August 20, aims to raise Rs 400 crore for expansion and debt repayment. “India just upgraded by S&P to BBB with Stable Outlook. Government Bond market rallying on this news as this would encourage more foreign and FPI inflows into the bond markets. A higher Credit Rating systematically gets more investments into the country as risk-adjusted returns are better. We see India to remain in global spotlight for Emerging Market favourable asset allocation and bond yields to fall in the short term.” Brigade Hotel Ventures Limited (BHVL), second largest owner of chain-affiliated hotels and rooms in South India among major private hotel asset owners as of March 31, 2025, today announced the signing of a landmark multi-deal agreement with Marriott International, Inc. to develop six hotels (940 rooms) across four key markets in the country.

The easing of Wholesale inflation to 0.58% is better than expectations and reflects the resilience of the Indian economy. The sustained deflationary trend, which reached a 25-month low, aligns well with the moderation of retail inflation to an 8-year low, with both trajectories heavily influenced by the softening of food prices. Inflation is within the RBI’s tolerance band, and moving forward, global economic headwinds may pose a hurdle to keeping the figures rangebound. There is a possibility of a slightly rough patch in the coming quarter due to the Tariffs levied by the US. However, given the robust domestic consumption trend, we foresee this pattern to be a sustained one, irrespective of external factors. Backed by a good monsoon favouring agricultural activities, we are likely to see a strong trend with further scope for softening of core inflation as well as headline inflation Dilip Pattanayak, President & Group Chief Human Resource Officer, JSW Steel, who tendered his resignation on May 20, 2025, due to personal reasons and to pursue career opportunities outside the JSW group, will be relieved from service with effect from August 18, 2025 Mrs. Bectors Food Specialities posts consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June 2025 at ₹30.9 crore, as against ₹35.4 crore in the same previous quarter.

The stock of Aster DM Healthcare has been in an uptrend since March. It was triggered by the support at ₹400. But over the past month, the scrip has been charting a sideways trend between ₹574 and ₹610. On Wednesday, the resistance at ₹610 was breached. This has opened the door for further appreciation. The chart indicates a potential rally to ₹680 in the near term. That said, before this upswing, the price might moderate to ₹590. Aster DM Healthcare stock shows uptrend potential with resistance at ₹610 breached, signaling rally to ₹680, with risk management strategies. Global satellite operators, including Intelsat, Inmarsat, Singapore Telecom, KT SAT, IPSTAR, and PT Telekomunikasi, are targeting India’s $2.3 billion satellite communication (satcom) market, projected to grow to $20 billion by 2028. These companies are increasing satellite capacity and forming partnerships to resell capacity for broadband-from-space services, aiming to compete with Elon Musk’s Starlink, which has 7,578 satellites. Starlink, Reliance Jio-SES JV, and Bharti Group-backed Eutelsat OneWeb have approvals to operate in India, while Amazon’s Kuiper and Globalstar await permits. The market’s growth is driven by direct-to-cell communication, enabling satellite signals to connect directly to mobile phones, and rising demand for connectivity in underserved regions. Tata Group’s Nelco has partnered with Eutelsat OneWeb and added Koreasat-7 for Ku-band operations. Intelsat, acquired by SES, added satellites for C-band services, while Viasat, which owns Inmarsat, is expanding its presence. India’s supportive policies, like GMPCS licensing, and rapid digitalization fuel this surge, positioning India as a key hub for satcom innovation. Broadband services are expected to launch later this year, pending spectrum allocation. Starlink could attract 180,000 subscribers initially, scaling to 5.7 million by 2030, but faces competition from local and global players. Regulatory challenges, like data localization, persist, though recent approvals signal government support. India’s satcom rollout is poised to be the world’s fastest, driven by private investment and government initiatives. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will implement a new cheque clearance system starting October 4, 2025, reducing clearance time from up to two working days to a few hours. The Cheque Truncation System (CTS) will transition from batch processing to continuous clearing with “on-realisation-settlement” in two phases: 🔸Phase 1 (October 4, 2025 - January 2, 2026): Cheques will be scanned and processed continuously during business hours (10:00 AM to 4:00 PM). Drawee banks must confirm cheque status (positive or negative) by 7:00 PM, or the cheque is deemed approved for settlement. 🔸Phase 2 (from January 3, 2026): The confirmation window shortens to three hours from presentation. For example, cheques presented between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM must be confirmed by 2:00 PM, or they are deemed approved. Settlements occur hourly from 11:00 AM. Payments will be released to customers within one hour of settlement, subject to safeguards. Banks are directed to inform customers and prepare for the transition. This aims to enhance efficiency, reduce settlement risks, and improve customer experience. 11:30 U.K. GDP m/m (Expected: 0.2% versus Previous: -0.1%) 12:00 India WPI Inflation YoY (Expected: -0.30% versus Previous -0.13%) 18:00 U.S. PPI m/m (Expected: 0.2% versus Previous: 0.0%) 18:00 U.S. Unemployment Claims (Expected: 225k versus Previous: 226k) Economic Calendar - 15.08.2023 India, South Korea and Italy @ Market Holiday 07:30 CHINA Industrial Production y/y (Expected: 6.0% vs Previous 6.8%) 07:30 CHINA Retail Sales y/y (Expected: 4.6% vs Previous 4.8%) 18:00 U.S. Retail Sales m/m (Expected: 0.6% vs Previous 0.6%) 18:45 U.S. Industrial Production m/m (Expected: 0.0% versus Previous: 0.3%) 19:30 U.S. Prelim UoM Consumer Sentiment (Expected: 61.9 versus Previous: 61.7) Deere & Company (Pre market) (Sector- Capital Goods) NetEase, Inc (Pre market) (Sector- Technology) JD. com, Inc (Pre market) (Sector- Retail) Tapestry, Inc (Pre market) (Sector- Retailer) Amcor plc (Pre market) (Sector- Packaging) Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc (Pre market) (Sector- Technology) Applied Materials, Inc (Post Market) (Sector- Technology) Nu Holdings Ltd (Post Market) (Sector- Financial) Credicorp Ltd (Post Market) (Sector- Financial) Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (TENT) (Sector- Energy) Centrais Electricas Brasileiras S.A. – Eletrobras (TENT) (Sector- Power) YPF Sociedad Anonima (TENT) (Sector- Energy) Major U.S. listed stocks result calendar 15.08.2025 Flowers Foods, Inc (Pre market) (Sector- FMCG) 3BBLACKBIO, AGARIND, AGIIL, AHLUCONT, ALGOQUANT, ALKYLAMINE, ANDREWYU, ARE&M, ARIHANT,ASHOKLEY, ASTRAZEN, BCG, BLKASHYAP, BLUECLOUDS, BOROLTD, CITURGIA, CROPSTER, DBREALTY, EASEMYTRIP, ETHOSLTD, EXPLEOSOL, FISCHER, GEPIL,GLENMARK,GREENPOWER, HEMIPROP, HINDCOPPER, HINDOILEXP,IDEA, INDORAMA, INOXGREEN, INOXWIND,IOC, IRB, JAICORPLTD, JAMNAAUTO, JINDALPOLY, JINDWORLD, JPASSOCIAT, JSLL, JTEKTINDIA, JYOTISTRUC, KDDL, KERNEX,KHAZANCHI, KMEW, KOTIC, LAOPALA, LLOYDSENT, MIIL, MUFIN, NAVA, NFL, OPTIEMUS, PANACEABIO, PATANJALI, PLATIND, PROSTARM, REDTAPE, RISHABH, ROTO, RRP, SABTNL, SANSTAR, SASKEN, SEPC, SPAL, SPANDANA, SPECTRUM, SPICELOUNG, SRHHYPOLTD, SRM, SWANENERGY, TCIEXP, TECHNVISN, TIRUMALCHM, VINATIORGA, VOEPL, WALCHANNAG, WCIL, YSL, ZAGGLE ASHOKLEY YoY * Revenue expected at Rs 8726 crore versus Rs 8598 crore * EBITDA expected to be seen at Rs 962 crore versus Rs 910 crore * EBITDA margin expected to be seen at 11.03% versus 10.59% * Net profit expected to be seen at Rs 582 crore versus Rs 525 crore GLENMARK YoY * Revenue expected at Rs 3458 crore versus Rs 3244 crore * EBITDA expected to be seen at Rs 645 crore versus Rs 476 crore * EBITDA margin expected to be seen at 14.68% versus 18.66% * Net profit expected to be seen at Rs 379 crore versus Rs 340 crore IDEA YoY * Revenue expected at Rs 11139 crore versus Rs 10508 crore * EBITDA expected to be seen at Rs 4673 crore versus Rs 4204 crore * EBITDA margin expected to be seen at 41.96% versus 40.01% * Net Loss expected to be seen at Rs 7004 crore versus Rs 6432 crore IOC QoQ * Revenue expected at Rs 180458 crore versus Rs 195270 crore * EBITDA expected to be seen at Rs 15756 crore versus Rs 15029 crore * EBITDA margin expected to be seen at 8.73% versus 7.69% * Net profit expected to be seen at Rs 7997 crore versus Rs 8122 crore 13 August 2025 (Rs.
