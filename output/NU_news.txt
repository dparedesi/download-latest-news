The “tell me about a recent deal” question in finance interviews is designed to test your genuine interest in the industry. Anyone can copy/paste a “story” based on one of our templates, and plenty of candidates are good at memorizing the technical questions. But it’s much harder to “fake” your way into a solid deal discussion, especially in an in-person setting. Deal discussions are popular for the same reason that assessment centers are widely used in London: They’re a quick/cheap way to assess candidates and provide more accurate results than generic interview questions. If you are changing careers, you can expect to get this question a lot because it’s a great way to assess your motivations and commitment. Are you recruiting for investment banking roles to double your compensation? Or do you have a genuine interest in working on deals? Note that this guide is for discussing deals in the news, not deals you have worked on personally. Discussing your own deals is different, so please refer to the “deal sheet” article for more on that one. I’d summarize the importance of the “tell me about a recent deal” question as follows: If you’re in the “Most Important” category, it’s worth spending a few hours preparing a solid deal discussion. If you’re in one of the other categories, spend less time on it and stay focused on your story and answers to the normal fit and technical questions. I’ll suggest these qualities for any deal you discuss: If you have Capital IQ or FactSet, you can screen transactions based on these criteria and click through to the results to find the description and documents for each deal: If you cannot access these services, you must rely on simple online searches and deal summaries from other sources. There are plenty of finance newsletters from sources/people like Axios, Litquidity, etc., so you can certainly subscribe to one of those and pick a deal listed there. But there are also plenty of lesser-known-but-still-useful sources. As a specific example, the Bocconi Students M&A Circle has write-ups and analysis of deals each year, so that could be a starting point. Another example is that many boutique banks issue market and M&A reports with recent transaction activity and even public comps for the sector. The best reports I’ve seen come from Capstone Partners, which publishes detailed “industry insights” for the most popular industries. These reports are all free and require no login or even an email sign-up. For example, if you go to Capstone’s Food & Beverage M&A report, you can find “notable M&A transactions by subsector” on page 8 of the PDF: They won’t necessarily give the multiples for these deals, but once you have a few names, you can do some quick searches to find the financials. For an M&A deal, you can search for the following information: If you go against my advice and discuss an equity or debt deal instead, you’d have to search for documents like the S-1 for an IPO or a credit rating update issued by the credit rating agencies. To say anything about the valuation, you’d have to use sites like FinViz or BeyondSPX to look up multiples for other companies in the sector (or hope the Capstone reports cover it). I recommend against discussing these deals because of the extra time and effort required. Continuing with the food & beverage industry, I’ll use Celsius’ $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu, announced in February 2025, as an example. There is no Fairness Opinion because Alani Nu was private, but there are shorter and longer investor presentations: The quality of Substack articles varies widely, but it’s always worth searching the site for commentary on specific deals: The details in these posts are not always correct, but you can sometimes use them to stand out in interviews by bringing up more interesting talking points. It’s not like reading the WSJ or FT, where the articles recycle the same points repeatedly (usually from the company’s PR department). You should read enough of the source material to outline the following points: Here’s a sample outline for this Celsius / Alani Nu deal: This is a lengthy outline (over 250 words), so it might be too long for your initial answer. A shorter, ~100-word version might be a better “first response” in this case: “One recent deal I followed was Celsius’ $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu in the energy drink and supplement space. Celsius had weak recent sales growth and did the deal to return to growth and gain more distribution, but the unadjusted multiple was 21x EBITDA, which is very high for this vertical; adjusted for synergies and tax benefits, it was more like 12x. I still think it’s quite an expensive deal in a difficult market, and it might reduce Celsius’ ability to do future deals since it also issued $900 million in Debt to fund it.” When you present your short deal outline, the discussion could go in different directions. If the banker is satisfied and wants to ask about other topics, they might switch to other questions. But if they want to dig deeper or test your knowledge, they might ask follow-up questions to see how much you know. All you can do to “prepare” for these questions is read more of the source material and sketch answers to a few common follow-ups. Common questions include: This information takes more time to find, so budget your time based on the importance of this question (not important for university students, but more important for MBA/experienced hires). Since we first covered deal discussions on this site, a flood of AI tools, chatbots, and AI-powered search engines have been released. Many of these tools claim to “do all the work for you.” So, you might look at this guide and think: “This seems like a lot of work. Can’t I just ask ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or Grok to do everything? Then I can memorize the answers.” The short answer is that you can use these tools to speed up your research/prep process, but you should never rely on them 100%. There are several specific problems: The last point is so important that I recommend using pencil and paper to draft deal outlines and even responses to fit/behavioral questions. Yes, it’s 2025, and I am still recommending a stone-age method because it’s still the best way to make details “stick” for in-person interviews. I mentioned in the introduction that the “tell me about a decent deal” question is designed to test your interest and commitment to investment banking, especially for career changers. But it’s also a great example of why banks are old-school and will always conduct in-person interviews, even if the initial rounds are done via HireVue. You could cheat your way through entire interviews if they’re all remote. And even when you go in for an in-person Superday, it’s still possible to “game” standard interview questions with enough memorization. But it’s very difficult to get through an extended deal discussion if you haven’t done the work or don’t understand the metrics and rationale. So, expect this question to become even more important in the future. Just hope the shift happens before banks shift even more of their workload to bots and agents… Brian DeChesare is the Founder of Mergers & Inquisitions and Breaking Into Wall Street.
