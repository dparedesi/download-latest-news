May 13, 2025 16:15 ET | Source: Waldencast plc. Waldencast plc. Q1 Net Revenue of $65.4 million, (4.1)% decline from Q1 202476.4% Adjusted Gross Margin, an improvement of 10 basis points$4.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA LONDON, May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waldencast plc (NASDAQ: WALD) (“Waldencast” or the “Company”), a global multi-brand beauty and wellness platform, today reported operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 (“Q1 2025”) on Form 6-K to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which are also available on our investor relations site at http://ir.waldencast.com/. Michel Brousset, Waldencast Founder and CEO, said: “As anticipated, in Q1 2025, Milk Makeup results were impacted by the cycling of the very successful launch of Jellies in Q1 2024, as well as the significant inventory reduction at the retail level versus a year ago.” “Despite a broader slowdown in the prestige beauty category in the U.S., Milk Makeup ended the quarter on a very strong note, fueled by the highly successful launch of Hydro Grip Gel Tint, which sold out shortly after release. We are also very pleased with the brand’s entry into Ulta Beauty, with retail sales beginning in late February. Both initiatives exceeded expectations and contributed to the brand’s high single-digit growth in U.S. retail sales. This solid domestic performance was offset by the contraction of international sales, which faced a difficult comparison against last year’s Q1 distribution expansion, as well as inventory reduction by retail partners. In Q1, Milk Makeup partnered with Nike Running in North America for the Nike After Dark Tour in Los Angeles, bringing sport and self-expression together to keep expanding reach and deepen community engagement.” “The Obagi Medical brand delivered a solid performance in the first quarter, although out of stocks in some key SKUs dampened volume growth. We are accelerating ongoing efforts to transform our supply chain—consolidating third party logistics partners and enhancing operational capabilities—to improve fulfillment, increase reliability, and support long-term, scalable growth.” “Despite a difficult quarter, we continue to increase our investments in marketing, up in the high teens, to fuel brand equity and set a strong foundation for delivering our long-term ambitions, starting with our 2025 objectives.” “We are confident in our ability to deliver a stronger performance throughout the remainder of the year, beginning in Q2. Key drivers include a robust pipeline of breakthrough innovation at both Milk Makeup and Obagi Medical, combined with restocking of Hydro Grip Gel Tint which is expected to fuel continued consumer demand. We also anticipate a meaningful uplift in Milk Makeup volumes from the successful Ulta Beauty launch. Additionally, ongoing improvements from Obagi Medical’s supply chain restructuring are expected to enhance fulfillment rates and operational resilience,” concluded Mr. Brousset. Q1 2025 Results Overview Please refer to the definitions and reconciliations set out further in this release with respect to certain adjusted non-GAAP measures discussed below which are included to provide an easier understanding of the underlying performance of the business, but should not be seen as a substitute for the U.S. GAAP numbers presented in this release. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024: Net Revenue decreased 4.1% year-over-year to $65.4 million. Gross Profit was $47.2 million, while Adjusted Gross Profit totaled $50.0 million, or 76.4% of net revenue, an expansion of 10 basis points compared to the prior year. Net Loss for Q1 2025 was $20.7 million primarily driven by Depreciation and Financial charges. Non-recurring legal and advisory expenses totaled $1.5 million, continuing their decline from prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 million, or 6.7% of net revenue. The year-over-year decline reflects sustained investments in sales and marketing, and G&A deleverage stemming from lower revenue. Liquidity: As previously announced, during Q1, Waldencast secured a new $205 million five-year credit facility, comprising a $175 million term loan and a $30 million revolving credit facility (“RCF”). This refinancing replaces the previous bank loans, enhances financial flexibility, and extends the Company’s debt maturity profile to March 2030, supporting long-term strategic priorities. As of March 31, 2025, the Company held $10.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, $172.1 million in net debt, and approximately $22.5 million in available capacity under the RCF. The increase in net debt during the quarter is primarily due to refinancing-related costs. Cash consumption reflects lower Adjusted EBITDA and an inventory build-up to support expected sales growth in future quarters. Outstanding Shares: As of April 30, 2025, we had 123,011,239 ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 112,644,711 Class A shares and 10,366,528 Class B shares. As of December 31, 2024, we had 122,692,968 ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 112,026,440 Class A shares and 10,666,528 Class B shares. First Quarter 2025 Brand Highlights: Obagi Medical: Milk Makeup: Fiscal 2025 Outlook: While mindful of the broader macroeconomic environment and assuming no further material changes to current tariffs, including the latest updates on China, we remain confident that our strategic initiatives position us well to deliver on our full-year guidance of mid-teens net revenue growth and an adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-to-high teens. Given our high gross margin business model and limited reliance on Asian sourcing, we expect a limited increase in cost of goods with any necessary price adjustments (likely in the low-to-mid single digits) to offset the announced tariff scenario. Conference Call and Webcast Information Waldencast will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter results on Wednesday, May 14, 2025, at 8:30 AM EDT for the period ended March 31, 2025.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Waldencast separately reports financial results on the basis of the measures set out and defined below which are non-GAAP financial measures. Waldencast believes the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. Waldencast believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. These non-GAAP measures also provide perspective on how Waldencast’s management evaluates and monitors the performance of the business. There are limitations to non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in GAAP financial presentation. The items excluded from GAAP financial measures such as net income/loss to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures are significant components for understanding and assessing our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to definitions set out in the release and the tables included in this release for a reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Gross Profit is defined as GAAP gross profit excluding the impact of amortization of the supply agreement and formulation intangible assets, and the amortization of the fair value of the related party liability from the Obagi Medical China Business, which was not acquired by Waldencast at the time of the business combination with Obagi Medical and Milk Makeup (the “Business Combination”). The Adjusted Gross Profit reconciliation by Segment for each period is included in the Appendix. Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by GAAP Net Revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before interest income or expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for the items as described in the reconciliation below. We believe this information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance and better identify trends in our business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses that are required to be presented in accordance with GAAP because management believes they are non-core to our regular business. These include non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, the amortization and release of fair value of the related party liability to the Obagi Medical China Business, change in fair value of assets and liabilities, and foreign currency translation loss (gain). In addition, adjustments include expenses that are not related to our underlying business performance including (1) legal, advisory and consultant fees related to the financial restatement of previously issued financial statements and associated regulatory investigation, and (2) other non-recurring costs, primarily legal settlement costs and restructuring costs. The Adjusted EBITDA by Segment for each period is included in the Appendix. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. The Adjusted EBITDA Margin reconciliation by Segment for each period is included in the Appendix. Net Debt Position is defined as the principal outstanding for the 2022 term loan and 2022 revolving credit facility minus the cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2025.
