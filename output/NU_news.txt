This growth will be fuelled by third-party cargo growth at new terminals over FY24-27E, followed by robust growth in JSW Group traffic FY27E onwards. This is based only on announced projects and there is significant optionality of new concessions given a) GoI’s aggressive port privatisation targets, b) management’s opportunistic approach, and c) its robust balance sheet. With a long residual concession life and strong growth visibility (given expansion plans of JSW Group), JSW Infra’s prem valuations look justified to us. Initiate with BUY rating. Initiate at BUY. JSW Infra’s FY27E val multiples prima facie look rich, at a premium to peers (Fig 49). We think this is justified given a) the significantly longer concession period, b) growth underpinned by expansions planned by group cos (esp post FY27E). We ascribe 18x to FY30E EBITDA and discount it back to arrive at our TP of Rs370/sh. Initiate with BUY. Pricol Ltd (Pricol): SACL Acquisition - growth at right valuations - Company Update CMP: Rs496; TP: Rs645; Rating: BUY ~ We raise our TP on Pricol to Rs645 (previously Rs580), as we account for earnings from the recent Sundaram Auto Components Ltd (SACL) acquisition and reiterate BUY. ~ This acquisition enables Pricol to focus on injection molding as a new vertical and has tremendous growth potential by virtue of new customer additions, courtesy well-established relationships in the legacy business. ~ We believe that the acquisition valuation (~12x FY24 PE ratio) is justified, given the presence of fast growing TVS Limited, relatively lower margins and its propulsion agnostic products. ~ The acquisition has led to an upgrade in the pre-acquisition earnings by 10% each in FY26/27E. ~ With 2w contributing ~65% to Pricol’s total revenues, robust demand in 2Ws presents a favorable outlook for the company to clock volume growth supported by a new portfolio of plastic components along with premiumization.
