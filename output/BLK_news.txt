With Bitcoin (BTC) surging back above the $105,000 mark and nearing its record high set in January, market expert Doctor Profit has outlined bullish predictions for the leading cryptocurrency. In a recent post on social media platform X, he detailed the dynamics he believes will drive Bitcoin toward new highs. Since hitting $77,000, Doctor Profit identified $100,000 as the first significant target, which has now been achieved. Looking ahead, he sees the next breakout target between $116,000 and $120,000. His confidence stems from several positive indicators, including a strong bullish divergence observed on the daily chart—a technical signal often associated with forthcoming price increases. He emphasized that daily divergences tend to have a higher success rate than those seen on longer time frames. Additionally, Doctor Profit pointed out that the funding rate is currently stable, with no over-leveraged positions in the market. He noted that BTC recently broke out of a significant double bottom formation and is now testing previous highs. A critical factor in his outlook is the substantial accumulation by US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are reportedly purchasing Bitcoin at a rate eight times greater than its current mining output. This aggressive accumulation phase, according to Doctor Profit, indicates institutional interest remains robust, even as retail traders have largely stayed on the sidelines during recent volatility. The analyst also highlighted that the strongest retail buying occurred around the $90,000 mark, which also represents a liquidity hotspot. Should the market revisit this level, he sees it as an optimal entry point, perfectly positioned at the bottom of the established trading box. Looking ahead, Doctor Profit anticipates volatility, particularly in light of Moody’s recent downgrade of the US credit rating from AAA to AA1—the first major downgrade since S&P’s similar action in 2011. Historical context suggests that such downgrades can lead to swift market corrections. In August 2011, following a downgrade, markets dropped by 5.5% in a single day. Doctor Profit believes that Bitcoin could similarly dip into the $90,000 range to capture liquidity before rebounding. Despite potential short-term fluctuations due to the downgrade, Doctor Profit maintains a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, reiterating his target of $116,000 to $120,000. He noted that the market had largely priced in the downgrade, and historically, stocks have rallied following such events. With major institutions, including BlackRock, increasing their Bitcoin purchases in the exchange-traded fund arena, Doctor Profit sees no signs of weakness in the market, pointing to further price gains for the market’s leading cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,400, marking a 12% increase over the past two weeks and a nearly 24% increase over the past month. Year-to-date, the cryptocurrency has gained 60%, lagging behind XRP’s gains of over 300% in the same period.

Title: Monzo’s pivot from cool to corporate: ‘freshness is not about gimmicks’

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Monzo, Britain’s biggest digital bank, is still synonymous with its neon debit cards, extensive use of emojis, and free spending abroad. But it’s no longer just trying to be cool; it’s trying to become a major financial institution. That shift, from an upstart fintech beloved by millennials to a mature, sustainable business, is what makes this year a likely turning point. In a sit-down with this editor last week — despite signs that Monzo is preparing to go public, along with new reports that something is in the works — Monzo CEO TS Anil wouldn’t confirm that Monzo is listing this year. He suggested the building blocks are in place, though: profitability, product breadth, and just the right amount of AI. The numbers help tell the story. Monzo posted its first annual profit last year. In its 2024 annual report, it claimed 9.3 million personal account holders and more than 400,000 business customers. It’s also no longer reliant on interchange fees and overdrafts; lending, subscriptions, and business banking are now meaningful revenue streams. All this comes after a period marked by regulatory scrutiny and leadership turnover, developments that forced the company to grow up fast. Under Anil — a banking veteran who joined Monzo in 2020 and soon after took over as CEO from co-founder Tom Blomfield — Monzo is still flashy. Those hot coral cards remain a must for many younger banking customers. It has also become more disciplined about its growing product lineup. Monzo’s customers can now invest in mutual funds powered by BlackRock, for example, and track their existing mortgages from other lenders in their Monzo app. They can also use Monzo in the U.S., though most Americans have yet to hear of the brand. The question is whether that’s a problem, considering Monzo started amassing beta customers in the country six years ago. Certainly, it seemed fair to ask if Monzo needs to penetrate the U.S. market to become the global powerhouse that Anil is envisioning. During our sit-down, Anil suggested that’s not the case. He said that one in five adults in the U.K. now banks with Monzo — in other words, there is market share Monzo has left to gain in its own backyard. (According to Anil, Monzo added 300,000 new users in April alone.) When questioned about U.S. expansion and the competitive landscape, Anil downplayed the challenge. “I think there are a few universal truths that apply,” he said. “Most people feel anxiety about their money, and that anxiety is independent of affluence … The second thing that holds true is that the incumbent industry has been built off of arbitraging customers and leveraging, in some fashion, customers’ ignorance. Those are the insights that are helping us create the best features that would make sense in the U.S.; that’s the way we intend to double down.” During our talk, we also discussed whether Monzo could itself be construed as a legacy player in the not-too-distant future. After all, the company is now 10 years old, and AI is changing everything. We wanted to know whether Monzo worries about the rise of AI-native banks. “Gosh no, we’re not a legacy player,” Anil said. “We continue to operate at the bleeding edge of technology.” What would worry him, he continued, is if he “saw signs of complacency in terms of adopting new technology, or at least a curiosity about it. Those would be like bright, flashing red warning signs for me, but that’s the opposite of the company that we are.” As for the IPO that’s reportedly in the works, Anil said: “To tell someone in the media ‘don’t believe everything you read in the media’ is kind of like a dicey move to make, but yeah, please don’t believe everything you read in the press. We will be a great public company one day. We haven’t decided either when or where, let alone with whom.” If you’re curious to learn more, including about how Monzo keeps its marketing fresh, how it’s using AI, and the ways its engineers handle the adoption of new tech, watch our full chat below.

Title: Eamon Ryan: Why has it taken so long to develop a greenway for Dublin Bay?

For more than 30 years, people have been campaigning for a safe walking and cycling route around Dublin Bay. It could transform our city, connecting northside and southside and restore the environment I grew up in, where children were much more free to wander and explore. It has been championed by many organisations and has a variety of names: the Sutton to Sandycove cycleway, the Coastal Trail or Dublin Bay Greenway. But its history tells a sad story of a lack of political will that is stopping us from fulfilling the true potential of our city. I remember in the mid 1990s heading out to Bull Island on a protest cycle organised by the Dublin Cycling Campaign. We were full of hope, only to be frustrated when a local resident opposing the plans had the ear of an influential councillor, and progress was delayed for years. Now the northside section is introduced, I don’t think a single person would want us to go back. Around the same time, we argued with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to compulsory purchase a sliver of land beside Blackrock Dart station to remove one of the worst bottlenecks on the route. We were told it would take too long, and asked to be patient and allow an alternative approach to see the light of day. We are still waiting for that to this day. Fifteen years ago, things changed for the better when, despite budgetary hard times, money was allocated for the first proper greenway between Newport and Achill. It was built quickly and at low cost because local people wanted their children to be able to meet their neighbours without having to navigate the dangerous main road. A few years later, the 46km Waterford greenway became a similar success story and every council started to consider what might be possible. Under the last government, they were allocated the staff and funding to develop their plans. Transport Infrastructure Ireland was given the responsibility of connecting up a national greenway network, and the National Transport Authority had the key role of approving projects and allocating budgets. Their orders were to prioritise local needs, deliver at speed and avoid over-engineering solutions in order to keep costs down. During Covid, the best example came when the mix of a visionary community group, an enthusiastic council and a great local authority official built out the coastal cycle route between Blackrock and Sandycove. They did it in record time and at minimal cost, transforming Dún Laoghaire for the better. It would make you cry. Half a century to deliver a three-metre track along the 22km it takes to get around the bay However, things fell back again when Dublin City Council tried to emulate the same approach in Sandymount, only for the High Court to stop the trial. What made it worse was the chilling effect the decision had in every council across the country and that it took four years for the Court of Appeal to reverse the judicial decision in April. At last, it seemed that the Strand Road section was ready to be built. With Dublin Port also promising a safe route from Clontarf to the East link bridge by next year, an end-to-end Dublin Bay Greenway finally seemed to be at hand. However during the interim period, some Dublin City Councillors appear to have lost their nerve. They and some residents are arguing we should await the introduction of flood protection works before building the cycle path, which will likely delay things for another 20 years. It would make you cry. Half a century to deliver a three-metre track along the 22km it takes to get around the bay – and all that delay because our political system is so attentive to local opposition, while the silent majority opinion that wants change remains by its very nature unheard. Public officials and regulators read the political temperature in a similar way and hold back on making hard decisions. Whatever you do, do nothing, becomes the order of the day. But what happened in Dún Laoghaire shows what is possible. The Dublin authorities are starting to deliver other game changing pathfinder projects and slowly but surely are improving things along the canals, Liffey, Tolka and Dodder. By joining up these various initiatives, we can reach a tipping point where Dublin once again becomes a great city to cycle and walk around and the perfect place to raise a child and call your home. Recent developments in Limerick, where a cycleway will connect the three universities, and on the Waterford Quay – where a sustainable transport bridge is about to be installed, which will link the existing greenway to the Waterford to New Ross greenway – give similar cause for hope. But you cannot force local authorities to make the necessary decisions. However, greater targeting of the active travel budget can change political dynamics. Those councils willing to build with ambition, speed and low-cost solutions should get most of the funding. Those who don’t should be asked to come up with more ambitious greenway plans and a plan to make it happen quickly. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BounceBitとBlackRockがBUIDLを活用し、RWA×CeDeFiの先駆的構造化利回り商品を発表 - RWA導入の新時代へ

PR TIMESのご利用について 資料をダウンロード BounceBit Ltd CeDeFiインフラストラクチャ・プラットフォームであるBounceBitは、BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund（BUIDL）を活用した初の構造化利回り戦略を成功裏に実行し、リアルワールド資産（RWA）の暗号資産金融への統合において新たなマイルストーンを打ち立てました。本戦略はBounceBitのトレジャリー管理フレームワークを強化すると同時に、今後リリース予定の製品群「BB Prime」の概念実証として機能します。 このRWA資産を基盤とした初の構造化投資商品では、BUIDL を革新的に活用しています。BUIDL は、BlackRock が運用し総資産20億ドル超を誇るトークン化された短期米国債ファンドです。適格デジタル証券プラットフォームである Securitize を通じてトークン化され、SEC（米国証券取引委員会）規制下のブローカー・ディーラーである Securitize Markets, LLC によって販売されています。投資家は法規制を遵守しながら、ドル建ての利回りを得ることが可能です。 この戦略の中核を担うのが、BUIDL を担保に用いて実行する3カ月間のデルタニュートラル・アービトラージ戦略（BTC先物のベーシス取引とオプション取引）です。本商品の構造では、アービトラージによる年率約20％の利回りと、BUIDL が本来持つ約4.25％の米国債利回りを組み合わせることで、合計で最大約24％の実効APY（年利換算利回り）を実現します。従来のステーブルコイン担保型戦略と比較して、基礎担保の資本効率が大幅に改善される点が大きな特徴です。 本戦略では、以下の点を可能にする新しいアーキテクチャを採用しています。 積み重なる利回りの獲得：米国債とアービトラージ双方のリターンを組み合わせながら、どちらも損なわない設計 機関投資家レベルのリスクモデル：資本効率を最適化 スマートコントラクトの自動化：運用の透明性とオペレーションの完全性を担保 「これにより、従来の金融市場から得られる利回りと暗号資産におけるアービトラージの収益を同時に享受できる初めての機会が生まれました」と、BounceBitの創業者兼CEOであるジャック・ルー（Jack Lu）は述べています。「世界的に著名な資産運用会社と協業することで、CeDeFiインフラによるRWAの活用方法を再構築し、西側基準の資産とアジアのダイナミックなトレーディング環境を結びつけることを目指しています。」 この戦略が成功を収めた背景には、BlackRock が提供する高品質の基盤資産と、Securitize による堅固なコンプライアンス体制があります。BounceBit の CeDeFi スタックは、カストディアンとトレーディング・プラットフォーム間での資産移転をスムーズに実行できるよう設計されています。 今後ローンチ予定の「BounceBit Prime」プラットフォームは、RWA を基盤とした統合型の利回りソリューションの提供を専業で行う初のプラットフォームになります。流動性の制限や実需の乏しさなど、RWA 分野が抱える主要な課題に対応することを目指しています。BlackRock の BUIDL や Franklin Templeton の Benji Fund などが初期のラインアップとして予定されており、450Mドル超のCeDeFiエコシステムによって支えられる BounceBit Prime は、機関投資家や暗号資産ネイティブ投資家に対して透明性と高効率の利回り商品を提供する計画です。ローンチに関する詳細は、近く発表される予定です。 BounceBit についてBounceBit は、CeDeFi（中央集権型と分散型を融合した金融）の中核インフラ構築に取り組んでいます。機関投資家向けの利回り商品、リステーキング・アプリケーション、RWA（リアルワールド資産）統合を提供します。BounceBit Chain は、Bitcoin（BTC）と独自トークン $BB によるデュアルトークン型 PoS Layer1 で運営されており、ビットコイン並みの高いセキュリティとEVM（Ethereum Virtual Machine）との完全互換性を兼ね備えています。 Website : https://www.bouncebit.io/ X (旧Twitter) : https://x.com/bounce_bit すべての画像 このプレスリリース内で使われている画像ファイルがダウンロードできます 0フォロワー Copyright © PR TIMES Corporation All Rights Reserved.

Title: The Perils of Founder Worship

Time Published: 2025-05-20T04:05:46Z
Full Content:
In the world of startups, founders are often elevated to near mythical status – the force poised to disrupt entire industries. This adulation can grant founders extraordinary latitude in corporate control, especially in innovative and unregulated sectors like tech or crypto. However, when this reverence turns into “founder worship,” especially under the guise of doing good, it blinds investors and stakeholders to the absence of basic corporate governance. The consequences can be disastrous. The rise and fall of FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried (“SBF”) offer a cautionary tale – one where charisma, weak governance, and the veneer of altruism obscured its lack of corporate discipline. It is a stark illustration of what can happen when governance norms are subordinated to a visionary founder. At the heart of the FTX scandal lies a troubling paradox: The “do-gooderism” that made SBF a household name and the darling of the venture capital world also amplified founder exceptionalism and deferred governance in the name of innovation. In essence, FTX highlights the dangerous interplay between founder worship and a specific kind of moral narrative that led to a company operating without fundamental corporate safeguards and meaningful checks on the founder’s authority. The rise of effective altruism (“EA”), a philosophical and social movement that emphasizes evidence-based philanthropy and the strategic use of wealth to maximize social good, permeates elite universities and the tech ecosystem. SBF’s association with EA lent him credibility and moral capital, particularly among sophisticated investors like Sequoia Capital, BlackRock, and Thoma Bravo LP. In theory, EA is aligned with ethical principles – encouraging rich individuals to donate substantial portions of their income to causes that yield the greatest impact. The reality, however, was that EA served as a moral halo for SBF, evidence of his integrity and commitment to the greater good. SBF’s disheveled appearance reinforced the impression that he was intensely focused on building the first one trillion-dollar startup solely for EA goals. This impression created trust in SBF, which substituted for governance. FTX’s legitimacy was bolstered not by its compliance with best practices but by its founder’s supposed noblesse oblige, which was based on his commitment to EA. Venture capital-backed startups operate in a unique legal environment where private ordering allows early-stage companies to structure governance, allocate rights, and implement oversight according to their own preferences. The flexibility accorded to private companies contrasts with the discipline expected of public companies, where ownership and control are clearly separated and heavily regulated. In many ways, this flexibility allows startups to move fast, take risks, and innovate. Over time, oversight mechanisms such as investor board seats, staged financings, and protective provisions typically create checks. However, when a founder commands cultural and financial capital, as did SBF, these checks may be non-existent. Enamored by mission-driven founders, investors sometimes abdicate their responsibility to control and manage the startups through the board of directors and to vote on corporate policies. The promise of massive returns can distract the most seasoned venture capitalists to the extent that they ignore red flags. By deferring or waiving such checks, a company whose corporate governance is based on private ordering can falter or even collapse. In the case of FTX, a founder-centric structure, coupled with mythical “do gooderism,” became a shield against scrutiny and ultimately led to the company’s demise and SBF’s criminal conviction. FTX was not subject to even the most basic corporate controls. Financial audits, effective board oversight, and internal compliance mechanisms were absent. Investors overlooked these red flags based on SBF’s visionary status and mission-driven narrative. The failure was structural. Although there is nothing inherently wrong with believing in a founder’s mission, the law must be agnostic to motives, and governance safeguards must be applied at the appropriate times. As FTX shows, private ordering has its natural limits. Faith in founders is no substitute for the timely implementation of legal guardrails to ensure startups do not engage in crime or fraud. By cloaking SBF in moral credibility, he was allowed to operate with little to no constraints, which ultimately led to the implosion of FTX. To prevent the next FTX, we should tighten the boundaries of private ordering. There are several reforms worth considering: It is tempting to dismiss FTX and SBF as anomalies in an otherwise functional private ordering system. But the conditions that enabled FTX’s meteoric rise and precipitous fall are embedded in the culture of venture-backed startups where there is a bias toward disruption over discipline. Startups cannot be allowed to circumvent legal norms just because they are mission-driven. Founder worship should not override the legal structures that protect investors, employees, and the public. The FTX saga underscores that private ordering has limits. Ultimately, its success depends on the timely implementation of corporate governance measures to ensure legal accountability.

Title: BlackRock’s BUIDL To Power BounceBit’s New RWA Yield Strategy Platform
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/05/19/blackrocks-buidl-to-power-bouncebits-new-rwa-yield-strategy-platform/
Time Published: 2025-05-19T22:01:54Z
Full Content:
Financial infrastructure firm BounceBit is tapping into BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) for a new real-world assets (RWA) yield strategy tool. According to a new press release from BounceBit, the collaboration mixes traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure, allowing investors to leverage traditional yields with crypto derivatives trading. Per the announcement, the strategy involves executing Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoin trades with BUIDL as collateral. BounceBit says the trading strategy could raise total annual percentage yield (APY) for investors by 24%. BUIDL is a BlackRock private fund, which is tokenized by Securitize and made available through its Securitize Markets. According to a post to the social media platform X, the strategy is “the first active use-case for tokenized treasuries.” Says Jack Lu, Founder & CEO at BounceBit, “This innovative approach demonstrates what is possible when investors simultaneously capture both U.S. dollar yields and funding rate arbitrage returns, potentially creating opportunities for institutional investors seeking sustainable USD-denominated yield generation across market cycles.” Last month, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said that the tokenization of RWAs on blockchains will develop stronger links between crypto and traditional finance (TradFi). In a paper on the financial stability risks of crypto, BIS analysts say that RWAs – or the tokenization of traditional assets on distributed ledgers – are creating an increased connection between TradFi and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Title: The Business Roundtable is MIA Against Trump’s Attacks
URL: https://time.com/7286691/business-roundtable-mia-trumps-attacks/
Time Published: 2025-05-19T19:42:20Z
Full Content:
U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office at the White House on May 6, 2025 in Washington, DC. President Donald Trump recently attacked Walmart, the biggest private sector employer in the United States and the largest retailer in the world. Douglas McMillon, CEO of Walmart warned that the Trump Administration’s tariffs could drive cost increases. In response, President Donald Trump took to social media. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,” seethed the President. “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” Advertisement Advertisement The rebuke comes the very same week that Trump chided revered Apple CEO Tim Cook for manufacturing in India and is merely the latest in a long line of attacks on some of America’s most iconic businesses. So far during his second term, Trump has lashed out at companies such as Amazon, Bank of America, and Boeing. And organizations including AT&T, Harley-Davidson, and Merck have not been immune to Trump’s wrath. However, business leaders are yet to collectively, and definitively, stand up to him. Many completely non-political CEOs saw their firms suffer Trump-initiated stock plunges as they made prudent decisions on how to guide their companies around reckless universal trade sanctions. As Trump’s tariff tantrums threaten to plunge the American economy off a cliff—amidst significant price increases, large layoffs, plummeting business and consumer confidence, and frozen capital investments across industries—CEOs know they need to speak truth to power. But we’ve heard from dozens of Fortune 100 CEOs that they are having a hard time breaking through to President Trump, and conveying the very real dangers facing their businesses, their shareholders, their employees, and their communities. Furthermore, even though 90% of CEOs agree that tariffs are backfiring, they are fearful that if they speak out on their own, they will turn into the next targets of a capricious, vindictive President—as Walmart found out the hard way. Trump fears collective action, and relies on pitting rivals against one another through a divide-and-conquer approach. When business groups stand by in passive inaction when individual CEOs get pummeled, they cede the moral and strategic imperative to Trump’s impulsive whims—ultimately leaving business leaders twisting in the wind. Some trade groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Chamber of Progress—along with other specialized industry groups from the automotive sector to the pharmaceutical industry—have tried to pick up the pieces. However, there are many who wonder why the Business Roundtable, a D.C.-based lobbying firm and association of more than 200 leading CEOs, seems to be missing in action. Indeed, why have they not played a greater role in catalyzing collective action beyond putting out perfunctory statements and purported behind-the-scenes lobbying? This muted response follows other high-profile disappointments from the Business Roundtable in the Trump era, including during his first term. In August 2017, following Trump’s horrifying defense of neo-Nazis who attacked peaceful counterdemonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville, Va., the American business community stood together. The highly-regarded CEO of Merck, Ken Frazier led the charge. In his resignation letter he wrote, “As C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.” The son of a well-read custodian, Frazier grew up in North Philadelphia and became one of few black Fortune 500 chief executives. Trump predictably attacked him, which immediately backfired. Over the next several days, CEOs who had once shunned politics came to Frazier’s vocal defense, including the heads of Walmart, Intel, BlackRock, and IBM. When Frazier exited the President’s Business Advisory Group, he set off a high-profile stampede of exits. Frazier’s peer CEOs walked out in solidarity, triggering the disbanding of the two of President Trump's business advisory councils: the Manufacturing Council and the Strategy and Policy Forum. At the time, many CEOs were frustrated that the Business Roundtable remained relatively passive—especially amidst an era of perceived antitrust politicization, with Trump deputies holding up the Time Warner-AT&T deal on specious grounds for 18 months. Similarly, when in November 2020, President Trump refused to acknowledge his electoral defeat, 22 CEOs, frustrated with inaction by the Business Roundtable, asked me to convene an immediate Zoom call for 100 of the nation’s largest CEOs. All showed up—from pharma to finance, advertising to airlines, consumer goods to consulting. During this “Chamber of Conscience” meeting, these business leaders stood up for the importance of certified elections and also certified the truth—meeting for four sessions through the presidential transition under the banner of Business Leaders for National Unity. That silence of the Business Roundtable is a far cry from why it was created. I personally knew the highly engaged, politically diverse founding generation of Business Roundtable members—ranging from Reginald Jones of GE, Clifton Garvin of Exxon, Irving Shapiro of DuPont, George Weyerhaeuser of his eponymous timberland firm, Al Casey of American Airlines, Roger Smith of GM, Jim Burke of Johnson & Johnson, and Roy Vagelos of Merck—and they set up the Business Roundtable explicitly as a vehicle for collective action for CEOs to tackle public policy issues. As Trump attacks our nation’s most iconic enterprises, the Business Roundtable needs to return to its founding principles, purpose, and moral clarity so that CEOs are not left dangling in the wind all alone and defenseless while Trump picks them off individually. CEOs grappling with how to break through to a mercurial President as they watch their enterprises and the broader economy teeter off the ledge know there is strength in collective action—lest they become Trump’s next target. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

Title: JPMorgan to support Bitcoin buying despite Jamie Dimon’s ongoing skepticism

JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon revealed the bank will offer Bitcoin, but he is still "not a fan" of the flagship cryptocurrency. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the Wall Street lender plans to offer Bitcoin (BTC) to its customers in a stark shift from his historical stance toward the digital asset. During JPMorgan’s Investor Day, Dimon reiterated that he is “not a fan” of Bitcoin, but acknowledged that clients will continue to demand access to it. He said: “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” He also clarified that the bank does not plan on offering custody services. Dimon’s criticism of crypto is consistent with past remarks. In a January interview, he called Bitcoin “worthless.” He tied it to criminal activity, repeating concerns raised in his 2023 Senate testimony, in which he advocated for shutting down the industry altogether. At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, he referred to Bitcoin as a “pet rock,” while in April of the same year, Dimon called crypto a “Ponzi Scheme.” In his May 19 remarks, he also stated that “blockchain doesn’t matter as much” as people think. However, JPMorgan has continued to build infrastructure around blockchain technology for institutional use. Earlier this month, Kinexys completed a test transaction that bridged its private network to a public layer-1 blockchain, using tokenized short-term Treasury assets and real-time settlement protocols. Chainlink and Ondo Finance participated in this pilot. Additionally, Kinexys processes over $2 billion in transactions daily and plans to scale up dollar-euro settlements using JPM Coin, JPMorgan’s proprietary token. Amid the remarks on Bitcoin offering, JPMorgan’s 13F filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the first quarter of 2025 showed a dramatic increase in crypto exposure through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of March 31, the firm reported $16.3 million in crypto-related holdings, up from $1 million at the end of 2024. The lender’s crypto exposure is primarily via Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked instruments. As of March 31, JPMorgan held a little over 263,000 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and around 3000 shares of Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF (BITB). The lender also held shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Mini Trust ETFs, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and new allocations to Bitwise and Franklin Templeton Ethereum products. The firm’s crypto-related holdings are just a tiny fraction of its $4.4 trillion in assets under management at the end of the first quarter. It’s unclear how much of the portfolio reflects proprietary positioning versus facilitation of client demand. The bank has previously clarified that holding some ETF allocations could be a part of its market-making services.

Title: Market Expert Predicts Bitcoin to Hit $220,000 By Year End If This Happens

Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to show strength following a resilient recovery from its April lows. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $104,921. Notably, after dipping below $80,000 amid heightened U.S.-China tariff tensions, Bitcoin rebounded strongly, gaining approximately 25% in April alone before a further surge this month. Renewed institutional interest has bolstered this upward momentum, including significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. That said, in this bullish environment, market analyst “apsk32” has projected that Bitcoin could reach $220,000 by the end of 2025 if its historical correlation with gold remains intact. In a recent tweet, the pundit argued that Bitcoin’s price movements continue to reflect long-term patterns tied to gold, not fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which he claims distorts BTC’s real value due to inflation. “The peg to fiat hides the truth,” he stated, citing a valuation model that prices Bitcoin in ounces of gold rather than dollars. The model uses a power-law function, a mathematical formula that accounts for Bitcoin’s cyclical nature. According to the analyst, Bitcoin currently represents over 643 million ounces of gold in market capitalization. This relationship, he suggested, puts the digital asset on track to match or exceed $220,000 in the coming months, assuming gold’s rally continues and Bitcoin maintains its historical pattern of lagging gold’s movements by a few months. Notably, Gold recently reached a record price of $3,500 per ounce, forming what the analyst describes as a “very bright” backdrop for Bitcoin. Although a theoretical top of $444,000 is possible based on this model, the analyst noted he believes $220,000 is a more realistic ceiling for 2025. But the journey to that target is not without obstacles. Market data shows a significant liquidity barrier between $105,000 and $110,000, where large sell orders could suppress upward momentum. Key support is seen at around $98,000 to $100,000, a level some analysts call “critical” for sustaining the uptrend. Elsewhere, Michael van de Poppe, a popular crypto trader and founder of MN Trading, echoed this sentiment, stating that Bitcoin needs to hold above $98,000 to continue its bullish momentum. “It’s the last major consolidation before the breakout,” he said. Meanwhile, other prominent voices have weighed in with similar bullish predictions. Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, doubled down on his support for Bitcoin, calling it a hedge against a collapsing central banking system. “I predict Bitcoin climbs to $250K this year. Buy more. Do not sell,” he urged his followers on Saturday However, not all indicators point to a smooth ride. According to crypto analytics platform Glassnode, Bitcoin’s short-term correlation to gold has recently dropped to -0.54, its lowest since February, implying that in the short run, BTC and gold are currently moving in opposite directions. Still, long-term correlations remain intact, with 90-day and 365-day values at 0.39 and 0.60, respectively.

Title: Despite Backlash From Trump, DEI Hasn’t Disappeared at US Companies

Walmart Inc. stunned civil-rights activists in November by saying it was pulling back on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The world’s largest retailer said it would stop using the term “DEI” in official communications, remove some LGBTQ products from its website and no longer consider race and gender to boost diversity when granting supplier contracts, among other changes. Six months later, the company’s moves seem less like a reversal and more like modest changes. “Belonging” has replaced most mentions of DEI— a semantic transition that began two years ago— but jobs posted on the company website still call for applicants who will support its policy of “diversity, equity & inclusion.” A landing page boasts about goods from “LGBTQIA+ founded brands,” accompanied by the tagline “Pride always.” And Walmart offers similar pages for Hispanic-, Black- and women-owned brands, noting that some have been categorized in collaboration with external groups that offer diversity certifications. Walmart is hardly alone. Many programs at large US companies that have fallen under the diversity, equity and inclusion banner haven’t disappeared, according to interviews with more than two dozen senior staffers from large US companies and corporate advisors. Even businesses that have made announcements purporting to curtail their DEI initiatives have, in most cases, made mostly minor adjustments, while promising investors and employees that nothing meaningful has changed. A Walmart spokesman said the company is addressing outdated references in job postings. “Our goal is to foster a sense of belonging, create opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers, and be a Walmart for everyone. We want to make Walmart the best place to work and shop,” a Walmart spokesperson said. Executive orders targeting what President Donald Trump has termed “illegal DEI” have rattled general counsels across the country’s largest companies— especially a directive that federal agencies compile lists of organizations to target for investigation by May 21. The administration argues that rather than reducing bias and encouraging managers to hire and promote based on merit, DEI policies have been “deeply demeaning,” and have increased hostility between different groups. But the orders haven’t fundamentally changed employment law, no matter how sweeping they may sound, said Jonathan Segal, a partner at law firm Duane Morris. And in many cases, familiar DEI efforts remainbecause those programs weren’t discriminating against employees. “You can do almost everything you were doing before with modest changes,” Segal said. Nor have the orders persuaded executives that all the programs that came to be known as DEI were a bad idea. Many admit that some elements of DEI went too far. However, by and large they continue to believe that efforts to recruit, promote and retain candidates from underrepresented groups are key to making sure they have the most capable and talented staff. They are loathe to eliminate policies that help workers feel welcomed and supported. They continue to fear discrimination lawsuits from workers of color, women, LGBTQ people and those with disabilities— not to mention the wrath of investors and the press. With guidance from lawyers, many companies have focused on a handful of changes. Gone are specific targets for demographic representation across their workforces, though companies are still required to collect data on the race and gender of their employees. Some people who once had titles like “diversity officer” are now called something else and run newly renamed initiatives. Employee resource groups — affinity organizations that cater to a characteristic like race, gender, sexual orientation, disability status and more — face new scrutiny and limits on their spending, but most continue to exist. Health benefits for trans employees and employees’ trans family members have hardly budged. Internship and mentorship programs developed to elevate traditionally marginalized groups mostly remain, with the new caveat that anyone can apply. Recruiting programs, especially at historically Black colleges and universities, haven’t changed. Molson Coors Beverage Co., Ford Motor Co., Deloitte LLP, McDonald’s Corp. and Boeing Co. are among those who’ve sought applicants in recent weeks through partnerships with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, a non-profit group that helps some of the country’s largest companies orchestrate internship and scholarship programs for students at HBCUs, primarily Black institutions and historically Black community colleges. In one example of how companies are trying to send one message to DEI critics and another to investors, last summer Lowe’s Cos. announced a rollback that would restructure its employee resource groups, curtail external sponsorships and limit participation in external workplace surveys. But in December, a top executive promised the scale of changes were limited: “These are the only changes that we have made,” Janice Dupré, executive vice president of human resources stressed at the company’s investor day, before touting the senior leadership team as “one of the most diverse in the Fortune 500.” “Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is embedded in our values and core to who we are as a company,” a Lowe’s spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re proud of our accomplishments, and we will continue to strive to cultivate a workplace that reflects the customers and communities where we operate and where everyone feels welcomed, valued and respected.” Subha Barry, once the chief diversity officer at Merrill Lynch, now runs Seramount, a company that provides workplace training and inclusive leadership plans for large companies. Because she stays away from more controversial discussions about social justice, she said she’s seen little impact on demand for her company’s services. “There’s a return to a new sense of normalcy where companies are adapting, adjusting,” she said. “Ninety percent of our companies are saying they don’t see any major disruptions happening in the long term.” DEI is the latest term used to describe corporate policies that developed in response to the Civil Rights Act. In the 1980s, as companies prepared for rising shares of women and people of color in the workforce, executives began developing programs to better recruit, develop and integrate talent. These efforts ultimately evolved into the myriad initiatives often called DEI. While initially centered on race, the acronym came to also embody programs that would benefit a variety of minority groups, including women, people who identify as LGBTQ, those with disabilities and veterans. Such recruitment and training programs were slow to produce results, and often developed only after an investigation found evidence of rampant discrimination. Then came the 2020 murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed by a White police officer in Minneapolis, setting off waves of protests about racial justice. Corporate executives responded by adopting sweeping, transformative language to spur their workforces into action, and setting ambitious goals for boosting diversity in their ranks. But just as today’s rhetoric about DEI rollback run into the reality of corporate inertia, the loud calls for boosting DEI after Floyd’s death often amounted to merely incremental changes. Many companies poured money into expanding DEI efforts based on programs they already had, hoping increased attention to race would help them transform their workforces. Such efforts met resistance almost immediately, with critics arguing that diversity programs amounted to discrimination against White (and sometimes Asian) people. They argued that bias training blamed employees for the sins of their ancestors, amplifying rather than diminishing racial angst. The pushback gained steam with the Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, a landmark case that overturned affirmative action in college admissions in 2023. While not directly implicated in that ruling, corporate America quickly began to question whether its own programs — especially those open to people only on the basis of race or gender — might run afoul of the course set by the court. Meanwhile, Trump’s return to the presidency has elevated DEI’s most ardent critics. His administration has argued that “corporations and universities use DEI as an excuse for biased and unlawful employment practices and illegal admissions preferences.” He’s intensified the pressure on federal contractors, who must pledge that they’re not engaging in “illegal DEI,” while providing little detail on what exactly that is. “President Trump’s executive order mandates recommendations to strengthen enforcement of federal civil rights laws against unlawful discrimination, including DEI initiatives, and he anticipates further actions to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans,” White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement. Meanwhile, critics like influencer Robby Starbuck and activist group Alliance Defending Freedom have pushed companies to stamp out even elements of DEI that don’t violate the law, arguing that employers shouldn’t be making statements or instituting policies that express “woke” beliefs, especially about gender or race. Starbuck has said he intends to go after companies who pledged to abandon DEI but whose commitment was only “surface level.” Companies “don’t want to end up on a list, don’t want to be a target,” said Craig Leen, a partner at law firm K&L Gates and the former director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs during Trump’s first term. Trump has ordered each federal agency to identify up to nine large companies, associations and nonprofit groups that should be investigated over DEI policies. But while the administration’s signaled a new enforcement priority, the president’s actions haven’t meaningfully changed anti-discrimination law. “A lot of what companies are doing in the DEI area they’re still able to do,” Leen said, though he suggests they consider re-branding. In response, many large employers have pulled back on any initiative that might inhabit a legal gray area. DEI critics have argued that numeric goals for workforce demographics, even when only aspirational, effectively amount to illegal quotas; such metrics were on the chopping block at almost half of companies who announced changes to their DEI plans, according to a Gravity Research study. Wells Fargo & Co. and BlackRock Inc. are among financial firms who said they’d no longer require hiring managers to interview a diverse slate of job candidates. Segal, the employment law specialist, also tells clients to go a step further, revisiting the underlying messaging behind their DEI plans. For example, companies that say they want a workforce that “reflects the diversity of the community” might draw scrutiny, because it could be seen as suggesting a company employ a certain number of people from each demographic group. But seeking a workforce that “reflects the talent in our community” likely mitigates the risk. Surely all companies have a responsibility to shareholders to seek out the best talent, taking care to look for people with backgrounds that might historically have been overlooked. “It sounds a little bit like semantics, but the words matter,” Segal said. He estimates that three quarters of firms he’s worked with “have made changes to their communications” about diversity initiatives to ensure that they can’t be interpreted as discriminatory, but by and large the underlying programs remain intact. Companies are also saying less. The director of a nonprofit group focused on Latino entrepreneurship said it had scrapped a planned press release about financial backing from corporate philanthropy. The donor didn’t want publicity, even though they’d sought such recognition in the past. Similarly, a banker said his employer balked at adding its name to an event championing Latinos in tech, but still sponsored the event for its client-building potential. In a survey of C-suite executives published in February, law firm Littler Mendelson PC found 55% were more concerned about the risk of lawsuits related to DEI after Trump’s inauguration than they were before. Even so, 49% of respondents said they were not considering any new or further rollbacks of their programs after Trump’s executive orders, while 27% said they were considering them only “to a small extent.” In the short term, they’re simply desperate to avoid government scrutiny. Johnny Taylor, the CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, said leaders of large public companies mostly want to maintain diversity and inclusion programming that keeps workers happy. Executives don’t want to find their companies’ names on a government list of “woke” companies, he said. But they’re also worried that top law firms who’ve struck deals with the Trump administration — like Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison and Latham & Watkins LLP — will fulfill their pledges to provide pro bono legal services by representing aggrieved former employees claiming reverse discrimination. What Taylor hears from CEOs is a version of: “Tell us what we can do that will affirm our commitment to this work but is not going to get us sued and get us into a protracted legal battle,” he explained. One way executives are solving that puzzle is by keeping battles quiet. A few companies, including Costco Wholesale Corp. and Apple Inc., have publicly defended their diversity efforts in the face of proposals from conservative groups to curtail those initiatives. But Deere & Co., McDonald’s and IBM — all companies that have made statements to employees or the public signaling retrenchment on DEI — have kept a much lower profile while asking shareholders to reject similar proposals. The government’s next steps remain a crucial unknown for corporate America, and the uncertainty has left lawyers at top firms guessing — and their phone lines busy. Employment “law used to be more about looking at the different court cases and giving your advice about what a court is likely to do,” said Leen, the K&L Gates lawyer and former government official. “When you have a very active administration, companies are more interested in what the administration might do than what a court might rule down the line.” Photo: A protest at Harvard University in 2023.

Title: Crypto ETPs see $785M in weekly inflows, AUM nears record high

Digital asset investment products managed by firms including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, ProShares, and 21Shares drew in $785 million of net inflows globally last week, marking the fifth consecutive week of gains, according to data from CoinShares. The latest inflows have pushed year-to-date figures to $7.5 billion, surpassing the previous high of $7.2 billion set in early February. “It also fully recovers the near $7 billion of outflows experienced during the February-March price correction,” CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill wrote in a report published Monday. Source: CoinShares While Bitcoin-related products continued to attract the most capital, with $557 million in inflows, Ethereum-based funds saw a notable rebound. Ethereum products registered $205 million in inflows last week, bringing the year-to-date total to $575 million. Butterfill described Ethereum as the “standout performer” for the week, citing renewed investor confidence following the Pectra upgrade and the appointment of Tomasz Stańczak as co-executive director. However, only $41.8 million of those Ethereum inflows came from US-listed spot ETFs, highlighting mixed sentiment across markets. Bitcoin traded in a narrow range between $102,000 and $105,000 during the week, while Ether declined about 3%. Total assets under management across crypto investment products stood at $172.9 billion, close to record highs. Despite the strong weekly inflow, Bitcoin products saw a decline from the $887 million recorded in the previous week. Butterfill attributed the slowdown to ongoing hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, short-Bitcoin products attracted $5.8 million in inflows, marking their fourth straight week of gains. US-based crypto investment products led inflows with $681 million, followed by Germany at $86.3 million and Hong Kong at $24.2 million — the latter’s highest since November 2024. In contrast, Sweden, Canada, and Brazil registered outflows of $16.3 million, $13.5 million, and $3.9 million, respectively. Among altcoins, XRP and Sui recorded inflows of $5 million and $9.3 million, respectively, while Cardano and Chainlink saw smaller positive movements. Solana-based funds were the only segment to report net outflows last week, with $0.9 million withdrawn.

Title: BounceBit Pilots Bitcoin Trading Strategy Using BlackRock's BUIDL as Collateral

BounceBit, a crypto infrastructure provider using features from both centralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), has executed a bitcoin (BTC) derivatives trading strategy using BlackRock's yield-generating tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, to enhance returns. The strategy, to be rolled out to institutions and retail users, consisted of two main components: a bitcoin basis trade, involving a long position in the spot market while shorting futures, and a short position in BTC put options, both collateralized by BUIDL tokens. The basis trade, also known as cash and carry arbitrage, alone generated an annualized yield of 4.7%, with put option writing contributing an additional 15%. Combined with the 4.25% return from BUIDL used as collateral, the total yield exceeded 24%. Integrating BUIDL as collateral helped generate a higher return than strategies collateralized by stablecoins, which do not generate any return. "This strategy allows investors to capture both Treasury Bill yields and funding rate arbitrage returns," Jack Lu, founder and CEO of BounceBit said in a press release exclusively shared with CoinDesk. "BounceBit bridges the gap between Western real-world asset issuers and Asian crypto trading infrastructure, providing new options for yield generation," Lu said. BounceBit is the native BTC restaking chain secured by staking both bitcoin and BounceBit tokens. The network allows BTC holders to earn yields through native validator staking, DeFi ecosystem and a CeFi-like mechanism powered by Ceffu and Mainnet Digital. As of writing, cryptocurrencies worth over $500 million were locked on BounceBit. BounceBit plans to roll out the BUIDL-collateralised strategy to institutional and retail users soon. "The successful pilot is a proof of concept to our new product line BB Prime, which will be available to both retail and institutional users," BounceBit's spokesperson told CoinDesk. "This strategy underpins BB Prime as a new class of CeDeFi applications built on top of RWAs which are traditionally troubled by a lack of utilities beyond just holding for t-bill yield, hindering mass adoption," the spokesperson added. BUIDL, launched in March 2024 by Securitize and BlackRock, is a tokenized investment fund operating on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Aptos and Polygon. The token, currently boasting a market cap of $2.88 billion, is backed by short-term U.S. government bonds, boasting a stable value pegged at one dollar per token.

Title: How President Trump is sparking a crypto revolution in America

By Rafael Nam President Trump addresses the Bitcoin 2024 conference at Music City Center in Nashville, Tenn., when he was still a candidate. Jon Cherry/Getty Images hide caption For years, crypto was viewed by many as a weird and fringe investment, hyped up by a bunch of math geeks and used widely by all kinds of unsavory characters, from drug dealers to hackers. It was known for spectacular returns — and spectacular crashes: Top crypto exchange FTX collapsed just two years ago, landing its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, in prison. Now, a radical shift is taking place under President Trump. From financial regulators to the halls of Congress and all the way to the Oval Office, the U.S. is fully embracing — and even promoting — crypto. It is a remarkable turnaround from the Biden administration. And crypto companies are emerging as big winners. On Monday, one of the top exchanges in the sector, Coinbase, is joining the S&P 500, the stock market index that tracks the biggest traded companies in the U.S. "I think it's a historic moment for the industry and it's a really special moment for Coinbase," says Faryar Shirzad, the company's chief policy officer. "Having Coinbase be the first crypto company that's on the S&P 500 and (to be) be in a position where more and more people are beginning to watch how we operate (and) what we do is really exciting for us." President Trump himself also stands to benefit financially. Shortly before his inauguration, he even launched his meme coin — a crypto asset known more for being tied to internet memes and jokes. And his family is getting into the action too with financial interests in crypto companies. Advocates of cryptocurrencies welcome the developments, believing the U.S. is finally embracing — and taking a global leadership role in promoting — an area they say will help define the future of the financial sector. But critics are aghast, warning that the U.S. is promoting an investment with a history of incredible volatility that will end up hurting scores of average Americans, potentially setting up a financial crisis like the one the world experienced in 2008. "History is going to show this will be a disaster courting a catastrophe for the rest of the country and especially for Main Street Americans, who are going to get stuck with the bill cleaning up after the next financial crash," says Dennis Kelleher, a prominent crypto critic at advocacy group Better Markets. Whatever anyone believes, however, one thing's clear: Trump has ushered in a new golden era for crypto. From Coinbase's inclusion in the S&P 500 to the deep regulatory shifts, here are three ways to understand what's taking place in the crypto sector. Perhaps the most sweeping changes have taken place at the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose mission is to police the financial sector and protect investors. Under former Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC aggressively went after the crypto sector, with lawsuits and enforcement including against top crypto companies such as Coinbase. Gensler, who stepped down early this year, called crypto "the Wild West." and sought to rein in the industry, comparing it to the period before the Great Crash of 1929 when the financial sector was dominated by "hucksters" and "fraudsters" before federal laws on securities were put in place. His approach set him up as an enemy for the sector as he sought to get companies such as Coinbase to register with the agency and comply with its regulations, despite protests from crypto companies that they shouldn't be considered part of traditional Wall Street. Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler took a much more aggressive approach against crypto companies when he headed the agency. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption No longer. The agency has staged a remarkable turnaround starting even before the new SEC head Paul Atkins was sworn in last month. In one of the agency's biggest decisions, it dropped a lawsuit against Coinbase that accused the company of trying to operate outside of its purview. It reassigned its chief litigation counsel to a new role managing IT systems. (The SEC did not reply to a request for comment from NPR.) Crypto companies have welcomed the changes, calling them a needed readjustment from what they saw as excessive heavy-handedness under the Biden administration. And regulators such as the SEC and the country's law enforcement are not necessarily giving up on overseeing crypto altogether. Just this month the former founder and CEO of a crypto company called Celsius Network was sentenced to 12 years for fraud and market manipulation. Yet for consumer advocates, the changes are devastating. Corey Frayer, the director of investor protection at Consumer Federation of America says it's akin to letting "crypto run wild." It's also personal for Frayer, who was at the SEC for more than three years. "It is very frustrating to see three years of, you know, 65, 70-hour weeks that me and my team worked to try and protect investors and get this industry compliant with the law, be erased in essentially three months," Frayer says. "And it is surprising to see, given the risks that it creates for the traditional financial system." When crypto exchange FTX collapsed, many analysts thought at the time that it would permanently tarnish crypto, validating warnings by critics about the dangers of the industry. Instead, something remarkable happened: Crypto has gone legit. By early 2024, BlackRock, one of the biggest financial firms in Wall Street, was the first to launch an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin, offering investors — including mom and pop ones — an easier way to invest in the cryptocurrencies. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried arrives for a bail hearing at Manhattan Federal Court in New York City on Aug. 11, 2023. When the crypto exchange collapsed, many thought it would permanently tarnish the crypto sector. It's done anything but. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images hide caption Super PACs representing crypto companies spent over $100 million in the 2024 election cycle, helping elect lawmakers they view as friendlier to the crypto industry to Congress. And now, Coinbase is set to become part of the S&P 500 starting at the open of trade on Monday, replacing Discover Financial Services, which is being acquired by Capital One Financial. "Coinbase joining the S&P 500 means crypto is here to stay. It's going to be in everybody's 401(k), everybody is going to have crypto exposure at least indirectly through Coinbase," said Brian Armstrong, the company's CEO, in an interview with Yahoo Finance. As crypto goes increasingly mainstream, another person stands to benefit directly: President Trump himself. Trump's launch of his meme coin sparked controversy even within the crypto industry, which sees it as a distraction that could undermine the credibility of the industry. Although $TRUMP lost a substantial part of its value since launching, President Trump sent the price of the coin soaring for a while when he announced he would hold a special dinner this Thursday for the top 220 holders of the meme coin as measured during a three-week period that ended earlier this month. That has sparked accusations that investors, including from abroad, rushed to buy Trump's currency as a way to influence the president. And it goes beyond meme coins. Members of the Trump family are also in. His sons are involved in crypto ventures that are reportedly exploring financial deals with major crypto companies as well as foreign-backed entities. President Trump's son, Eric Trump, who's an executive at the Trump Organization, participates in the Token 2049 crypto conference in Dubai on May 1. Giuseppe Cacace/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Ultimately, all the changes that are taking place under President Trump have consumer advocates concerned that it will end in a crisis similar in scope to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. There are similarities, according to crypto critics. Back then, financial firms peddled complex financial investments with elaborate names like credit default swaps or collateralized debt obligations — investments that few understood and turned out to be a house of cards that collapsed and dragged the global financial system down with them. "You have these predatory instruments that come into the marketplace. They're advertised as innovations. They're advertised as serving low-income communities or middle-class Americans. And at the end of the day, they blow up," consumer advocate Frayer says. "The companies that foisted them upon Americans get bailed out or do fine, and everyone else is left holding the bag. So I am afraid this is like 2008 all over again." An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that President Trump has invited the top 220 holders of his namesake memecoin for dinner this Wednesday. The dinner is on Thursday.

A robotic dog is exhibited at the 137th China Import and Export Fair, also known as Canton Fair, April 16, 2025. (Photo by Wu Wenjun/People's Daily Online) The recently concluded 137th China Import and Export Fair, also known as Canton Fair, saw the participation of 288,000 overseas buyers from 219 countries and regions. On-site intended export deals reached $25.44 billion, a year-on-year increase of 3 percent. Multiple indicators hit record highs, underscoring China's determination to share its development opportunities with the world through high-level opening up. At a time when globalization is facing headwinds and unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, China is opening its door wider to the world, providing much-needed stability and certainty to the global economy. Opening up to the world is the fundamental national policy of China that has endured throughout more than four decades of reform and opening up. This long-standing commitment remains a vital pathway for China to pursue its own development while contributing to global prosperity. By promoting development through opening up, China has been widely recognized as an oasis of certainty and a hot spot for investment and entrepreneurship. China's high-level opening up is a continuous effort rather than a completed mission. Actively expanding imports is also a key part of this strategy. China does not deliberately pursue a trade surplus. It is working to foster more balanced trade by actively increasing imports. In 2024, the total value of China's imports reached 18.4 trillion yuan ($2.55 trillion), up 2.3 percent year on year, setting a new record. The country has maintained its position as the world's second-largest importer for 16 consecutive years.

From hosting international cooperation platforms such as the CIIE, Canton Fair, China International Fair for Trade in Services, China International Consumer Products Expo, and China International Supply Chain Expo, to promoting the brand of "Invest in China" and launching the "Shopping in China" series, China is providing broad development opportunities for global companies with a spirit of openness. Meanwhile, it has given all the least developed countries with which it has diplomatic relations zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines. With these ongoing efforts, the enormous Chinese market is turning into a shared global market, demonstrating China's sense of responsibility as a major country. China's determination to expand high-level opening up remains unwavering. This is not only a clear position but also evident in concrete actions. In the first quarter of this year, 12,603 new foreign-invested enterprises were established in China, representing a year-on-year growth of 4.3 percent. Meanwhile, China has removed all market access restrictions for foreign investors in the manufacturing sector. The items on its negative list, which specifies fields that are off-limits to foreign investors, have been further slashed to 29 in the national version and 27 for pilot free trade zones (FTZs). China has also released a guideline for improving its FTZs and approved a plan that aims to expand comprehensive pilot programs to accelerate the services industry's opening-up. These efforts reflect China's steady drive to expand institutional opening up, such as that of rules, regulations, management, and standards, and its commitment to deepening and broadening opening up. As Rebeca Grynspan, secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, noted, China has a spirit of openness where businesses worldwide can connect, forge partnerships and contribute to a more prosperous and interconnected global economy. China's pursuit of high-level opening up has expanded the space for mutually beneficial China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation. In 2023, the U.S. set up 1,920 new enterprises in China, with an actual investment of $3.36 billion, up 52 percent from the previous year. At the same time, China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation has generated substantial business opportunities and profits for American companies. For example, Tesla's electric vehicle sales in the Chinese mainland have hit a record high of 657,000 units in 2024, up 8.8 percent year on year. China's voluntary opening policies have benefited financial institutions from all countries including the United States. More than 10 American insurance companies have subsidiaries in China. American financial institutions, such as Goldman Sachs, American Express, Bank of America, and MetLife, have achieved substantial investment returns as strategic investors in Chinese financial institutions. Meanwhile, BlackRock, Fidelity, Neuberger Berman, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Alliance Bernstein have been allowed to establish wholly foreign-owned fund management companies in China. Some U.S. politicians have called for greater opening up of China to American business for the good of both China and the United States. The fact, however, is that China has repeatedly affirmed its welcome to companies from all countries, including the U.S., to invest and thrive in China. China has developed sound regulations, policies and procedures for foreign investment, promoted trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and made active efforts to foster a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized. It has been and will remain an ideal, safe, and promising destination for foreign investors. It is hoped that the U.S. will refrain from creating obstacles for American companies seeking to invest in China, and stop using national security and America First as catch-all pretexts for demanding openness from others while tightening its own trade restrictions. Such protectionist moves risk disrupting global industrial and supply chains and weakening the multilateral trading system. Only through mutually beneficial cooperation can China and the U.S. realize their respective development goals. This not only serves the common interests of both countries but also meets the expectations of the international community.

Title: Texas Stock Exchange CEO Sees State Muscling In on NYC, Delaware

Time Published: 2025-05-19T06:00:06Z

The head of the upstart Texas Stock Exchange said the state is making a serious play to reshape the US financial landscape, using new pro-business laws and a proposed ban on trading taxes to take on longtime power centers on the East Coast. Governor Greg Abbott signed legislation this week aimed at strengthening legal protections for companies and curbing shareholder challenges, part of a broader strategy to lure corporate registrations from Delaware. Meanwhile, a ballot measure in November would ban taxes on securities transactions just as a group of New York lawmakers is pushing to bring back a state levy on stock sales. “Texas is going in direct competition with Delaware and New York, Delaware for registrations and New York for listings and the exchange operators,” Jim Lee, founder of the Texas Stock Exchange, said in an interview a day after attending a signing ceremony with Abbott. The new measures show “the commitment that the state is making to building out capital markets here.” Lee’s Dallas-based bourse project is backed by the likes of BlackRock Inc., Citadel Securities, Charles Schwab Corp. and pipeline billionaire Kelcy Warren. But for all the progress Lee has made, he still has a long way to go to get the Texas Stock Exchange up and running. The exchange is still under review by US securities regulators. Lee said approval will potentially come by the end of the third quarter, keeping the schedule on track to begin trading early next year. The exchange will soon have about 60 employees working from a temporary office in Dallas. It’s still shopping for a permanent space, which it plans to announce in the summer. The industry’s powerful incumbents appear to be taking notice. The New York Stock Exchange announced it would reincorporate its Chicago operations in Dallas to start an equities exchange in Texas. Nasdaq Inc. unveiled a plan to open a regional headquarters in Dallas. Together, the two exchanges dominate US listings. “It’s flattering and we welcome them,” said Lee, chief executive officer of TXSE Group Inc., the parent company of the Texas exchange. “We’ve been driving this process for years now and we welcome them to the effort. They are formidable competitors.” The TXSE is trying to break through at a time when growing US businesses have been staying private for longer, tapping funding sources such as private equity firms that offer capital without the costs of operating a public company. Calling such expenses “a flaw in our public markets,” Lee is pledging to offer predictability to listing companies while holding down costs. He has national and global ambitions but says the initial focus will be on companies in the “southeastern quadrant” of the US from Texas to Florida and the Carolinas. Its primary trading platform will be in Secaucus, New Jersey. “The solution is, you have to have a lot more alignment and predictability for public companies, and we have to drive down cost,” he said. While the New York proposal to reinstate a tax on stock sales has little chance of becoming law for now, Lee said any future steps in that direction would benefit his state. Texas is also trying to entice companies to move their incorporation to the state as more executives question Delaware’s status as the gold standard for business litigation. Texas is developing a system of business courts. Elon Musk won shareholder approval last year to move Tesla Inc.’s incorporation to Texas after a Delaware judge voided his record-setting pay package. His Space Exploration Technologies Corp. also moved its incorporation to Texas from Delaware last year. Topics Texas

Title: Political Sabotage: The Democrats’ Obstruction of Trump’s Foreign Policy Wins

After securing a strong base of support in the 2024 election, Donald Trump is positioning himself for a renewed push in foreign policy — an area that his supporters argue has deteriorated under recent Democrat direction. With growing global instability and concerns about America’s waning influence abroad, many see Trump’s return as an opportunity to reassert U.S. strength on the world stage. Citing what they view as failures in diplomacy, deterrence, and global leadership under the Biden administration, Trump’s supporters anticipate a more forceful, deal-driven approach that prioritizes national interest and restores America’s negotiating power. The Deal with Ukraine One of the most significant early foreign policy moves of President Donald Trump's second term is the U.S.-Ukraine Mineral Resources Agreement, signed on April 30, 2025. The agreement, seen as a strategic counter to Russian influence, was finalized after months of complex negotiations and is viewed by Trump’s supporters as a testament to his assertive and transactional approach to foreign policy, especially in contrast to the strategies of the previous Democrat administration. Almost immediately, Democrat lawmakers and affiliated media outlets began to raise red flags. They argue that the agreement reflects an overly transactional and politicized approach to foreign policy, questioning whether Trump bypassed traditional diplomatic protocols to bolster his political standing. Democrats expressed concerns over the agreement’s terms, with some advising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to reject the deal, citing fears of compromising Ukraine’s sovereignty and the absence of explicit security guarantees. Notably, Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) met with Zelenskyy shortly before his Oval Office meeting with Trump, urging caution against a “fake peace agreement” lacking security arrangements for Ukraine. Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.) likened Trump’s approach to a coercive real estate tactic, suggesting the deal resembled a demand for Ukraine to “pay rent” through mineral concessions. Furthermore, Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) characterized the agreement as “extortion” in a televised interview. Undercutting Democrats’ Political Narrative Many Democrats view major deals initiated by Donald Trump as potentially damaging to their own standing because these deals shift the narrative in Trump’s favor. When Trump achieves visible wins on the international stage, it challenges Democrat criticisms of his leadership and complicates their messaging. Such developments can resonate with voters who prioritize results over rhetoric, thereby posing a threat to Democrat poll numbers and weakening their leverage in debates over foreign policy direction and executive decision-making. The Democrat party has built a complex network of influence across key financial and institutional channels. Supporters see this as a strategic framework for implementing progressive policy goals and ensuring long-term institutional stability. Initiatives like Trump’s foreign economic deals — particularly those negotiated outside traditional diplomatic or bureaucratic structures — are viewed by some Democrats as threats to a financial and governance model they have helped shape over decades. A growing concern among Trump-aligned policymakers is that meaningful progress in reshaping U.S.-Ukraine relations may be stalled as long as key Ukrainian institutions remain heavily staffed or influenced by figures aligned with pro-Democrat frameworks. Any effort by Trump to establish a new kind of dialogue with Ukraine may be constrained until there is a shift in Ukraine’s internal political and administrative landscape — one that allows for greater openness to his administration’s more transactional and sovereignty-focused foreign policy approach. And a notable example is Tomáš Fiala, a key figure in Ukraine’s financial sector with deep ties to Western institutions and a consistent advocate of liberal democratic alignment. Ties with Soros and the Democrat Party Fiala is the CEO and founder of Dragon Capital, a leading Ukrainian investment firm. He has served as the elected President of the European Business Association (EBA) from 2010 to 2015 and again from 2016 to 2021, leading Ukraine’s top business organization comprising over 1,000 companies with more than a million employees. He was also elected to the Board of Transparency International Ukraine from 2016 to 2020, part of a leading global anti-corruption watchdog. In October 2020, Fiala was elected to the Board of Directors of the Kyiv School of Economics. He has been associated with George Soros through business partnerships and media ownership in Ukraine. In 2015, Soros became an anchor investor in a new Ukraine fund managed by Dragon Capital, marking a significant international investment in the country following its 2014 revolution. Additionally, Dragon Capital’s pro-Western stance and Soros’s involvement have been noted in discussions about media ownership and potential foreign influence channels in Ukraine. By the way, Soros Fund Management has held various investment positions across the financial sector, including bonds issued by major firms like BlackRock. Regarding connections to the Democrat party, the media outlets associated with Fiala have supported Democrat figures. For instance, reports indicate that a media group funded by the Open Society Foundation and managed by Fiala played an active role in the U.S. electoral process, supporting Democrat candidates. As Trump Sets the Narrative, Democrats Struggle to Respond Some Democrat strategists are reportedly growing concerned that the ideological momentum behind Trump-aligned populism could disrupt their longstanding influence over policy and financial frameworks - both domestically and in foreign relations. This includes not only narrative control but also influence over financial channels such as foreign aid, NGO funding, and institutional partnerships. With the 2026 Congressional elections approaching, many within the Democrat party see the stakes as increasingly high. For them, preventing a deeper shift in public sentiment — and preserving their grip on key institutions and funding networks — has become a political priority. But Democrat strategies to counter his influence have largely fallen flat. Rather than offering a compelling alternative vision, many within the party appear to be relying on the hope that Trump will eventually sabotage himself through legal missteps or controversial decisions. Despite internal calls for a bold rebranding, Democrats remain fragmented and overly reactive, often focused more on opposing Trump than defining their own agenda. This passive stance leaves them vulnerable, especially as Trump continues to dominate political discourse with a clear, sovereignty-focused message. Ultimately, waiting for him to stumble may prove to be a losing strategy as the 2026 congressional elections approach. Ensuring Loyalty and Effectiveness As Donald Trump pushes forward with a series of high-profile foreign policy initiatives — ranging from negotiations with Ukraine on resource development to renewed diplomatic overtures in the Middle East — the Democrats are increasingly focused on delaying or obstructing these efforts. In this view, the Democrat strategy is less about offering a clear foreign policy alternative and more about buying time to regroup and rebuild public support after electoral losses. To effectively carry out the policy agenda, the president must continue to go beyond reforming agencies like USAID and pursue broader leadership changes across the federal government because as it stands, certain agencies are remaining staffed with individuals whose ideological leanings conflict with Trump’s vision. If Trump leaves pro-Democrat officials in key government and diplomatic positions, the Republicans risk enabling internal opposition that could undermine their foreign policy goals. These individuals, aligned with previous administrations’ multilateral and progressive agendas, may reinterpret or redirect the implementation of Trump-initiated deals to align with Democrat priorities.

Title: Limerick hammer Cork in statement Munster hurling championship win

AS STATEMENT PERFORMANCES GO, this one from Limerick will rank as highly as anything they’ve produced in the John Kiely era. They blew Cork away by 16 points this afternoon to leave their home support in a joyous mood in the May sunshine. Qualification from Munster has been assured and Limerick’s status as favourites to land a seventh provincial title on the bounce has hardened after the scale of victory they delivered here. Cork were left chastened after this beating and know they must now get a positive result at home to Waterford next Sunday to prolong their season. The cold truth was that this game was settled by the interval, Limerick retreating to the dressing room with the comfort of a commanding 2-18 to 0-9 advantage. Goals from Aaron Gillane and Adam English underlined their utter dominance in that period. After Tom Morrissey had snapped over a brace of points, Gillane set the tone in the third minute when he gathered the ball in the left corner and took advantage of a slip by Niall O’Leary. The Patrickswell man galloped in along the endline, sidestepped Ciarán Joyce, and drilled home his shot. Cork’s Alan Connolly and Diarmaid Byrnes of Limerick James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO Cork did notch the next three points of the game to cut the deficit to two but they were chasing in Limerick’s slipstream for the remainder of the afternoon. By the time Limerick raised a green flag again in the 27th minute through English, released by the outstanding Cian Lynch for the strike, they were 2-12 to 0-6 clear. The signs were ominous for Cork and they could have shipped further goals but Barry Nash’s effort went wide under pressure from a swarm of Cork defenders, Shane O’Brien was hooked on another occasion, and in the same passage of play, Tom Morrissey’s effort was blocked on the line by Mark Coleman. The pressure on the Cork defence was intense. Limerick, driven on by the power of their half-back line where Kyle Hayes excelled, were in control and Cork couldn’t get their attacking game going to bag the boost of a goal at the other end. Nickie Quaid was equal to a Patrick Horgan strike in the 21st minute after Brian Hayes fashioned an opportunity, and Cork were left staring at a 15-point deficit at the break. Advertisement Cork’s Shane Barrett and Tom Morrissey of Limerick. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO The second half had a lower-key feel to it. Cork sprung Séamus Harnedy from the bench and he landed two points during his time on the pitch, while Horgan finished with 1-9 to his credit, but his overall display also featured some poor shooting as he chalked up four wides from frees and dropped another short. Cork landed seven of the first 10 points in the second half, substitute Cormac O’Brien impressing, but it was damage limitation stuff such was the majesty of hurling that Limerick had produced in that opening period. Cork’s goal arrived ten minutes from full time, Horgan smashing home a 20-yard free after Brian Hayes had been fouled. The outburst of celebration in the Cork support was soon quelled as Limerick grabbed their third goal, Gillane firing home a penalty after he was fouled by Eoin Downey. Substitutes Cathal O’Neill and Peter Casey kept the Limerick scoring tally ticking over, and the champions are now in the driving seat to return to another provincial decider. Scorers for Limerick: Aaron Gillane 2-7 (1-6 frees, 1-0 pen), Adam English 1-2, Tom Morrissey 0-5, Gearóid Hegarty 0-3, Peter Casey 0-2, Cathal O’Neill 0-2, Michael Casey 0-1, Diarmaid Byrnes 0-1, Cian Lynch 0-1, Shane O’Brien 0-1, David Reidy 0-1. Scorers for Cork: Patrick Horgan 1-9 (1-8 frees), Séamus Harnedy 0-2, Robert Downey 0-1, Mark Coleman 0-1, Shane Barrett 0-1, Brian Hayes 0-1, Brian Roche 0-1. 1. Nickie Quaid (Effin) 4.

Title: Bitcoin Price Suddenly Soars As Congress Predicted To ‘Make History’

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 05/18 update below. This post was originally published on May 17 Bitcoin has been thrust back into the spotlight by extreme price swings this year, with U.S. president Donald Trump’s assault on the global trade order resulting in wild predictions of total U.S. dollar collapse. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has reclaimed $100,000 per bitcoin, topping the closely-watched level even as BlackRock quietly issues a stark bitcoin warning. Now, as crypto traders brace for a perfect storm to hit the bitcoin price, JPMorgan analysts have flipped from gold to bitcoin, predicting the bitcoin price will outperform gold over the rest of 2025. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon remains skeptical of bitcoin and crypto despite the bitcoin ... More price boom over the last few years. "Between mid-February and mid-April gold was rising at the expense of bitcoin, while of the past three weeks we have been observing the opposite, i.e. bitcoin rising at the expense of gold," JPMorgan analysts led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note seen by Decrypt. "In all, we expect the year-to-date zero sum game between gold and bitcoin to extend to the remainder of the year, but are biased towards crypto-specific catalysts creating more upside for bitcoin over gold into the second half of the year." Those "crypto-specific catalysts" include the passage of pro-crypto laws and regulations in the U.S. as well as Trump’s support of the technology. Elsewhere, Wall Street and tech giants are quietly gearing up to blow up the crypto market. 05/18 update: A U.S. bill that would regulate stablecoin issuers, formerly introducing crypto into the established financial system, will be debated by Congress this coming week, with some claiming it’s poised to pass the Senate. The bitcoin price surged to $106,000 per bitcoin on Sunday, climbing to a level not seen since early February and putting it in touching distance of its all-time high of almost $110,000. “Next week, the Senate will make history when we debate and pass the Genius Act that establishes the first ever pro-growth regulatory framework for payment stablecoins,” Republican senator Bill Hagerty from Tennessee, who sponsored the "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (Genius) Act, said in a statement. After Democrats raised eleventh hour concerns over the bill earlier this month that stemmed from U.S. president Donald Trump and his administration’s links to the crypto world, the bill has been redrafted to satisfy Democrats concerned with consumer protection and national security elements, according to a copy seen by Coindesk. “Let’s get this home, we are ready for adoption and to revolutionise the way this financial market works,” Bo Hines, executive director of the president’s council of advisors for digital assets, said during the Consensus crypto conference this week. “We’re actually having these conversations in real-time—I’m extremely confident in the fact that they will get it pushed through, we’d love to see it on the president’s desk. We’re well on our way to achieving the presidents’ goal. We are moving extremely quickly and effectively.” Crypto companies have long been calling for regulation, with Congress under president Joe Biden trying and failing to get rules for stablecoins and issuers passed into law. "The industry wants regulation," investor Ira Auerbach from Offchain Labs said in emailed comments. “The message from those I engage with is clear: Give us the rules of the game and watch innovation flourish.” In April, the JPMorgan analysts warned bitcoin’s burgeoning reputation as “digital gold" was under pressure as the bitcoin price failed to hold up in the face extreme market volatility triggered by Trump’s global trade war. The bitcoin price plummeted to around $75,000 per bitcoin, dropping over 30% from its all-time high of almost $110,000, as traders panicked over Trump’s tariffs but has since bounced back to over $100,000. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, triggering a wave of bullish bitcoin price ... More predictions. Bitcoin price bulls have remained upbeat, however, with Miller Value Partners chief investment officer and chairman, Bill Miller IV, telling CNBC the bitcoin price will keep climbing until it eclipses gold’s $20 trillion market capitalization. “Bitcoin’s back in the six-figures with a lot of room to go. If you compare its primary functional use case, a check and a balance on the lack of accountability in fiat unit creation, we still have a long way to go,” Miller said, predicting bitcoin’s “functional superiority” will push it to a price of $1 million per bitcoin. The gold price has hit its own record high this year as investors flee to the traditional safe haven, though it has dipped in recent weeks as the global trade war looks increasingly close to being resolved. With bitcoin’s market capitalization “back above $2 trillion and gold trading north of $3,200/oz, the two now stand side-by-side—as hedges against geopolitical turmoil and, increasingly, as high-conviction stores of value for the future,” Gadi Chait, head of investment at bitcoin and crypto custody company Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments.

Register | Sign in Latest News Current Drivers Current Teams Current Circuits Latest Galleries Gallery Categories NEWS STORY18/05/2025 Today's race - probably the last at this iconic track, unless, God (and the WEF, Bill Gates, Blackrock etc.) willing, there is another pandemic - can go one of several ways. It could be decided at the first corner, or certainly on the opening lap, and then become one long DRS train, or it could be a genuine thriller. The Weather Gods are not going to be playing a part, which leaves it down to tyres, pit stop strategy and good old grit and determination. We know from experience that neither Oscar nor Max is prepared to give an inch, so the opening lap will be vital, however with the likes of Russell, Norris, Alonso Sainz, Albon and Hadjar in close proximity there should be added drama from the outset. Then we have the frustrated Ferraris, not to mention an equally fired-up Antonelli. A one-stop is the most viable choice, in part because there is only one DRS zone and also because this is the longest pit lane of the season in terms of time lost during a pit stop. The combination of medium and hard, with a stop between laps 17 and 23, is the most likely. However, as an alternative, some drivers might prefer to go for a longer first stint, starting on the hard, in the hope of an eventual Safety Car, in which case the switch to medium would be between laps 37 and 43. A two-stop strategy is not out of the question in terms of total race time, but the factors just mentioned mean it is at a disadvantage. For anyone attempting this, the best combinations would be medium-hard-hard." Piastri, Norris, Leclerc, Hamilton, Verstappen and Antonelli all have one set of fresh mediums available, while, of those mentioned, Norris has one set of fresh hards while the rest have two. As for the soft - the infamous C6s - we are not going to see them again today, indeed the drivers would be happy never to see them again such were the issues they had with them yesterday. Despite the drama of Q2 and Q3, Aston Martin insists that its qualifying positions are not purely down to tyre choice but also the raft of upgrades brought here. Hopefully, Alonso and Stroll can use their positions, and the limitations of the Imola track, to convert their grid spots into a decent points haul. The Spaniard is always 'up for it', consequently it has been disappointing to see his frustration this season. Yesterday proved he still has fire in his belly, and given the equipment can still do the business. The Williams pair have looked strong all weekend, and it is good to see Sainz finding his feet, and while the Grove outfit should be in for some decent points there is still a long, long way to go before we can start thinking podiums. Having looked so strong on Friday, Gasly fell away somewhat yesterday, but he should give a good account of himself today, though Hadjar and Stroll will be keen to thwart him. The drama of the front rows aside, the real drama this afternoon should come from behind what with the Ferraris, Hamilton, Colapinto and Tsunoda. Having harangued Jack Doohan since before the season even began, Colapinto's 'fans' have now turned their attention elsewhere, giving poor old Tsunoda grief after the Red Bull driver gesticulated after being impeded by the Alpine. The Argentine has spoken out at the abuse levelled at Tsunoda - much of it racist - but sadly that appears to be the sort of demographic the sport is attracting these days. Despite his excellent debut last year Colapinto was subsequently involved in far too many crashes - costing Williams a small fortune - however this appears to have been overlooked amidst the anticipation of taking Doohan's seat. Yesterday he picked up where he left off, consequently the doubts over his potential remain. Already condemned to the back of the grid, a complete new engine change means that poor old Yuki will start from the pitlane. Colap;into drops one place after he entered the fast lane in the pit lane before the re-start time was confirmed. Talking of qualifying, Haas is still arguing over the fact that Bearman's final Q1 lap was disallowed, though it is unlikely that the stewards will change their mind, and even if they do, what can be done about it? With only one stop looking likely, not to mention the sole DRS zone and the fact that overtaking is nigh impossible, other than tyre choice it is the pit stop strategy that could be a decider today, so it is going to be fascinating to watch for the undercuts and overcuts. In the minutes before the pitlane opens, there is drama in the Williams garage where a leak has been detected on Albon's car. It's unclear what sort of leak it is so the car is being stripped down. The pitlane opens and Verstappen is first out, followed by Hulkenberg, Hadjar, Sainz and Lawson. Air temperature is 24 degrees C, while the track temperature is 46 degrees. It is bright and sunny. That said, Race Control says there is a 20% chance of rain. While Albon's car is sorted and the Thai driver takes his place on the grid, there is activity at the rear of Russell's Mercedes. All are starting on mediums bar Hamilton, Antonelli, Hulkenberg, Bearman and Tsunoda. Fresh rubber for all bar Russell, Alonso and Stroll. They head off on the formation lap, all getting away cleanly. The grid forms. They're away! Piastri gets away well, as does Russell right behind, but Verstappen is slow off the line and as they take the kink that is Turn 1 the Red Bull and Mercedes are side-by-side. However, heading into Tamburello Verstappen starts to brake early and having left Russell for dead clearly catches Piastri on the hop and is through to take the lead. A brilliant move by the world champion. "Piastri, what is he doing," asks a frustrated Russell who is boxed in behind the McLaren as Verstappen forges ahead. At the end of Lap 1, it's: Verstappen, Piastri, Russell, Norris, Alonso, Sainz, Albon, Stroll, Gasly and Leclerc. Hamilton is down to thirteenth and Antonelli up to twelfth. Ocon pits for hard tyres. Hamilton and Antonelli are side-by-side as they battle for 12th, while Gasly goes off and into the gravel at Turn 10 as he battles Leclerc. The Frenchman drops to 14th. After 3 laps Verstappen is 1.4s clear of Piastri as Leclerc closes on Stroll. As Russell remains 2.4s down on Piastri a DRS train consisting of nine cars forms behind the Mercedes. Sainz is harrying countryman Alonso as Hamilton is all over Antonelli further back. At the start of Lap 9, Norris tries a Verstappen on Russell, but is unable to pull it off. "I'm not sure how I'm going to make it to the target lap, pushing like this," admits Russell. In his determination to pass the Mercedes, Norris has two wheels on the grass. "He just drove on the grass," says a surprised Russell. As the pair continue to battle, Alonso and Sainz close in. Finally, following a little mistake by Russell, Norris passes the Mercedes as they head into Variante Villeneuve. Russell and Sainz both pit at the end of Lap 11, rejoining in 15th (Russell) and 16th. A two-stopper? Leclerc also pits, rejoining in 15th. "Plan A is very ambitious at the moment," says Piastri. Check out our Sunday gallery from Imola here. {pb] Alonso and Bortoleto pit at the end of Lap 12, as Leclerc posts a new fastest lap (20.505). The undercut has seen Leclerc pass Russell and Alonso. Replay shows flames from the front-left wheel on Alonso's car as he headed down the pitlane following his stop. Piastri pits at the end of Lap 13. An issue with the front-right sees the Australian rejoin in 12th, 4.9s ahead of Leclerc. Stroll pits at the end of Lap 14, as Hamilton is up to 6th. It's a slow stop for Stroll who rejoins in 17th. After 15 laps, it's: Verstappen, Norris, Albon, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton, Hulkenberg, Colapinto and Bearman, though all have yet to stop. The leading car yet to stop is Tsunoda, who is 0.599s ahead of Piastri. The Japanese driver is told to do his best to hold him up. He tried, but to no avail, Piastri is through and seeks to make up the 32s gap to Verstappen. Having made short work of Bearman Piastri sets off after Colapinto. Out front, Verstappen leads Norris by 9.6s. As Piastri passes Colapinto, Tsunoda is battling a charging Leclerc. "The key for us is clean air and going long," Norris is told. "Albon 21.8, 21.8," Sainz is told as Leclerc passes Tsunoda for 11th. "There is no gap right now," Hamilton is told, "we are not ruling out Plan C." "Understood," he replies. Despite earlier fears the medium appears to be coming back. "It's like the rear track-rod or something is broken, the rears are moving," complains Russell. Colapinto pits at the end of Lap 22 and rejoins in 20tgh, as Piastri passes Hulkenberg for seventh. As Hamilton continues to harry Antonelli, Piastri closes on the pair. On Lap 26, Piastri passes Hamilton in Tamburello, the Briton offering no resistance. The Australian subsequently repeats the move on Antonelli, as he sets off after Hadjar, who can do Verstappen some good if he can hold off the McLaren. Piastri passes the RB to claim fourth, leaving him 32s down on Verstappen. Norris pits at the end of Lap 28, rejoining in seventh ahead of Leclerc. The VSC is deployed as Ocon has stopped on track. Verstappen pits as do Albon, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton and a whole load of others. "Unbelievable, unbelievable," complains Leclerc at the turn of events. While a one-stopped played to his advantage, this has wrecked his race. As the dust settles, Verstappen leads Norris, Albon, Piastri, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton, Alonso, Stroll and Leclerc. Russell is down to twelfth. The VSC is withdrawn and as Leclerc tries to catch Stroll napping, Verstappen leads Norris by 19.9s. Replay shows a possible unsafe release for Antonelli. Norris post a new fastest lap (19.816), as Piastri hunts down Albon. Unseen, Leclerc has passes both Aston Martins, while Sainz has passed Tsunoda for 13th. Hamilton finally passes Antonelli in Tamburello to claim 6th, as the stewards have noted Tsunoda for causing a potential collision with Sainz. Russell passes Stroll and immediately closes on the other Aston Martin as Hamilton posts a new fastest lap (19.473). The crowd roars as Hamilton sweeps by Hadjar to claim fifth, the VSC having played out perfectly for the seven-time world champion. Now 18.7s ahead of Norris, Verstappen is leaving the opposition for dead. In fifth, Hamilton is the leading driver on the faster medium tyres. "I had to use a lot of tyres to get through those two," says Hamilton when told he is up to P5. Meanwhile, teammate Leclerc passes Antonelli for 7th. Hulkenberg passes Alonso for tenth as Tsunoda passes the other Aston Martin for 13th. Leclerc passes Hadjar to claim 6th, leaving him 2s down on his teammate. However, this raises the question of whether on hards, while his teammate is on mediums, will team orders come into play again? Sainz passes Hulkenberg for tenth as Tsunoda passes Alonso for 12th. "I'm the unluckiest ******* driver in the world," sighs Alonso. "It's going to be torture," he adds, knowing that he is destined to slip further down the order. "Swap the positions," Colapinto is told. He duly obliges, allowing Gasly through to take 15th. "I've got an issue," says Antonelli as he pulls to the side of the track on Lap 46. The Safety Car is deployed. Verstappen pits, taking full advantage of the freebie, as Norris follows suit. "We need to stay out, we don't have a tyre to last until the end," Leclerc is told. Hamilton and Hadjar pit as Norris rejoins behind his McLaren teammate. Hamilton rejoins in 7th, as Alonso and Stroll pit, along with Colapinto and Bortoleto. Next time around Albon pits, the Thai driver rejoining in fifth. As Piastri closes to within 1.8s of Verstappen - on 18 lap old rubber - they are taking their time in removing Piastri's car. With Norris on fresher rubber, McLaren is going to have to make a tough decision over the course of the remaining laps. Behind the Safety Car it's: Verstappen, Piastri, Norris, Leclerc, Albon, Russell, Hamilton, Sainz, Hadjar and Hulkenberg. "I see tyres are pretty dead," says Norris. "I'm not asking to be let by, I'm just saying." "These tyres are going to be incredibly difficult to restart," warns Leclerc. With 11 laps remaining, Bearman is told he can un-lap himself, which should take another lap or so. Piastri's tyres are 21 laps old, Leclerc and Russell's 22 laps. The Safety Car is withdrawn at the end of Lap 53. Verstappen lets loose, and as Piastri follows Leclerc tries to make a move on Norris. Having failed, the Ferrari driver comes under attack from Albon. Check out our Sunday gallery from Imola here.

Posted by kenji, 23 hours ago "@ED. I'm still here...smarting, hahaha. Imola results were partially expected give how pacy the Red Bull was. Oscar got done over by Verstappen and it was very much a catch me if you can exercise from there on. It peed me right off but that's racing. What were McLaren thinking pitting Piastri on lap 12. To my mind that was a disaster just waiting to be played out...as it certainly did. Must admit though that Oscar scything through the field was really great to watch.In the end Norris's plaintive pleading to be let by wasn't missed despite Norris claiming he was just making an observation!!! Fortunately the team were not about to risk it and he had to make a pass on merit, on newer rubber which was easier for the team to defend, The race exceeded expectations and Imola is a far nicer environment to hold a race.

As is now usually the case the rest of the race was all about tyres & DRS.If Max had got clear he was always going to win. Once ahead the Red Bull's tyre heating\deg issues are nullified. The Red Bull is every bit as fast (in clean air) as the McLaren: its performance in Qualifying attests this. As a side issue it seems that Max is still the only driver who can come to terms with his RBR car. If RBR want to win any Team gongs they need to address this problem. Even if Max were to win every race, McLaren, Mercedes or even Ferrari, who all have two drivers able to extract decent performance from their car, stand a chance of winning the Team Championship. All the driver championship delivers is a bigger pay-packet for the driver of the Team's car...." Rating: Positive (1) Rate comment: Positive | NegativeReport this comment 5.

A portfolio manager, she spent more than a decade at BlackRock, where her duties included trading risk-off assets like government bonds. But, in 2021, Thornton’s career took a sharp turn—she left her post at the world’s largest asset manager and entered the world of Web3. "There's just a lot of opportunities here," Thornton said of the crypto industry. That's particularly true for women, she added, despite the fact that the space's ranks are overwhelmingly dominated by males. "It's exciting," Thornton said. "People [are] coming from other industries, bringing their knowledge, bringing their skills, and applying them in this new way on this new asset class." Now, she spends her days in the crypto trenches, trading tokens like Bitcoin and one-of-one monkey jpegs —two emerging asset classes that lie at the opposite end of the risk spectrum compared to the financial instruments she traded during her traditional finance days. “When I'm working from home, my kids will kind of walk by my desk, and then they'll stop in their tracks and ask, ‘Mom, what are you doing?’” Thornton told Decrypt. “I'm like, ‘Oh, well, these are the Pudgy Penguins, and these are the Lil Pudgys,’” she said, explaining that the people in her life often seem mystified by her work. Her mother, she added, “thinks I work for Bitcoin.” (She does not.) Thornton is a senior index fund portfolio manager at Bitwise, a crypto-focused asset manager founded in 2017 that offers its clients a variety of investment vehicles, from crypto index funds to ETFs and private funds. As part of her role at the company, Thornton is responsible for implementing investment strategies across a large swath of portfolios—much like she did in her TradFi days. But, she also contributes to managing such unconventional funds as the Bitwise Blue-Chip NFT Index Fund, which targets a decisively more crypto-native crowd. “Where I am, and like so much of what I do really, is at that intersection of the two spaces,” Thornton told Decrypt. Thornton is one of a growing number of traditional finance professionals who are flocking to the crypto industry as institutions increasingly embrace the asset class, and lawmakers clear a path toward reducing federal regulatory oversight of the industry, encouraging its growth in the U.S. Although current employment data on the crypto industry is scant, a report from digital assets-focused research firm K33 Research shows that 199,000 people held jobs in the industry as of 2023, with the majority of those employees working for exchanges and brokerages or crypto-focused financial firms. That tally is small compared to the more than 6 million people who were employed in the finance and insurance sectors that same year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. But now, as a growing number of institutions, states, and public companies invests in the asset class, elevating the price of Bitcoin back near its all-time high above $108,000 set in January, some experts say the crypto industry is poised to attract even more talent from more traditional employment sectors. A recent report from the World Economic Forum shows that over 10% of global GDP could be stored on blockchain by the end of 2025—a marked increase in blockchain use that could spur cross-industry hiring into Web3, according to crypto-focused recruitment services firm RecruitBlock. As Web3 and traditional finance become increasingly enmeshed, it's people like Thornton who will continue to close the gap between those worlds. Thornton said the differences between the emerging tech and traditional finance worlds can, at times, be stark. Crypto markets, unlike regular markets, never close. And whereas TradFi systems “usually have maybe two decimal places on a share quantity,” cryptocurrencies can go out to eight or 12 decimal places. Those differences inform Thornton and her colleagues’ work to manage crypto-focused portfolios much in the same way they used to manage TradFi portfolios, with an aim to create balance, reduce slippage, and tighten market exposure. “When you trade an asset with a price as large as Bitcoin, it matters if you're trading 10.48 or 10.483527397—and you have to get that level of precision,” Thornton said. “They hired me at Bitwise to manage the funds with the same level of precision and rigor and professionalism that we did at BlackRock.” Asked if she feels the gap between the professionalism that guides interactions in the TradFi world and the somewhat cultish espirit de corps of the Crypto Twitter (aka X) trenches, Thornton said, “I'm more of a lurker, to tell you the truth.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Solana’s Q1 was all gas – Can SOL’s price catch up in Q2?

Time Published: 2025-05-17T14:00:10Z

Solana kicked off Q1 with aggressive on-chain momentum – but price action told a different story. Solana [SOL] kicked 2025 off like it had something to prove — and it did. Q1 was defined by relentless on-chain activity, driving sustained price strength for SOL. Transaction throughput surged, active address count climbed, and network engagement hit fresh highs. But what about price action? Did that operational velocity translate into meaningful market traction? Not quite. Despite the fundamentals, SOL closed Q1 down 34.7% from its $190 opening, mirroring broader market weakness as many peers chopped sideways. Now, as we head deeper into Q2, investors must ask: Can Solana deliver on both fronts — Robust fundamentals and a rebound in quarterly returns? Messari’s deep dive breaks down Solana’s Q1 blowout in key metrics. Chain GDP popped 20% QoQ to $1.2 billion, while stablecoin supply rocketed 145% to $12.5 billion – USDC alone up 148% to $9.7 billion. In fact, daily DEX volume hit $4.6 billion on average, spiking to a staggering $36 billion on the 18th of January — that’s more than 10% of Nasdaq’s daily trading. Source: Messari Big players like BlackRock and ApolloGlobal launched real-world assets (RWA). Plus, prediction markets like Polymarket added Solana support, showing the network is attracting serious capital and use cases. This hypergrowth over 90 days confirms Solana’s devs are methodically stacking bricks for the next big DeFi and Web3 wave, reinforcing AMBCrypto’s thesis that a spot Solana ETF could be closer than the market thinks. But let’s keep it real: Fundamentals are only half the battle. If SOL can’t turn this on-chain strength into price alpha and reward patient holders during the FUD grind, a pullback to the Q1 floor of $95 is on the table. And the early warning signs are flashing. Solana kicked off Q2 at $124.56 and has since ripped to $167.72 – a clean 34.4% leg up. Early dip buyers are comfortably in the green, with cost basis anchored near the $95 Q1 floor, now sitting 75% above spot. Unrealized gains are piling up, but with late longs crowding in, the setup’s looking ripe for exit liquidity. On the 14th of May, Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) spiked to a monthly high of 1.7 billion as SOL printed $176.65. Source: Glassnode For context, a spike in CDD suggests older, high-conviction holders are offloading into strength. Since that peak, SOL has shed nearly 6%, echoing past cycles where major CDD blowouts coincided with market tops. Therefore, for Q2 to stay bullish, Solana needs more than just usage metrics. Instead, it needs a sustained bid-side conviction and fresh capital inflows to convert its operational strength into actual quarterly returns. Otherwise, this rally risks turning into another round of distribution masked by high activity.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 05/18 update below. This post was originally published on May 17 Bitcoin has been thrust back into the spotlight by extreme price swings this year, with U.S. president Donald Trump’s assault on the global trade order resulting in wild predictions of total U.S. dollar collapse. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has reclaimed $100,000 per bitcoin, topping the closely-watched level even as BlackRock quietly issues a stark bitcoin warning. Now, as crypto traders brace for a perfect storm to hit the bitcoin price, JPMorgan analysts have flipped from gold to bitcoin, predicting the bitcoin price will outperform gold over the rest of 2025. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon remains skeptical of bitcoin and crypto despite the bitcoin ... More price boom over the last few years. "Between mid-February and mid-April gold was rising at the expense of bitcoin, while of the past three weeks we have been observing the opposite, i.e. bitcoin rising at the expense of gold," JPMorgan analysts led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note seen by Decrypt. "In all, we expect the year-to-date zero sum game between gold and bitcoin to extend to the remainder of the year, but are biased towards crypto-specific catalysts creating more upside for bitcoin over gold into the second half of the year." Those "crypto-specific catalysts" include the passage of pro-crypto laws and regulations in the U.S. as well as Trump’s support of the technology. Elsewhere, Wall Street and tech giants are quietly gearing up to blow up the crypto market. 05/18 update: A U.S. bill that would regulate stablecoin issuers, formerly introducing crypto into the established financial system, will be debated by Congress this coming week, with some claiming it’s poised to pass the Senate. The bitcoin price surged to $106,000 per bitcoin on Sunday, climbing to a level not seen since early February and putting it in touching distance of its all-time high of almost $110,000. “Next week, the Senate will make history when we debate and pass the Genius Act that establishes the first ever pro-growth regulatory framework for payment stablecoins,” Republican senator Bill Hagerty from Tennessee, who sponsored the "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (Genius) Act, said in a statement. After Democrats raised eleventh hour concerns over the bill earlier this month that stemmed from U.S. president Donald Trump and his administration’s links to the crypto world, the bill has been redrafted to satisfy Democrats concerned with consumer protection and national security elements, according to a copy seen by Coindesk. “Let’s get this home, we are ready for adoption and to revolutionise the way this financial market works,” Bo Hines, executive director of the president’s council of advisors for digital assets, said during the Consensus crypto conference this week. “We’re actually having these conversations in real-time—I’m extremely confident in the fact that they will get it pushed through, we’d love to see it on the president’s desk. We’re well on our way to achieving the presidents’ goal. We are moving extremely quickly and effectively.” Crypto companies have long been calling for regulation, with Congress under president Joe Biden trying and failing to get rules for stablecoins and issuers passed into law. "The industry wants regulation," investor Ira Auerbach from Offchain Labs said in emailed comments. “The message from those I engage with is clear: Give us the rules of the game and watch innovation flourish.” In April, the JPMorgan analysts warned bitcoin’s burgeoning reputation as “digital gold" was under pressure as the bitcoin price failed to hold up in the face extreme market volatility triggered by Trump’s global trade war. The bitcoin price plummeted to around $75,000 per bitcoin, dropping over 30% from its all-time high of almost $110,000, as traders panicked over Trump’s tariffs but has since bounced back to over $100,000. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, triggering a wave of bullish bitcoin price ... More predictions. Bitcoin price bulls have remained upbeat, however, with Miller Value Partners chief investment officer and chairman, Bill Miller IV, telling CNBC the bitcoin price will keep climbing until it eclipses gold’s $20 trillion market capitalization. “Bitcoin’s back in the six-figures with a lot of room to go. If you compare its primary functional use case, a check and a balance on the lack of accountability in fiat unit creation, we still have a long way to go,” Miller said, predicting bitcoin’s “functional superiority” will push it to a price of $1 million per bitcoin. The gold price has hit its own record high this year as investors flee to the traditional safe haven, though it has dipped in recent weeks as the global trade war looks increasingly close to being resolved. With bitcoin’s market capitalization “back above $2 trillion and gold trading north of $3,200/oz, the two now stand side-by-side—as hedges against geopolitical turmoil and, increasingly, as high-conviction stores of value for the future,” Gadi Chait, head of investment at bitcoin and crypto custody company Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments.

Title: Bitcoin ETF allocations drop in Q1 – Is institutional confidence fading?

Will the sluggish Q2 basis trade affect ETF demand and cap BTC’s further rally? Several funds trimmed their Bitcoin [BTC] exposure in Q1 2025. Surprisingly, the state of Wisconsin exited its entire $321 million (100%, orange) in BlackRock iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), according to recent 13-F filings with the SEC. Source: Fintel (IBIT Q1 2025 allocation) The average portfolio allocation in IBIT dropped by 15.6% in the past quarter, data from Fintel showed. Additionally, Millennium Management LLC slashed its IBIT position by 41% to 17.6 million shares and closed its position in the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO). However, the fund added BTC-related exposure from Ark 21Shares and Grayscale Mini. Another hedge fund, Brevan Howard, reduced its IBIT holdings by 15.6%. The rebalancing and reduced exposure weren’t surprising given the market headwinds seen in Q1 2025 amid tariff wars. Over the same period, BTC dropped about 12% in the first three months of the year, up from $109K to $76K. Bitwise CIO, Matt Hougan, told Reuters that the cautious approach may be due to reduced basis trade — the price difference (premium) funds get when they buy spot BTC ETF and short CME BTC Futures. He said, “But that premium collapsed and reached its lowest around the end of March. So I’m not surprised to see hedge funds trim their holdings.” Source: Velo (BTC annualized basis trade) The premium was lucrative and hit a whopping 15%-20% annualized returns in late 2024, added Hougan. However, the basis trade sharply dropped below 4% in March, and may partly explain the reduced interest in the products. In Q2 2025, the premium surged to 9% but has slightly eased below 8% at the time of writing. A similar picture was painted by the demand for spot BTC ETFs. In February and March, the products saw over $4B in outflows. Source: Soso Value However, in April and the first half of May, they have seen $5.2 billion in inflows, a renewed demand that lifted BTC above $100K for the first time since February. From a market snapshot, current BTC levels reflected a bull mode seen before the November massive run-up, according to the CryptoQuant Bull Score Index reading of 80. Source: CryptoQuant More inflows into U.S. spot BTC ETFs could rally BTC higher. However, any faltering in demand for the products could likely lead to a local top for the crypto asset. It traded at $103K at press time. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: President Trump in One Word

Brilliant! President Donald Trump is absolutely brilliant! President Trump’s first international trip was not to a NATO ally, but to the Middle East, because that is where the money is. His trip began in Saudi Arabia, where the Saudis rolled out the lavender carpet for Trump because lavender is the symbol for generosity and Trump was wearing a matching lavender tie. The lavender represents the lavender wild flower blossoming in their desserts. Jesse Watters said in Saudi Arabia, it’s like rapper Lil’ Kim stated, “It’s about money, power and respect.” Jesse says, “That’s Trump’s language.” Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, ruler of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, broke protocol and met President Trump on the tarmac. President Trump gave a speech where he stated, A new generation of leaders is transcending the ancient conflicts, forging a future where the Middle East is defined by commerce, not chaos, where it exports technology, not terrorism, and where people of different nations, religions and creeds are building cities together, not bombing each other out of existence. [snip] I will never hesitate to wield American power if it’s necessary to defend the United States or to help defend our allies [pointing at the Saudi prince]. And there will be no mercy for any foe who tries to do us or them harm. Trump continued, saying, We have the biggest business leaders in the world here today. They are going to walk away with a lot of checks, a lot of this you are going to provide [looking at the crown prince]. And in the United States, it’s probably about two million jobs we are talking about. Watters reported that “executives from Coca-Cola, Citigroup, IBM, Delta, United, BlackRock, Google and Amazon, all in the desert with Trump… Trump came on a mission to spread money and peace.” The goal of this trip is to secure $1 trillion in investment in the U.S. with $600 billion already secured. After the meetings, the crown prince stated that a phase two will raise the agreements to $1 trillion. Brilliant! President Donald Trump is absolutely brilliant! Next, Trump was off to visit the nation of Qatar, situated on the border of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. Qatar is a semi-constitutional monarchy, where Emir Tamin bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, reigning since 2013, stated, “Together the U.S. and Qatar are feeding and fueling the world. This energy partnership alone is also valued at $1.5 trillion dollars. So, we have been ‘drill baby drilling’ for the last four years.” Looking at President Trump, the Emir continued and said, “And we are glad to have you back on board.” Of the meeting Watters quipped: “Qatar’s pumping oil and sending us the money. $1.2 trillion? Not a bad thing for a day in Doha.” Also, Jesse stated as a result of President Trump’s visit, Qatar put in “the biggest order for Boeing aircraft ever: 210. That’s $100 billion dollars.” But this trip was far more than just a trip about making trillions and billions of dollars for America. Jesse stated, “Trump did something that no U.S. president has done in 25 years. He met with Syria’s president, who used to be a bad guy, but now he’s our bad guy.” Trump shocked the world and lifted sanctions on Syria stating that he was giving them “a chance at greatness.” Jesse stated, “We are trying to peel Syria away from Russia and have them play nice with Israel, and peel Syria away from Iran. The less friends Iran has in the neighborhood, the better chance they sign the nuke deal.” Brilliant! President Donald Trump is absolutely brilliant! At the Qatar dinner President Trump shook hands with about 400 people and in a speech stated, I hope you can help me with the Iran situation, because it is a perilous situation, and we want to do the right thing. We want to do something that’s going to save, maybe millions of lives… We’re really helping the region. We are helping the world. We’re helping your country, and we are trying to get it done, if we can. We are trying to get it done. We have to move quickly, and I just hope Iran realizes what a great friend they have right here [Qatar]. Then Jesse stated, If we can sign a nuke deal with Iran, we can lower sanctions and bring their oil back on line. And when we get the Saudis to pump more oil, it will drive the price down, starve Russia’s war machine and force Putin to the negotiating table, and end the war in Ukraine. We are also selling these Arabs chips and weapons. And if Netanyahu settles the war in Gaza, the Gulf States will re-up the Abraham Accords and we can all do business with Israel. Everyone will be doing business together: Jews, Muslims, and the United States. Moscow will be pushed out of the region. China will be pushed out. And you will have a nice U.S.-sponsored trade alliance with an American security blanket, soft and cozy. Then we can pivot out of that desert back to the Western hemisphere and to the Far East, where the action is. His [Trump’s] main pitch this week is make money not war. Trade goods, not missiles. It’s a ‘Hail Mary,’ but it might work. Brilliant! President Donald Trump is absolutely brilliant! If all of this were not great enough, Trump then left for the United Arab Emirates, one of the richest countries of all, where he received a hero’s welcome in the palace at Abu Dhabi, UAE. Trump secured a $1.4 trillion business deal and they lit up their city in red, white, and blue to celebrate, but the best was yet to come. President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan awarded President Trump with his nation’s highest honor, the Order of Zayed: This is the United Arab Emirates’ highest civil decoration named after the first president of the UAE, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. The Order is a necklace made of pure gold, featuring an elaborate design that reflects luxury and appreciation. The main necklace bears the name ‘Zayed’, the founder of the United Arab Emirates, surrounded by decorative details that express the cultural and heritage character of the Emirates. What an honor for an American president. The world is watching in awe while this great free-world leader — leads — with unity, strong love and common-sense peace. How refreshing.
