View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.mgd773xcp Share article Print article Imagine investing in a premium Central Otago vineyard, or owning a slice of prime Wellington commercial property, all without needing millions in upfront capital. Through asset “tokenisation”, this is becoming a reality. Essentially, tokenisation converts physical and financial assets into digital records, called tokens, which are stored using blockchain technology. Some tokens represent ownership in the way digital property titles or share certificates do. Others might be used for customer loyalty schemes, digital event tickets to prevent scalping, or a means to make fast, low-cost international payments. The blockchain itself is basically a shared digital ledger distributed across computers, with transactions linked into a cryptographic chain. This decentralisation and transparency makes tokenisation both trustworthy and efficient. For decades, investing in real-world assets has meant navigating lawyers, banks, brokers, registries, mountains of paperwork, hefty transaction costs and prohibitive minimum spends. A $10 million commercial building, for example, might require investors to commit large proportions of the full amount, locking out all but the wealthiest buyers. Tokenisation changes this equation for both buyers and sellers. That same building could be split into 100 digital tokens, each representing 1% ownership worth $100,000. Like owning shares in a company, token holders benefit from rental income and property appreciation proportional to their stake. For sellers, it’s a way to raise capital by attracting many smaller investors rather than a few large ones. Digital assets are already woven into New Zealand’s economy. BlockchainNZ reports nearly NZ$8 billion of digital assets traded annually, with interest in digital assets becoming more common. But New Zealand stands at an important juncture. Existing financial regulations weren’t designed with tokenisation in mind, meaning progress is slow and complex. Industry bodies such as BlockchainNZ, the Banking Association and Payments NZ warn that even slight changes in a token’s features can alter its legal classification, making compliance confusing and expensive. Without clear rules, New Zealand risks losing billions to overseas markets offering greater regulatory certainty. Executives from multinational investment company BlackRock have compared tokenisation today to the internet in 1996, something poised for explosive growth. Accounting firm Deloitte projects US$4 trillion in global real estate will be tokenised by 2035, up from less than US$0.3 trillion in 2024. In November 2025, Australia introduced legislation for digital asset platforms, with Treasurer Jim Chalmers citing potential annual gains of A$24 billion. Dubai launched its first tokenised real estate platform in May 2025, projecting US$16 billion in value by 2033. J.P. Morgan Asset Management has launched MONY, a tokenised cash fund that invests in relatively safe short-term debt securities. BlockChainNZ held New Zealand’s first real estate tokenisation forum in Auckland in July 2025. Industry analysis suggests tokenising just 2–3% of the domestic property market could unlock over NZ$60 billion in transaction volume. New Zealand has genuine advantages: internet penetration exceeds 95% of the population; it is a member of the intergovernmental Digital Nations coalition; and it operates an established digital land-title system, ideal for real estate tokenisation. The regulatory conversation is underway, with the Financial Markets Authority releasing a discussion paper on tokenisation in September 2025. But the Banking Association has identified a critical gap: while existing laws are technology-neutral, they lack clarity for tokenised products. It recommends legislative reviews, controlled testing of tokenised financial products, and guidance for industry participants and consumers on regulation and compliance. Ultimately, New Zealand will need a cohesive framework that actively enables safe innovation. As one industry insider has argued: the rails for tokenisation are being laid now and if we don’t help build them, we’ll be forced to run on tracks designed by others. Tokenisation also brings serious challenges. Local financial laws were written for paper certificates and bank vaults, not digital tokens and blockchain networks. When an Auckland property developer tokenises an apartment building, or a Marlborough winery offers digital shares, which rules apply? Are these securities? Property titles? This uncertainty creates a compliance minefield. Technology risks compound these problems: cybersecurity vulnerabilities, digital key theft or loss, bugs or flaws in blockchain code that hackers can exploit, and malfunctions in the technology infrastructure can all cause irreversible losses. Energy-intensive blockchain systems raise environmental concerns, while weak consumer protections can expose users to fraud and scams. Tokenised assets can be highly volatile, with rapid price swings encouraging speculation and panic selling. Easy round-the-clock trading amplifies boom-and-bust cycles. When everyone can trade with a few clicks, panic can spread rapidly. The Financial Markets Authority has warned that market manipulation becomes easier across multiple unregulated platforms, money laundering may be harder to detect in cross-border transactions, and fraud (from fake tokenised assets to digital Ponzi schemes) can scale quickly. None of this means tokenisation should (or can) be avoided. The challenge for New Zealand is to keep up with this form of financial innovation, and to retain investment dollars that might otherwise migrate to other jurisdictions.

Title: Al Gore, Howard Lutnick and Christine Lagarde: What really happened at that Davos dinner

DAVOS, Switzerland – Al Gore didn’t like what Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had to say at a private dinner here at the World Economic Forum – but other guests were far more receptive, On The Money has learned. In fact, many of the Wall Street and government heavyweights in attendance agreed with the key points of his speech – including the fact that Europe can only grow its tech economy by eliminating a myriad of regulations and taxes that are hindering growth, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Gore, as The Post reported, was angry at Lutnick’s remarks that took aim at globalism, the ideology that puts concerns about the world before country – and how it has shafted the American middle class, hollowing out whole communities as factories are off-shored to cheap labor locales in Asia. When Lutnick stepped offstage, Gore walked up to him and said, “Boo” — like he was trying to scare him, a source told The Post. The former US veep has become one of the world’s leading globalists since leaving government and a hawk on the environment, pushing so-called net zero policies that many believe caused countries to slash energy production, sparking global inflation. During a Tuesday VIP dinner hosted by billionaire BlackRock boss Larry Fink, where several hundred people were invited, Lutnick delivered a speech that was at times fiercely critical of European allies on globalism (he said it had failed so much it is now “dead”). He also underscored that regulations and taxes have plagued the EU economy for years, hindering growth and technology advancements. Lutnick said if the EU reformed its tax code and administrative state, US tech giants would flock there. Those comments were met with many in the crowd nodding in agreement, according to people who were there. “No one walked out during his speech as some reported,” said a person close to Lutnick. One report suggested that Christine Lagarde, the European Central Bank president, bolted during the speech. But multiple sources say she left earlier because she was exhausted after a long day of meetings at the World Economic Forum. “That was just fake news,” the person close to Lutnick added.

Lutnick, meanwhile, also said if Europe wants to continue to push strict environmental standards – so-called net zero carbon emission policies by 2036 – it needs to think twice how it’s achieving those goals. At the moment, the EU continues to buy much of its oil from Russia and its windmill turbines from China, two of the world’s most oppressive regimes. Russia, of course, is being one of the bloodiest conflict on continent since World War II with is invasion of Ukraine. “There was no mass exodus or boos unless you count Al Gore,” the person close to Lutnick said.

Seems even a private invitation-only hoity-toity dinner is not exactly a classy event anymore. Even Congress is a politer place, given the harrumphing that followed several years ago, when a conservative legislator shouted 'you lied' to some politician who obviously lied.

Title: Elon Musk says it's 'highly likely' humans figure out how to reverse aging — but there's 'some benefit to death'

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Elon Musk says he thinks aging will one day be solved. The world's richest man said getting older was a "very solvable problem" during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum on Thursday. "When we figure out what causes aging, I think we'll find it's incredibly obvious. It's not a subtle thing," Musk said. "The reason I say it's not a subtle thing is because all the cells in your body, you know, pretty much age at the same rate. I've never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm ever in my life, so why is that? There must be a clock that is synchronizing across 35 trillion cells in your body," But Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said there would be some downsides to longer lives. "You know, there is some benefit to death, by the way. There's a reason why we don't actually have a longer lifespan, because if people do live for a very long time, I think there's some risk of an ossification of society. Of things getting locked in place," he said. "It may become stultifying. A lack of vibrancy, but that said, do I think we'll figure out ways to extend life and maybe even reverse aging? I think that's highly likely." Musk's surprise appearance was his first time onstage at the World Economic Forum, which he'd previously called "boring af." His conversation with Fink was wide-ranging, but didn't reveal much new information. Dozens of political and business leaders from across the globe gathered in Davos, Switzerland, this week to attend the World Economic Forum. The guest list included President Donald Trump, who made his case for the US to annex Greenland and the US's economic agenda during his address on Wednesday. Trump's push for Greenland has rattled European leaders and the US markets. It's also shocked Greenlanders, who have spoken against the annexation and the Trump administration. "We're not for sale," one resident said. Trump said the US would not use military force to take Greenland, but has leveraged tariffs against European countries in his campaign. The weeklong event ends on Friday with closing remarks from WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning. Jump to

Title: SpaceX Recruiting Four Wall Street Investment Banks For IPO, Report Says

ByZachary Folk, Forbes Staff. SpaceX is lining up four major Wall Street banks to lead its initial public offering, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, as the space tech company prepares for what could be one of the largest IPOs in history that investors hope could value the company at $1.5 trillion. The banks reportedly include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, according to the Financial Times, although more could get involved in the future. The group is currently selling existing shares to value the company at $800 billion, backing up a report of an insider share sale from Bloomberg last month valuing the company at that target. An investor previously told Forbes a 2026 IPO could value the rocket and satellite company at $1.5 trillion, and could potentially make CEO and majority shareholder Elon Musk a trillionaire. The banks declined to comment to FT, and SpaceX did not immediately return a request for comment from Forbes. The largest IPO in history took place in December 2019 when Saudi Aramco, the Saudi Arabian state-run oil company, went public with a portion of its company. The IPO raised about $29 billion from investors, valuing the petroleum company at a staggering $2.03 trillion. Musk spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday for the first time. Speaking to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the billionaire was bullish on the future of SpaceX, offering ambitious promises about using the company’s technology to reach the Moon and Mars. “SpaceX is about… advancing rocket technology to the point where we can extend life and consciousness beyond Earth to the Moon to Mars eventually to other star systems,” Musk said. The SpaceX CEO also expressed a desire to go to Mars himself, which he said was a six month trip away, although the planets only align every two years. “I’ve been asked a few times, ‘Do I want to, you know, die on Mars?’ And I'm like, ‘Yes, but just not on impact."

Title: Bitcoin liquidity just evaporated – and now this Wall Street feedback loop could wipe out gains

As major funds dump holdings, a thin order book means every dollar of selling is now significantly more destructive. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded three straight trading sessions of net outflows this week, totaling $1.58 billion. The pullback follows a brief stretch of positive follow-through, sandwiched between another three-day outflow streak from Jan. 7 – 9 that totaled $1.134 billion, or about $378 million a day leaving the category. Earlier in the month, flows flipped the other way, with more than $1 billion of net inflows over the first two trading days of January and $1.8 billion in inflows between Jan. 12 – 15, setting an early-month risk tone. The swing from fast inflows to a multi-session drawdown has renewed focus on ETF flow prints as a near-term positioning read rather than a passive backdrop. Bitcoin ETFs face record outflows amidst macroeconomic headwinds and dwindling demand. Large outflow days were led by the largest funds, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), arguing against the move being driven by smaller products or idiosyncratic reallocations. When the biggest vehicles lead redemptions, flows are easier to interpret as a broad pullback in real-money demand. They can also feed through to spot-market mechanics because creations and redemptions are ultimately serviced via the fund’s exposure to spot bitcoin, whether delivered in-kind or transacted via cash through the ETF plumbing. That linkage is why multiple negative sessions can matter more than a single print. In an inflow regime, ETFs can provide a steady marginal bid that helps rallies hold and reduces the amount of spot selling required to break key levels. In an outflow regime, that marginal bid thins. Redemptions can add supply at moments when discretionary buyers are already stepping back. The feedback loop becomes more visible when liquidity is lower because the same dollar of selling can move price more. A recent CryptoSlate market note reported order-book depth about 30% below 2025 highs. That is a setup where flow-driven selling can carry more price impact than it would in a deeper book. The macro backdrop adds context for why ETF flows became a “watch this” input in early January. The sharp repricing in Treasurys tied to tariff-related geopolitical uncertainty, with the 10-year yield referenced around the mid-4% range during the move. That mix has tended to pressure high-beta risk exposures when rates volatility rises. Recent crypto drawdowns can be framed alongside a broader risk-off tape, linking Bitcoin’s direction to cross-asset sentiment rather than crypto-specific catalysts alone. In that environment, ETF redemptions become one of the cleaner observable footprints of de-risking. They show what investors are doing in a regulated wrapper that many allocators use for tactical exposure. Positioning around late-January options levels provides another lens for how flows can interact with price. Call open interest clustered around $100,000 into late-January expiries. That keeps attention on whether spot can hold above nearby levels or gets pulled back toward strikes where positioning is dense. If spot hovers below a large call cluster while ETF flows remain negative, rallies can face two headwinds at once: fewer fresh ETF bids and a derivatives landscape where traders may monetize upside attempts rather than chase them. If flows turn and spot holds firm, the same concentration can act as a magnet above price, particularly if dealers’ hedging needs shift as spot moves through strikes. Wall Street's increased Bitcoin ETF shares in Q4 2025 highlight strategic buying during price slides, hinting at a more complex market play. Using the Jan. 7–9 run rate as a simple scenario unit helps translate the story into forward-looking terms without treating flows as destiny. What investors watch next is less about any single number and more about persistence and price reaction. One check is whether redemptions stay concentrated in IBIT and FBTC or broaden across the complex, according to Barron’s coverage of the largest products’ role in major outflow sessions. Another is whether Bitcoin begins to absorb negative flow days without sharp downside follow-through. That can imply sellers are being met with bids away from the ETF channel. If the pattern becomes “outflows and fast declines,” that points to weak spot demand, with lower depth amplifying moves. That is consistent with the microstructure framing in the CryptoSlate note linked above. Rates sensitivity remains a parallel check because yield spikes tied to macro headlines have coincided with risk reduction across assets, according to MarketWatch’s reporting on the Treasury selloff tied to tariff-related uncertainty. There is also a practical caveat: ETF flows can be tactical and can reverse quickly. That includes rebalancing, tax positioning, or basis-driven strategies that do not reflect a long-term view. The market is operating under macro-first constraints, which can push allocators to adjust exposure rapidly as rates move. That is why streak length, the identity of the funds driving the moves, and the market’s ability to hold levels during negative prints tend to carry more information than any one day’s total. European leaders eye U.S. Treasurys as Greenland leverage, risking a one-month yield shock on Americans.

Advisors are building caps, rebalancing rules, and drawdown math while crypto execs sell regret avoidance as the new thesis. When your bank account becomes a tool of geopolitical coercion, the "rupture" at Davos changes everything you know about financial safety. NYSE is moving to "continuous" settlement, leaving traditional banking hours in the dust forever.

Tesla will probably sell its Optimus robots to the public by the end of next year, according to chief executive Elon Musk, who has said the carmaker’s fortunes will be increasingly dependent on humanoid machines. The company is already using some of the robots to do simple tasks in its factory, Mr Musk said Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He predicted Optimus would be “doing more complex tasks” by the end of 2026. Sales to the public will begin when Tesla is “confident that it’s very high reliability, very high safety, and the range of functionality is also very high”, Mr Musk said. The comments offer a more concrete timeline for the future business line, which Mr Musk sees as a key focus for Tesla going forward, alongside artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles. The automaker’s core business of selling cars has suffered from a stale product lineup and the loss of EV incentives in the US, leading to two consecutive years of declining deliveries. While Mr Musk regularly talks up the potential of Optimus, he has been relatively vague about production timelines and targets. During a January 2025 earnings call, he said his “very rough guess” was that Tesla would start delivering Optimus robots to other companies in the second half of 2026. [ Michael O’Leary takes aim at ‘liar’ Donald Trump and ‘idiot’ Elon MuskOpens in new window ] Earlier this week, Mr Musk cautioned that initial production of Optimus and Tesla’s newest vehicle, the Cybercab, will be “agonizingly slow.” Tesla shares rose 1.7 per cent in late morning trading in New York. Mr Musk’s appearance in Davos came as a surprise after the world’s richest man was confirmed as a last-minute addition to Thursday’s schedule. He’d previously criticised the forum, calling the annual gathering of the world’s elite “boring” and slammed the WEF as a body that’s “increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don’t want”. He touched on a variety of topics in his conversation with BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, including data centres in space, robotaxis and power generation bottlenecks. Meanwhile, rocket maker SpaceX is lining up investment bankers at four Wall Street firms for leading roles on a blockbuster initial public offering, expected to be one of the largest new listings ever. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are being lined up for senior roles leading the IPO, according to people familiar with the matter. SpaceX executives have held meetings with bankers in recent weeks as the company prepares for an IPO as soon as this year. The group is currently conducting a sale of existing shares that would value it at around $800 billion (€681 billion). Other banks are also likely to land roles on the listing, the people said, cautioning that no final decisions had been taken and the situation could yet change. A SpaceX IPO would seek to raise tens of billions of dollars, probably surpassing Saudi Aramco’s $29 billion raise in 2019 to become the largest ever public listing. - Bloomberg From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Elon Musk warns the U.S. could soon be producing more chips than we can turn on. And China doesn’t have the same issue

Elon Musk warned the biggest issue hampering AI advancement in the United States is a problem Chinese competitors don’t have. In a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said AI chip production is increasing exponentially, but electrical power is insufficient, hampering the efficiency of AI data centers in training and deploying AI models. “I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said. “It’s clear that we’re very soon—maybe even later this year—we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on.” The U.S. has been grappling with an outdated grid system, the result of decades of underinvestment and an aging infrastructure. As tech companies increasingly rely on grid operators for electrical power, reliability issues and production limitations have threatened the speed of AI implementation, raising investor concerns of an AI bubble and fueling the belief that the U.S. has already lost the battle with Chinese tech. Two massive data centers in Nvidia’s Santa Clara, Calif., hometown may sit empty for years waiting for electricity to power them, according to energy experts. Meanwhile, the massive increase in demand, combined with the need for updated infrastructure, have driven up electricity bills for the average American. Earlier this month, the Trump administration and 13 bipartisan governors mounted pressure on operators of the country’s largest grid, PJM Interconnection, to boost power supply, as well as hold an auction for tech firms to make offers on 15-year contracts to build power plants, which would transfer the cost of electricity away from consumers and to data center operators. “We know that with the demands of AI and the power and the productivity that comes with that, it’s going to transform every job and every company and every industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters last week. “But we need to be able to power that in the race that we are in against China.” During his remarks at the gathering in Davos on Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged tech companies to build their own nuclear plants amid the AI push, which he claimed the administration would approve in just three weeks—although these historically take years to approve. Just as many AI investors fear, China is already well ahead of the U.S. when it comes to production capacity, and the country isn’t saddled with the same limitations as the U.S., Musk said at Davos. China is primarily reliant on solar power, seen as a less expensive alternative to nuclear power, with quicker deployment and fewer safety risks. “China’s growth in electricity is tremendous,” he said. According to the Global Energy Monitor’s Global Solar Power Tracker, China has nearly four times the amount of operational electricity from solar power than the U.S. Including potential power, China is expected to have 1,118,442 MWac, or electrical power output, from solar energy compared with the U.S.’s 237,947 MWac. “Solar is by far the biggest source of energy,” Musk said. Musk claimed powering the U.S. with solar energy would require very little space, only a 100-mile-by-100-mile square of solar fields needed to power the entire country. But U.S. policies have thwarted efforts to harness and deploy solar power. Despite urging grid operators to take action to increase production capacity, the Trump administration has opposed a pivot to solar energy, stripping subsidies for renewable energy sources it claimed “compromises our electric grid.” The White House did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Tariffs on solar equipment from Asia took effect in May, with import taxes as lofty as 3,500%, following a U.S. International Trade Commission determination that imports of solar modules and cells from Southeast Asian producers in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia were detrimental to U.S. manufacturers. “Unfortunately, in the U.S., the tariff barriers for solar are extremely high,” Musk said. “And that makes the economics of deploying solar artificially high.”

The round was led by Bain Capital’s crypto division and Distributed Global. The funds of numerous prominent crypto investors also participated, including Katie Haun’s Haun Ventures and Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. Superstate builds infrastructure that moves traditional assets, like stocks and government securities, onto blockchain networks including Ethereum and Solana. In the last year, that trend has exploded from a curiosity on Wall Street to a near-standard practice. Industry titan BlackRock’s once-experimental BUIDL fund—a tokenized money market fund— debuted on Ethereum in 2024. It has since grown by several billion dollars and expanded to numerous other blockchains. Traditional finance mainstays have followed suit. Earlier this week, the New York Stock Exchange unveiled an on-chain platform it plans to soon use to facilitate the trading of tokenized stocks and ETFs. SuperState has been a go-to service for companies seeking to bring their assets on-chain—particularly those with crypto ties. It recently helped two Nasdaq-traded firms, Galaxy Digital and Solana Company, tokenize shares. Robert Leshner, Superstate’s CEO, recently told Decrypt he anticipates tokenized stocks will become particularly popular with retail investors once they realize they take those otherwise idle assets into crypto’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, and use them as collateral for all manner of loans. “You can take that money and buy a car or buy a house and leave the system entirely with it,” Leshner said at the time. “I think there’s going to be a lot of really happy investors.” Crypto-native companies have also jumped into tokenized stocks in recent months, seeking to compete with traditional finance firms over market share of the growing trend. Last month, Coinbase debuted a new product, Coinbase Tokenize, which will eventually allow customers to buy and sell on-chain stocks, and also enable institutions to tokenize assets themselves. A report out Wednesday from BlackRock emphasized that as crypto and traditional finance become increasingly intertwined, the financial opportunities within that intersection are becoming increasingly lucrative—and the race to capture that market, more competitive. “You have traditional securities and assets that are looking to be tokenized, and frankly, you have [digital] assets that [...] are making their way into the more traditional financial systems,” Jay Jacobs, the author of the BlackRock report, told Decrypt. “We believe in that convergence that does seem to be accelerating.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2026 Decrypt Media, Inc.

ByMartina Di Licosa, Forbes Staff. Musk shared his hopes of dying on Mars, rehashed his futuristic vision for humanity, and joked about political tensions over U.S interest in Greenland and Venezuela during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos Thursday Morning, a surprise appearance that came after years of publicly disparaging the conference. “I’ve been asked a few times, do you want to die on Mars?” Musk shared during his conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, “And I’m like, yes, but just not on impact,” he added, garnering laughs from the crowd. Musk opened the talk by joking, “I heard about the formation of the peace summit, and I was like, ‘Is that P-I-E-C?’ … A little piece of Greenland, a little piece of Venezuela…all we want is a piece.” Fink focused on Musk’s space and AI-related ventures, leading Musk to reiterate his vision for building advanced humanoid robots, which he said “everyone on earth” is going to have When asked if he had any last words to share, Musk said, “I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future.” Musk’s inclusion in the Davos speaker roster was a last-minute surprise that came a day after President Trump’s speech. “There’s so many myths around Elon Musk,” said Fink towards the end of the conversation, publicly defending him, “He’s a great friend…and I’m totally inspired by what he has done.” Shortly before, Fink told the crowd he wanted to “humanize” Musk, garnering loud laughs. 850 of the world’s top CEOs and 400 top political leaders, including close to 65 heads of state and six G7 leaders, are attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, according to the organization. Musk joins a long list of notable speakers which, in recent days, has included President Donald Trump, President Macron of France, and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. Musk has been critical of the World Economic Forum for years. In 2023, he responded to a video of the event’s opening ceremony posted to Twitter with “How is WEF/Davos even a thing?” adding, “Are they trying to be the boss of Earth!?” He went on to compare the summit to message board 4chan, which is known for being a platform for extremist points of view, joking, “There should be a game show: “4Chan or Davos, who said it?” The year prior, Musk publicly announced that he had declined an invitation to attend the conference, calling it “boring af.” One reason for his past distaste for the yearly summit could be its viewpoint on overpopulation, which the World Economic Forum’s official X account has called “a global challenge.” Musk, who has 14 children and is an advocate for boosting world population, responded to that post with, “Population collapse is an existential problem for humanity, not overpopulation!” This year, he has yet to post about Davos to his X profile.

Title: Elon Musk says at Davos that robots will one day outnumber people

Watch CBS News Updated on: January 22, 2026 / 2:18 PM EST / CBS News Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans. Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as "increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want." Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes "sustainable abundance" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis. "With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all," Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. "People often talk about solving global poverty — how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics." Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are "ubiquitous," which he said would unleash "an explosion in the global economy." "My prediction is there will be more robots than people," he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens. Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing "simple tasks in the factory." "By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public," Musk added. "That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability — you can basically ask it to do anything you like." The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing. Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving. "I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.," he told Fink. "And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully."

Title: Ethereum Holds $3,000 as Whales Accumulate: Key Resistance and Support Levels to Watch

Time Published: 2026-01-22T16:00:35Z
Full Content:
Ethereum (ETH) has stabilized above the $3,000 mark after a sharp sell-off earlier this week, as large holders increased their exposure during the dip. The recovery follows a volatile period in which ETH briefly fell below key technical levels, triggering liquidations and renewed caution across the broader crypto market. On January 22, Ethereum was trading around $3,003, up roughly 1.3% over 24 hours. The rebound came after ETH dropped nearly 13% between January 19 and 21, touching the $2,900 area for the first time in four weeks. That decline coincided with heightened macro uncertainty, ETF outflows, and the liquidation of over $480 million in bullish leveraged positions. On-chain data shows that large Ethereum holders accumulated aggressively during the recent downturn. Whale balances increased by roughly 290,000 ETH over a two-day period, representing purchases worth close to $360 million at current prices. This behavior suggests that some long-term investors view the recent pullback as a buying opportunity. However, other indicators point to a more cautious stance among experienced traders. The smart money index remains below its signal line, a level that has historically been crossed ahead of stronger upside moves. In previous instances, such confirmations preceded double-digit gains, but no such signal has emerged so far. Derivatives data support this wait-and-see approach. ETH perpetual futures funding rates briefly turned negative, indicating reduced confidence among leveraged traders. Options markets have also shown increased demand for downside protection after repeated rejections near the $3,400 level over the past two months. From a technical perspective, Ethereum is trading within a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. Momentum indicators show a bullish divergence, the relative strength index has formed higher lows while the price made lower lows between November and mid-January. This pattern suggests that selling pressure may be weakening, though confirmation is still lacking. The immediate level to watch on the upside is $3,050, a former support zone that ETH lost during the recent sell-off. A sustained daily close above this level would indicate short-term stabilization. Above that, the $3,146–$3,164 range represents a dense supply zone, where approximately 3.4 million ETH have been accumulated. This area is expected to act as a strong resistance.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/22/2026 7:31:29 AM PST by Tench_Coxe I’m at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland where I saw Chrystia Freeland, the disgraced former MP and cabinet minister. Actually, I think she saw me first and tried to hide from my sight.So I decided to ask her some questions.Now, if I had been in Canada, she would have had me arrested. That’s what she did to our reporter, David Menzies. And of course, she had no compunction about seizing bank accounts from hundreds of her political enemies during the trucker protest. (snip)I also asked her about her accepting a job working for the Ukrainian government, while also working for the Canadian government. Isn’t that an obvious conflict of interest?Needless to say, she was absolutely vicious, saying that anyone who would dare question her must be working for Vladimir Putin. I’m serious, she said that!

Thursday, 22 Jan 2026 FILE PHOTO: Elon Musk attends the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 19, 2025. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo Jan 22 (Reuters) - Elon Musk ‌will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos for ‌the first time on Thursday, marking a striking reversal for ‌the billionaire who has publicly criticized the annual gathering of political and business elites. The world's richest person will join BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on a panel ‍scheduled for 1530 GMT, according to the ‍latest World Economic Forum program. Musk's ‌appearance at Davos comes as he continues to play a key ‍role ​in several global debates, including SpaceX's supply of satellite internet to conflict zones and public criticism over sexualized images ⁠generated by Grok, a chatbot developed by his ‌AI startup xAI. In the past few years, Musk has been one of the ⁠WEF's most ‍prominent critics, regularly criticizing the annual Davos gathering as elitist, unaccountable and disconnected from ordinary people. Musk has repeatedly mocked Davos on his social media ‍platform X, calling it "boring" and saying ‌the WEF is "an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want." The Tesla CEO's status as an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump has elevated his political clout, giving him an unusual degree of influence over policy discussions spanning technology, defense and global communications. Several of Musk's companies are of direct interest to governments, ‌including SpaceX, a major U.S. defense contractor whose Starlink network operates in conflict zones, and X, the social media platform he controls, where changes to ​moderation policies have drawn criticism over misinformation and hate speech.

Title: Bitcoin Price Not Following ‘Digital Gold’ Narrative Amid Greenland Tensions
URL: https://gizmodo.com/bitcoin-price-not-following-digital-gold-narrative-amid-greenland-tensions-2000712910
Time Published: 2026-01-22T14:30:42Z
Full Content:
Reading time 3 minutes While the original Bitcoin whitepaper mostly focused on the crypto network as a peer-to-peer digital cash system for decentralized payments, the narrative around the worldâs largest and most valuable crypto asset has evolved into more of a store of value rather than a medium of exchange over the past decade. This is where the âdigital goldâ nickname originated, as some believe that bitcoin can act as an apolitical base money for the digital age with a monetary policy that was âset in stoneâ when the network first launched all the way back in 2009. As Larry Fink, the CEO of financial titan BlackRock, explained just last month, âBitcoin is an asset of fear . . . The long-term fundamental reason you own [bitcoin] is because of debasement.â While some view this digital gold narrative as a pivot from Bitcoinâs original design, the reality is that the systemâs creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was concerned with removing the trust required in central banks to not debase the currency in some of his earliest writings. This may all sound great in theory, but the reality is that bitcoin has routinely been unable to act like its analog sibling in times of global economic turmoil. For example, the bitcoin price suffered one of the worst crashes in its history when COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic in early March 2020. Over the past week, bitcoin has also dropped roughly 10% amid increasing tensions between the United States and Europe over control of Greenland and the selloff in the Japanese bond market. Last October, there was also a massive crash in the greater crypto market, including $16 billion in liquidations on leveraged positions, amid increased trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Of course, many of the liquidated positions were in crypto assets that are much more speculative and less credible than bitcoin. Meanwhile, gold is up roughly 5% over the past week. In fact, gold massively outperformed bitcoin in 2025, despite the precious metal supposedly being the less speculative and volatile asset of the two. While bitcoin has seen increased institutional adoption from the likes of Ivy League university endowments, nation states, and the largest asset manager in the world, the reality is that central banks, most notably China, still prefer real gold over its digital alternative. That said, the functional utility of bitcoin as something like digital gold still exists, as was shown by the recent flight from crypto exchanges in Iran to the base Bitcoin network. In addition to the local populations, there has been extensive reporting on nation-states like Iran and Venezuela using crypto to avoid economic sanctions imposed by the United States. While much of this activity is being usurped by stablecoins, these dollar-pegged tokens can also be easily frozen by their centralized issuers. Of course, the current inability of bitcoin to act as a safe-haven asset does not mean it is destined to fail to achieve its long-term goals. After bitcoin crashed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it went on to enjoy a 4,000% price rise to the new all-time high of around $125,000 hit last year. The price has since settled back down in the $90,000 area, and itâs unclear if the usual four-year cycles from the past will continue. The fact that it still moves like a tech stock in times of increased economic tension is a sign that it is still early days for bitcoin, despite its market cap now being measured in the trillions of dollars. However, it will eventually need to start acting more like the digital gold it’s touted to be if it wants to stand the test of time and become the basis of a new, digital monetary standard for the 21st century.

Crypto is now said to account for roughly 20% of the familyâs $6.8 billion fortune. Given that Bitcoin was created to circumvent traditional finance, what are we even doing here? Situations that expose centralization in supposedly decentralized exchanges have become par for the course in crypto. She warned of "extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria, and a collapse in confidence." Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas have enacted laws aimed at creating their own reserves. Turns out people might like to circumvent centralized financial infrastructure in times of political upheaval. Â©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC. All rights reserved.

Musk has repeatedly mocked Davos on his social media platform X, calling it “boring” and saying the WEF is “an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don’t want.” The Tesla CEO’s status as an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump has elevated his political clout, giving him an unusual degree of influence over policy discussions spanning technology, defense and global communications. Several of Musk’s companies are of direct interest to governments, including SpaceX, a major U.S. defense contractor whose Starlink network operates in conflict zones, and X, the social media platform he controls, where changes to moderation policies have drawn criticism over misinformation and hate speech. (Reporting by Akash Sriram and Chandni Shah in Bengaluru; Editing by Alex Richardson and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Il 22 gennaio (Reuters) - Elon Musk parteciperà al World Economic Forum di Davos per la prima volta giovedì, segnando una sorprendente inversione di tendenza per il miliardario che ha pubblicamente criticato il raduno annuale delle élite politiche e commerciali. La persona più ricca del mondo si unirà all’amministratore delegato di BlackRock Larry Fink in un panel previsto per le 1530 GMT, secondo l’ultimo programma del World Economic Forum. L’apparizione di Musk a Davos arriva mentre continua a giocare un ruolo chiave in diversi dibattiti globali, tra cui la fornitura di Internet via satellite da parte di SpaceX alle zone di conflitto e le critiche pubbliche sulle immagini sessualizzate generate da Grok, un chatbot sviluppato dalla sua startup di intelligenza artificiale xAI. Negli ultimi anni, Musk è stato uno dei critici più importanti del WEF, criticando regolarmente il raduno annuale di Davos come elitario, non responsabile e disconnesso dalla gente comune. Musk ha ripetutamente deriso Davos sulla sua piattaforma di social media X, definendolo “noioso” e affermando che il WEF è “un governo mondiale non eletto che il popolo non ha mai chiesto e non vuole”. Lo status di alleato del Presidente degli Stati Uniti Donald Trump dell’amministratore delegato di Tesla ha elevato il suo peso politico, dandogli un insolito grado di influenza sulle discussioni politiche che riguardano la tecnologia, la difesa e le comunicazioni globali. Diverse aziende di Musk sono di interesse diretto per i governi, tra cui SpaceX, un importante appaltatore della difesa statunitense la cui rete Starlink opera in zone di conflitto, e X, la piattaforma di social media da lui controllata, dove le modifiche alle politiche di moderazione hanno attirato critiche per la disinformazione e l’incitamento all’odio.

Jensen Huang says AI and robotics offer a big opportunity When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has asserted that humanity is seeing one of the biggest revolutions in human history from AI and robotics. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Huang ruled out fears of an AI bubble by stating artificial intelligence reaches all sectors – it's not just a term used in tech businesses. "The spot price of rentals is going up. Not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs," Huang argued in an interview with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink (via The Register), referring to the sheer reach of AI. Artificial intelligence has already been seen to require ongoing investment across data centers, but energy infrastructure is also under higher-than-ever pressure and demand for skilled professionals is equally as high. Also speaking at Davos, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also ruled out an impending AI bubble, noting, "I think a telltale sign of if it's a bubble would be if all we’re talking about were the tech firms," he said, remarking AI's global and cross-industry reach. We're also seeing AI evolve into physical devices, with Huang stating that robotics provide a "once-in-a-generation" opportunity for European manufacturing. Huang also made positive remarks on AI's effects on the labor market – he believes that "tradecrafts" will be vital to the buildout of data centers and infrastructure. "This is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history and that's going to create a lot of jobs," he said. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Nadella's opinion differed, focusing instead on jobs affected by AI. He compared today's landscape to previous workforce trends, where prospective employees would have to prove competency across various office software like Word and Excel. AI upskilling is just the next phase of that. In short, it's clear that both leaders see AI and robotics drastically changing the way we see work, but quite how that translates into job creation or job losses is yet to be seen.

Title: Nvidia CEO expects AI to create more jobs for construction workers, electricians, plumbers, and many others

But human-AI collaboration will likely lift certain industries to new levels. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Artificial intelligence is expected to reshape the labor market by eliminating white-collar positions that do not require a lot of creativity or experience, but at the same time increase demand for blue-collar employees like construction workers, electricians, or plumbers, as AI infrastructure requires a massive built-out, according to Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia. That build-out spans many industries, so while some roles will vanish, others will flourish, reports Bloomberg. "This is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history that is going to create a lot of jobs," Huang said in a conversation with Laurence D. Fink, the head of BlackRock, at the World Economic Forum 2026. "We are going to have plumbers, electricians, construction and steel workers, network technicians, and people who install and fit out the equipment. In the United States we are seeing quite a significant boom in [these areas]: salaries have gone up, nearly doubled. We are talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building uh chip factories or computer factories or AI factories. We have a great shortage in that." However, the benefits of AI-driven growth are unevenly distributed across the labor market. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei once warned that AI-enabled automation could trigger a 'white-collar bloodbath,' which could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level office jobs. He noted that Anthropic's Claude AI has become particularly great at coding tasks, which could displace junior software developers and even erode portions of more senior software engineering work. Still, even Amodei believes the long-term gains from AI will outweigh the damage. Nonetheless, he warns that large-scale unemployment or underemployment remains a serious risk over the next five years. By contrast, Huang argues that some professions that can greatly benefit from both AI and human touch will actually increase demand for certain specialists, which will lift certain industries to new heights. "Ten years ago, one of the first professions that everybody thought was going to get wiped out was radiology," Huang noted. "The reason for that was that the first thing AI [gpy] superhuman in capability was computer vision, and one of the largest applications of computer vision is studying scans by radiologists. Well, 10 years later, it is true that AI has now completely permeated and diffused into every aspect of radiology. It is true that radiologists use AI to study scans. […] However, […] the number of radiologists have gone up. Is that because a lack of trust of or is that because the human interaction with the results of AI is a better outcome? […] The fact that they are able to study scans now infinitely fast allows them to spend more time with patients diagnosing their disease, interacting with the patients, interacting with other clinicians. […] As a result of that, the number of patients that the hospital can see has gone up, [driving revenues of hospitals]." In short, while AI can be a disaster for certain industries and professions, its impact on the quality of life will likely be comparable to the impact of electricity, automobiles, computers, broadband Internet, and telecommunications, all of which created many more professions and employment opportunities than they eliminated. However, one should note that the impact of AI can be compared to the cumulative impact of the aforementioned technologies combined in a very short time, so making exact predictions here is hardly a good business.

Title: Al Gore Heckles Trump Admin's Howard Lutnick at World Economic Forum Event

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was heckled by former Vice President Al Gore during a World Economic Forum event in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, according to news coverage. Gore booed Lutnick while the Commerce secretary was giving a speech at an invite-only dinner event hosted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Mediaite reported on Wednesday. The report comes after Lutnick criticized Europe during his remarks, which prompted European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde to suddenly leave the dinner event, multiple outlets reported. “I sat and listened to his remarks,” Gore said Wednesday in a statement provided to Mediaite. “I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane.” “And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others,” Gore continued. The WEF and a representative for Gore each did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. “During Secretary Lutnick’s three-minute speech, no one left hastily,” a Commerce Department representative told the DCNF in a statement on Wednesday. “Only one person booed, and it was Al Gore.” Moreover, Fox Business Network Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino wrote in a Wednesday X post that he was told by a “reliable” anonymous source that “at the dinner Lagarde walked out BEFORE [Lutnick’s] speech and was tired like everyone is at Davos.” Lutnick claimed in an op-ed published by the Financial Times on Tuesday that the Trump administration was “not going to Davos to uphold the status quo,” but instead was going “to confront it head-on.” “For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world,” Lutnick wrote. “Some of our past leaders believed the lies that offshoring was necessary, borders were not, and our national interest needed to submit to global lower cost of labour for the common good. That approach failed the US, crushed American workers and ripped apart most of the rest of the world as well. It destroyed industries, weakened supply chains and left working people in most western countries behind.” Gore suggested Wednesday that U.S. government policy should promote “regenerative agriculture” during a panel discussion at the WEF. Gore added that the U.S. needs “policies that [are] in recognition of the fact that governments around the world typically do subsidize farming, but don’t subsidize them in ways that incentivize them to go in the wrong direction, but incentivize them to go in the right direction.” Gore, the failed 2000 Democratic presidential nominee, is the cofounder and chairman of Generation Investment Management, and also the founder and chairman of The Climate Reality Project, a nonprofit organization which aims to combat the “climate crisis,” according to a biography on his website.

Title: Jensen Huang talks AI's insatiable appetite for GPUs at the World Economic Forum: 'spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two generation old GPUs'

AI is all-consuming. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Jensen Huang has well and truly escaped gaming obscurity these days. The Nvidia CEO just took the stage at the World Economic Forum to talk about AI demand, bubbles, and the impact that artificial intelligence has on the job market now and into the future. Of course, being the man in charge of shipping billions of dollars of AI chips, he has a particularly positive take on the lot. Chatting to Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, who called Nvidia 'nuh-vidia' throughout the conversation, Huang had a few things to say about his booming business. "One good test on the AI bubble is to recognize that Nvidia now has now millions of Nvidia GPUs in the cloud. We're in every cloud. You know. We're used everywhere. "And if you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it's so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two generation old GPUs. The spot price of rentals are going up, and the reason for that is because the number of AI companies that are being created, the number of companies shifting their R&D budget." Nvidia's datacentre business, the topic of conversation here, has soared to many times its gaming revenue in recent years. It hit a record $51.2 billion through August to September last year. Gaming revenue during the same period was $4.3 billion. Though the demand for datacentre GPUs, such as upcoming Rubin chips, B100/200, and older chips like the H100/H200, do have a knock-on effect in gaming GPUs. Just look to the price of the RTX 5090—a more than capable card for smaller-scale AI deployment—which launched at $1,999 and is now selling for around $4,000+. Capacity for production is one factor in all of this, as when AI comes knocking for chips, be those GPUs or memory, there's only so much readily available at any one time. That's why we're seeing RAM prices skyrocket: AI demand outstrips supply and datacenter buildout is more valuable than availability for consumers. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In Huang's words, the fervour to buy more AI chips is "the largest infrastructure build out in human history." "That's going to create a lot of jobs," he says, citing skilled labor requirements for building out massive datacenters and increasing energy output to meet their demands. The impact of AI on the job market was one of the main topics of discussion through the talk. Huang, in no uncertain terms, suggested that AI will create a labour shortage, rather than take jobs from humans. He suggests one way to understand his way of thinking is to look beyond the tasks required to do a job and instead determining the purpose of a job. "Now, the easiest way to think about whether what is the impact of AI on a particular job is to understand what is the purpose of the job and what is the task of the job," Huang says. "If you just put a camera on the two of us and just watched us, you would probably think the two of us are typists, because I spend all of my time typing and and so if AI could automate so much word prediction and help us type, then we would be out of jobs. But obviously that's not our purpose. And so the question is, what is the purpose of your job? In the case of radiologists and nurses, it's to care for people, and that purpose is enhanced and made more productive because the task has been automated." I do think there are instances where this is not the case. When AI is entirely replacing the purpose of someone's job—or intrinsically changing it or shifting it further away—such as generative AI and artists or musicians, or closer to home, when AI tools are used to summarise news stories. When the AI is not owned or run by those professions affected by its use, it's not as often beneficial. Jobs may be created in some sectors, but similarly, jobs may move from other sectors entirely as it permeates into the wider market. Though Huang aims to keep things positive about AI, as you would expect from a CEO in his position signing off with a request for people to "get involved". And if anything is clear from this talk, according to these two, it wouldn't appear there's signs of slowing for the rapid buildout of AI. If anything, they suggest the large-scale investment in AI is only just beginning. 1. Best overall: AMD Radeon RX 9070 2. Best value: AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 GB 3. Best budget: Intel Arc B570 4.

Title: Is It Ethereum? BlackRock CEO Wants ‘One Blockchain’ For Tokenization
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-one-blockchain-blackrock-ceo/
Time Published: 2026-01-22T11:30:33Z
Full Content:
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink used the World Economic Forum stage to argue that tokenization needs to move from pilot programs to market plumbing and suggested that a shared blockchain standard could cut costs and even “reduce corruption,” a framing that immediately reignited the “which chain?” debate across crypto and specifically inside the Ethereum community. Fink didn’t name a network. But the combination of BlackRock’s onchain product footprint and its own research positioning makes Ethereum the most natural candidate for the “one common blockchain” he alluded to, even if he kept it implicit. Fink’s remarks, delivered in the language of infrastructure rather than crypto evangelism, leaned heavily on the operational case for digitized assets and interoperable settlement rails. “I think the movement towards tokenization, decimalization is necessary. It’s ironic that we see two emerging countries leading the world in the tokenization and digitization of their currency, that’s Brazil and India. I think we need to move very rapidly to doing that.” He then pushed the argument beyond payments and into capital markets: “We would be reducing fees, we would do more democratization by reducing more fees if we had all investments on a tokenized platform that can move from a tokenized money market fund to equities and bonds and back and forth.” The most provocative line was his call for standardization and the trade-off he implied comes with it. “[If] we have one common blockchain, we could reduce corruption. So I would argue that, yes, we have more dependencies on maybe one blockchain, which we could all talk about, but that being said, the activities are probably processed and more secure than ever before.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told the World Economic Forum he thinks the movement toward tokenization and digitization is necessary. We need to move very rapidly to doing that. With one common blockchain, we can reduce corruption. The “one common blockchain” Larry Fink referenced… https://t.co/sMMcg4oyN1 pic.twitter.com/VhRvuwCx00 — Ethereum Daily (@ETH_Daily) January 22, 2026 In the abstract, “one common blockchain” could be read as a generic appeal for shared rails. In practice, BlackRock’s public-market crypto lineup and its tokenization work have concentrated around Bitcoin and Ethereum. On the ETF side, BlackRock’s flagship US spot products track bitcoin and ether — iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) — with ETHA launching in 2024 and now sitting in the center of the firm’s public-facing Ethereum exposure. On the tokenization side, BlackRock’s first tokenized fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), debuted on Ethereum via Securitize in March 2024, making Ethereum the original issuance network for what has become one of the market’s most closely watched institutional RWAs. While BUIDL has expanded across multiple networks over time, the key point for Fink’s “common blockchain” framing is that Ethereum has been BlackRock’s default starting point for public-chain issuance, a meaningful signal in a market where “standards” tend to follow whoever already has the deepest liquidity, the broadest integration surface, and the most conservative counterparties. The stronger tell came this week from BlackRock research rather than Davos soundbites. In its 2026 thematic outlook, BlackRock explicitly floats the idea of Ethereum as the infrastructure layer that collects the “toll” as tokenization scales. One slide asks: “Could Ethereum represent the ‘toll road’ to tokenization?” and adds that stablecoin adoption may be an early proxy for tokenization “in action,” with “blockchains like Ethereum” positioned to benefit. In the same section, BlackRock cites RWA data “as of 1/5/2026” and notes that “of tokenized assets 65%+ are on Ethereum,” underscoring the network’s lead in today’s tokenized-asset stack. At press time, ETH traded at $3,005. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: BlackRock Powers Bitcoin Investment For US Insurance Company, Here’s How
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-powers-bitcoin-us/
Time Published: 2026-01-22T10:00:41Z
Full Content:
BlackRock is enhancing Bitcoin investment by creating new avenues for institutional capital to access the asset within the US financial system. Instead of relying on traditional crypto markets, the firm channels Bitcoin-linked returns through the insurance sector. Through its partnership with Delaware Life Insurance Company, this approach integrates BTC exposure into a fixed index annuity framework, allowing insurers and policyholders to benefit from Bitcoin-linked returns without direct ownership of the asset. BlackRock is enabling Bitcoin exposure for a US insurance company by translating the volatile asset into a structure that fits the strict risk requirements of insurance products. In a statement on Tuesday, Delaware Life confirmed it has added the BlackRock US Equity Balanced Risk 12% Index to its fixed index annuity portfolio, formalizing the integration. This index connects digital assets with traditional insurance frameworks in a controlled way, making Bitcoin participation feasible within a risk-managed product. Instead of holding BTC directly, the index combines US equity exposure through the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF with Bitcoin exposure delivered via the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). IBIT, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF launched in January 2024, has grown to nearly $76 billion in assets under management, establishing it as the primary institutional gateway for BTC exposure in the US. Risk management is central to the index’s design. A 12% volatility target dynamically adjusts allocations to limit downside risk rather than pursue aggressive upside. This feature is essential for fixed index annuities, which are structured around principal protection. As a result, policyholders are insulated from direct losses on their initial investment while still participating in index-linked returns influenced by both equity and BTC performance. BlackRock’s role extends beyond access, supplying the ETF infrastructure and volatility-controlled framework that allows Bitcoin exposure to function within an insurance balance sheet. For Delaware Life, a subsidiary of Group 1001 Insurance Holdings, the partnership marks the first instance of a US insurer embedding Bitcoin exposure within a fixed index annuity. With Group 1001 overseeing approximately $76.4 billion in assets, the move reflects a strategic product expansion by a major insurance platform rather than an experimental initiative. Company leadership has positioned the offering as a response to growing demand from financial professionals seeking modern portfolio tools that remain compatible with retirement product risk constraints. From BlackRock’s standpoint, the structure expands Bitcoin’s presence in long-term savings and insurance markets without altering the conservative expectations of those products. By framing BTC as a return component within a tightly governed risk framework, BlackRock enables institutional adoption that aligns with regulatory standards, insurer capital requirements, and retirement planning logic. In effect, Bitcoin exposure is being packaged in a form insurers already understand and can distribute, quietly extending its reach into one of the most risk-controlled areas of finance.

Title: Bitcoin analysts predict ‘prolonged consolidation’ for BTC price

Bitcoin’s onchain structure “remains fragile,” said Glassnode, warning of a prolonged consolidation period ahead for BTC price. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin (BTC) price could be in for another prolonged period of consolidation if key support levels are not reclaimed, a new analysis reveals. Key takeaways: Bitcoin is stuck between key cost-basis levels, predicting 2022-type consolidation unless key support levels are reclaimed. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $708.7 million, their fifth-largest since launch, signaling institutional caution. In the Jan. 21 edition of its regular newsletter, The Week Onchain, onchain data provider Glassnode confirmed key areas of resistance “constraining upside follow-through and keeping rallies vulnerable to distribution.” The BTC/USD pair has been oscillating within a wide range defined by the True Market Mean at $81,100 and the short-term holder (STH) cost-basis at $98,400. Related: Bitcoin eyes $90K as Trump sees crypto bill signing ‘very soon’ According to Glassnode, the recent rejection near the STH cost basis at $98,400 “mirrors the market structure observed in Q1 2022, where repeated failures to reclaim recent buyers’ cost basis prolonged consolidation.” The chart above shows that Bitcoin price spent the period between February 2022 and July 2022 trapped between the STH cost basis and the True Market mean before entering an extended bear market, bottoming around $15,000 in November 2022. Glassnode’s Entity-Adjusted UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), a metric that shows at which prices the current set of Bitcoin UTXOs were created, also revealed a wide and dense supply zone above $100,000 that has been gradually maturing into the long-term holder cohort. “This unresolved supply overhang remains a persistent source of sell pressure, likely to cap attempts above the $98.4K STH cost basis and the $100K level,” Glassnode wrote, adding The Bitcoin “Risk Index has climbed to 21, hovering just below the High Risk zone (25),” said private wealth manager Swissblock in a recent X post, adding: As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin must take out resistance at $98,000-$100,000 to revive the bull market cycle. On Wednesday, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows for a third consecutive day, totaling $708.7 million, according to data from CoinGlass. This marked their largest single-day exit in two months and the fifth-largest withdrawal from these investment products since their launch in January 2024, as shown in the chart below. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, posted the biggest outflows of $356.6 million. Fidelity's FBTC followed with $287.7 million, alongside four other funds that saw outflows. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a combined net outflow of $286.9 million on Wednesday across five funds. The last three days saw a “historic $1.58B exit from Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock and Fidelity are leading the charge in heavy institutional de-risking,” said analyst NekoZ in a reaction to the outflows. The selling pressure from spot BTC ETFs coincided with the rejection at $90,000 on Wednesday amid growing macroeconomic uncertainty, which increased the probability of rangebound price action or further downside if the support at $84,000 breaks.

Title: The world needs more plumbers and electricians

Unravelling the hype behind IT for creating useful CIO strategies. It may not have made the headlines when world leaders and CEOs met at the World Economic Forum at Davos, but the fireside chat between BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Nvidia president Jensen Huang, should worry everyone who has felt the trauma of having to book a tradesperson. Trying to get a quote for some plumbing or electrical work at home is as easy as using a metal detect to find a cache of gold on the beach. While the residents of Eastbourne this week munched on the news that their beach had washed up a container load of chips of the eating variety, it’s the demand for silicon chips, and, in particular those power hungry AI chips, that’ll eat up demand for tradespeople. Rather than economies experiencing job losses arising from greater use of AI in the workforce, Huang described the AI boom as the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history”, which he claimed would create a lot of jobs. “It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft,” he said. “Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don’t need to have a PhD in computer science to do so. Specifically Huang said the tech sector will need plumbers, electricians, network technicians, construction workers and steel workers, as well as the people who install and fit out the equipment. Mirroring the views presented by Microsoft’s Brad Smith in a March 2025 Fox Business article, Huang said there was a great shortage of such people. Where there’s the most demand, Huang said there will be a salary hike. “We’re talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories.” The latest AI hardware requires water cooling and more energy per rack than ever before. It needs a total rethink of how to power and cool datacentre facilities. In a recent Linkedin post, commercial real estate advisor Kris McGee, said datacentre are paying electricians $130 per hour, flying them on private jets to job sites and building “man camps” in rural Texas. London-based IT rollout specialist, Optrium recently estimated that electrical systems account for 40% to 45% of construction costs while cooling and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems represent about 15% to 20% of total expenses. The efficiency of these systems are vital to operating high-powered datacentres, such as those running demanding AI training and inference workloads. And keeping the electrical and cooling systems optimal means hiring highly skilled electricans, HVAC engineers and plumbers for water cooled systems. As demand for these skills increases with the escalation in AI datacentre builds, salaries of tradepeople will inevitably rise. The bottom line is that this demand will mean hiring a talented plumber or electrician is going become harder and will cost more.

Title: Elon Musk to take part in Davos panel discussion today

Full Content:
Elon Musk marked his last-minute Davos debut today with a critique of US solar tariffs and aggressive targets for Tesla, including humanoid robot sales next year, as well as flagging European approval for self-driving tech within weeks. After years of describing the World Economic Forum's annual meeting as elitist, unaccountable and disconnected from ordinary people, the world's richest man was interviewed by World Economic Forum interim co-chair Larry Fink. The BlackRock CEO expressed his admiration for Musk at the start of the wide-ranging discussion, which covered the future of robots and AI, the economic benefits of reusable rockets and Musk's childhood fascination with science fiction. Musk has become more prominent in recent years, driven by his proximity to US President Donald Trump and his stewardship of firms including Starlink-owner SpaceX, social media platform X and artificial intelligence startup, xAI. Breaking ranks with Trump on renewable energy, Musk said the US could produce enough solar power to meet all of its electricity needs, including booming demand from the proliferation of Big Tech's power-hungry data centres. "You could take a small corner of Utah, Nevada or New Mexico - a very small percentage of the area of the US - to generate all of the electricity that the US uses," he added. "Unfortunately, the tariff barriers for solar are extremely high and that makes the economics of deploying solar artificially high," Musk said. Trump has been openly critical of clean energy sources while encouraging oil majors to drill more for oil and gas. His freeze on approvals for major onshore wind and solar projects has left thousands of megawatts of capacity in limbo at a critical time for the US as it rushes to secure enough power to meet soaring AI-driven requirements. The interview did not touch on other major geopolitical and economic themes that have dominated the forum this week, including Trump's ambitions for Greenland and Russia's war in Ukraine, focusing instead on technology and robotics. The pair joked about aliens, life on Mars and the "Terminator" film series. "We need to be very careful with robotics. We don't want to find ourselves in a James Cameron movie. Love his movies, but we don't want to be in Terminator, obviously," said Musk, referring to the fictional AI system from the "Terminator" films that becomes self-aware and turns on humanity. Among the highest profile executives speaking at the Swiss mountain resort this week, Musk predicted robots will eventually outnumber humans, leading to a huge economic boom, and joked about traveling to Mars. "People ask me do I want to die on Mars, and I'm like: 'yes, but not on impact','" he said towards the end of the 30-minute session, drawing laughter from the audience. His appearance at Davos comes as governments and regulators from Europe to Asia crackdown on sexually explicit content generated by his xAI chatbot Grok on X, launching probes, imposing bans and demanding safeguards, in a growing global push to curb illegal material.

Title: Elon Musk is a surprise addition to the Davos schedule

Davos, things just got exciting: Elon Musk will be in town. Musk wasn't expected to attend the World Economic Forum. But a day after President Donald Trump's speech, the Tesla and SpaceX chief has been added to the schedule. The world's richest man is now on the books for a session at 4:30 p.m. Swiss time on Thursday, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Flight data from ADS-B Exchange showed that Musk's private jet, a Gulfstream G650, took off from San Jose International Airport on Wednesday night local time and is traveling east. It's not yet clear whether Musk, who has been posting on X for the last several hours, is on the aircraft. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider. He's had a rocky public relationship with the organizers of Davos. In 2023, he made a post that questioned the need for the WEF. "Are they trying to be the boss of Earth!?" he wrote at the time. Musk said in 2022 that he had declined an invitation to Davos, writing on social media that it was "boring AF." The WEF said at the time that he hadn't been invited since 2015. More recently, the billionaire has drawn attention for his public feud with Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, after the latter said he wasn't interested in installing Starlink on his airline's fleet due to several drawbacks. The WEF has not said what's on Musk's speaking agenda for Thursday. A WEF spokesperson confirmed that Musk is attending the event, adding that the forum has "an outstanding tech delegation attending this year's meeting — companies and individuals who are shaping the future of their industries."

Title: The critical hour of United Europe and our own “turning away” from Trump’s Davos, PASOK’s pointless infighting, bank profits and National Insurance

Time Published: 2026-01-22T07:40:23Z

Greetings. Europe—and in the broader sense the entire civilized Western world—is at this moment facing a major and unprecedented test. The outrageous demand by President Trump to conquer or “buy” a country such as Greenland, which in fact is under the “European umbrella” of an EU member state, Denmark, is not a matter for discussion or negotiation. It bears no resemblance to what happened in the dictatorship of Venezuela, nor to how the United States might influence the fall of a regime such as the mullahs of Iran. Consequently, this is the moment when Europeans—and of course we as well—must resist Trump in a united, methodical, and determined manner. Mitsotakis, partly because of timing and partly because of the common European stance, did not go to Davos and will fly straight to the Summit in Brussels for the major issue of Greenland. Athens’ forecast is that no one other than Orbán will sign Trump’s “peace pact,” Meloni included. One shot, three birds I should of course tell you that nevertheless in Athens they are studying very carefully Donald’s proposal for the so-called Peace Council, which is truly… astonishing. I am told that on Monday Gerapetritis will travel to New York and take part in the UN Security Council, which will assess the well-known Resolution 2803 that lays the foundations for the day after in Gaza. As a serious diplomatic source was telling me, Donald’s Council is essentially different from what is proposed in the UN Resolution, since the corresponding council envisaged there has a fixed term, whereas Donald’s is “open-ended” and may start with Gaza but deal with any other conflict field. Moreover, it is unclear where the funds requested as participation contributions will go, while it is foreseen that Trump would be president for life. “If this passes, it is a simultaneous ramming of the UN, NATO, and the European Union,” a serious diplomatic source told me, explaining the reluctance of Europeans—apart from Orbán—to capitulate to Trump’s idea. And I learn that Athens has already conveyed this message to Washington. The Ankara meeting is being finalized It is a matter of days before announcements regarding the Supreme Cooperation Council in Ankara, which will take place in the first half of February. I understand that the second week of February is more likely, specifically by February 13. Gerapetritis and Fidan have 4–5 dates and are examining them based on the schedules of Mitsotakis and Erdoğan, but Athens is sending the message that the SCC must take place. PASOK quarrels for nothing “A bad village, few houses,” says the proverb, and it seems to apply perfectly in the case of PASOK, where the top figures are at each other’s throats with leader Nikos, who is trying to tidy up the shop and is leaking various scenarios, such as the possibility of running in Athens A, where Geroulanos is elected. Geroulanos gathered about 2,000 people at his cake-cutting event at the Caravel, and when Androulakis appeared he was received with lukewarm applause. “All right, it’s not exactly his crowd,” a senior PASOK figure told me, acknowledging nonetheless that whenever the leader is outside his own mechanism he fails to excite. I also understand that there is some… difficulty in relations between Androulakis and Diamantopoulou. Anna feels stifled because the program “isn’t moving,” as the shop isn’t pulling, while Androulakis may now be “loading” her with any shortcomings for the poor reception of the programmatic positions in society. Thus the shop will limp along until the elections, where “we won’t get more than 11–12%,” as a PASOK MP was saying. A potluck congress Otherwise, various parties are holding congresses in the coming days. For example, the New Left, where things are generally rather sad, and also President Stefanos, who announced a congress for the Democracy Movement on February 7–8 at the Peace and Friendship Stadium (SEF). Let me tell you that Vice President Zakri is already opening a discussion about cooperation with Karystianou; I imagine it will also be raised at the congress. In any case, the congress is something of a potluck affair, and the president even asked SEF for a discount for the “Melina Mercouri” hall, while there was also coordination with Olympiacos BC, because the congress ends Sunday at noon and on Sunday at noon Olympiacos basketball plays Kolossos Rhodes. In any case, the party is not providing buses or hotels for cadres coming from the provinces, and generally a proposal has been made as to whether they can… be hosted by friends from Athens. Rain–schools–Aris Now, regarding yesterday’s severe bad weather and rainfall in Attica, which manifested mainly from 5 p.m. onwards, I would say the following. Initially, in the morning, because the phenomena were mild, we all thought that closing the schools was an excessive reaction by the Region. In the end, it wasn’t so, because from early afternoon the weather worsened and the rain that fell was probably one of the heaviest in the history of Attica, during which unfortunately an unlucky woman lost her life. It is estimated that daily the Region of Attica alone transports about 32,000 students with 1,900 routes of public schools, special education, etc. Closed schools “lighten” traffic in Attica by about 7,000 cars per day, studies say. Therefore, the… “scientists” who started criticism early on social media (Aris Spiliotopoulos, Antonaros, etc.) simply rushed. What does Aris with the mustache, who butchers everything and knows everything—from the weather to President Maria—tell you? February 4 for the VOAK We were saying a few days ago about the official start of the VOAK concession within the first half of February. Although there were thoughts to do it earlier, the date has now been definitively locked for February 4. The duration of the concession contract is 35 years, and GEK TERNA has undertaken the largest part of the VOAK, the Chania–Heraklion section. In view of further strengthening the company’s concessions portfolio, Piraeus Securities proceeded with a significant upgrade of its investment recommendation, raising the target price of the share to €40 from €31 previously, following Santander, which a few days ago raised the bar to €49. The share closed yesterday at €30.84. Meetings of A. Exarchou with Eric Trump and the Saudi Minister of Investment Highly active at the Davos Forum was the President and CEO of the AKTOR Group, Alexandros Exarchou, as he had a series of important meetings of business interest. Among others, he met with the Saudi Minister of Investment, Khalid A. Al-Falih, with whom potential opportunities for investments in the energy sector were discussed, and with the Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, Eric Trump, with whom he discussed investment opportunities and the broader prospects of the Greek economy. Today, A. Exarchou is participating in a panel with the U.S. Ambassador K. Guilfoyle, the Minister of Energy of Romania, and Deputy Foreign Minister H. Theocharis. Yesterday, during a discussion with businessman, author, and Forbes columnist Rhett Power, the head of the AKTOR Group said that Europe must decide what it ultimately wants to be: a real federation with common interests, a common army, and central authority, or a loose union of states. It needs to decide, he said, on its role and identity, otherwise it risks being sidelined in global geopolitical and economic realignments. Europe, he stressed, over-regulates everything, resulting in everything becoming more expensive, creating a huge competitiveness problem for European businesses, and squeezing citizens’ disposable income. A Greek woman in the top ranks of PepsiCo The latest major changes in the executive pyramid of the multinational group PepsiCo have brought Athina Kanioura to the top of Latin America. The Greek manager took over as CEO of Latin America Foods—one of the company’s strongest and fastest-growing business segments—while at the same time retaining the strategic role she has held since 2020 as Chief Strategy & Transformation Officer for the entire Group. For those who don’t know her: before “landing” at PepsiCo, A. Kanioura had built a long and steadily rising career at Accenture, starting from the Greek subsidiary, continuing in London, and reaching the top of global leadership in Analytics & AI. She herself, via LinkedIn, spoke of a “legacy of success” she is inheriting from Paula Santilli, of a market that remains a growth engine, and of a culture of innovation and speed that—she says—she can leverage to “unlock new potential.” The recent changes in the multinational’s executive pyramid also “touched” the Greek subsidiary, PepsiCo Hellas, where the new head is Georgian Konstantin Merkviladze. National Insurance opens its cards Today we will have the unveiling of the new strategy of National Insurance. The group’s CEO, Dimitris Mazarakis, and the rest of the management will speak to journalists about the framework of the goals and strategic priorities of the insurer after its acquisition by Piraeus Bank. We say framework, because the Business Plan 2026–2030, which will set out the strategy for the next five years, will officially be presented next March. However, some things are already known, with the main one being the ambitious target of achieving €1.5 billion in premiums by 2030 and gradually regaining first place in all sectors except motor insurance. For 2026, this is characterized to some extent as a transition and preparation year for the full development of (co)operations with Piraeus Bank, as well as infrastructure issues such as accelerating digitization, technological support, etc. At the operational level, a major issue is repositioning in the Health sector and the further development of collaborations created due to Piraeus Bank, such as with Errikos Dynan, the utilization of the banking network, strengthening and expanding sales networks in Greece, and more. Naturally, there are many other issues the management will be called upon to address, some extremely difficult and not exclusively in its hands, with perhaps the foremost being how the issue of increases in premiums and healthcare costs will be handled, and what will happen in the future with the two partnerships that Piraeus Bank maintains with two well-known insurance companies. Banks rush to announce results (+dividend) It may not be a coincidence but rather a symptom of banks’ haste to announce their results and the dividend for fiscal year 2025 as early as possible. Piraeus Bank and Eurobank will announce their 2025 financial results on February 26, 2026, a date that exemplifies the trend that has formed in our market toward the earliest possible disclosure of financial data. Overall, the four systemic banks will present total net profits of approximately €4.7 billion for 2025, despite pressure from the reduction of ECB interest rates. Already from the nine-month period, profits had reached €3.5 billion, with an increase in the loan portfolio of €10.5 billion. Bank of America estimates that Eurobank closed the year with net profits of €1.36 billion, while for Piraeus the estimates amount to €890 million. Early announcement allows faster approval by the SSM for dividend distribution and potentially buyback programs. The two banks are planning high payout ratios (Eurobank 50%, Piraeus 35% gradually rising to 50%), with a total dividend yield exceeding 7–8% for 2026–2027. With strong capital adequacy, NPE ratios below 3%, and aggressive expansion plans through acquisitions that enrich revenue sources, banks are trying to justify the investment fever on the Stock Exchange. Free shares A program for the free allocation of shares to administrative and executive staff was approved by Ergon Foods, concerning the distribution of up to 11.69 million preferred non-voting shares, with a nominal value of €0.10, with an annual privilege between €3,000 and €5,000 per beneficiary, deriving from the capitalization of retained earnings. The program runs until 30/06/2026 and the Board of Directors will determine the beneficiaries, the terms of allocation, and the holding obligation. The timing is not accidental. It comes a few months after the entry of the Halcyon fund under Eleni Bathianaki, aiming to “tie” executives to the international expansion plan described to newmoney by co-founder Thomas Douzis: from new Ergon House locations and foreign markets to the ambition of building a Mediterranean brand with global reach. In practice, therefore, the program translates into a tool for participation in future added value and a move that shows Ergon no longer operates with the logic of a “family business,” but under the terms of a growth company playing on an international field. Kousta’s entry into LNG Danaos Corp’s investment in the Alaska LNG liquefied natural gas project marks a shift in the company’s strategy beyond traditional container shipping. With the $50 million investment, it deploys part of the approximately $1 billion in cash it accumulated over the past three years, moving capital from a market characterized by intense volatility such as containers to an energy transportation market with greater revenue stability. Danaos is not investing in shares but is envisaged as a preferred vessel provider for at least six LNG carriers, leveraging its expertise in maritime transport of large cargoes. This implies that Danaos will build or manage at least six specialized vessels for this LNG transport. In this way, it creates a new revenue stream not directly linked to its core activity, reducing exposure to fluctuations in container freight rates. At the same time, the investment aligns with the United States, which is promoting domestic LNG production as a strategic energy resource. Danaos enters a project with strong political backing and commercial commitments in Asia, thus reducing regulatory and geopolitical risk. Simultaneously with its entry into cargo vessels—capesize bulkers—Danaos shows that it wants to diversify its revenue sources. The strategic move of Olympic Shipping & Management The recent chartering of the VLCC supertankers Olympic Laurel and Olympic Trophy to Shell for three years by Onassis-controlled Olympic Shipping & Management is not merely a commercial agreement but a clear statement to the global energy market. With scrubber-fitted VLCCs earning up to $122,600/day in spot rates, the company secures stable premium revenues while simultaneously reducing exposure to market volatility. The Greek company exploits these realignments, strategically securing interests with leading oil companies, while the choice of long-term contracts places it at the heart of energy flows between the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Olympic Shipping & Management leverages technology, experience, and timing to shape balances in the oil market. Greek shipping, continuing the tradition of Aristotle Onassis, maintains control over critical nodes of international energy and sends the message that it remains a protagonist even in periods of intense instability. At the same time, Aramco Trading chartered Maria Angelicoussis’ “Maran Mars” for three years at $52,000/day, and Mitsui OSK Lines chartered Angeliki Frangou’s “Nave Allegro” for five years at $44,000/day. The moral of the story is that Greek-owned shipping achieves higher charter rates and more favorable terms compared to major Middle Eastern and Asian players, confirming its strategic superiority. Oikonomou strategically locks in newbuilds Giorgos Oikonomou appears to be rewriting his playbook in the tanker sector with his latest move. The TMS Group acquired two newbuild suezmax tankers, which had initially been reserved for John Fredriksen and Seatankers. Financial analysts note that this is not merely a deal but a strategic coup. TMS is essentially “strolling” into a market where slots for newbuildings are scarce and demand has surged due to geopolitical realignments—more specifically, trade flows of Russian oil to India and China. With these two new orders, TMS increases its suezmax fleet to six vessels, strengthening its presence in a global fleet that traditionally yields high returns on difficult routes, such as transporting crude from Northern Russia and Black Sea ports. This move gains strategic depth when viewed as part of a broader trend of Greek shipowners “snapping up” new tanker order slots. Oikonomou essentially capitalized on a window of opportunity left by Seatankers, showing that TMS has the flexibility and capital to move quickly, even when major shipping deals are overturned. The story also has a geopolitical flavor. The dependence of suezmaxes on Russian flows, combined with the potential restriction of the “shadow fleet,” opens opportunities for “mainstream” shipowners like Oikonomou. Aktor at a new high and the rally in refineries Aktor is in a favorable phase, recording three consecutive positive sessions, resulting in the share reaching an important milestone and closing at €10.16. At the same time, the group’s market capitalization now exceeds €2 billion. Refineries took center stage yesterday, with buyers flocking en masse to Motor Oil and HELLENiQ ENERGY, in the wake of a report published by Pantelakis Securities on the sector. MOH recorded a jump of 4.3%, returned above €31, and is within striking distance of the all-time high of €31.48 recorded on December 22, 2025. Similarly, HELLENiQ ENERGY rose by 2.8% and moved above €8.7, with the next target being the seven-year highs of €9. Pantelakis set the bar at €40 for Motor Oil and €10 for HELLENiQ ENERGY, with an overweight recommendation for both refineries. Cenergy Holdings also recorded six consecutive gains, extending its all-time record and closing at €17.6. KRI-KRI’s bet in Aspropyrgos The small dairy company from Serres, KRI-KRI, has grown. It is now worth €658 million, that is, 24% more than around this time last year. Its weapon is one word: “exports.” Hence KRI-KRI’s next investment in creating a logistics center in Aspropyrgos, Attica, is only natural. Today, nearly 7 out of every 10 euros that KRI-KRI earns from dairy products come from international markets. The company closed 2025 with turnover of around €300 million. Aspropyrgos, apart from bordering Piraeus, has now established itself as the country’s absolute logistics hub, with rental prices reaching €5.8/sq.m. per month (+19% over five years) and land prices at €120,000–130,000 per stremma. Major retail companies (IKEA, Sklavenitis, Galaxias, METRO, etc.) are investing hundreds of millions in the area. For KRI-KRI, the Aspropyrgos center will function as a bridge: on the one hand serving the Attica market, where yogurt sales increased by 5.8%, and on the other facilitating export logistics via Piraeus. Naturally, all this is accompanied by increased production capacity through the major €52.2 million investment at the Serres factory. The changing of the guard and compensation A “changing of the guard” took place at EBIOP-TEMBO, the electrical equipment manufacturing company based in Chalkida and controlled by Siemens. At the end of October, the German CEO at the time, Dennis Julian Schubert, resigned and was replaced by fellow German Felix-Alfred Uebelhack, a Siemens Group executive, seconded to the company by shareholder Siemens A.E. to cover the CEO position effective from 01.11.2025. What is of interest now is the projected remuneration of the new CEO. Based on the relevant terms of the contract with Siemens for the secondment of this executive, the duration is three years, from 15.10.2025 to 14.10.2028, with the possibility of extension. The gross annual fixed remuneration during the secondment amounts to €129,268, while the gross annual variable remuneration in case of 100% target achievement—i.e., the bonus—is €32,317. The “other net annual allowances (housing, family, etc.)” reach €19,500, in addition to any other provided benefits “according to the contract concluded between him and Siemens AG.” There is also a “billing” clause according to which billing is done monthly, with a 5% profit margin in addition to the cost of the executive, excluding costs stipulated in the contract to be directly covered by the company. €3.8 billion absorbed in 12 minutes! Europe’s stock market is “thirsty” for defense stocks. Twelve minutes. That was the time it took for the €3.8 billion IPO of the Czech defense industry Czechoslovak Group (CSG) to be fully subscribed by institutional investors. Not hours, not days—twelve minutes that reveal much about Europe’s new geopolitical reality. CSG’s IPO in Amsterdam values the company at €25 billion. Controlled by 33-year-old billionaire Michal Strnad, CSG entered the market with impressive figures: revenues of €4.5 billion in the first nine months of 2025 (+82% year-on-year), an EBITDA margin of 26.4%, and… an order backlog of €14 billion. It is the second-largest producer of medium- and large-caliber ammunition in Europe, and the world’s largest in small caliber. The participation of cornerstone investors—Artisan Partners, BlackRock, and Qatar’s Al-Rayyan—with total commitments of €900 million set the tone for the new era. The STOXX Europe Targeted Defence index is again flirting with record highs, five times above levels of three years ago. Europe is “rearming,” and CSG—with 68% of its revenues from NATO countries and 26% from Ukraine—stands exactly at the epicenter of this upheaval. Trump predicts a stock triumph; Americans can’t afford natural gas In just two days, natural gas prices in America rose by +60%. One could attribute the explosive increase to the “Arctic freeze” that swept across the U.S. Perhaps, however, this explanation alone is not sufficient. Most Wall Street hedge fund managers had increased their short positions in natural gas, betting on lower prices due to the mild winter. The sudden change in weather boosted heating demand and triggered a classic short squeeze, with optimistic speculators hurriedly closing their positions, accelerating the rise in natural gas prices. There is, however, another detail, and it concerns liquefied natural gas infrastructure on the other side of the Atlantic. The U.S. has now evolved into a leading exporter of LNG, supplying Europe after exerting intense pressure on it to disengage from Russian gas. But when domestic inventories are strained by extreme weather conditions, arbitrage is created between domestic consumption and export contracts. The messages from this chaotic situation are many. First and foremost, storage capacity. Storage capacity is the new gold of the energy map. Second, climate change—which Trump denies—yet produces extreme weather conditions and turns energy commodities into a game of Russian roulette. Markets no longer price average demand, but extreme events. Explore related questions

Title: Microsoft CEO urges AI developers “to get to a point where we are using this to do something useful,” or “lose even the social permission...to generate these tokens”

Nadella tells Davos that AI’s legitimacy hinges on making people's lives better When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is concerned that if artificial intelligence doesn’t start delivering real, measurable benefits to society, people will be fed up with it and its price, ending its current form of existence. The Davos stage is an odd venue and audience to preach societal good over other goods, but it certainly helped his comments stand out. AI developers "have to get to a point where we are using this to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries. Otherwise, I don't think this makes much sense," Nadella explained during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. "We will quickly lose even the social permission to take something like energy, which is a scarce resource, and use it to generate these tokens, if these tokens are not improving health outcomes, education outcomes, public sector efficiency, private sector competitiveness, across all sectors, small and large." The Davos crowd, used to a more digital transformation cheerleading role, sounded a little confused. But the discussion also shows how the AI hype train is both an illusion and real. Nadella should know what he's talking about. Microsoft is one of the biggest drivers of the current AI boom, with tens of billions of dollars invested in OpenAI, its own Copilot suite baked into productivity tools, and a seat at nearly every major AI policy table. But his message at Davos was that leadership now demands a reckoning – not just about how smart or useful AI tools are in theory, but whether they’re helping people in schools, clinics, small businesses, and city governments. That’s not an abstract moral argument. It’s an infrastructure one. AI’s growth has been driven by immense computational muscle, which means it’s also driven by massive energy use. Training today's biggest models consumes as much electricity as some small countries consume in a year. And inference, when you run the model on your phone or desktop to answer a question or generate a response, adds to that cost every second it runs. AI doesn’t just use servers; it fuels an ever-expanding footprint of data centers, water-cooled systems, and grid-straining workloads. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Nadella’s social permission phrase gets to the heart of what might be next. Until now, the public has broadly accepted that cloud-based tech companies can use resources in exchange for productivity, entertainment, or convenience. But that goodwill isn’t guaranteed. If AI begins to look like a wasteful luxury, delivering novelty rather than necessity, citizens and governments may start to push back. During the session, Larry Fink asked whether all this productivity talk would mean fewer jobs, and Nadella didn’t dismiss the concern. But he argued that AI’s potential lies in amplifying what people can do. But this moment is different from past tech inflection points. The sheer scale of AI's appetite. Cloud computing scaled gradually. Smartphones had physical limits. But AI can grow as fast as the models and capital behind it allow. That’s why Nadella’s call to focus on outcomes comes off as cautious as well as pragmatic. Nadella’s message was simple but sharp: we are nearing the edge of public tolerance for black-box systems powered by opaque amounts of energy, with unclear societal benefits. And maybe we should all be asking harder questions when the next shiny AI tool drops: Does this help me? Does it help someone? Or is it just burning energy to generate yet another token?

Title: India’s wealth boom sparks M&A frenzy as banks chase affluent clients

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. MUMBAI: India’s wealth management industry is scrambling to scale as a growing pool of household financial wealth remains underserved. Of the at least $1.1 trillion held by the country’s top households, defined as those with annual incomes of $25,000 or more, at the end of FY24, only about $0.7 trillion was addressed by registered wealth managers, according to a 2025 Deloitte report. This leaves an estimated $0.4 trillion in unmet demand. This pool of household wealth is being serviced by a limited universe of private wealth managers, financial advisers, mutual fund distributors and registered investment advisers. Specialized wealth managers are only able to meet 11% of the demands of the country's top 1% households, as per a Bernstein report from 2025. These include listed platforms like 360 One Wealth, Anand Rathi Wealth, Nuvama Wealth, as well as private players like Kotak Wealth, Julius Baer India. Waterfield Advisors, and Avendus Wealth. Most high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth demand, Bernstein noted, remains either self-managed, handled by accountants, or serviced by domestic banks and brokers offering limited customization, as well as independent advisers that lack scale. The imbalance has turned wealth management into one of the country’s most active dealmaking sectors, drawing global banks, foreign asset managers and domestic lenders eager to secure access to India’s affluent and ultra-high-net-worth clients. “The velocity at which investable capital is forming in India has surpassed the speed at which many institutions can build organic advisory capability," said Feroze Azeez, joint CEO of Anand Rathi Wealth. The scarcity of established platforms, he said, is drawing foreign capital seeking direct access to Indian wealth while pushing domestic banks to race for specialized capabilities. India is now among the world’s fastest-growing wealth markets, with wealth creation accelerating across entrepreneurs, professionals and salaried classes, said Prakash Bulusu, joint CEO of IIFL Capital. “This expanding client base demands personalized investment advisory services…Those rare firms offering all services are in focus." The opportunity is only expected to widen. Bernstein estimates that the country’s serviceable wealth is expected to triple from $3 trillion in FY25 to $9 trillion by FY35. Firms race for scaleSeveral international and domestic banks, and asset managers are moving quickly to capture a share of this growth. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and Emirates NBD Bank, which recently received Reserve Bank of India approval to set up wholly owned subsidiaries, are still deciding whether to build organically or acquire existing platforms, according to two people aware of the matter. Jefferies is also looking to enter India’s mutual fund space through an organic buildout, a third person said. SMBC, Emirates NBD did not respond to emailed queries, while a Jefferies spokesperson refused to comment. Domestic players are also reassessing growth strategies. Mint reported earlier this month that investment bank DAM Capital is preparing for a potential foray into wealth management and alternative investment funds. Some deals are already delivering shortcuts to scale. Boston-based State Street Corp. recently invested ₹580 crore in fintech platform Groww’s asset management business. Last month, Mizuho Financial Group agreed to acquire KKR’s majority stake in Avendus Capital, giving the Japanese lender immediate access to the firm’s ultra-high-net-worth client relationships. Deutsche Bank AG’s India retail and wealth management business, valued at $2.5 billion, has reportedly drawn binding bids from Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and Federal Bank Ltd. Affluence fuels the rushThe primary driver of this deal activity is the rise of India's affluent class, industry experts explained. They said that the number of high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals in India has surged in recent years, fuelling demand for sophisticated wealth management services. In 2025, India had four of the top 10 cities globally for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, according to wealth intelligence firm Altrata – the financial hub of Mumbai; Bengaluru and Hyderabad, centres for IT and business services; and the national capital, Delhi. The Mercedes-Benz Hurun India Wealth Report 2025 noted nearly a 200% rise in India’s millionaire households. It estimated that India now has 871,700 households with net worth above ₹8.5 crore, or approximately $1 million, almost double the 2021 figure of 458,000, representing 0.31% of all households. Between 2017 and 2025, million-dollar households grew 45%, though only a small share entered ultra-rich categories. The report also found that 83% of respondents remained confident about India’s economic growth over the next three years. The surge in India mirrors a global trend. In 2025, M&A targeting investment and wealth management firms surged as firms repositioned for rising demand in alternatives and a multi-trillion-dollar generational wealth transfer, with deal volumes at record highs globally. As per Deloitte 2026 Investment Management Outlook report, deal volume in the first half of 2025 jumped 46% year-on-year, making it the most active first half in more than a decade. As in 2023, a substantial share of these transactions targeted wealth management and investment advisory firms. “The continued expansion of alternative investment offerings helps underscore the vital role wealth management firms can play in helping high-net-worth individuals and retail investors make informed investment decisions," the same report said. “Additionally, with trillions of dollars set to shift between generations over the coming decades, many investment firms are taking notice and positioning themselves accordingly." India’s current wave of deals builds on a key consolidation in early 2025, when 360 ONE WAM Ltd acquired UBS Group AG’s onshore India wealth management business, consolidating roughly 80 family office relationships alongside its assets under management. UBS retained a minority stake rather than continuing independently.

BlackRock Inc., which ended its DSP partnership in 2018, re-entered in 2023 through a joint venture with Jio Financial Services Ltd, with chairman Larry Fink calling it a “major step" in expanding the firm’s global presence. Jio BlackRock received final registration and approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India to begin operations in May 2025. Looking ahead, the trend shows no signs of slowing. Deloitte expects continued consolidation through 2026, driven by the integration of public and private market products and competition for scarce wealth-management scale.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG PublishedÂ Jan 22, 2026, 07:42 AM UpdatedÂ Jan 23, 2026, 03:02 PM DAVOS, Switzerland - As artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to upend job markets in countries around the world, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang brushed off longer-term concerns and made the case that skilled vocational workers are seeing increasing demand now. Plumbers, electricians and construction workers are going to be able to command âsix-figure salariesâ, thanks to demand to build data centres that run and train AI, he said in an interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan 21. The technology will require one of the biggest infrastructure build-outs in history, with trillions of dollars in new investment, Mr Huang said. âWeâre seeing quite a significant boom in this area. Salaries have gone up nearly double,â he said. âEverybody should be able to make a great living. You donât need to have a PhD in computer science to do so.â Mr Huangâs comments echo remarks made at Davos on Jan 20 by Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp, who praised workers with âvocational trainingâ and said AI would create more local jobs and largely eliminate the need for mass immigration. Coreweave CEO Michael Intrator also touched on the âphysicalityâ of the AI boom at a panel later on Jan 21, describing the need for growing numbers of plumbers, electricians and carpenters.Â Nvidia, the leading maker of chips that help power and run the latest AI models, has benefited from the huge rush to build data centres. The company is on track to generate almost US$200 billion (S$256.7 billion) in data centre chip sales for 2025, according to an average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. To date, the bulk of its revenue comes from the biggest data centre builders â Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, Alphabet â but it is striking deals with a growing number of smaller data centre operators. Tech firms have committed to spending a combined US$500 billion in data centre leases in the coming years. AIâs impact on the job market is already being felt. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned about a âwhite-collar bloodbathâ that could wipe out 50 per cent of entry-level jobs. The companyâs Claude AI is gaining attention for its coding abilities, a feature that could displace more junior programmers.Â âWeâre entering a world where the (tasks of) junior-level software engineers â maybe many of the tasks of the more senior-level software engineers â are starting to be done most of the way by AI systems. Now thatâs going to go further,â Mr Amodei said in an interview at Davos on Jan 20. While he believes the good from the technology will outweigh the bad, high unemployment and underemployment are risks that need to be mitigated.Â âThereâs going to be unfortunately a whole class of people who are, across a lot of industries, going to have a hard time coping,â he said.Â On Jan 21, Mr Fink noticeably avoided probing Mr Huang on sensitive topics, most notably China. Nvidiaâs sales to the country are controversial, and the company is waiting to hear whether it will be able to sell its chips to the country and in what quantities. Just on Jan 20, Mr Amodei likened shipping Nvidia chips into China to selling nuclear weapons to North Korea.Â Mr Huang is expected to visit China at the end of January as he works to reopen a crucial market for the companyâs AI chips. It is a pivotal time for the business, after the United States moved to ease limits on chip exports to China which it has had in place since 2022. Nvidia is still blocked from shipping the top-of-the-line chips to the country, stymieing Beijingâs ability to innovate beyond the cutting-edge of AI, but will be able to ship older-generation H200 AI chips. China, meanwhile, is expected to clear H200 imports for commercial use in the first three months of 2026, though it will not allow the chips for use in the military, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure or its state-owned enterprises, Bloomberg News reported. Some of the countryâs most prominent tech firms, including Alibaba Group and ByteDance, have privately expressed interest in ordering more than 200,000 units each of the chip.Â BLOOMBERG Nvidia AI/artificial intelligence Employment E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Pondering whether Ethereum could become the “toll road” to blockchain-based markets, the report stated that Ethereum “could be poised to benefit” from a shift spurring moves across legacy financial institutions, from DTCC to the New York Stock Exchange. Ethereum currently underpins 65% of tokenized assets, according to the report. Meanwhile, the adoption of stablecoins is outpacing spot crypto trading volumes, suggesting that “tokenized assets may have a use-case outside of purely speculative trading.” The second-largest digital asset by market cap has the potential to accrue value if a growing number of firms tap Ethereum for creating digital representations of real-world assets, according to Jay Jacobs, U.S. Head of Equity ETFs at BlackRock. He authored the report. “If we see more tokenized assets utilizing the Ethereum blockchain, ultimately, you would see it be a beneficiary of additional trading activity, [and the] issuance of things like stablecoins or real- world assets,” Jacobs told Decrypt. “If you’re an investor looking to play the growing adoption of blockchain technology, one of the best and probably fastest-growing use cases right now is tokenization, and Ethereum is a beneficiary of that trend,” he added. Although a pie chart included in the report references 10 networks capable of supporting tokenized assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only ones that are mentioned elsewhere, suggesting that the world’s largest asset manager has a distinct view toward them. The report didn’t include assets tokenized on Canton Network either. The permissioned blockchain, which was recently tapped by DTCC for its tokenization pilot, is currently used as a record-keeping layer for $362 billion in real-world assets, according to RWA.xyz. Ethereum, meanwhile, supports $13.2 billion in real-world assets that can be managed in-wallet. When it comes to BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, the $1.6 billion product primarily exists on Ethereum ($499 million) and Binance’s BNB Chain ($503 million). Broadly, Jacobs said there’s a lot of interest in what BlackRock is calling “the convergence,” where traditional markets are becoming increasingly interconnected with crypto. He pointed to spot exchange-traded funds for digital assets as an example. BlackRock is behind the largest ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have $70.6 billion and $10.7 billion in assets under management, respectively, according to CoinGlass. The firm has stood by as competitors have created products for other digital assets like XRP and Solana. “You have traditional securities and assets that are looking to be tokenized, and frankly, you have [digital] assets that [...] are making their way into the more traditional financial systems,” he said. “We believe in that convergence that does seem to be accelerating.” Still, Jacobs said that there are plenty of pieces that need to fall into place, whether that’s regulatory policy or company-level policy. Last year, the SEC created a task force to develop a “comprehensive and clear” regulatory framework for digital assets, but the expected passage of a market structure bill could also shape the regulator’s treatment of tokenized assets. What’s more, if firms want to take advantage of capabilities like around-the-clock trading or instant settlement through tokenization—qualities that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink first highlighted in 2022—then Jacobs said there would need to be the development of a supportive market around the technology across a variety of assets. “It’s early,” he said. “There's a lot of interest across financial firms to support this convergence right now, but not all innovation happens in a straight line—and ultimately, you need to see the benefits of tokenization materialized for the investors and trading community.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2026 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: ‘Only one person booed’: Al Gore heckles Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after Davos speech

By Ireland Owens, Daily Caller News Foundation January 21, 2026 Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was heckled by former Vice President Al Gore during a World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday, according to news coverage. Gore booed Lutnick while the Commerce secretary was giving a speech at an invite-only dinner event hosted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Mediaite reported on Wednesday. The report comes after Lutnick criticized Europe during his remarks, which prompted European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde to suddenly leave the dinner event, multiple outlets reported. “I sat and listened to his remarks,” Gore said Wednesday in a statement provided to Mediaite. “I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

The WEF and a representative for Gore each did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. “During Secretary Lutnick’s three-minute speech, no one left hastily,” a Commerce Department spokesperson told the DCNF in a statement on Wednesday. “Only one person booed, and it was Al Gore.” Moreover, Fox Business Network Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino wrote in a Wednesday X post that he was told by a “reliable” anonymous source that “at the dinner Lagarde walked out BEFORE [Lutnick’s] speech and was tired like everyone is at Davos.” Lutnick claimed in an op-ed published by the Financial Times on Tuesday that the Trump administration was “not going to Davos to uphold the status quo,” but instead was going “to confront it head-on.” “For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world,” Lutnick wrote. “Some of our past leaders believed the lies that offshoring was necessary, borders were not, and our national interest needed to submit to global lower cost of labour for the common good. That approach failed the US, crushed American workers and ripped apart most of the rest of the world as well. It destroyed industries, weakened supply chains and left working people in most western countries behind.” Gore suggested Wednesday that U.S. government policy should promote “regenerative agriculture” during a panel discussion at the WEF. Gore added that the U.S. needs “policies that [are] in recognition of the fact that governments around the world typically do subsidize farming, but don’t subsidize them in ways that incentivize them to go in the wrong direction, but incentivize them to go in the right direction.” Gore, the failed 2000 Democratic presidential nominee, is the cofounder and chairman of Generation Investment Management, and also the founder and chairman of The Climate Reality Project, a nonprofit organization which aims to combat the “climate crisis,” according to a biography on his website.

Former Vice President Al Gore briefly accosted Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after the Trump official’s speech on the sidelines of this week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, The Post has learned. During a Tuesday VIP dinner hosted by billionaire BlackRock boss Larry Fink, where several hundred people were invited, Lutnick delivered a speech that was fiercely critical of European allies. When he stepped offstage, Gore walked up to him and said, “Boo” — like he was trying to scare him, a source told The Post. Lutnick laughed and someone at the event remarked, “What an honor to have Al Gore boo,” according to an insider. The ex-veep confirmed he’d disliked the speech. “I sat and listened to his remarks,” the avid environmentalist told The Post in a statement. “I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane. And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others.” According to media reports, a number of other crowd members booed while attendees including European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde left the dinner before dessert was served. Fink reportedly tried to calm the audience as guests made for the exits. But a Commerce Department spokesperson and a BlackRock exec said Lagarde actually left before the remarks. “No one left hastily. Only one person booed and it was Al Gore,” a Commerce rep told The Post. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email.

Lagarde reportedly made a dash for the door as Lutnick argued that Europe was losing global influence — adding to tensions as President Trump ramped up his threats to take over Greenland. Just a day before the speech, the commerce secretary wrote a bold opinion piece for the Financial Times, stating: “We are here at Davos to make one thing crystal clear: With President Trump, capitalism has a new sheriff in town.” “For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world,” he wrote.

Institutional investors and crypto whales viewed the ETH price drop below $3,000 as a buying opportunity, but data still hints at a deeper sell-off to $2,700. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ether (ETH) price saw a daily candle close below $3,000 on Tuesday, but a positive is that data showed large holders were buying throughout the dip. While ETH whale accumulation signals growing confidence, conflicting indicators suggest rising market risk for the altcoin. Key takeaways: ETH whales and institutional investors bought over $130 million in Ether as the price closed below $3,000 on Tuesday. BitMine added more than 92,500 ETH in January, showcasing the growing demand for staking yield. ETH dropped 7.83% to $2,938 on Tuesday, marking its largest daily correction since November 4, 2025. Despite the drop, onchain tracker Lookonchain reported ETH accumulation from whales and institutional investors. According to the data, Trend Research borrowed 70 million USDt (USDT) from Aave to buy 24,555 ETH worth $75.5 million, bringing its total holdings to 651,310 ETH valued at $1.92 billion. Separately, an OTC whale address acquired 20,000 ETH, worth $58.8 million, via FalconX and Wintermute. Institutional investor accumulation of ETH extended beyond trading desks. BitMine has added 92,511 ETH in January, valued at $268 million. The ETH treasury company said it expects to become the largest Ethereum staking entity once its planned 4.2 million ETH is fully staked, generating an estimated $367 million to $393 million annually in staking rewards. The company added that it projects another $35 million to $40 million in income from cash operations. However, not all large capital flows were supportive. On Wednesday, BlackRock transferred 30,828 ETH worth about $91 million to Coinbase Prime, fueling concerns over potential sell-side volatility. Related: ETH derivatives metric turns positive after years of sell-side dominance From a technical standpoint, ETH’s longer-term chart suffered a bearish shift after closing below $3,000. The move also pushed the price below the four-month point of control near $3,100, the level where the highest volume traded over that period, signaling that the market has lost its most accepted price range. The breakdown coincided with a bearish break of structure (BOS), suggesting trend continuation to the downside. Based on current liquidity clusters, ETH could eventually test external liquidity zones around $2,718 and $2,620. Over the past 24 hours, $287 million in leveraged positions were liquidated, with longs accounting for $257 million, highlighting forced selling pressure. Data from Hyblock adds to the cautious mood. The whale versus retail delta has flipped negative, falling to -6,480 for ETH, indicating that whales are reducing their long exposure or adding shorts more aggressively than retail traders. Such shifts have preceded periods of heightened short-term volatility. On the other hand, 76% of retail traders are in long positions, pointing to the potential for a price reversal near the key swing lows.
