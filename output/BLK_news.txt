Title: Trump Tariffs Provide Limited Strategic Opportunity to Buy Bitcoin

The much-dreaded Trump tariffs are here, with the new US President enforcing up to 50% additional duties on imported goods from friends and foes alike. Top markets reported heavy losses with the S&P 500 falling close to 5%, Dow Jones 4%, and Nasdaq suffering a 6% decline. However, premier cryptocurrency Bitcoin has resisted the recent downward price pressure and has remained steadfast above $81k. Trump styled the aggressive April 3 move as “Liberation Day” for the USA, but it could result in a massive trade war worldwide, leading to another major economic recession. Affected entities, including America’s allies like Canada, the European Union, and others, have already announced retaliatory measures, and adversaries like China have followed suit. Bitcoin remains the only major asset that has held onto its price levels going into the weekend. The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization initially fell 5% to nearly $81k. Still, it has since recovered some of these losses and is sitting relatively comfortably at $84k, reversing the downward trend entirely. Bitcoin’s recent price stability in the face of a major American-initiated trade war offers insight into the future of global economics. The primary reason Bitcoin is showing incredible resilience is the US Dollar’s threatened status as the global reserve currency. The US’s financial burden is breaking new records at a rapid pace. The national debt has crossed $33 trillion, and for the first time in the country’s history, interest payments on this gigantic figure will exceed the national defense budget of $950 billion. Within the next six years, the interest on debt will likely surpass all US government tax collections and other sources of revenue. According to Larry Fink, the CEO of major investment bank BlackRock: “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control… America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Previously, Bitcoin promoters used the same logic, but here, we have the CEO of the largest bank in the world actually using it in his communique with the investors. This shows that BTC has come a long way in recent years. The stable performance of the top digital coin has resulted in investors looking at the cryptocurrency with renewed enthusiasm, not as a speculative asset but a long-term store of value similar to Gold. According to leading financial author and commentator Morgen Rochard: “Bitcoin isn’t a stock pick. It’s an opt-out button.” As Bitcoin continues to offer a much more stable alternative to the uneasiness of the global markets under the cusp of a trade war, it will continue to prove its worth as a serious investment tool.

New York Attorney General Letitia James issued a warning to US congressional leaders regarding regulation of cryptocurrency, particularly how Bitcoin and other virtual currencies could erode the US dollar’s position around the world. She urged stronger federal regulations to protect investors from fraud and criminal use in the cryptocurrency market. James emphasized the importance of a federal regulatory system for digital currencies in her Congressional letter. She identified that lacking regulation, these type of currencies expose users to fraud and monetary volatility. Bitcoin currently presents an actual threat to the dominance of the dollar, particularly since more businesses and individuals opt for digital currencies when sending money overseas, James indicated. Her concerns echo those of BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who suggested that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against the dollar amid US fiscal challenges and rising inflation. “Millions of New Yorkers actively buy, sell or hold cryptocurrency and other digital assets, and they deserve further protection,” James wrote in her message. 🚨NEW: This morning @NewYorkStateAG Letitia James sent a letter to congressional leaders @LeaderJohnThune, @SenSchumer, @SpeakerJohnson and @RepJeffries urging them to pass a federal regulatory framework for digital assets to mitigate fraud, criminal activity, and financial… pic.twitter.com/yJjDgBqdBt — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 10, 2025 The Attorney General placed particular emphasis on stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets such as the US dollar. She called on lawmakers to establish regulations mandating that stablecoin issuers have a US presence and support their tokens with US dollars or treasuries. James described how stablecoins facilitate the exchange of value among various cryptocurrencies but, in the absence of regulation, can be manipulated and create fraud. She also demanded greater protections from crypto scams that have resulted in tremendous financial losses. “Thousands of New Yorkers and investors nationwide have lost millions of dollars to cryptocurrency scams and fraud that can be avoided with more robust federal regulations,” James said. James actually cautioned against having digital assets in retirement accounts like IRAs. She contended that cryptocurrencies are too volatile and risky for retirement savings plans, citing the extreme price fluctuations of Bitcoin as proof of instability capable of injuring the financial well-being of individuals, especially retirees relying on savings. This is because financial institutions like Fidelity began offering crypto IRA options to clients. In addition to investor protection, James also contended that thorough crypto regulations would enhance national security. She explained that cryptocurrency purchases are usually anonymous and used for criminal activities, thus necessitating the government to implement stringent rules mandating crypto firms to register with regulators and adhere to anti-money laundering protocols.

Title: Bond market moves raise fears of growing bets against America

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Government bonds have been selling off while stocks have plunged. That’s unusual, and it’s raising concerns that global investors are losing some of their long-standing confidence in America. Stocks are generally seen as a risky type of asset, while bonds are known as a “safe haven,” with the two typically moving in opposite directions. That’s because government bonds — a type of security sold to help finance expenditures, to be paid back to buyers with interest over a set period — are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The same can’t be said for publicly traded companies and their share prices. So when stock markets are booming and investors are excited to bet on the performance of American businesses, demand for lower-risk bonds dries up. During times of turbulence, the reverse usually happens. We don’t know exactly why bonds are gyrating so much. Barclays Analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha Instead, the two markets have seen simultaneous sell-offs. The premier U.S. government bond, the 10-year Treasury note, saw its yield surge above 4.5% this week. Bond prices and yields are inversely correlated, so rising yields signal lower appetite for the bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield ended the week more than 12% higher, while the S&P 500 closed out a week of volatile trading up 5.7%, rebounding late Friday after a series of brutal losses. “We don’t know exactly why bonds are gyrating so much,” Barclays analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha said in a note to clients Friday that he titled “This is not normal.” Soaring yields on 10- and 30-year Treasurys make it costlier for the federal government to borrow money. It’s also bad news for consumers because the 10-year note’s yield is directly linked to rates for mortgages, credit cards and personal and business loans. “This matters to nearly all Americans,” said Natalie Colley, a partner and financial planner at the New York-based firm Francis Financial. “Gone are the days of a pension,” she said, referring to the more than 70 million U.S. savers with access to 401(k) retirement accounts tied to markets. Volatility on Wall Street has unnerved many account holders in recent weeks, forcing some financial planners to do double duty as therapists to rattled clients. “If Treasurys are not a safe-haven asset, that has major implications for balance sheets across the board — businesses, nonprofits, pensions, households,” said Ernie Tedeschi, a former top economist in the Biden administration who’s now the director of economics at Yale University’s Budget Lab. “So much of world finance is predicated on U.S. Treasurys being safe.” He called recent bond market trends “the most concerning piece of data since the tariffs began.” “It’s showing a deterioration in confidence in the U.S.’s place in the world,” he said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has pushed back against such concerns, telling Fox Business on Wednesday, “There is nothing systemic about this. I think that it is an uncomfortable but normal deleveraging that’s going on in the bond market.” But experts see warning signs elsewhere, too. The value of the dollar relative to other global currencies has nosedived. This week it suffered its biggest drop since 2022 and ended Friday at its lowest level since September. “Everything in the U.S. is not doing well right now,” Kyla Scanlon, a financial educator and author of “In This Economy?: How Money and Markets Really Work,” told her TikTok followers this week. “The U.S. dollar is getting crushed.” She chalked up the currency’s decline to “the erratic trade policy that we’ve seen,” adding: “Markets don’t believe that the U.S. has a stable or clear economic plan.” Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, flagged similar concerns. “Normally when you see big tariff increases, I would have expected the dollar to go up. The fact that the dollar is going down at the same time I think lends some more credibility to the story of investor preferences shifting,” he told CNBC on Friday. There are several other possible explanations. One has to do with the way hedge funds bet on bond markets. Another could be that investors are anticipating a run-up in inflation and demanding higher interest rates now so they don’t lose money in the future. “Maybe they feel, or the market feels, that the actions around tariffs are actually going to create upward inflationary pressure,” said Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth, an advisory firm in New York. “That very well could be part of the puzzle here.” Even experts who are more hesitant to assign a cause to the bond sell-off say geopolitical factors are hard to ignore. So much of world finance is predicated on U.S. Treasurys being safe. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics, yale budget lab “The idea of other countries turning away from America, I don’t want to go down that rabbit hole necessarily,” said Lee Baker, founder of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta. “But in this particular instance, America turned away from everybody else” with steep new trade barriers. For now, Baker and other wealth advisers are cautioning clients not to react hastily to the recent volatility. Younger investors who aren’t close to retirement — and typically have less exposure to the bond market — should stay the course, Colley said. “Making sure that you’re in an appropriate asset allocation for your stage in life” and building up some emergency savings can help create a “financial moat that will insulate any investor at any point in their investing career from feeling panic around what’s going on in the stock market,” she said. If possible, she recommends keeping at least six months’ of cash on hand for a rainy day. Older retirement savers can consider some protective measures, Baker said. His firm has been building buffer exchange-traded funds — so-called “defined-outcome” ETFs tied to options contracts — into clients’ portfolios. These funds tend to be more expensive and typically cap potential gains, but they offer robust downside protections and have seen a recent surge in interest. BlackRock launched a new iShares buffer ETF earlier this year, billing it as a way of “mitigating risk while participating in market growth.” Baker added that “there’s a whole lot of other stuff in the world beyond stocks and bonds” to consider investing in, such as real estate, infrastructure and private equity. But he cautioned that it’s usually a good idea to consult a qualified adviser first, partly to avoid making important money moves out of fear. “It’s probably not a good idea to go whole hog in any of these,” he said, “but we can certainly reduce your downside while giving you some upside with a combination of these things.” J.J.

Title: US Treasuries suddenly trading like risky assets

Billed on Wall Street as so rock-solid safe that they are risk-free, US Treasury bonds have long served as first port of call for investors during times of panic. They rallied during the global financial crisis, on 9/11 and even when America’s own credit rating was cut. But now, as President Donald Trump unleashes an all-out assault on global trade, their status as the world’s safe haven is increasingly coming into question. Yields, especially on longer-term debt, have surged in recent days while the dollar has plunged. Even more disconcerting is the pattern of the recent market moves. Investors have often dumped 10- and 30-year Treasuries — pushing prices down and yields up — at the very same time they frantically sold stocks, crypto and other risky assets. The inverse is also true, with Treasuries rising in unison with them. They are trading, in other words, a little like a risky asset themselves. Or, as former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers says, like the debt of an emerging-market country. Even if this dynamic was to fade as swings in stocks eventually normalise, as most analysts expect, a message has been delivered to policymakers in Washington: Investor confidence in US bonds can no longer be taken for granted — not after a years-long borrowing binge that swelled its debt load and not with a president in the White House hell-bent on rewriting the rules at home and abroad and antagonising, in the process, many of the country’s biggest creditors. This has profound implications for the global financial system. As the world’s “risk-free” asset, Treasuries are used as a benchmark to determine the price of everything from stocks to sovereign bonds to mortgage rates, while serving as collateral for trillions of dollars of lending a day. Treasuries and the dollar get their strength from “the world’s perception of the competence of American fiscal and monetary management and the solidity of American political and financial institutions,” said Jim Grant, the founder of Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, a widely followed financial newsletter. “Possibly, the world is reconsidering.” Friday was more evidence of the same. As US stocks opened the session lower, 30-year yields were surging, touching as high as 4.99%. As shares advanced into the afternoon session, long bonds rallied in tandem. “Treasuries are not behaving as a safe haven,” said ING rates strategist Padhraic Garvey. “If we were to slip into recession there is a path there for yields to revert lower. But the here and now is painting Treasuries as a tainted product, and that’s not comfortable territory. Treasuries have proved to be a pain trade too.” “Treasuries are losing their haven status. Capital is leaving the US at an increasing rate as the dollar’s reserve-currency standing is diminished, and the risk of a recession raises the likelihood of an inflation-stoking a double-digit fiscal deficit,” said Simon White, a macro strategist with Bloomberg. But not everyone is convinced that investors are losing faith in the safety of US government debt. Benson Durham, head of global asset allocation at Piper Sandler and a former Federal Reserve economist, has done his own analysis comparing key Treasury-market metrics to those in Europe. Some measures suggest investors have demanded less of a premium to own US debt relative to German and UK bonds in recent days, he said. “People are right to kind of worry about this general economic management,” Durham said. But “it’s not clear to me, at least not yet, that this is an episode where people are particularly penalising US assets.” (Story continues below) Traders work on the floor of the American Stock Exchange at the New York Stock Exchange headquarters on April 11. (Photo: Bloomberg) There are suggestions in markets, albeit lacking the hard evidence to back them up, that Treasuries may have fallen because China is selling or shunning them. Some debate whether Beijing might eventually dump US debt as a response to the US tariffs. Others say more technical factors are behind the selloff in the long-end. There are signs that hedge funds have been unwinding leveraged trades that capitalise on price differences between Treasuries and interest-rate swaps or futures contracts. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent backed that view in an appearance on Fox Business earlier this week. “I believe that there is nothing systemic about this — I think that it is an uncomfortable but normal deleveraging that’s going on in the bond market,” said Bessent, who on taking office advertised lower 10-year borrowing costs as an ambition. An auction of 30-year bonds on Thursday also saw investors snap up $22 billion worth of the debt, supporting the argument that Treasuries continue to be attractive even during the selloff. That’s not to say that markets are behaving as usual, however. Through Thursday US stocks had plunged 7% since Trump announced plans to ramp up tariffs on dozens of countries on April 2. Rather than tumble, 30-year yields actually rose around 40 basis points in the span, only the fifth time in data going back to the 1970s that moves of this magnitude have occurred simultaneously. A raft of traders and hedge fund strategies have struggled to navigate the recent volatility, leading to steep losses. The surge in yields also poses a risk to Trump’s stated goal of cutting taxes while reining in the US budget deficit, and was at least in part behind his decision Wednesday to announce a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for dozens of countries. “Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards,” Summers, who is also a paid Bloomberg contributor, wrote this week in a social media post. “We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market,” he said, adding that “this could set off all kinds of vicious spirals, given government debts and deficits and dependence on foreign purchasers.” If foreign investors do decide to continue retreating from US assets, the pain could be substantial. They hold about $7 trillion in Treasuries, $19 trillion of equities and $5 trillion of corporate debt, accounting for about 20% to 30% of the total market, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management Inc. If recent history is any guide, a buyers’ strike may have long-lasting repercussions for US borrowing costs. Just three years ago, investor pushback against UK Prime Minister Liz Truss’s unfunded tax cuts fuelled a surge in yields the country has yet to recover from, while the pound has never fully bounced back from the Brexit vote in 2016. “There is a distrust by the market created by the on-off tariffs, and that definitely adds an uncertainty premium,” said Shamil Gohil, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International. “Large fiscal deficits will lead to continued concerns on debt sustainability which will likely require some risk premium to hold Treasuries.” Nathan Thooft, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, said Treasuries still dominate global markets in terms of quality and depth, but acknowledged that recent events have chipped away at investor confidence. “Much of the challenge we have seen over the last decade have been policy dynamics or geopolitical dynamics that were driven outside of the United States,” he said. “It’s a different dynamic this time, which is causing people to be less confident in US assets, both on the equity side and on the fixed-income side. There has probably been some permanent damage.” It’s also different this time because the Fed, worried about how tariffs could fuel a jump in inflation, is less likely to bail out the bond market by lowering rates anytime soon. “You can’t count on” long-term Treasuries as a hedge, said Russell Brownback, a portfolio manager at BlackRock Inc. “That is the fixed-income regime we are in now.”

Title: The global impact of Trump’s trade war and how China can win…by losing

May be Beijing and Washington have taken up their battle positions and are firing at each other, but we should be clear that in such an extended war the consequences will affect everyone and there is a very serious possibility that the changes will not only be economic… If someone three months ago presented as realistic the scenario of the White House deciding to re-draw the global “deck” at the risk of bringing decades-old enemies to the same table to discuss how to deal with their until recently most important ally, it would have caused the least smirk. Yet the fact that Japan and South Korea on their own initiative are in discussions on a new joint engagement project in Asia with China shows the extent not of the theoretical concern but the real dimension of the problem. When the world’s largest fund manager – BlackRock – officially and especially publicly declares that the US is currently the main agent of instability in the world with the policies it chooses, then the issue is much deeper and more serious than announcements and tariff rates. The markets in the US have decided to send a clear message to the Administration immediately and that is why we are also seeing significant changes in US bond yields which are at 5% for the first time since 2020 and the serious consequences – and economic – that the pandemic has brought with it. Behind these particular moves, in fact, it seems that China, which is the world’s second largest holder of US debt, is not – at least not yet – behind them. Donald Trump may not have made a public appearance yesterday as he was in hospital for hours for his scheduled annual health check that every President goes through but through the White House spokeswoman he indicated that even now what he is waiting for is for Beijing to pick up the phone to negotiate. What is expressed as a wish from the oval office is unlikely to happen, at least not immediately, as China for its part appears ready to bear the costs – at least to some extent – that will result from US economic “fire”. Beijing also appears to have prepared an initial contingency plan to deal with possible consequences of factory closures or shutdowns in the country, and it is not out of the question for China to turn to more significant measures against the US if Trump insists on increasing pressure. Outside of China, however, there is significant – unprecedented for this century, analysts note – mobility around the world at the political and diplomatic level. The visit of the Prime Minister of Spain to Beijing may not have been “over-analysed”, but it is indicative that in the Union member states, beyond the common line, have chosen to move individually in order to reduce as quickly as possible the risks of recession that are visible to all. China, which seems to be taking a wait-and-see attitude, stating that “we will not continue the tariff game”, seems to have a clear plan to cover – or at least attempt to do so – the gaps that the US has diplomatically and politically chosen to leave, especially in Europe. What is produced in the first year from these meetings may be “small” or even unworthy of political analysis, but in the big picture of the future it is the beginning of discussions with a country that the US has traditionally isolated with the political and long-standing solid alliances it has built over 8 decades… Today Beijing has the opportunity again by paying a heavy price to find itself in a different diplomatic and political position. A position that may in the long run also require significant structural changes from Beijing itself, but ultimately a position that brings the country officially into the limelight as the second major pole of the world. With Trump’s manipulations, China gains – by losing – its official position and recognition at the “table” of the world’s greats. Explore related questions

Title: Trump puts US dollar’s role as dominant world currency up for grabs

The US dollar, by historical norms, is living it large well into borrowed time. Since 1450, only five other powers have enjoyed having a currency that dominated global trade and, in more recent centuries, the vaults of the world’s central banks: Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands (known as the Dutch Republic at the time), France and Britain. Each reign lasted an average of less than 95 years. The dollar took over in the early 1920s, according to many academics, even if it would be the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 that established the postwar international financial system and cemented the greenback’s supremacy. The demise of the dollar has been called many times in recent decades as persistent budget deficits have led to soaring US government debt. Borrowings have tripled over the past 15 years alone, to about $36 trillion (€31.6 trillion). But inertia and what economists call “network effects” – where governments, businesses and banks continue to use a currency because everybody else does – kept such predictions in check. The dollar’s slump against most major currencies since Donald Trump announced his ‘Liberation Day’ raft of tariffs last week has reignited the debate. It has fallen by as much as 5.7 per cent against the euro, with most of the sell-off occurring since Trump paused most of the charges on Wednesday evening, spooked by volatility on the bond market. Could this time be different? “I think we are at the start of the end [of the dollar era], but only at a start,” Vincent Mortier, chief investment officer at Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, told The Irish Times on Friday. “But the issue, right now, is: what are the available alternatives?” The benefits of being the reserve currency have been many. It’s given the US and its citizens greater buying power and access to lower borrowing rates – boosting economic growth – than they might otherwise enjoy. The dollar’s centrality to the global payments system has strengthened the US’s diplomatic power, making it easier to impose and enforce financial sanctions against countries, individuals and entities that it has problems with. About a quarter of the US’s $36 trillion debt is owned by foreign investors. Mortier sees the percentage held by domestic players, including retail investors, increasing amid signals from Trump’s officials that they would like to ease bank capital reserves rules so they could hold more US bonds and potential incentives encourage retail investors to buy government debt. This might allow a country – such as Japan, whose bonds are about 88 per cent owned by domestic investors – to run higher debt burdens than would otherwise be tolerated by the markets. “But the side effect is that the US dollar – and buying power – will continue to weaken,” says Mortier. Some argue that bitcoin, the teenage granddaddy of cryptocurrencies, will be reserve currency of the future. Indeed, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, posited in his annual letter to shareholders last week that this is a risk if the US doesn’t get its debt under control The main driver of the renewed market pressure on the dollar in recent days has been the escalation of the US-China trade war, with the White House clarifying on Thursday that total tariffs on China would now be 145 per cent, even as it has reduced tariffs on the rest of the world to 10 per cent – for 90 days. “The question of a potential dollar confidence crisis has now been definitively answered – we are experiencing one in full force,” said Francesco Pesole, a foreign exchange strategist at ING. Large questions marks hang over whether the US can strike a flurry of trade agreements with other nations before the 90 days are out. “There has been little respite for the dollar,” said Deutsche Bank strategists in a note on Friday, “as markets continue to reassess how much of the historical premium for US assets stemming from American exceptionalism is still justified under the radical vision and volatile policy of the new US administration.” There are no obvious successors, however. The euro may be the world’s second most traded currency and number two in the stockpiles of monetary authorities. But the euro zone doesn’t have a proper capital markets union – despite the European Commission’s best efforts over the past decade – let alone a fiscal union. The euro-zone debt crisis hasn’t helped. The euro accounted for less than 20 per cent of global reserves last year, down from peak of almost 28 per cent in 2009, according to International Monetary Fund data. The dollar accounts for about 58 per cent of global reserves. The big problem with adopting the renminbi, which makes up just 2.2 per cent of global reserves despite China being the world’s second-largest economy, is the country’s lack of rule of law and its one-party state. Some argue that bitcoin, the teenage granddaddy of cryptocurrencies, will be reserve currency of the future. Indeed, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, posited in his annual letter to shareholders last week that this is a risk if the US doesn’t get its debt under control. But bitcoin has a long way to go to establish itself as a store of value. Over the past six months alone it has almost doubled in price to peak at more than $109,000 before falling back by a third. “Instead of a radical transformation, we believe currency reserves are likely to go through an evolutionary process,” said Atul Bhatia, an investment strategist at RBC Wealth Management, in a report this week. “Falling trade will lead to slower global growth and declining reserve needs, but the reduction will likely be done passively. Some countries may choose to rebalance part of their holdings away from the dollar, but the lack of ‘safe’ investment options for non-dollar currencies will act as a constraint, in our opinion.” For Mortier at Amundi, too, there is unlikely to be one winner, but a broader spread of currencies in reserves, to include the euro, pound, Swiss franc, renminbi and Japanese yen – along with the dollar. “We are at a pivotal moment of structural shift that is very important for the world, for the global economy,” he said. “And what is happening now is a kind of acceleration ... of the US losing its status as the only superpower.” Joe Brennan is Markets Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday raised concerns over the possible negative growth of the US economy and a looming recession as the trade war escalates. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said in an interview with CNBC. As US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on April 2, fears of economic slowdown arose along with a sell-off in the stock market. On Wednesday, Trump declared a 90-day pause on tariffs, which will not help much to restore the US economy, according to Fink. “I think you’re going to see, across the board, just a slowdown until there’s more certainty. And we now have a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs — that means longer, more elevated uncertainty,” he said. According to Fink, the US economy is at risk in the short run, while he pinned hopes on artificial intelligence and advanced infrastructure to provide “transformative investment opportunities.” to enable economic growth in the long run. On Friday, Fink addressed the reciprocal tariff announcement on a call with analysts after the company reported first-quarter financial results. “The sweeping US tariff announcements went beyond anything I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance,” the BlackRock CEO said. Fink is not the first CEO to warn about the possibility of a recession. JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon raised alarm over a looming recession, saying the odds of a recession in the US are at 50 per cent. Previously, the JPMorgan Chase CEO also told Fox Business that a recession is a “likely outcome” of raising tariffs. “I am going to defer to my economists at this point, but I think probably that's (recession) a likely outcome,” he said. Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted that a trade war may lead to higher inflation and slower growth. "We face a highly uncertain outlook with elevated risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation," he said. “We are rapidly headed towards recession,” Peter Tchir, head of macro strategies at Academy Securities told Bloomberg. “The world was prepared for ‘reciprocal tariffs.’ Whatever the abomination that was launched at the Rose Garden was, it is a disaster — mostly for the US, but also for the global economy," Tchir added. “If the 25% tariff is fully implemented quickly and largely maintained, and US trading partners retaliate approximately tit-for-tat, the U.S. and global economies will not suffer a depression, but they will suffer serious recessions,” Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody’s Analytics wrote on X. “The recession will hit imminently and extend until next year. Real GDP will fall close to 2% peak to trough, and unemployment will increase from its current 4% to 7.5% at its peak next year. I attach a 15% probability to this dark scenario,” Zandi added. On April 2, Donald Trump unveiled steep reciprocal tariffs on several countries and later paused them for 90 days on Wednesday. After the tariffs were first announced, global markets witnessed a severe selloff, which was later recovered on the announcement of 90-day pause.

Title: What’s Bitcoin nav?

Time Published: 2025-04-11T23:30:02Z
Full Content:
market net asset value Never stop learning about bitcoin: In the image you provided from Strategy.com, the term “Bitcoin NAV” refers to the Net Asset Value of Bitcoin-related assets held by MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company known for its significant investment in Bitcoin. Here’s a detailed breakdown: What Bitcoin NAV Means Here Additional Context Comparison to Your Previous Query In your earlier question about “Bitcoin NAV,” I interpreted it as referring to the Net Asset Value per share of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), which was $66.21 as of April 11, 2025. That context was about an investment fund’s per-share value. Here, however, “Bitcoin NAV” refers to the total value of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings, not a per-share value of an ETF. The different contexts explain the difference in interpretation. Summary Let me know if you’d like to dive deeper into MicroStrategy’s financials or Bitcoin strategy! . Key Points What is Bitcoin NAV? Bitcoin NAV, or Net Asset Value, typically relates to Bitcoin investment funds like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). It represents the per-share value of the fund’s assets, primarily Bitcoin, minus liabilities. This is important for investors tracking the fund’s performance compared to its market price. Current Value Based on the most recent data from the Grayscale website, the NAV per share for GBTC is $66.21 as of April 11, 2025. This value reflects the fund’s holdings of Bitcoin at current market prices, adjusted for expenses. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Bitcoin NAV Bitcoin NAV, or Net Asset Value, is a term predominantly associated with investment vehicles that hold Bitcoin, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). These funds allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly purchasing the cryptocurrency, and their NAV per share is a critical metric for understanding the fund’s value. This section provides a comprehensive exploration of what Bitcoin NAV entails, its current value, and the context surrounding its calculation, drawing from various sources to ensure accuracy and depth. Understanding Bitcoin NAV NAV is a standard measure in the investment world, representing the total value of a fund’s assets minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. For Bitcoin-focused ETFs like GBTC, the NAV per share is calculated based on the value of the Bitcoin held by the fund, less any operational expenses or liabilities. This value is typically updated daily and can differ from the market price at which shares trade, leading to premiums or discounts. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), launched in 2013, is one of the oldest and most recognized Bitcoin investment products in the U.S. It transitioned to a spot Bitcoin ETP listed on NYSE Arca in 2024, offering shares through a registered basis. According to the Grayscale website (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF), the fund’s investment objective is to reflect the value of Bitcoin held, less expenses, which directly influences its NAV per share. The website notes that NAV per Share is not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), with a separate GAAP NAV per Share also provided for accounting purposes. Another notable Bitcoin ETF is the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), managed by BlackRock, which also calculates its NAV based on the value of Bitcoin held, using the CF Benchmarks Index as specified in its prospectus (iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF). Both funds are subject to market fluctuations, as their NAV per share is tied to Bitcoin’s price, which can be highly volatile. Current NAV Per Share for GBTC As of April 11, 2025, the NAV per Share for GBTC, based on data from the Grayscale website, is $66.21, with a GAAP NAV per Share of $66.22. This information is found in the “Daily Performance” section of the website, ensuring it reflects the most recent valuation. The slight difference between NAV and GAAP NAV per Share is due to accounting methodologies, with the standard NAV per Share being the more commonly referenced figure for market purposes. To contextualize this, each share of GBTC represents a specific amount of Bitcoin. According to the Grayscale website, as of the latest data, there are 240,750,100 shares outstanding, with a total of 190,171.4309 Bitcoin in the trust, resulting in approximately 0.00078991 Bitcoin per share. Given the NAV per Share of $66.21, this implies an implied Bitcoin price of approximately $83,812.75 per Bitcoin ($66.21 / 0.00078991), which aligns closely with recent market prices reported by platforms like Coinbase, where Bitcoin was valued at around $83,213.75 on April 9, 2025 (Coinbase Bitcoin Price). Comparison with Other Bitcoin ETFs For comparison, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) had a closing price of $45.17 on April 10, 2025, with a slight discount of -0.04%, suggesting an NAV per Share of approximately $45.18, calculated from net assets of $45,404,653,307 and 1,004,800,000 shares outstanding. This lower NAV per Share reflects differences in fund size, management fees, and the amount of Bitcoin per share, but it underscores that GBTC is often more prominently associated with “bitcoin NAV” in public discourse due to its longer history and market presence. Potential Misinterpretations It’s worth noting that “NAV” could theoretically be confused with other metrics, such as the network value of Bitcoin or the price of Navcoin (a separate cryptocurrency, now rebranded as Navio), but search results consistently point to NAV in the context of Bitcoin funds. For instance, a currency converter from Bitcoin to Navcoin (Bitcoin to NAV Coin Converter) was identified, but this is distinct from the NAV of Bitcoin investment funds. Given the user’s query, it seems most likely they are referring to GBTC’s NAV per Share, given its prominence in search results and historical context. Market Context and Premium/Discount The NAV per Share is not always equal to the market price at which shares trade. For GBTC, on April 11, 2025, the market price was $66.27, resulting in a premium of 0.09%, indicating the shares were trading slightly above their NAV. This premium or discount is a common phenomenon for closed-end funds and ETFs, influenced by supply and demand dynamics. For example, YCharts provides analysis on GBTC’s discount or premium to NAV (GBTC Discount or Premium to NAV), highlighting historical trends since 2015, which can help investors understand how the fund trades relative to its underlying value. Conclusion Given the evidence, “bitcoin NAV” most likely refers to the NAV per Share of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), which stands at $66.21 as of April 11, 2025. This value is derived from the fund’s holdings of Bitcoin, adjusted for expenses, and is a key metric for investors. While other Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT exist, GBTC’s long-standing presence and association with the term in search results make it the primary candidate for this query. The alignment with implied Bitcoin prices further validates this interpretation, ensuring the response is both accurate and relevant for the user’s needs.

Title: A wild week of tariff swings leaves consumers and Wall Street on edge
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-tariffs-pause-stock-market-volatility-what-happened-this-week-rcna200922
Time Published: 2025-04-11T22:20:50Z
Full Content:
Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Tariffs were on, then they were off. At least temporarily, and only some of them — but not for China, which got hit with steeper duties and promptly hit back. Wall Street reeled, then rebounded to its strongest weekly gain in well over a year. The past week has seen a head-spinning series of U.S. trade policy changes that economists, investors and ordinary consumers increasingly worry will drive up inflation or even trigger a recession. “The economy is facing considerable turbulence,” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday, when the bank reported strong earnings while warning of pitfalls ahead. Both JPMorgan — which sees 50-50 odds of a recession this year — and Morgan Stanley saw revenues jump from stock trading activity as investors raced to adjust their holdings in the face of growing uncertainty. The major U.S. stock indexes ended on a high Friday after a volatile week of massive losses and gains. The eleventh-hour rebound came after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt signaled that President Donald Trump is “optimistic” for a trade deal with China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 4.9% on the week, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished up 7.3%. The S&P 500 had its best week since November 2023, ending up 5.7%. That broad-based index was still down 5.5% since April 1, the day before Trump unveiled a sweeping slate of fresh tariffs. While much of those new import taxes have been reduced for a few months, market watchers and finance executives say major economic headwinds remain. “Timely resolution which benefits the U.S. would be good for businesses, consumers and the markets,” Wells Fargo told investors Friday about the global trade tensions. In the meantime, “we expect continued volatility and uncertainty and are prepared for a slower economic environment in 2025,” the bank said. Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, told CNBC on Friday that he thinks the U.S. economy is “very close, if not in, a recession now.” (An official determination on that front can only be made by a panel of experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research, usually months after the fact.) Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, plunged 11% since last month, according to a reading Friday by the University of Michigan, the measure’s fourth straight month of declines. “Consumers report multiple warning signs that raise the risk of recession: expectations for business conditions, personal finances, incomes, inflation, and labor markets all continued to deteriorate this month,” the researchers wrote. The survey was conducted before Trump changed his mind on the tariffs he’d unveiled just a week earlier, covering nearly 90 countries. He said he came to the decision because more than 75 of them didn’t retaliate and reached out to negotiate. The temporary policy rollback, however, doesn’t apply to China. After Trump announced he was hiking tariffs on the country to 145%, Beijing retaliated Friday with 125% duties on U.S. goods. Investors say they aren’t sure exactly how the global trade picture will shake out. Morgan Stanley said in a note Friday that Trump’s 90-day reprieve “merely extends policy uncertainty” and leaves effective tariff rates at century-long highs. “While any delay of tariffs is beneficial on the margin, it is not the same as their removal,” they wrote. “History suggests that elevated and prolonged uncertainty that weighs on business confidence can have detrimental effects on business spending and hiring.” Inflation eased more than anticipated in March, dipping to an annual rate of 2.4% in government figures published Thursday, and wholesale prices also cooled unexpectedly last month. But analysts were quick to discount the encouraging data. “That was nice, but don’t get used to it,” Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst, said in a statement Thursday, citing widespread signs of unease across the consumer economy. Experts are already warning that common purchases — from clothing and auto parts to grocery staples like coffee, nuts and seafood — remain on track to get pricier in the months ahead from tariffs. Price hikes are also in store for items extensively produced in China, including toys, video game consoles and electronics. Barclays analysts said Thursday that retail and import data suggests many consumers “have front-run these tariffs to some extent by making heavy purchases in February and March,” looking to snag Chinese-made gadgets and other items produced abroad before prices rise. Foot traffic at warehouse clubs jumped nearly 10% in the last week of March, days before Trump’s April 2 tariff rollout, according to Placer.ai tracking data, which the company said could indicate a race to stock up. The Barclays researchers said they expect price pressures to moderate over the course of the year “as firms trade less with China and source from the rest of the world, where we expect the average tariff to remain close to 10%.” But the bank still foresees inflation climbing to 4.1% overall by the end of this year. “The economic tariff Armageddon unleashed by Trump last week has been the dark black cloud over stocks since this fiasco began,” Wedbush Securities analysts wrote in a note to clients Friday. The impact has mainly been felt on Wall Street so far, they said, but “that is all about to change.” Rich Bellis is Senior Business Editor at NBC News.

Title: US consumer sentiment tumbles as trade war fears grow

Expectations of rising unemployment hit the highest level since 2009. United States consumer sentiment plunged in April, marking the fourth month in a row of declines – widely seen as a pointed reaction to President Donald Trump’s escalating trade wars, which have fuelled concerns over potential job losses and rising inflation. The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s closely watched consumer sentiment index, released Friday, fell 11 percent in March to 50.8 percent, the lowest since the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past year, sentiment tumbled 34 percent. The decline was “pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation”, Survey of Consumers director Joanne Hsu said in a public statement. The share of respondents expecting unemployment to rise in the coming months increased for the fifth straight month and is now the highest since 2009, during the Great Recession. While consumer sentiment is not always a reliable indicator of the overall economy, it has at times reflected shifting vibes in how the public feels about presidential leadership. Sentiment among Republicans has dropped 6 percent over the past month as Trump teased, then rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs, only to institute a 90-day pause of some import taxes Wednesday. “Interestingly, President Trump appears to be getting much of the blame for much of the deterioration in sentiment with 67 percent of respondents saying the government is doing a ‘poor job’ on fighting inflation and unemployment,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING told The Associated Press (AP) news agency. “Only 18 percent say it is doing a ‘good job’.” Asked at Friday’s news briefing about the falling consumer sentiment, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt advised that the public should trust in Trump as he executes his tariffs plan. “As he said, this is going to be a period of transition,” she said. “He wants consumers to trust in him, and they should trust in him.” The result of the trade war drama so far is a baseline tariff on most countries of 10 percent, with imports from China getting taxed at a combined 145 percent. Goods from Canada and Mexico face tariffs of up to 25 percent, while imported autos, steel and aluminium are taxed at that same rate. China retaliated Wednesday with a 125 percent tariff on US goods. The Trump administration has suggested that it will cut new trade agreements with more than 75 nations over a span of 90 days. “We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY,” Trump said Friday on his social media site Truth Social. “Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly.” Eroding American confidence has also surfaced in the financial markets. Investors are selling off US debt. The interest rate on the 10-year US Treasury note was 4.51 percent in Friday afternoon trading, up from roughly 4 percent at the start of the week. That suggests more economic instability ahead. On Friday, the dollar slumped to a three-year low against the euro. Larry Fink, CEO of the investment firm BlackRock, told the financial news network CNBC that the US economy is on the cusp of a downturn, if not already there. “I think we’re very close, if not in a recession now,” Fink said. The University of Michigan sentiment survey found that people now expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4 percent, up from 4.1 percent last month, a move that may be of particular concern for the US Federal Reserve. The Fed pays close attention to inflation expectations because they can become self-fulfilling. If people expect prices to rise, they often take steps that can push up prices, such as accelerating purchases or seeking higher wages. It’s a sign that most of the public views as a blip this week showing that consumer inflation declined in March to an annual rate of 2.4 percent. Most economists believe that, given the intensifying trade wars, inflation is likely to be reignited. Americans’ inflation expectations over the next five years are now at the highest since 1991, according to Capital Economics, a forecasting firm. “Households appear to have come to the same conclusion as markets: The tariffs will do lasting damage to the US economy,” Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in an email to the AP. Consumer sentiment remains sharply divided by party, with the index for Democrats at 34.1 and Republicans at 81.9. Yet both recorded steep drops in April. Sentiment among independents plunged to 46.8 from 55.7 and is sharply below its post-election peak of 70.2. The April reading among independents is now lower than it was at any point during Joe Biden’s presidency. Those inflation expectations have now jumped for several months. At a news conference last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the University of Michigan’s inflation expectations measure was an “outlier”. Market-based measures of inflation expectations, based on inflation-adjusted Treasury securities, have remained low, near the Fed’s 2 percent target. Typically, falling sentiment suggests that Americans will cut back on spending, though in recent years, consumers have at times kept spending despite the gloom. Still, the fact that worries about employment are rising could lead to more caution by consumers. Follow Al Jazeera English:

This week: Robinhood and MARA Holdings were the only two crypto stocks that ended the week in the green; Coinbase gets competition for its custody biz; and why GDP isn’t all that interesting for asset managers. Green shoots for Robinhood and MARA Trading platform Robinhood and Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings managed to end what’s been another rollercoaster five days for markets higher than they were this time last week. Robinhood, which trades under the HOOD ticker on the Nasdaq, was changing hands for $42.75 two hours before the closing bell, after having gained 5.8% since last Friday. And this is the same week that Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock, citing concerns over the company’s reliance on transaction-based revenues. The bank reduced its price target from $90 to $40. So what is going in Robinhood’s favor? It’s likely not just down to the fact that President Donald Trump assured investors it was a “GREAT TIME TO BUY” right before he paused tariffs for 90 days and sent markets soaring. Wall Street analysts have flagged HOOD as a company that’ll experience some short-term pain as retail investors are likely to be hardest hit by economic woes, but they’re still optimistic about long-term potential. And, as an aside: It’ll be a while yet before HOOD shares are directly competing with eToro as a chill sweeps across all the would-be IPOs in 2025. Its rival, eToro, has been saying since the start of the year that it wanted to go public. It plans to use ETOR as its ticker, according to an SEC filing last week. Meanwhile, MARA, which also trades on the Nasdaq, was up 4.5% compared to last Friday and trading for $12.47 before markets closed. Virtually all crypto stocks spiked when President Donald Trump put a 90-day pause on punishing tariffs. But the Florida-based Bitcoin miner is the only one to still be looking better now than it was a week ago. The company reported a 6% month-to-month uptick in its Bitcoin production during March and captured 5.8% of possible miner rewards paid out during the period. But more importantly: It estimates it’ll complete its 40 megawatt Ohio data center in a few weeks. It’s yet another step towards vertical integration that could help lower operating costs—which is critically important for Bitcoin miners these days. The Bitcoin network difficulty just experienced a big spike, meaning that mining rigs will have to work harder to compete for each new block on the network, with each block paying out around $260,000 to the lucky miner. Coinbase gets custody competition Earlier this week, BlackRock added Anchorage Digital as an additional custodian for its iShares Bitcoin Trust and iShares Ethereum Trust spot ETFs. The funds trade on the Nasdaq under the IBIT and ETHA tickers, respectively. It sounds like a big deal, right? After all, the iShares crypto funds account for $45 billion worth of BTC and $1.7 billion worth of ETH. But as Decrypt reporter Andre Beganski found out, Coinbase’s custody business isn’t exactly raking in the dough. Following the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024, Coinbase's custodial fee revenue doubled to $142 million from $70 million the year prior, according to its most recent shareholder letter. To put that in perspective, it accounts for roughly 6% of the $2.3 billion in revenue Coinbase saw in Q4. The company’s largest single source of revenue remains the almighty dollar—or, rather, the Circle’s dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin. That’s because Coinbase has a deal with Circle to evenly split the interest earned on the cash and cash equivalents backing USDC stablecoins. GDP Is Old News Is the U.S. heading into a recession? And if it is, is the GDP really the best metric to figure that out? Yes and no. There’s a lot of attention being paid to the U.S. Commerce Department’s upcoming gross domestic product report—but really, it’s driven by political circles. Any sitting president would love to have a Great Big GDP number to point at, like an A+ on a report card. The GDP essentially tallies up receipts for goods and services that have already been sold. It’s a lagging indicator that, as CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill puts it, doesn’t warrant a lot of emphasis when asset managers are trying to gauge the health of the economy. And even if the Q1 GDP report doesn’t show that the country has entered a recession—Butterfill suspects it won’t—there are lots of other troubling indicators flashing red at the moment. “Notably, consumer confidence has dropped sharply, the NFIB small business surveys show increasing strain, and bankruptcy filings are up 13% year-over-year—approaching levels last seen during the COVID crisis,” Butterfill told Decrypt. “These challenges are likely to be compounded by the ongoing turmoil surrounding the liberation trade tariff dispute, though its impact will likely only become visible in Q2 data.” But the purchasing managers’ index, or PMI, is a forward-looking indicator that’s based on surveys. So what’s that saying? The S&P Global PMI showed growth in March, but a portion of it was a strategic increase in production to get ahead of Trump’s tariff tirade. S&P also found that, among those surveyed, business confidence has "deteriorated across the board” virtually everywhere. Except Russia!

Title: Wall Street CEOs Speak Out on Tariffs and Recession Fears on Earnings Calls

Wall Street is kicking off an earnings season against an exceptionally unusual economic backdrop. As financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), BlackRock (BLK) and Wells Fargo (WFC) reported first-quarter results today (April 11), their CEOs used the opportunity to sound off on the chaotic market impacts of the Trump administration’s tariff policy.

You can opt out anytime. “The economy is facing considerable turbulence,” said JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon in a statement accompanying the bank’s first-quarter earnings release that cited factors like tariffs and trade wars as “potential negatives.” The banks say their clients are exercising a wait-and-see strategy as they navigate the uncertain economic environment caused by the tariffs. “I was traveling in Europe last week when the sweeping U.S. tariff announcements went beyond anything I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told analysts today, adding that anxiety about the future of the economy is “dominating each and every client conversation.” Market panic scaled down earlier this week after Trump announced a 90-day pause for much of the levies. While a 10 percent “baseline tariff” still remain in place. China was the only country not spared. On the contrary, the President has hiked up total tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent. “The China issue is a major issue,” Dimon said today during JPMorgan’s earnings call. “It’s a significant change that we’ve never seen in our lives.” He added that he is more worried about national security implications than economic fallout related to the tariffs. As the 10 percent universal tariffs stay in place and the standoff with China continues, the U.S. faces a 50/50 chance of a recession this year, Dimon said, citing JPMorgan economists’ latest forecast. Fink is even warier about the odds. “I think we’re very close, if not in a recession now,” he told CNBC today after BlackRock reported first-quarter earnings. Bank CEOs urge for the U.S. to strike trade agreements with tariffed nations as soon as possible. Despite noting that he supports the Trump administration’s “willingness to look at barriers to fair trade,” Charles Scharf, head of Wells Fargo, told analysts today that “timely resolution” would benefit businesses, consumers and markets alike. “This isn’t Wall Street vs. Main Street,” said Fink, who pointed to the retirement and college savings accounts of ordinary Americans as vulnerable to stock hits. While JPMorgan, BlackRock and Wells Fargo don’t import physical goods from China and other tariff-hit countries, they could still be caught in the crosshairs of the U.S.’s trade war with the rest of the world. Dimon conceded that it’s a tricky time to be a U.S. company conducting business abroad. “I do think some clients or some countries will feel differently about American banks and we’ll just have to deal with that,” he said. Fink noted that his firm plans to open more offices outside of the U.S. to continue operating “hyper-locally” across different regions. “We are Mexican in Mexico, Canadian in Canada, Dutch in the Netherlands, British in the U.K., Irish in Ireland, Japanese in Japan—this is not something new,” he said.

BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said he was caught by surprise at the breadth of President Donald Trump’s tariffs last week on many countries, including key US trading partners. “The sweeping US tariff announcements went beyond anything I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance,” Fink said on a call on Friday with analysts after the company reported first-quarter financial results. The president imposed the steepest tariffs in a century on April 2, sparking markets to sell off around the globe. On April 3 and 4, the S&P 500 Index had its steepest two-day plunge since the March 2020 onset of the pandemic. “This isn’t Wall Street versus Main Street,” Fink told analysts Friday. “The market downturn impacts millions of ordinary people’s retirement savings.” The US is either very close to a recession or already in one, Fink said in a CNBC interview after the analyst call. He said he was shocked at the 10-Year Treasury’s reaction in the wake of Trump’s tariffs. Trump partially backed down on his trade war Wednesday, calling for a 90-day pause on “reciprocal tariffs” while keeping 10% duties on most countries. But Trump hasn’t wavered on China, with tariffs of 145% on imports from that country. In the short run, inflationary pressures and anxiety dominate client discussions, according to Fink. Investors have put an all-time high — about $950 billion — in cash accounts at BlackRock as of April, money that could eventually be invested in stocks, bonds and private markets, he said. “Yes, in the short run, we have an economy that is at risk,” Fink said. But he added that artificial intelligence and surging infrastructure demand present “transformative investment opportunities.” Fink also raised the prospect that investors will allocate more money to Europe in the future.

As of March 31, the world’s largest asset manager held $50.3 billion worth in ETF digital assets, about $5 billion less than in the previous quarter, according to the release. Still, among asset managers, BlackRock remained the leader in inflows with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) adding $2.7 billion and $548 million in inflows, respectively, during the quarter. The combined $3.1 billion represents about 3% of net flows into BlackRock’s products in Q1. BlackRock currently has 463 products listed on the U.S. stock market, according to Stock Analysis. As of Friday, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF had nearly three times the AUM of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, totalling $45 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF had an AUM of $1.8 billion, less than the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF’s $3.46 billion footprint, although the latter is a conversion from an existing fund and has shed $4.1 billion since its ETF debut. Still, investors had less of an appetite for BlackRock’s crypto products in the first quarter amid a largely risk-off environment. Over the past 12 months, BlackRock’s crypto ETFs generated $30 billion worth of net inflows, averaging around $7.5 billion per quarter. IBIT has added about $39 billion in net inflows since its debut in January 2024. The price of Bitcoin fell 12% in the first quarter, representing the asset’s worst performance since the second quarter of last year. Ethereum’s price meanwhile collapsed 45%,its biggest plunge since Q2 2022), but BlackRock’s crypto ETFs still generated inflows. BlackRock, which first tapped Coinbase as a custodian for its crypto ETFs, recently turned to Anchorage Digital. BlackRock disclosed in filings earlier this week that it would now lean on the digital assets trust bank as an additional option for safeguarding digital assets.

Title: Consumer confidence craters as recession fears grow

U.S. consumers are growing deeply uneasy. According to preliminary data released Friday by the University of Michigan, consumer sentiment has declined 11% since March. This marks the fourth consecutive monthly decline and a 30% decrease since December 2024. Typically, consumer confidence shows a partisan tilt, with optimism rising under one’s preferred political party. However, the April decline was “pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation,” according to survey director Joanne Hsu. The downturn reflects rising concerns over inflation, interest rates, geopolitical instability, and abrupt domestic policy changes. Many respondents cited trade and tariff developments as potential economic headwinds — though the data was collected before President Donald Trump’s latest tariff revisions, which paused levies on select countries while increasing them on Chinese imports. “Consumers report multiple warning signs that raise the risk of recession,” Hsu noted, highlighting deteriorations in expectations for business conditions, household finances, incomes, inflation, and the labor market. Notably, the share of Americans expecting unemployment to rise in the year ahead has more than doubled since November 2024 and now sits at the highest level since 2009. While sentiment remains above its mid-2022 lows, this abrupt downturn in early 2025 marks a sharp reversal from gains in more recent years — and a sign that American households are bracing for more economic turbulence ahead. Recent warnings from top executives underscore the public’s growing unease. Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy said new tariffs are already prompting many third-party sellers to raise prices and driving shoppers to stockpile. Amazon is trying to soften the blow by stockpiling inventory and renegotiating supplier terms, but Jassy acknowledged that inflationary pressures are likely to ripple through the platform. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that the economy is facing “considerable turbulence,” highlighting risks from “sticky inflation,” high fiscal deficits, elevated asset prices, and escalating “tariffs and ‘trade wars.’” Appearing on CNBC (CMCSA) Friday, BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink echoed Dimon’s sentiments, saying that he expects a “slowdown” across the board, and that the U.S. may be in a recession soon — if it isn’t already.

Title: BlackRock’s crypto ETFs thrive in one of the toughest quarters with $3 billion inflow

BlackRock's crypto ETFs capture investor interest amid Bitcoin and Ethereum volatility. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, reported $3 billion in digital asset inflows during the first quarter of 2025 despite the volatility in the crypto market. The update came in the firm’s latest earnings report, which also revealed $84 billion in total net flows across its broader portfolio during the quarter. The performance was primarily fueled by record-breaking activity in BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which brought in $107 billion in net flows alone. Additional gains came from private markets and systematic active strategies, reflecting strong investor confidence in the firm’s broader offerings. Commenting on the results, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described the quarter as the firm’s best start to a year since 2021. Fink added: “We delivered 6% organic base fee growth in the first quarter, representing our best start to a year since 2021 and secular strength against a complex market backdrop. We are helping clients navigate market and policy changes, while also providing insights on long-term structural growth opportunities.” BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs comprised around 2.8% of total Q1 inflows. While that share remains modest, it’s significant given the market turbulence in early 2025. Bitcoin and Ethereum faced steep corrections, marking one of their most challenging quarters in recent memory. Despite the volatility, BlackRock’s crypto-related products played a pivotal role in what many analysts have called the most successful ETF rollout in financial history. The firm’s digital asset offerings have driven billions in liquidity to the crypto market, helping to soften the usual capital rotation cycles that dominate the space. As a result, the firm has begun expanding its crypto-related product offerings to other regions, including Canada and Europe. However, digital assets remain a relatively small part of BlackRock’s broader portfolio despite the momentum. As of March 31, 2025, the firm’s digital asset ETFs held $50.3 billion under management, just 0.5% of its total $11.6 trillion portfolio. These assets generated $34 million in base fees over the period. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: The CFO and Treasurer’s Guide to Digital Assets

Time Published: 2025-04-11T15:15:58Z

Highlights Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is quietly transforming capital markets, enabling greater efficiency, liquidity and automation through blockchain technology. RWAs offer CFOs and treasurers practical benefits over speculative crypto assets, including yield generation, liquidity management and collateralization, by anchoring digital tokens to tangible or cash-flow-generating assets. Despite growing interest, regulatory uncertainty remains a significant hurdle, with industry leaders and lawmakers recognizing the need for clearer frameworks to enable broader adoption of tokenized financial instruments. Blockchain technology was meant to disrupt payments and finance. But while the payments space, at least in the U.S., remains in waiting for a crypto-led transformation, it is across capital markets where traditional approaches are already undergoing a quiet on-chain revolution thanks to the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). With the news this week that private equity and insurance giant Apollo has made a strategic investment in Plume, a blockchain platform focused on RWAs, boardrooms and treasury offices are now paying closer attention to efficiencies gained by turning real-world assets into digital ones through tokenization. The Plume investment follows Apollo’s January partnership with RWA infrastructure provider Securitize to tokenize investment opportunities. As digital transformation reshapes capital markets, RWAs represent a potent convergence of blockchain technology and traditional finance. For chief financial officers (CFOs) and corporate treasurers charged with steering balance sheets, optimizing liquidity and mitigating risk, RWAs could offer both compelling opportunities as well as new layers of complexity. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which derive their value from consensus and scarcity, RWAs are anchored in real-world value and can often generate cash flow. For CFOs, this shift signals a move from speculative digital assets toward instruments that might be able to play tangible roles in liquidity management, yield generation and even collateralization strategies. Read also: Need for On-Chain Trust Grows as AI Agents Flood Crypto Real-world assets are tangible or intangible assets — such as U.S. Treasuries, real estate, invoices, carbon credits, securities or even art — that have been tokenized and placed on a blockchain. Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital token that represents ownership or a claim on an underlying asset. These digital representations are often embedded with smart contracts that automate compliance, yield disbursements and governance functions. Once these assets are tokenized, organizations and enterprises can take advantage of automated processes on various blockchains which can reduce transaction fees, streamline settlement times and enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, tokenizing traditionally illiquid assets makes them easier to buy, sell and trade on secondary markets. Major financial players, and not just Apollo, are taking RWAs seriously. BlackRock recently launched its first tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain, backed by short-term U.S. Treasurys. JPMorgan’s Onyx platform has already settled billions in tokenized collateral transfers, while Citigroup partnered with Wellington Management and WisdomTree to explore the tokenization of private markets. Earlier this year, it was also announced that Ondo Finance would be the first provider to bring real-world assets to Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network (MTN). “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS. “Back in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” For CFOs and treasurers responsible for safeguarding corporate capital and ensuring optimal deployment, RWAs present novel use cases across several financial disciplines. See also: Stablecoin Sandwiches? Here’s What CFOs Need to Know About Crypto Jargon Digital asset fluency is quickly becoming a core competency for finance teams. The blockchain can offer CFOs and treasurers a powerful toolkit, but, like all advanced technologies, it is one that must be wielded with precision and foresight. PYMNTS Intelligence this year found that blockchain technology has numerous potential benefits to serve the unique needs of regulated industries, including finance, healthcare, identity verification and supply chain management, to name a few. But holding tokenized assets requires secure digital custody solutions. Custodians must be vetted not only for cybersecurity but also for their legal and compliance frameworks. Additionally, many RWA platforms still rely on centralized issuers who can pose operational or credit risk. Among the biggest uncertainty impacting the RWA space, just as with the rest of the on-chain economy, is the lack of operational clarity around regulation in the U.S. marketplace. But the tide is beginning to turn. “The largest financial institutions are eager to explore tokenized assets,” Nikola Plecas, head of commercialization, Visa Crypto, told PYMNTS, but added that they require regulatory certainty to do so at scale. PYMNTS covered Wednesday (April 9) how crypto industry participants and attorneys told a House subcommittee that existing regulations from the SEC lack clarity and are outdated, while the lawmakers in attendance said new legislation tied to market structure and oversight would be forthcoming.

Title: Larry Fink says Trump's tariffs 'went further than I could have imagined'

Even people who make a living from predicting the markets can’t predict everything. Larry Fink, the longtime CEO of BlackRock (BLK), said on a Friday call with analysts that he was surprised by President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs last week. “The sweeping U.S. tariff announcements went beyond anything I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance,” Fink said on a call after the company reported first-quarter financial results. On April 2, the president imposed the steepest tariffs the country has seen in over a century — a 10% universal tariff and heavy reciprocal tariffs. This week, Trump announced a 90-day reciprocal tariff pause on countries that hadn’t announced retaliatory duties. Tariffs on China, notably, remain in place; the country is now facing a 145% reciprocal tariff; China has since announced a 125% levy on all U.S. goods. The markets have been chaotic this month — after Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement, the S&P 500 had its steepest two-day plunge since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 90-day pause on tariffs sent the markets skyrocketing before coming back down to Earth. Now, the markets continue to grapple with what the future could look like: What the steep tariffs on China mean for Big Tech, whether the president will continue to be erratic with his trade policy, whether the country is headed for a recession, and more. “In the short run, we have an economy that is at risk,” Fink said, before adding that artificial intelligence and rising infrastructure demand present significant and “transformative” investment opportunities. “This isn’t Wall Street versus Main Street,” he said. “The market downturn impacts millions of ordinary people’s retirement savings.” This morning, BlackRock announced better-than-expected first-quarter results — revenue rising 12% to $5.28 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $11.30, beating analyst expectations of $10.19. Fink, who has become a billionaire through his role at the helm of the world’s largest asset manager, went on CNBC’s (CMCSA) Squawk on the Street on Friday morning to issue a more dire warning about the days ahead. “I think we’re very close (to), if not in, a recession now,” he said. “I think you’re going to see, across the board, just a slowdown until there’s more certainty. … We now have a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs — that means longer, more elevated uncertainty.” Fink said the current economic crisis “is not a pandemic, this is not a financial crisis, this is something that we have created.” He added that the U.S. is now a “global destabilizer.” His comments Friday echo what he said earlier this week: that the U.S. is headed for a global slowdown and that the country’s economy is “weakening as we speak.” Fink told CNBC, “Long term, I’m less worried about some of these issues, but in the short run, I’m petrified about some of these issues.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin and Ether ETF Inflows Declined 83% in Q1 to $3B

In no surprise given the lame crypto price action in the first quarter of 2025, BlackRock (BLK) posted a sizable slump in net inflows into its spot bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) ETFs. In all, investors put $3 billion into BlackRock’s digital asset-focused ETFs in the first three months of the year, according to the company's first quarter earning report. That's an 83% drop from what was a big inflow number in the fourth quarter as prices and sentiment shot higher alongside the Trump election victory. Taken alone, the first quarter number still signals strong demand for crypto-linked funds, even as prices deteriorated. That $3 billion represents 2.8% of the total inflows into BlackRock’s mammoth iShares ETFs in the first quarter, which also include active, core equity, and strategic funds, among smaller categories. BlackRock at quarter's end managed roughly $50.3 billion in digital assets, or about 0.5% of its total assets of more than $10 trillion. Digital asset ETFs accounted for $34 million in base fees, or less than 1% of the company’s long-term revenue. The decline in bitcoin and ether ETF inflows last quarter came alongside a 70% quarterly fall in iShares' overall inflows to $84 billion from $281 million as global markets attempted to navigate the changing macroeconomic environment under President Trump.

Title: BNY Is Changing The Game For Crypto Accounting

BySean Stein Smith BySean Stein Smith, Contributor. BNY continues to expand crypto operations In the latest move by TradFi institutions pivoting to embrace the blockchain and tokenized asset space, the banking giant BNY has debuted a real-time reporting tool (Digital Assets Data Insights) in partnership with Blackrock. The fact that these two financial giants are collaborating on an on-chain valuation and reporting tool is set to have substantial effects on the crypto accounting and reporting conversation moving forward. Put simply, this tool will allow the posting of net-asset-value data directly on to select blockchains without relying on third-party accounting services. The involvement of on-chain money market fund, BUIDL, managed by Blackrock in addition to being the leading partner on this initiative, also highlights the growing importance of on-chain assets. Benefits that have been discussed connected to this include 1) the ability of BNY to post NAV figures directly on chain, 2) enhanced credibility of tokenized funds thanks to increased transparency and real-time information, and 3) the ability of other products to benefit from more comprehensive suites of tools tailor made for tokenized information. The launch of the partnership also reinforces the rise of tokenized assets and other data, outside of traditionally decentralized instruments such as bitcoin and ether. While the project itself is still in early stages the implications of this real-time reporting and disclosure capability are significant in terms of allowing further maturation of tradeable products and services. In addition the reporting functionality of Digital Assets Data Insights will have implications for the crypto accounting world; let’s take a look at a few of them. One of the key aspects of BNY’s efforts is the connection that will be established between on-chain assets and off-chain data across blockchain networks. Specifically, and leveraging the data already managed on-chain by BNY, the institution will be able to broadcast select accounting data to the Ethereum network, amplifying the ability of investors to leverage public blockchain traceability and transparency. By also integrating smart contract functionality, customers will be able to automate data analytics and better integrate off-chain data and information alongside how public blockchains are used. In short the efforts underway at BNY have the potential to unlock better transparency, traceability, and insights for tokenized products whether or not said instruments are stored on-chain or secured via off-chain mechanisms. These values of tokenized funds being posted directly on-chain also have the potential to accelerate conversations related to accounting, reporting, and disclosures. An ongoing issue in the crypto and tokenized asset sector is the lack of standardized reporting and disclosures in the marketplace. While multiple private sector options have been put forward as potential options the reality is that there are still open items when it comes to critical accounting issues. These include not are limited to how to best determine valuation and liquidity measures for certain specific cryptoassets, products, or instruments and the consistency with which these pieces of information are reported to the marketplace. Accounting professionals will need to be aware of how these non-CPA generated reporting frameworks and best practices will influence client expectations going forward. Obtaining more accurate and real-time data linked to the valuation of crypto instruments and investing options will also enable the increased proliferation of dashboards, KPIs, credit scores, and other data that is essential for widely traded investing products and services. One additional aspect of these changes is the impact and acceleration that more real-time data will have on a particularly tricky crypto accounting area; crypto-audits. The singular aspect of the cryptoasset landscape that has continued to lag behind the landscape at large, even as institutional adoption continues to accelerate is the development and proliferation of standardized crypto audit practices. With the FASB and IASB only having issued limited guidance to this point, and tax agencies taking varied approaches to crypto tax issues, the onus has fallen on the private sector to develop such practices. For example, the AICPA has developed and continued to update multiple practice aids related to accounting and attestation best practices for digital assets. In addition the Digital Chamber of Commerce has also issued multiple whitepapers on the topic of proof-of-reserves, and although that practice continues to evolve the expectation is that some iteration of this concept will play a key role going forward. The efforts by BNY to enable more real-time valuation and (by extension) reporting and disclosure will only increase the appetite and interest in these ideas. As TradFi continues to adopt crypto, some of the largest institutions are looking to shake up the crypto accounting landscape.

Title: BlackRock CEO says U.S. may be in a recession now

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC on Friday that he thinks the U.S. economy has weakened to the point of growth possibly turning negative. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said on “Squawk on the Street.” Fears of an economic slowdown have risen sharply since President Donald Trump unveiled widespread tariffs last week, sparking a sell-off in the stock market. Trump on Wednesday announced that he was pausing some of those import levies for 90 days, but that move is not enough to restore confidence in the economy, Fink said. “I think you’re going to see, across the board, just a slowdown until there’s more certainty. And we now have a 90-day on the reciprocal tariffs — that means longer, more elevated uncertainty,” Fink said Friday. Surveys of consumers and business leaders have shown weakening sentiment in recent months. However, other pieces of economic data like job growth and retail sales have held up better. Fink said consumers may have been stock up on goods ahead of the threatened tariffs, which could be masking some underlying economic weakness. Fink’s comments come after BlackRock released its first-quarter financial results. In that release, the CEO commented that “uncertainty and anxiety about the future of markets and the economy are dominating client conversations.” The asset management giant’s financial results were mixed. BlackRock reported $11.30 in adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter, above the $10.14 expected by Wall Street analysts, according to LSEG. However, $5.28 billion in revenue was short of the $5.34 billion consensus expectations. On the assets front, BlackRock reported $84 billion in net inflows during the quarter and ended March with nearly $11.6 trillion under management. Shares of the firm were up less than 1% in morning trading. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: BlackRock draws $3 billion in digital asset inflows in Q1, AUM reaches $11.6 trillion

Share this article Investors poured around $3 billion into BlackRock’s digital asset products in Q1 2025, contributing to $84 billion in total net inflows for the quarter, according to the firm’s first-quarter earnings release on April 11. BlackRock’s iShares ETF platform brought in a strong $107 billion in net inflows during Q1 2025. However, the firm’s total net inflows came in lower at $84 billion, as outflows in other segments—notably a $45.5 billion pullback from institutional index funds—offset the ETF gains. BlackRock’s digital assets under management stood at over $50 billion at the end of Q1, up from $17.5 billion a year ago, which represents a 187% increase year-over-year. This surge dwarfed the growth rate of other asset classes within the firm’s portfolio, such as equities, which was up 8% YoY to $5.7 trillion. The first quarter also brought notable volatility. Even though digital assets attracted over $3 billion in net inflows, market depreciation reduced their value by over $8 billion. As of March 31, the global asset manager oversees approximately $11.6 trillion worth of client assets. Digital assets make up just 1% of BlackRock’s total AUM, with their $3 billion net inflows accounting for 2.8% of total ETF inflows in Q1 2025. For comparison, private market investments brought in $9.3 billion during the same period. Digital asset-related investment advisory and admin fees reached $34 million in Q1, less than 1% of BlackRock’s total $4.1 billion in long-term revenue as of March 31. That figure aligns with the segment’s AUM share but underscores the low-fee structure typical of digital offerings. For example, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), BlackRock’s flagship crypto ETF launched in early 2024, operates at a competitive 0.25% fee post-waiver. The report comes as US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their sixth straight day of net outflows, with $149 million in redemptions yesterday, according to Farside Investors. The withdrawals were led by Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC, amidst a broader market movement where investors sought safer assets such as gold and cash, influenced by escalating US-China tariff disputes and market volatility tied to US policy changes.

Title: Ireland women to get true test of their progress
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/04/11/ireland-women-to-get-true-test-of-their-progress/

This afternoon in Cork, Ireland will discover if there is any lingering scar tissue from last year’s 88-10 shellacking at Twickenham. Scott Bemand’s Ireland team have made significant progress in the interim, including a brilliant victory over New Zealand in Canada last November. England, chasing a 32nd successive Six Nations victory dating back to when Ireland were the last side to beat them in 2018, remain the benchmark by which all teams are weighed and measured. John Mitchell’s side show no signs of growing bored or tired of their dominance and will be keen to continue to crush all comers ahead of a home World Cup later in the year. Under Bemand and his coaching team, the influx and influence of the Sevens cohort has helped to produce a more blended style in attack and defence l and there has been an improvement at set-piece and breakdown. England are about to test that warranty. Ireland’s reserve hooker Clíodhna Moloney has first-hand knowledge of the basement level issues that undermined Irish women’s rugby over the years and also the current trajectory that has seen the national side climb steadily in performance and ranking. Her appraisal is worth noting. “A lot has changed in terms of our experiences as a group, our playing group has changed, new people have come in. You’ve got the likes of Erin King coming in and performing really well in Vancouver. “A lot of other players have come in and come through the Celtic Challenge and other pathways. I think it’s just growing all the time. We’ve obviously got a new coaching staff. Areas of our game continue to develop like lineout, set-piece, Hugh Hogan has been brilliant on defence. “Our set-piece has grown from a coaching perspective but also from a player’s expectation. When we train (in) units, the detail that the girls are operating at weekly, it’s advancing all the time. And that expectation is very high in the group. “The physicality is going up a lot. The ball in play, we’re trying to push that. We’re trying to play quickly, trying to play on top of teams. And you feel it in your body, and you feel it in the intensity after sessions. “We’re trying to diversify our attack as well. It’s a multifaceted piece. I think a lot has changed and people have learned a lot, that [the England game last year] was probably the biggest game they’d experienced ever for this group. That will never happen again, I think we’d all say that. “People are happy and excited after it rather than worrying or looking back. They want more. That’s probably the biggest thing with this group is that you’ve got girls being like, ‘okay what’s the next thing’?” Moloney’s time in England with the Exeter Chiefs gives her an obvious insight into England’s depth of quality in terms of the playing roster but she doesn’t feel the need to tell any ghost stories. Her team-mates know what’s coming and are keen to embrace the challenge. “I don’t think you need to tell them. It’s more of a feeling of knowing that we’ve done the work, experiencing how training feels when we’re under really high-pressure scenarios. It’s that that gives them confidence more than me telling them this or that about whatever player I might know. “The have confidence from the pressure we’ve experienced here. I think they’re just really excited to be honest with you. There’s no fear in there.” And the truth in that statement will be borne out by what happens this afternoon during the 80-minutes. Ireland must have the courage and belief to play and let that take them where it will on the scoreboard.
