A FORMER SCHOOL principal convicted of the indecent assault of six boys over a 30-year period has been jailed for four years for some of the offences, with further sentencing to follow for the others. Aidan Clohessy (85) was convicted of 19 counts of indecent assault following two separate trials at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court last month. Imposing sentence in the first case against him today, Judge Elva Duffy said Clohessy was “living a life full of good deeds during the day” but was also “an ogre” who carried out “what can only be described as atrocities at night time, when no one could see that behaviour”. Clohessy was the principal of St Augustine’s School, Blackrock, Co. Dublin from the 1970s until 1993. The six boys were all pupils of the school. Some were boarders at the school, which catered for boys with mild to moderate learning disabilities at that time. The boys were aged between 10 and 13 when Clohessy’s offending took place. The abuse primarily took the form of inappropriate touching, the court heard. In the first trial, Clohessy, with an address at the Hospitaller Order of St John of God, Granada, Stillorgan, Co. Dublin, was convicted of 14 counts of indecent assault – 10 in relation to one boy and four in relation to a second boy on dates between 1983 and 1985. Today, he was sentenced four years in relation to the offending against these two boys. Judge Duffy noted Clohessy’s age and health would make custody more challenging for him. The jury in the second trial returned guilty verdicts on five counts of indecent assault – two for one boy, and one count each in relation to three other boys. All this offending took place between 1969 and 1986. Clohessy was acquitted of three further counts of indecent assault. Having heard evidence in this case today, Judge Martin Nolan adjourned the case overnight to consider sentence. Victim impact statements were read to the court on behalf of all six injured parties. They outlined how the abuse affected their mental health, relationships, education and later employment opportunities. One man said: “Brother Aidan, I don’t forgive you but I don’t judge you anymore. That responsibility does not belong to me. “One day, you will stand before the man you chose to serve. One day, you will stand before your maker, and on that day, you will be handed your judgement.” Another said he struggled to learn his wedding vows or to read his children a story. Clohessy was interviewed voluntarily by gardaí and denied wrongdoing. He acknowledged that corporal punishment was used in the school, including by him. Clohessy told gardaí this included striking boys on their bare buttocks, but said this was only for the most serious offences and only of those boys who were residents at the school. The investigating gardai agreed with Ronan Kennedy SC, defending, that his client was co-operative during the investigation. The garda further agreed that Clohessy has been the subject of adverse media publicity. Kennedy told the court his client will not be appealing the jury’s decision in either trial. Clohessy is originally from Co. Limerick and entered the religious order after completing his Leaving Certificate in 1958. He initially trained as a psychiatric nurse and after some years working in this area, retrained as a teacher. Clohessy started work at St Augustine’s School in 1969, becoming principal in the mid 1970s. Kennedy said his client served in roles on the provisional leadership team and was appointed in 1993 to lead a mission in Malawi to develop mental health services there, where he remained until 2013 when he returned to Ireland. Kennedy said Clohessy lives “a humble and quiet existence” and supports other members of the religious community who have significant health issues. A medical report and two testimonials were handed to the court on Clohessy’s behalf. Kennedy asked the court to take into account his client will find custody more difficult due to his age and health issues. He submitted that his client would have to live with the stigma of being a sex offender and has already been subject to negative publicity. “In many respects, he was already condemned and judged in the court of public opinion before he was ever tried in this court,” Kennedy said. An investigating garda outlined the evidence of the first trial to the court. The first boy was aged around 10 when he went to St Augustine’s School in 1973. Advertisement In the first incident, the boy, who was a boarder, had returned to the chalet and was making a sandwich when he heard the front door open. He knew it was Clohessy. Clohessy called the boy “demon” and said he had to get the demon out of him. The boy was taken to a room, where Clohessy slapped him on his bare buttocks and touched his testicles. The court heard there were other similar incidents including occasions when the boy felt something wet on the small of his back. On one occasion, the boy felt something in his buttocks, didn’t know what it was, but knew Clohessy had done it. The court heard there is no suggestion that this was an object. The abuse ended when the boy was around 11 or 12. A victim impact statement was read to the court by the injured party’s wife. He said the pain “imposed on me as a child has never truly gone away” and has “shaped every part of what I became”. He developed trust issues and has had feelings of shame, confusion and fear. He said the trial brought a lot of that fear and trauma back to the surface. “It was like being haunted by the ghost of your own life,” he said. The man said the abuse took away his childhood and “stole my future” as he could not learn like other children and left school with limited literacy skills. He said he struggled to find work to support his family, and they had experienced financial pressures. Addressing Clohessy directly, he said: “Brother Aidan, I don’t forgive you but I don’t judge you anymore. That responsibility does not belong to me. “One day, you will stand before the man you chose to serve. One day, you will stand before your maker, and on that day you will be handed your judgement.” A second boy, who was also a boarder at the school, was around 11 when the first incident took place. He was in a changing area after he had taken part in a swimming race when Clohessy came in. Clohessy told the boy, “I told you to win the next time” and touched the boy, who was getting changed, in his genital area. In a separate incident on the same day, Clohessy called the boy over while walking past the chalets and touched him inappropriately. Clohessy put his finger to his lips in a shushing motion. The boy was in Clohessy’s office on another occasion when the principal told the boy to take down his clothing. The boy refused to remove his underwear and Clohessy pulled it down. The boy felt something hard on his buttocks, then something wet. The boy dried himself off and asked Clohessy why, but didn’t get an answer. Clohessy put his finger to his lips in a shushing motion and said something like “son, no one knows”. The court also heard evidence about another incident in a storage area of the gym building where Clohessy touched the boy inappropriately. Clohessy said to him: “Son, I hope no one knows.” In a victim impact statement he said the abuse impacted his education, his mental health and his later employment. Imposing sentence, Judge Duffy said the age of the injured parties and that the offending took place on multiple occasions, were aggravating features. The judge noted the contents of both victim impact statements. She said these were “vulnerable children” who had been entrusted to Clohessy’s care. Judge Duffy noted the defence had indicated there would be no appeal and she expressed the court’s hope that this might offer some peace for the two injured parties in moving forward. The judge said she had read the testimonials and acknowledged that while Clohessy has “good elements”, this offending took place “in total secrecy”. She said she would impose two separate sentences of two years, to run consecutively. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Ethereum Co-Founder Projects Disruptive Global Dominance for Ethereum layer-1 (L1)

Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has taken to X to share his outlook on the future of the Ethereum Layer 1 blockchain, which he believes is primed for global dominance. Lubin’s assertions are in response to the recently approved Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, a bill designed to clarify the use of stablecoins. The Ethereum co-founder can be seen on X, affirming the sentiments of an Ethereum supporter, who referenced Pro-Ethereum sentiments shared by Robbie Mitchnick, the head of Digital Assets at BlackRock. The BlackRock official, who appears to be bullish on Ethereum, previously revealed that Ethereum ranks as the first choice on the company’s radar, particularly when the investment firm begins to explore tokenization. On the other hand, Lubin highlighted some of the blockchain’s key features, including its permissionless nature and flexible structure, neutral state, and anti-censorship design, adding that the Ethereum blockchain is primed to continue on a decentralized path. “Ethereum Layer 1 will be the master ledger for the world; Permissionless to inspect, use, and add data or functionality to. Credibly neutral [and] censorship resistant. Tamper-resistant and tamper-evident (via slashing and transparency). Incessantly progressively decentralizing itself.” He wrote. Lubin stressed the role of the Ethereum community in strengthening the blockchain, hailing community members from developers to users, and applauding their commitment to the network’s core values. However, he maintains that network regulation is bound to become increasingly difficult as barriers are underway. “With a best-in-class giant community that is constantly hyper vigilant as there will always be patient, well resourcedactors working to subvert the system. Fortunately this will get harder and harder as Ethereum grows and matures.” He asserts.

Title: Is the $313 Million Ether Transfer to Coinbase Signaling Major Sell-Off?

A large Ethereum (ETH) transfer has sparked renewed fears of a potential market dump, just as leverage in the ETH futures market surges to record levels. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain flagged a massive transaction of 113,000 ETH—valued at approximately $313 million—deposited into crypto exchange Coinbase. The move was initiated from a single whale wallet amid heightened speculative trading activity and rising institutional accumulation of ETH. Whale deposits to centralized exchanges are often interpreted as a signal that large holders may be preparing to sell. Lookonchain reported the transaction on X, noting that the wallet had remained dormant for a considerable period before suddenly moving its entire holdings to Coinbase. While the motive behind the transfer remains unknown, such high-value movements often precede large sell orders, especially when combined with current market conditions. The timing of the whale deposit aligns with a new all-time high in Ethereum futures open interest. According to data from Coinglass, ETH futures open interest has surpassed $29 billion, driven by increasing speculative activity using stablecoin-backed, cash-margined contracts. This trend is also reflected in the growing presence of retail traders in Ethereum’s derivatives market. CryptoQuant reported that futures trading frequency among smaller investors has spiked above its 12-month average, contrasting with Bitcoin’s stagnant on-chain activity. Despite the potential for short-term volatility, institutional demand for ETH has remained steady. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, reportedly acquired $163.6 million in ETH across two consecutive weeks, according to blockchain data tracked by Lookonchain. Ethereum is currently trading at $2,295, marking a slight 0.16% decline over the past 24 hours. Analysts have identified $2,800 as a critical resistance level. According to crypto traders such as Daan Crypto Trades and Duo Nine, a break above this threshold could lead to a push toward the $3,000 mark. However, with leverage peaking and large ETH volumes moving to exchanges, the market remains on alert for a possible correction. High open interest and excessive retail positioning have historically led to liquidations during sudden price swings. In contrast to bullish sentiment, some traders are beginning to open short positions on ETH. Lookonchain highlighted this divergence, suggesting that some market participants prepare for a downside move in response to the whale transfer and overheated derivatives activity. While Ethereum continues to enjoy institutional inflows and speculative momentum, the $313 million whale transfer to Coinbase has introduced a new layer of uncertainty.

The US Has Bombed Iran: Cast Aside Illusions. Phil Taylor, Robin Philpot By Phil Taylor and Robin Philpot, June 23, 2025 Within days, perhaps hours, we may expect the White House to announce meetings with a willing coalition of Iranian political expats who will be described as a government in exile.

The West’s Reckless Militarization and the New International Order By Stephen Sefton, June 23, 2025 From the perspective of the North American and European elites, the developing new world order threatens their customary political-military dominance and their subsequent neocolonial economic control based on centuries of ruthless imperialist aggression.

But a closer examination reveals the nuclear issue to be a pretext for a regime change operation designed both to secure Israel’s military domination of West Asia and to maintain U.S. global hegemony. Iran Is the Sixth Country on the List of the Countries America Is to Destroy for Israel. Dr. Paul C.

Title: What The GENIUS Act Could Mean For The Digital Dollar
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/06/23/what-the-genius-act-could-mean-for-the-digital-dollar/
Time Published: 2025-06-23T15:04:49Z

BySandy Peng BySandy Peng, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images) The Senate passed the GENIUS Act on Tuesday, aiming to bring stablecoins under a national regulatory framework. In this historic bill, which now needs to pass the House of Representatives, lawmakers are moving to define what a “digital dollar” really is. The stablecoin market expanded from $5 billion in 2020 to nearly $261 billion today, with Tether alone holding $155 billion. For context, Tether’s $155 billion market cap rivals the GDP of Hungary, which was about $212 billion in 2023. Last year, the company reported $13 billion in profits from investing its reserves, primarily in the U.S. Treasuries, making it more profitable than BlackRock. In fact, according to a report by the crypto exchange CEX.io, more money moved through stablecoins than Mastercard in 2024. Over $27.6 trillion was settled via tokens most mainstream credit card users still haven’t heard of, or understand, quite yet. Until now, the most rapid growth of stablecoin usage has taken place outside of North America, even though most stablecoins are pegged in some way to the dollar. In Latin America, 71% of financial services firms now use stablecoins for cross-border payments. The region processes $94.2 billion in genuine payment settlements, not trading volume. Business-to-business payments alone account for $3 billion per month. The acceleration gained momentum after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s April 2025 guidance declared that traditional 1:1 backed stablecoins aren’t securities. Within weeks, Société Générale announced USDCV, backed by Bank of New York Mellon. Standard Chartered partnered with Animoca Brands for Hong Kong's first licensed stablecoin. And all in all, one thing is clear: stablecoins have found their product market fit. Fit for emerging economies, where people don’t want to lose ~6.65% to remittances. Fit for better yield than what standard banks are providing. Fit for everyone who doesn’t want to wait for their payments to settle in three days. By the end of 2025, there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of stablecoins launching. Yet they won’t take on the typical form as we commonly know it — instead, stablecoins will be getting more and more complicated. This explosion in usage is precisely what the GENIUS Act aims to address: how do you regulate a financial instrument that already moves more money than global card networks? Today’s stablecoin landscape ranges from fiat-backed tokens like USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT), to algorithmic models, to complex financial instruments that generate yield or track exotic assets. In February, Figure Markets launched YLDS, the first SEC-registered yield-bearing stablecoin, offering 3.85% APY tied to Secured Overnight Financing Rate rates. MakerDAO’s new USDS accepts everything from Ethereum to tokenized U.S. Treasury bonds as collateral. The GENIUS Act assumes stablecoins are simple, static, and centrally issued. But the next thousand stablecoins won’t look like these stablecoins at all. They'll be yield-generating machines wrapped in “dollar clothing” — commodity plays disguised as cash or real estate exposure that fits inside your digital wallet. We’ll soon be able to use stablecoins that automatically shift between treasury bills and corporate bonds based on market conditions, or tokens that give you exposure to African farmland while maintaining a dollar peg. We’re already beginning to see certain hints: tokenized gold reserves, carbon credit backing and even stablecoin protocols that track baskets of emerging market currencies. Projects like Virtual Finance, who are building on Scroll — a blockchain that I co-founded, and Synthetix, are experimenting with synthetic dollar models. ViFi’s synthetic dollar model for example is designed to offer local currency stability in high-inflation environments, without centralized reserves. The winners won't be the most stable — they'll be the most useful. Just as you can’t currently distinguish which dollar bill is coming from Chase and which from Bank of America, soon users won’t look at who is issuing the stablecoin. Instead, the yield and what else can be done with it will matter more. Regulators are fighting yesterday’s war with tomorrow's weapons pointed backwards. The GENIUS Act assumes stablecoins are static instruments — issued here and regulated here. But what happens when a stablecoin issued in Singapore, backed by London real estate, traded on a Cayman Islands exchange, and held by someone in Lagos, eventually fails? Whose problem is that? The answer: everyone’s and no one's. Europe tried the heavy-handed approach with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation. And as a result, Europeans now access the same stablecoins through DeFi, just with extra steps and (potentially) higher risk. The U.S. wants domestic oversight while Tether laughs from the British Virgin Islands, holding more treasuries than most countries. Asia is crafting its own rules, creating a patchwork where regulatory arbitrage isn’t a bug — it’s an entire business model. When thousands of stablecoins exist, each with different mechanisms, backings and jurisdictions, traditional regulation becomes a game of whack-a-mole. Except the moles are armed with smart contracts and the hammer is made of strongly worded letters. The barbarians aren’t at the gate — they're already inside, issuing tokens and earning yield. When this unravels, and parts of it will, there's no Federal Reserve to lower rates, no U.S. Treasury to backstop losses and no coordinated response from people who can't even agree on what a stablecoin is. But maybe that’s the point. Maybe the chaos is the feature. In Argentina, chaos means 50% inflation, so a synthetic dollar backed by derivatives feels like stability that not all citizens are used to. In Nigeria, chaos means capital controls, so any dollar access beats none. For millions, these complicated, possibly fragile and definitely risky instruments solve real problems — and they solve them today. The thousand stablecoins launching this year won’t all survive. Most won't. But the ones that do will reshape how money works, who controls it and what it can do. Traditional finance took centuries to build safety nets. We’re speedrunning the same evolution in years, maybe months. Whether that ends in breakthrough or breakdown depends entirely on how thoughtfully we build today. As the GENIUS Act attempts to define what a regulated stablecoin, and by extension, a “digital dollar,” should look like, it may be racing against a moving target. The market is evolving faster than legislation can draft definitions. Disclosure: Sandy Peng is the Co-Founder of Scroll, a blockchain that ViFi is building on with regards to a stablecoin project.

Title: Digital Harvest — BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street: Shareholders in the Shadows. Colin Todhunter

They don’t sell seeds. They don’t own tractors. They don’t run warehouses or ship grain. But BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are among the most powerful actors in global agriculture. Together, these three asset managers control more than $26 trillion in assets—more than the GDP of the United States and India combined. They are shareholders in nearly every major agribusiness: Bayer, Cargill, ADM, Nestlé, Deere & Co and more. They don’t compete. They co-own. And through that ownership, they govern. This is not capitalism as competition. It’s capitalism as quiet coordination. These firms don’t need to dictate policy. They shape the terrain on which policy is made. Their influence is structural, not spectacular. It’s exercised through boardrooms, shareholder resolutions and capital flows. And it’s largely invisible to the public. But its effects are everywhere. According to the Food Barons 2022 report by ETC Group, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street hold dominant stakes across the agrifood chain—from seeds and chemicals to supermarkets and logistics platforms. In many sectors, they are the top three shareholders in all the major firms. This means that ‘competition’ between companies like Bayer and Syngenta, or Nestlé and PepsiCo, is often little more than a performance. The real power sits behind the curtain. These firms don’t micromanage. They don’t need to. Their power lies in alignment—in shaping what counts as value, what counts as risk and what counts as acceptable behaviour. And increasingly, that behaviour is being framed through the lens of ESG: Environmental, Social and Governance metrics. But ESG is not a moral compass. It’s a risk framework. In recent years, BlackRock and its peers have positioned themselves as climate-conscious investors. They speak of ‘net zero’, ‘transition finance’, and ‘sustainable agriculture’. But this is not about decarbonising the food system. It’s about de-risking portfolios. The same firms that invest in fossil fuels also invest in carbon offset schemes. The same firms that back industrial agriculture also fund ‘climate-smart’ seed technologies. It’s a hedging strategy, not a transformation. And in India, this logic is taking root. Asset managers are increasingly backing land-leasing platforms, agrifintech startups and carbon credit aggregators that promise to ‘unlock value’ from farmland. But unlocking value often means locking farmers into new forms of dependency—on scoring systems, digital compliance and speculative markets they don’t control. This is not investment. It’s extraction with a sustainability label. The most dangerous shift in agriculture today is not technological—it’s financial. Land is no longer just a place to grow food. It’s an asset class. A hedge against inflation. A site for data capture and carbon speculation. In this model, the farmer is not a producer. They are a tenant on someone else’s spreadsheet. And the spreadsheet is global. BlackRock doesn’t need to own the land. It just needs to own the firm that owns the firm that leases the land. Through layers of investment vehicles, farmland is being bundled, securitised and traded—often without the knowledge of those who live on it. This is enclosure without fences. Governance without government. Asset managers like to present themselves as passive investors. They claim they don’t direct company strategy—they just follow the market. But when you own 5–10 per cent of every major firm in a sector, you are the market. And when you vote on shareholder resolutions, appoint board members and shape executive pay, you are not passive. In 2023, BlackRock and Vanguard voted against resolutions that would have required agribusinesses to disclose their impacts on deforestation and land rights. Their justification? The proposals were “too prescriptive”. But what they were really protecting was the freedom to operate without scrutiny. What makes BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street so dangerous is not that they are evil. It’s that they are structural. They don’t need to conspire. Their incentives are aligned. Their tools are abstract. And their power is exercised through absence—of regulation, of transparency, of accountability. They are not the villains of this story. They are the architecture. And that makes them harder to fight. Food sovereignty is not just about seeds or soil. It’s about power. And power today is financial. It flows through indexes, benchmarks and capital allocations. It decides which crops are grown, which firms survive, and which futures are funded. And it does so without ever touching the soil. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

June 23, 2025 8:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Steve Laipply, Global Co-Head of Bond ETFs at BlackRock, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast. Yet another extra special guest, Steve Lightly is global co-head of Bond ETFs and investment giant BlackRock. He helps to oversee over a trillion dollars in bond ETFs. He’s got a fascinating background at both Bank America, Merrill Lynch, and since 2009 at BGI and BlackRock. I thought this conversation was really fascinating. There are a few people in the world of fixed income that understands the bond market, the ETF market, what the fed’s doing, what is driving both institutional and household investors on the fixed income side. I, I thought this conversation was absolutely fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with BlackRock’s co-head of Bond ETFs. Steve Lely. Steve Lely, welcome to Bloomberg. Steve Laipply: Thanks for having me, Barry. Barry Ritholtz: So, what a perfect time to have somebody who specializes in fixed income and bonds. We’ve had all sorts of mayhem with tariffs on, tariffs off rates, up rates down, yields starting to creep higher and higher. But before we get into what’s going on today, let’s talk a little bit about you and your background. BS degree in finance from university in Miami, MBA from Wharton Finance. Always the career plan. Steve Laipply: Not quite, so I went to Miami University in Ohio, actually. Really? I grew up in a small town in Ohio. Yeah. So went there for, ultimately ended up in the business school. I did start off thinking, you know, as many people might that, oh, what, what should I do? Should I be a doctor or a lawyer? I decided to try doctor. I love biology, organic chemistry, not so much. That’s Barry Ritholtz: That’s the gut course that screens a lot of doc future docs out. Steve Laipply: So I had a good friend who said, Hey, I’m taking finance. I really like it. Maybe give it a shot. I took a finance class, really liked it a lot. It’s sort of like math with dollar signs attached to it. So that’s sort of the way I viewed it. I really enjoyed it. And, and that was kind of, that was kind of it. I was hooked. Barry Ritholtz: University of Miami in Ohio is gonna scratch out my next question, which, which is how do you get anything done in the Florida sun in Miami? But Ohio I bet is a little easier study type of regime. Steve Laipply: A little bit. It’s still, it’s a beautiful campus, A lot of fun. But, but yeah, it’s, it was, it was a good experience. Barry Ritholtz: You come outta Wharton, we’ll talk a little bit about iShares and your previous history at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, but what was it that drew you to fixed income? Steve Laipply: I, I think a couple of things. One, I really, I really did enjoy sort of the, the variety of things in fixed income. You know, I mean, you know, equities can be complex in their own right, but fixed income, you can have so many different types of instruments and cash flows and structures. And it was just really interesting to me to see that variety Barry Ritholtz: And what do we have something like 3,500 individual equities outside of the ping sheets, and how many QIPs are there for fixed income? Millions. Steve Laipply: So I, I did this, yeah, I did this exercise on Bloomberg, depending on how you filter well, north of a million, right? Well, north and it, and it’s, you, you might even get multiples of that depending on how you filter. But yeah, fixed income as, you know, once you, once you issue that a company’s gonna issue debt, you know, perpetually, they’re gonna keep issuing new CUSIPs over time. Right. So, so it adds up. Barry Ritholtz:No, no doubt. So you’re at Bank America Merrill Lynch as a senior member of the interest rate structuring and strategic solutions sounds very institutional. Tell us a little bit about your time at Bank America Merrill Lynch. Steve Laipply: Yeah, so I, I think that group, the idea was to work with institutional clients to really help them manage risk, right? And so it was about using derivatives in particular in a sensible way to come up with hedging strategy. So my, my particular focus was on the mortgage servicing community. They, they had a very, very complex asset. They still do, it’s a little bit different now all these years later, but they had a tremendous amount of interest rate risk in those servicing right assets, right? So my job was to work with them to come up with, you know, thoughtful ways to hedge that risk. And, and there are, you know, some very, very vanilla ways to do it. But, you know, we wanted to really try to be, you know, more thoughtful and much more tailored. And that was, that was what I spent a lot of time doing. I really enjoyed it. Barry Ritholtz: When I think of hedging risk on the fixed income side, not specific to that era, which was kind of unique, I think, of interest rate, risk, credit risk, the underlying security that subsequently gets securitized. Am I warm? Tell me if Steve Laipply: That’s about right. Yeah. Barry Ritholtz: Okay. What else do you consider when you’re trying to find a way to hedge a fixed income risk? Steve Laipply: Yeah, and so you just, you just nailed almost all of it. So depending on what it is. So when you’re dealing with something like a mortgage servicing, right? That’s that lender, you know, sells the loan off, and then somebody retains that annuity that can get prepaid. So if you go pay off your mortgage, I go pay off my mortgage, that annuity disappears. There’s optionality there. You have to hedge that, right? So you have interest rate, risk, volatility, risk, things move up and down, the more likely you are to decide if rates fall to prepay. So it’s all of that good stuff. And then yes, you can have credit risk and other types of assets as well. You, Barry Ritholtz: You use one of my favorite words, optionality because every time I have a discussion with people who are not in the world of finance, and they say, have you ever calculated how much it costs to take your boat or jet ski out and figure out what each ride costs you? And I’m like, you don’t understand optionality. I have the ability to do that every single day. Whether I choose to exercise that or not, that is still a value that would cost somebody something. You join a, a boat club or a rental club or whatever, lay people don’t get optionality. Tell us how that applies in, in fixed, fixed income. Yeah, Steve Laipply: And you see this in different ways, Barry. So I mean, not dissimilar, right? So as an example, again, going back to the homeowner part, if you have a mortgage, you can decide to prepay that a lot of people don’t. Interestingly, there are stories that, that exist, and I’m sure you’ve heard ’em, where people still have 10% mortgages somewhere get 00:06:52 [Speaker Changed] Out. Is that true? 00:06:53 [Speaker Changed] There are stories about that. And so if you look at, at statistics, I haven’t done this in a while by the way. So hopefully after this long period of time, maybe they’ve paid ’em off. But you can find these very high coupon mortgages that are still out there and nobody really knows why they haven’t paid them off. But it is your right, but you’re not forced to pay it off. You would think you’d want to if interest rates were low enough. But that exists in different ways. Just like when companies issue debt, a lot of times they’ll issue callable debt. So same idea if interest rates fall or credit spreads tighten, they can call that debt and issue cheaper debt, right? And so that, that’s, that’s just sort of a basic tenant of, of how people like to structure their, their liabilities. 00:07:34 [Speaker Changed] My equity version of that is BlackRock s and p 500 fund is like five bips, four bips, it’s like practically free. And sometimes portfolios come into the office. And why are you paying a hundred basis points for what’s as effectively an s and p 500 index? Why don’t we save you 95 bips a year, compounded over 20 years? That’s a lot of money. So the market is kind of sorta almost efficient, is, I don’t know how else to describe it. 00:08:04 [Speaker Changed] No, I think that’s right. I mean, and, and over time, you know, we, we’ve really started to see investors gravitate towards this idea of efficiency. And you know, again, you, you, this is a theme that you really, really hammer home, which is, you know, basic sort of blocking and tackling is don’t surrender a lot of your return to fees. I think everybody thinks that’s incredibly important. It took a while for people to wake up to it, but I do think over time people have really started to understand fees matter, the strategy matters too. But, but fees matter as well. And so we we have to You want both? Yeah, you want both. You want both. 00:08:40 [Speaker Changed] So I know we’ll get to BlackRock starting in oh nine, but how long were you at Bank America for? 00:08:47 [Speaker Changed] From 97 through oh nine. Oh, 00:08:49 [Speaker Changed] So you quite a while watched the debacle front row. Front row. Yeah. Did you start at Merrill or did you start at Bank America? 00:08:56 [Speaker Changed] I started at Merrill. 00:08:57 [Speaker Changed] Oh, you did? Yeah. So a lot of people, slagged, was it John Thune? I thought he cut a great deal that worked out really well for Merrill employees and relatively well for Merrill shareholders at least compared to, you know, bear Stearns and Lehman and so many other companies. He, he did a solid and it took a while before people recognized it. What was your experience like going through that mayhem? 00:09:22 [Speaker Changed] I mean, it was stressful as, you know, I was not involved with the particular businesses that were under stress, but it was stressful for all of us Oh, sure. As the headline scroll day after day after day, you know, was a front seat in history. Sure. As it turns out. And so I think, you know, hopefully a lot of lessons have been learned from, from, you know, that period of time, as you know, and I think you’ve said this many times, each crisis looks a little bit different. So hopefully we take lessons from the last one and that starts building a knowledge base up over time. So maybe the next time we’re a little bit better equipped to deal with it. But, but it was, yes, it was an interesting time. 00:10:02 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. To say the very least, ho hopefully we take the right lessons. Sometimes we, we draw the wrong lessons. That’s a whole nother story. So how did you find your way over to BlackRock in 2009? I’m assuming that was once the dust settled a little bit. Was it late past March oh nine? Yeah, 00:10:18 [Speaker Changed] It was, it was, it was interesting. You know, you you have sort of contact and networking with different folks and I had, and it was at the time, Barclays Global Investors. Yes. And I, I, I did know, I did know a couple of, a couple of folks that were there and we had just, you know, had casual conversations. But at one point, and this is a former mentor of mine, gentleman named Matt Tucker reached out to me and said, Hey, you know, this is an interesting opportunity. It’s called Bond ETFs. It’s, it’s a business that, that I’ve really been working hard on over here. And I’m looking for a skillset that that sort of maps to that and, and, you know, I kind of think that, that your background might be, might be interesting for this. So, you know, let’s, let’s talk about it and then, you know, sort of the rest is history. But I, I was very, very excited about it. And there is a funny story to this, which is I discovered bond ETFs on my own sort of accidentally. I was trying to buy treasuries and I was very frustrated by the commissions I was getting charged on that. A colleague actually pointed me to the iShares website and showed me that bond ETFs actually exist and you could simply buy this on exchange without actually having to buy physical bonds and, and, you know, pay a commission for it. So, 00:11:34 [Speaker Changed] And, and not only was the commission, you know, next to nothing, the spread and the price discovery seemed to be a little friendlier to buyers. 00:11:42 [Speaker Changed] I was really blown away by that. And I could not stop, you know, scrolling through that website and fascinated by the idea that you could take bonds and put them on exchange. Absolutely fascinated by that and, and feeling a little stupid that I hadn’t stumbled on it before. But so, so the fun part about that was it helped a little bit in the interviews to be able to say, yes, I’m familiar and, and you know, by the way, yes, I’m, I’m actually a customer pro, albeit at a small scale, but 00:12:08 [Speaker Changed] For those people who are unfamiliar with BGI or, or Barclays Global Investments, eventually what I have argued is the single greatest acquisition in at least wealth management history. Barclays Global gets in bought up by BlackRock, and the whole iShares product line gets really super sized with just a much savvier group of product developers, marketers, traders, just everything about it went next level. How much of that were you there to witness? I’m assu. Did you start at BGI or did you start, start a BlackRock? 00:12:48 [Speaker Changed] It’s funny because people often ask me, what was BGI, like, I was there for one month before the actual, it was, yeah. So 00:12:55 [Speaker Changed] Like what I’ve heard through the grapevine is it was a solid shop with a great product. Yeah. A little sleepy kind of back water. If you are at Bank America, Merrill Lynch and you still haven’t discovered their bond ETFs. Somebody is not doing the marketing job they should have. 00:13:12 [Speaker Changed] Well, it was, it was interesting. They were very much, I think quantitative and academically oriented and, and I think, I think a little bit of the culture was okay with, with being, you know, somewhat under the radar because it was, you know, a very proprietary place. And so that, that might be, might be some of it. But yeah, BlackRock did come in and, you know, they did, that deal was interesting if, I don’t know if you remember Barry, there were, there were some discussions about whether, you know, it would be some sort of a private deal or what have you. And then BlackRock kind of came in and said, we’ll take the whole thing in that, that was announced I think in June, so I’d only been there a very short period of time. And then it closed in the fall. And I will never forget, you could tell that BlackRock was, was very efficient at this because the day after the merger closed, the signage was up on the building. You walked in all the screensavers that changed overnight. You had a nice pad notepad with the logo on it and you know, no kidding. Some nice pens and, and all that stuff. So very, very impressive how, how they were able to, to do this so cleanly and, and quickly. That’s 00:14:17 [Speaker Changed] Fascinating. And I failed to mention BlackRock is a little shop over on the west side of the city, 11 $12 trillion in assets somewhere in that range. How big a chunk is fixed income and fixed income ETFs at BlackRock. 00:14:32 [Speaker Changed] We, we just hit 1 trillion in fixed income ETFs. 00:14:36 [Speaker Changed] So keep outta it. You’ll get some a UM soon. Keep, keep plugging 00:14:39 [Speaker Changed] Away. Keep plugging away. Yeah. And, and you know, the industry is, is now globally, the industry is approaching 3 trillion. We’re at around 2.8 trillion in change and we think that number is gonna get to six by the end of the decade for the industry. And we, we hope to be obviously a sizable chunk of that. But it’s been, you know, it’s been experiencing double digit growth, you know, for years and years and it’s just been a very, you know, fast moving river for us. Huh. 00:15:05 [Speaker Changed] Really, really quite fascinating. So Steve, you just mentioned you think bond ETFs can reach $6 trillion by 2030. Is that right? What is the key driver of that growth that’s doubling in less than five years? 00:15:23 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it, and it’s a number of things and, and we’ve talked about these trends. So I think you have, you have a series of waves of adoption that happened. And it’s interesting because where we tend to see the largest uptake of bond ETFs is when you have stress markets. And so I think this is, we, we have several, several test cases at this point. So, you know, we’ve had many ones since the financial crisis. So financial crisis happened, and I think that’s the first time where I personally started getting reverse inquiry from sophisticated investors asking about the bond ETFs because they noticed that even at the worst of it, let’s call it September or October of oh eight, they were still trading on exchange very robustly. Other markets not doing so well, right? And so that got the attention of a lot of investors at that time, products were probably too small for, for a lot of those investors. 00:16:18 But they became very intrigued by them over the ensuing years. You had a, you know, you would have occasional blips in the markets, whether it was, you know, some sort of an energy dislocation in high yield or what have you. But what we noticed was every single time you would have one of these stress markets, you’d see a huge surge in volumes in bond ETF trading on exchange that would get the attention of larger investors. They would start adopting the products. Why? Because when you need to trade something, you were able to trade bond ETFs even if other things were really struggling to trade. And so every single time you’d have one of these waves of dislocation and fixed income, you started seeing more and more and more investors gravitate to bond ETFs. The big one was COVID. So for sure, February, March, 2020, you know, even treasuries, high quality investment grade, you know, the whole thing e everything was seeing dislocation, right? And so that’s when we saw probably our largest wave of adoption in, in fixed income ETFs was during that period of time, same story. You saw things that people would just take for granted suddenly struggling, you know, in terms of bid ask and depth of liquidity. But what could you trade? You could trade bond ETFs, you could trade ’em in size. That got, at that point a lot of attention because now the products have scaled to a level where even the largest investors could use them in their portfolios. And so that was interesting. 00:17:46 [Speaker Changed] So you’re absolutely preaching to the, the choir. I have heard mostly on the equity side, but also on the fixed income side. You know, these ETFs, you don’t know what the underlying is priced at. They’re filled with all sorts of stuff. It’s really hard to get a print on when it hits the fan. You’re not gonna be able to get in or out of it. You’re gonna have giant spreads and no liquidity. That wasn’t true in oh 8, 0 9. That wasn’t true during the flash crash COVI and the most recent tariff volatility, even in 22 when stocks and bonds were both down double digits for the first time in four plus decades, ETFs traded like rock stars. Why is this such persistent squabbling, you know, you’ll see just wait. Is it that people are losing business to ETFs? Why is there so much fear and concern that for 25 years have been completely unjustified? 00:18:45 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think it’s a little bit of, it might be a little bit of 00:18:49 [Speaker Changed] The sour grapes 00:18:50 [Speaker Changed] A little bit, but I, I think part of it too was after the crisis, there was, it felt to me like there was this search for what’s the next thing, right? What’s the next thing that could go wrong? Not quite sure where, why that focus shifted to ETFs, but it was ETFs and probably a number of other things. But I think the idea of a bond ETF in particular drew attention because the, the talk track was, well, you’re taking something over the counter and you’re putting inside this box and you’re putting this box on exchange. And that might, you know, cause some, some interesting things to happen. And in reality what we’ve seen is just the opposite of those fears. Barry, again, just, you know, you pointed out the tariff volatility, same story, different verse, right? So you have, you know, markets are really, really stressed. 00:19:39 You see a lot of dislocations volumes on exchange. Once again, set new records. I think, you know, on the day of the announcements, I think we saw close to a hundred billion dollars of bond ETFs strain on exchange. Wow. Way more than the, the previous record during, during COVID. But the, the sort of, I think skeptic has always said, well, you know, we haven’t seen a good test yet. We haven’t seen a good test yet. I think COVID was a good test. This was just a reminder, right? And so really what happens is, you know, the exchange keeps trading even if the underlying doesn’t. And unlike, you know, the fears, you don’t see these quote unquote forced redemptions or anything like that. Nobody’s forced to redeem an ETF. It can just trade on exchange. And I think that’s the elegance of it. It gets proven time and time again. 00:20:25 [Speaker Changed] So I just wanna define some terms you reference. ’cause in the back of my head I’m always thinking, does my real estate agent mom or my art teacher wife know what that means? So when we talk about on the exchange, we’re talking about anything that’s publicly traded that you could just log onto your online trading account, buy or sell instantly. When we talk about over the counter OTC, that’s one bond desk calling another bond desk and saying, Hey, do you guys have this 2019, you know, muni, California muni series, whatever, and someone has to go locate that. So over the counter means two people literally speaking to each other to engage in a transaction. Is that, is that a fair description? 00:21:11 [Speaker Changed] That That’s exactly right. And so yes, over time bond trading’s gotten more efficient. You know, in the underlying market you have electronic trading of treasuries and now, and now credit. But you know, if you go back 20 years when ETFs were, were first new bond ETFs were first new, it was still very much a voice market. It was a very much pick up the phone exactly as you described. And even today, I think even the most sophisticated institutions still believe in the, you know, efficiency and the elegance of being able to trade a bond ETF on exchange you’re trading. If you, if you just step back for a second and think about what you’re actually doing, you’re trading hundreds or sometimes thousands of bonds simultaneously at a penny bid ask on exchange. You actually still can’t do that in the underlying market. So, you know, it doesn’t matter if you’re an individual, it doesn’t matter if you’re a large sovereign wealth fund, that’s still a very impressive feat to be able to, to do a transaction like that. 00:22:08 And bond ETFs allow you to do that. But I wanna get back to, you know, you, you had asked what are sort of the long-term drivers. I think this idea of just, okay, you can trade these things when you need to. That’s important. Another one would be when we’re building portfolios and we see this both, again on the wealth and on the institutional side, do we need to build portfolios with hundreds or thousands of bonds? Or could we take a low cost bond, ETF as sort of the core of that portfolio? Could we then use individual bonds to sort of flavor that or tilt that in different ways and then maybe add our favorite active managers on top of that. Might that be a more efficient way to do it than just going out and buying, you know, to your point, picking up the phone and calling around and putting together hundreds or, or however many bonds which might take days or weeks. And so I think there’s this growing realization that, you know what, it’s fine to trade in and out when things are volatile, but actually might be more efficient to use these things long term in a bond portfolio. So I think that’s a huge part of the adoption too, is the recognition that this might be a smarter way to build bond portfolios in general. On, 00:23:11 [Speaker Changed] On the equity side, I am fond of telling people, before you go chasing alpha, why don’t you at least lock in beta? Yeah. And I’m, I’m pleased to hear that’s a similar approach on the fixed income side. 00:23:25 [Speaker Changed] Very much, very much. And I think it’s a, and and this has been a journey because, you know, you’ve run into this, and I’ve heard you talk about this on your show before. Everybody wants to believe that, you know, if I’m buying the security, I have intent, I did my homework, it matters a great deal. And that may be true for that security. But when you do that a hundred times, some of that starts getting canceled out, right? And so that’s when you have to step back and say, all right, if I’m looking at my portfolio holistically, I want a certain beta, I want a certain tilt, I want a certain amount of yield coming from, you know, one place or another, what’s the most efficient and the cheapest way to do that? And that’s, I think people are slowly recognizing that maybe the ETF actually has that, that has that utility. 00:24:10 [Speaker Changed] So this is a good time to ask a question about active fixed income investing. It seems like it’s super challenging on the equity side. We all know the stats, 60% of active managers underperform their benchmark in year one. By the time you get to five years, it’s 80 plus 10 years, it’s 90 plus. And by the time you get to 21, it’s a handful of guys like Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch. I don’t see that uphill battle the same on the fixed income side. It seems like fixed income active does much better than fixed income equity. Is that fair? Or 00:24:53 [Speaker Changed] I think there are a few things. So, so one, we think that all investing is active to a degree, right? Okay. You’re making decisions. So if you’re using ETFs, you’re making sort of these broad beta calls and you’re deciding, you know, which beta, which sector, what have you. So there’s an active choice there in how you build that portfolio. But to your point, strictly active in fixed income, what does that mean? That means that, hey, I’m going out and I’m assembling a bond portfolio. I’m gonna compare that to a benchmark and I’m gonna see if I beat it. 00:25:21 [Speaker Changed] And you guys have the benchmark, the, the ISU iShares core US ag, or as everybody calls it, the ag 00:25:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, the ag. We have a GG, we have the universal, which is IUSB. One of the things that we’ve been vocal about is which benchmark are you looking at? Because sometimes you’ll see a manager buy a bunch of high yield bonds in their portfolio. Not all, but like, they’ll hold, you know, a large allocation of high yield bonds benchmark to the aggregate, which has none. And say, oh look, I’m beating the aggregate now. That’s, that’s fine. 00:25:57 [Speaker Changed] By taking on more risks, 00:25:58 [Speaker Changed] They’re taking on more risks, right? Okay, that’s fine. You may give some of that back every, call it five years. Right? What we sort of preach too is, okay, let’s get benchmarks that look a little bit closer to the risk you’re taking and see what you’re actually adding through security selection, right? So some of it’s benchmark mis specification, but fixed income markets still are less liquid, they’re more fragmented. So yes, there are opportunities there. And so, you know, people often ask me, do you believe in active or quote passive we call passive index. ’cause actually even in, in, in indexing still an active 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] Choice. 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, exactly. So, 00:26:32 [Speaker Changed] You know, wait, market cap waiting, that’s a choice. 00:26:35 [Speaker Changed] It’s a choice. And so my answer to that is we believe in all of the above, we think the best portfolios have elements of both of these things index and quote unquote active together, much better portfolio, much more resilient than just sort of suiciding one or the other. Oh, I’m all active or I’m all index, right? So we think both makes a lot of sense and that’s, that’s how we sort of design our product set give, given 00:26:59 [Speaker Changed] The million plus QIPs, the million plus bonds that are out there. My simple thesis was always, if you want to be an active fixed income manager, how hard is it to screen out the lowest quality weakest credit, poorest, poorest yield relative to risk you have to take? And if you’re just cutting out the bottom half of that, that should do better than, than whatever the ag is gonna do or whatever your benchmark is. Because there’s, you know, hey, there’s 3,500 stocks, not all of which are great, a million bonds, there’s a lot of room for the bottom, pick a number, decile quartile, half a lot of junk can get mixed up into that. And I don’t mean high yield, I mean lower quality fixed income opportunities. 00:27:46 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And it, this is the trick with fixed income, you could see great opportunities, but when you try to act on them, it can be really costly to actually implement and that cost or just can you find that bond, right? So right. And you locate it, the search cost, the actual transaction cost, wait, 00:28:03 [Speaker Changed] There’s a search cost for locating a bond. I always thought it was kind of built into the transaction cost. I didn’t realize, hey, find me this that’s gonna cost you just to ask that question. 00:28:13 [Speaker Changed] Well, let’s call, let’s call that the time it takes to actually get ahold of it. You’re sitting in cash, right? And, and, and I’ve, I’ve heard you say this many times, you probably should not be singing in cash very long. It, it’s a medium of exchange. Right? That’s 00:28:26 [Speaker Changed] That’s 00:28:26 [Speaker Changed] Right. But, but, but this is the, the time it takes you to locate that particular bond and then you have to pay the transaction cost, you know, the bid ask on top of it. So you know, yes, optically you could see opportunities all over the place. The question is, are you able to actually move on them and implement them at the right, at the right price? And that’s, that’s where there’s a lot of skill involved in fixed income, I think. And, and 00:28:49 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard some clients say, especially institutional clients, listen, my cash, my money allocation, I’ve got that I’ve hired you to do, you are my equity guy, you’re my fixed income, you are my opportunistic distress guy. I don’t need you to carry cash. And I wonder how that impacts people’s thoughts of when you start to see 1, 2, 3, 4% creeping up as a cash balance, gotta put that money to work. There’s an opportunity cost of just sitting in cash fair. 00:29:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and, and there is, I think what has happened the last couple years is, you know, money market assets are, you know, in the trillions. And 00:29:30 [Speaker Changed] So, well now that it’s four and a half, 5% 00:29:32 [Speaker Changed] Now that percent, now it’s four point half 5%. And so there’s been a little bit of what I would call, I think apprehension of giving up that certain or what people view as certain, you know, four and a half to 5% and then moving out. The trick to that is, you know, if you wait too long right? The market’s gonna move past you. 00:29:50 [Speaker Changed] And, and, and we’ve watched it, you know, it broke below four. Yeah, it went back over five. You’re not locking that in. You’re taking what? Look, if you’re saving for a house or something six months a year down in the road and you’re afraid of, you know, 20, 22 type year, of course a money market makes perfect sense. But if you’re looking out a couple of years, you, you want a product where you can sort of lock in a higher yield fair statement. Yeah. 00:30:16 [Speaker Changed] And you also want to be able to have, so look, cash is great. We, we launched money market ETFs. Cash plays a role in a portfolio, to your point, it shouldn’t be a huge part of the portfolio. You need to get those assets allocated, you know, on a risk basis. So whether it’s, you know, equities, safe bonds, riskier bonds, it’s like an orchestra, right? You have your string section, your horn section, they all need to play together and just sitting on the sidelines, that’s okay for a while, but it’s, it doesn’t make very good music. You need to actually have everything, you know, kind of playing its role in the portfolio. And so I long term, that is what’s going to actually, you know, build your return, 00:30:55 [Speaker Changed] Right? And I’m spitballing these numbers off the top of my head. I have to double check them. But I wanna say cash is a drag on performance four to five years in equity and nine outta 10 years in fixed income. Am I close there? Ballpark? 00:31:09 [Speaker Changed] Haven’t heard that part on fixed income, but, but I, I, I, I see your point. I mean, you know, if you just sit forever and the fed cuts rates, you’re going to miss it, right? And so that’s, that’s right. That’s, and you know, and I think the consensus right now is ah, you know, maybe they’ll cut a couple times this year, maybe a couple times next year, things can move pretty quickly on the ground. And you know, it’s one of those things where, you know, yeah, by the time you wake up and decide to move, the market may have already moved past you. I mean, to your point, we were at around four point a half percent almost a year ago. And guess where we’re sitting at today? Around four point a half percent. But it’s been quite a bumpy ride up and down. And so who knows where we’ll be in six months. So 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] The question is of if you were sitting in money markets for the past year, or you had bought some equivalent bond ETF, which performed better over the past 12 months, given all the volatility, 00:32:02 [Speaker Changed] Well, on a risk adjusted basis, you could say, all right, I had less risk in the money market and I’m sort of sitting where I was, you know, year. Yeah. But if 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] You’re in high quality bonds, how much risk is there really? 00:32:11 [Speaker Changed] If you, if you bought sort of last, if you, if you think about where we were closer to 5%, you know, you actually ended up locking in pretty good yields. Now the one thing I would say is it’s hard to time, it’s hard to time rates very, it might be actually the hardest thing to do is to time the top in yields that can be a very, very fleeting thing. So it’s more about get invested, build a durable portfolio, make sure you have risk in the right buckets. You need some high quality bonds for ballast, you need some riskier bonds for income, right? That all plays together with the equity side and the alt side of your portfolio. All these things need to come together. Yes, cash plays a role, but you will probably miss out on some very good opportunities. We haven’t had yields like this in 20 years. Right? So are you really going to try to hit the top when you’re seeing yields that have, are as good as they’ve been in a, in a generation? Yeah. So you can get greedy, right? But, 00:33:06 [Speaker Changed] Which is kind of funny ’cause it, it, oh, I always laugh when I think about someone who’s 40, 45 years old on a stock desk, on a bond desk, have not seen 7% yields Yeah. In their entire professional career. And I recall people’s bonds coming up, like the New York City geo bonds finally got called 7%. Like they were getting, I’m getting 15%, what am I gonna do with 7% their, that was when New York City was gonna collapse. You can’t get 15% today, 7% treasuries. Hey, that’s a good deal. No one realized how great a deal it was, right. 25 years ago. But that’s just, just the reality. Yeah. 00:33:47 [Speaker Changed] And then you do have to go back to the mid two thousands to see yields at these levels. So it’s a great opportunity and we, you know, rather than saying, well I really wanna hold on until 5% I, you know, I mean you, you just may miss it. So we with, we think it’s just a great, great time in fixed income. 00:34:03 [Speaker Changed] A a absolutely. And I wanna just remind everybody who thinks they can time yields or the fed collectively, everybody has been completely wrong about when the Fed was gonna start cutting, how far they were gonna cut, how often they would’ve cut. Like the consensus could not possibly have been more wrong for like, what, three years? Yeah. Four years. Here comes the recession, here comes the fed cuts, here comes if you’re waiting, ’cause you think you can guess if you’re gonna be a macro tourist, best of luck to you, 00:34:34 [Speaker Changed] Right? Yeah, exactly. It’s build the portfolio for the long term, you know, and, and you may say, well, I could have gotten a higher yield, or Hey, I locked in a pretty good yield year. Either way it’s about the next 10 years. It’s not about the next month. Huh. 00:34:49 [Speaker Changed] Really, really interesting. So let’s start out talking about fixed income today and the obvious spike in bond market volatility we’ve seen this year. Tell us what’s going on. 00:35:02 [Speaker Changed] It’s, we’ve covered a, a couple of these things, but it’s pick your theme. Okay, so let’s, let’s go back a few years. We had COVID we had the policy response to that. We then had transitory inflation, which became not transitory inflation. We then had the, we had the reverse policy response, which was to aggressively hike rates the i the most aggressive tightening cycle in, in 40 years, right? So people were used to seeing rates, you know, bumping up against zero. I think at one point the 10 year yield was, you know, somewhere in the, you know, 60, 70 basis point range at the very, very, very lows. And I think this was quite a shock to people who were just sort of used to seeing the post-crisis, post-crisis, sorry, quantitative easing regime. All of a sudden you have yields moving, you know, to a two handle, three handle, four handle, and then ultimately a five handle something. 00:35:56 To your point, many investors haven’t seen this before. And so it was, it was quite a shock to the system then we kind of hit sort of equilibrium. The economy seems to be doing all right as we talked about, you know, people were worried about recession, it hasn’t materialized yet. The fed, you know, paused for a while, started easing, then all of a sudden you get new policy initiatives coming in, specifically tariffs, right? And so that caused a general rethinking of the way the economy is going to move going forward. Will inflation come back, won’t it? It’s just been, you know, a lot of up and downs and, and as we were talking, if you just look at the trajectory of the tenure yield, you know, we, we just sort of do this large, you know, kind of sine wave between, you know, call it sort of high threes and high fours and we’ve been doing that now for a few years. So you’re just sort of stuck in the middle of, you know, kind of a four handle, but you get these ups and downs depending on, on what the driver is. 00:36:56 [Speaker Changed] And just to put some specifics on this, when, when we look at the broad economic consensus about tariffs, they’re generally perceived as inflationary, sort of a giant vat tax on consumers. I know a lot of people in the administration push back on that characterization, but if you’re spending more money on tariffs, you have that much less money to spend on other things. Therefore it should hurt corporate revenues and perhaps be someone inflationary. Is that, is that a fair assessment? 00:37:29 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s hard to say. So I think, you know, I’ve heard both arguments. I think really what inflation is about, right? So we, whether it’s tariffs or something else, you know, people often talk about these things is well that’s a one time shock versus something that happens repeatedly over and over again. I think some of that’s academic inflation’s really. I almost think it’s a mind game or an expectations game. The real, I think question is, does inflation, you know, a higher expectation for inflation somehow get embedded or get sort of resurfaced, right? As a result of whatever policy initiative. And so I think what the Fed’s looking at is less about a specific thing and more about whether people start worrying that inflation will be at X level, like, which may be above where the Fed wants it to be. To me, I think that’s what they’re really focused on is, you know, hey, we got things down, we’re at 2.3%. 00:38:23 And by the way, what’s interesting, I actually looked at this, if you go back to, let’s call it 95 to 2005, average inflation was around two and a half, right? Not two, right? So, so if you kinda look at a long, long time series on Bloomberg as an example, right now where we’re sitting isn’t too far off where we’ve been on a long, you know, 20 odd, 30 odd year journey. But I think what the fed’s worried about is will any particular action cause people to start worrying that inflation will be higher? And as you know, sometimes that that can become sort of a self-fulfilling thing. I think that’s kind of the concern. So I’m 00:38:58 [Speaker Changed] Gonna play devil’s advocate on every point you, you said, and I want to hear your pushback, but before I get to that, former vice chairman of the Fed, Roger Ferguson, did this accidentally very funny piece about the 2% target and he could not find an academic basis for that number, but he traced it back to an interview from the Australian, their central bank chief on TV in the 1980s. And he mentioned 2% as their target. That was the first mention of it. I, I mean it certainly was a credible target in the post financial crisis while we were trying to get up to 2% inflation and deflation was the fear. But once the cares act and the new era of fiscal stimulus passed, isn’t 2% kind of the wrong target. Why doesn’t two and a half or 3% make sense in an era of fiscal, not monetary stimulus? 00:40:01 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna, I’m gonna say that is above my pay grade, but, but what I will say is if you look at a long, long time series, whether it’s two, whether it’s two and a half, I mean, I think generally right now we’re sort of in that zip code, right? So can they get it all the way down to a perfect two? I don’t know. And, and and do they want to, or you know, does, do you risk going to one and a half? I mean that’s, that’s for them to worry about. I do think that we’re not too far off. If you, if you were to look at this over many, many, many years, the worry is somehow, does everything that’s happening right now start sending you in the other direction Again, people worrying about it, does that start, you know, causing, you know, specific actions that actually lead to it to a becoming more of a reality? I think that’s what the fed’s sort of focused on. 00:40:46 [Speaker Changed] And, and I, I think transitory has become a dirty word, but i i we sometimes want stuff right now I can make the case that this bout of fiscally driven inflation was transitory. Transitory just took a little longer than everybody expected compared to the sort of deep structural inflation we saw in the 1970s. This wasn’t structural. We passed a giant, everybody stay home. Here’s $2 trillion, takes a little while for the pig to work its way through the python. Yeah, right. 00:41:21 [Speaker Changed] That’s interesting. I mean, yeah, you had a huge, huge fiscal impulse, you know, very, very significant fiscal impulse and sure it could take time for that to work through. If you couple that with the idea that you unleashed that fiscal impulse at a time when policy was still easy, the textbooks would tell you that you probably should expect some inflation. But I think, you know, if you look at just the way people had sort of entrenched their thinking post-crisis, they were caught off guard. 00:41:47 [Speaker Changed] When, when you were at Wharton, did you have Jeremy Siegel as a professor? 00:41:51 [Speaker Changed] I did not. I did sit, I was a little bit, I was a little bit disgruntled about that. It didn’t work, didn’t work out scheduling. I did sit on in on some of his lectures just as a, as a guest. So in the back row. But yeah, 00:42:02 [Speaker Changed] I had him in here, I don’t know, two months after the first cares act was was passed and he was the first person I recall saying, Hey, this is economics 1 0 1, $2 trillion, the largest fiscal stimulus as a percentage of GDP since World War ii. We are gonna see a giant bout of inflation, maybe even double digits. And I, I got emails, we love Jeremy, you’ve had him on the past, but he’s crazy. We’re not gonna get anywhere near nine 10%. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about. And it was kind of shocking to hear someone stocks for the long run talk about inflation and bond yields and he turned out to be pretty dead on. 00:42:44 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Again, if you just sort of go back and you look at a large fiscal impulse coupled with easy monetary policy that’s right out of the textbooks 00:42:54 [Speaker Changed] And, and yet it was so hard, another failure of imagination was so hard to say, no, no, we’ve had inflation 2% for 20, 25 years. What are you talking eight, nine, 10%? Yeah, it just, it just seemed that regime change was so hard to incorporate ’cause it just seemed like such a break from everything we’ve experienced before 00:43:17 [Speaker Changed] And it happened quickly 00:43:19 [Speaker Changed] Very, very, very quickly. So, so, so let’s talk a little bit about the next easing cycle. I’m assuming that six months from now, by the time we get into the fall, the worst of the tariff is behind us. Things will have stabilized at that point. Is the Fed starting to think, all right, we can unfreeze the housing market a little bit and talk, talk about a few more rate cuts this year or next? Like what sort of timing should we be thinking about? 00:43:50 [Speaker Changed] That’s what the market, I looked at this this morning, the market’s pricing in a couple cuts by the end of the year pricing in a couple cuts next year. And so it looks to me the market sort of settled on this idea that maybe we’ll up with a terminal rate of around, you know, three and a quarter, three and a half, somewhere in that zip code. So, we’ll, we’ll see. I mean the cut definitely got pushed out to September, right? I think originally, you know, if you go back even, you know, a few weeks ago we were still thinking sort of, you know, mid to late summer, but that’s, that’s now pushed into September for sure. So, so we’ll see. 00:44:24 [Speaker Changed] So the big question is, everybody’s been expecting cuts for so long and has been so wrong. Is there anything in the data that you look at that suggests a maybe we’re gonna get it right this time in terms of the Wall Street consensus as to when the timing of rate cuts might be? 00:44:42 [Speaker Changed] Well you j you just said it, consensus has a funny way of maybe not actually materializing, right? So I think everybody’s sort of locked in on this, on this path now it looks like just the way the curve is shaped and everything else. Well we will see I, the data has come in, you know, it depends. You, you can find, you can find people who have raised growth concerns, but then you can also find the resiliency crowd. There’s, there’s just a lot of, i I think sort of mixed data right now, but overall, you know, the economy seems to be holding in pretty well so far, 00:45:13 [Speaker Changed] Pretty resilient. You know, one of the things I always look at are spreads and they seem to be relatively low for all the people running around with their hair on fire. They are, yeah. What does that tell us of the state of the economy and, and the state of the fixed income markets? 00:45:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think if you, whether you’re looking at investment grade spreads or high yield spreads, right? The spreads to treasuries, they’re both pretty tight relative to historical, long-term historical averages. So yeah, the credit markets are telling you that so far they are buying the resiliency story. They think that, you know, balance sheets are still in pretty good shape. I mean you’ve heard this anecdote before that when yields were low, corporations did do, you know, very thoughtful issuance and they were able to lock in yields and really, you know, shore up their balance sheets and, and have these strong cash flow profiles. Now ultimately people will have to refinance and you know, that may be at higher yield. So we’ll see how long that holds. But so far spreads are telling you that the resiliency story is intact. 00:46:17 [Speaker Changed] So corporate debt issuers refinance that at lower rates. Households did it, everybody did it except Uncle Sam, we’ll save that for another time. But if you’re a buyer of debt, how should you be thinking about duration? When do you start extending your duration? Looking to lock in a little higher yield on the possibility that we see lower rates in the future? This, 00:46:42 [Speaker Changed] This is the debate capital THE, right? So I think we’ve been very much in the camp of, you know, the intermediate part of the curve is pretty attractive. So you know, if you’re looking in five 00:46:56 [Speaker Changed] To seven, see a three 00:46:56 [Speaker Changed] To seven somewhere in that zip code, you know, whether it’s in treasuries or, or high grade or even even high, high yields in that area. Anyway, that’s the maturity profile. But if you look at that versus say 30 years, I think that, you know, right now a lot of debate going on, on the fiscal situation, Moody’s action sort of resurfaced that debate. If you look at term premium meaning, and you know, again, let’s define terms the amount that investors want for holding very long-term bonds has gone up quite a lot over the last several months. And I think all of this is sort of playing into this idea that yeah, longer term yields are flirting with 5%, could they go higher? They might, there’s a lot of ambiguity around what our fiscal trajectory is. Are we at risk for further deterioration? We are running deficits with a growing economy and that is, you know, and we’re running larger ones than we historically have with a, with a growing economy. 00:47:53 So that’s what’s caused this fear of the long end. Now are longer term bonds to be avoided completely. I think there’s healthy debate on that. I do think that they still hold some shock absorber value, right? Depending on the situation. So, you know, we like we, we kind of frame this as being positioned, you know, overweight in sort of this, this belly of the curve. ’cause we think that’s a sweet spot. It doesn’t mean that you should have zero right long-term bonds, you know, it could be having some might be a good sort of, you know, insurance policy in a way. 00:48:24 [Speaker Changed] So when, when yield comes down, bond values go up and vice versa. If you’re making a bet, what’s the next 200 basis points in yield? Is it more likely to go higher or more likely to go lower? It would take a pretty big screw up to send yields up 200 basis points. Not a zero possibility, but is that kind of the core bet we’re more likely to see move down than up? 00:48:51 [Speaker Changed] I think the current view is that long-term yields could edge higher on this time edge, higher 00:48:58 [Speaker Changed] Edge, higher like 25, 50 basis points that’s 00:49:01 [Speaker Changed] Been discussed. Five ’cause this idea that depending, okay, depending on how the tax and spending bills come out and how people score that and what’s that gonna look like for the deficit, et cetera, et cetera. You know, the discussion could be, could you see further pressure on the very, very long end? The intermediate part is probably, okay, so the real debate is, are we gonna see more of a steepening depending on the outcome of, of the, you know, tax and spending bills, et cetera, et cetera. That’s been the debate. Now if you get an unexpected slowdown, you could see long-term yields come down temporarily. And so to your point, you know, do you get 200 basis points up or do you get 50 to a hundred down? It all depends on, you know, the unexpected. By definition if you get a sharp slowdown that nobody saw coming, you probably do see longer term yields coming down. And I think not a lot of people are expecting that at all. 00:49:52 [Speaker Changed] Well except everybody for the past five years predicting recessions that never showed up. The other question that I always like to ask is, hey, what happens if we yields don’t go appreciably higher or lower? Can we just be stuck in a four point a quarter to four and three quarter, you know, money market yields, plus or minus around four point a half percent. What does that look like? Can we just stay in that range for 3, 4, 5 years? 00:50:20 [Speaker Changed] Sure. Are you likely to probably not. History would tell us that except for you had this long period that doesn’t look really like anything that we’ve seen. The the 2010s. Yeah, the 2010s, right. Yeah, it’s just totally unique. So unless we go back to the 2010s, probably not, but, but I think, you know, my earlier point, it’s gonna be really hard to call, like this is the best yield that I want to get into. It’s more about we’re gonna have ups, we’re gonna have downs, we’ll have cycles. It’s really about building that portfolio out for the, for the long term and getting income. So it’s the first time in 20 odd years the income is back in fixed income. So that’s pretty compelling. 00:50:57 [Speaker Changed] So if, if someone’s fixed income investor or looking to add fixed income as a sort of shock absorber to their equity portfolios, what segments of the fixed income market do you find attractive? Where are the opportunities today? 00:51:13 [Speaker Changed] We’ve been seeing flows mostly go into very high quality. So that being treasuries, that being investment grade, that’s where, you know, the bulk of flows have been moving into. And again, much of it has been in that sort of belly of the curve type of exposure. Now, mathematically as a shock absorber, you’re gonna get your biggest kick from the very long end of the curve. We just talked about that, right? You’re taking some risk there. So 00:51:37 [Speaker Changed] ’cause if it goes the other way, if 00:51:38 [Speaker Changed] It goes the other way, it hurts, right? And so the debate’s going to be, you know, will it play that role if you get a big slowdown, right? If you get a huge risk off, will you see long, long-term yields rally like they have in the past in light of some of the fiscal concerns? That’s the big, big 00:51:54 [Speaker Changed] Debate and the dollar concerns on top of it. Yeah, 00:51:56 [Speaker Changed] That’s the debate. But, 00:51:57 [Speaker Changed] And and what about, you know, we always have clients who are looking into their retirement, you know, I just want X dollars and not worry about taxes. If you’re in a high tax state, how are you looking at the muni markets these days? 00:52:12 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, and I think Munis have, have really, you know, seen some whipsaw as well, right? So a lot of folks now look at, look at Munis and see some opportunities there. Again, this discussion around tax policy has really, really sort of caused a lot of volatility. At some point you just have to really make an allocation decision and if you’re, if you are, you know, in a high tax bracket, I mean Munis can be pretty compelling and they’ve cheapened up a fair amount. 00:52:40 [Speaker Changed] All right. So I only have you for a limited amount of time. Let’s jump to my favorite questions that I ask all of my guests. Starting with what’s keeping you entertaining these days? What are you watching or listening to? 00:52:54 [Speaker Changed] Well, so the funny part about this is it’s so masters in business, big fan. I, we already talked about that, but no, I also, 00:53:03 [Speaker Changed] Whenever someone says that, I always feel like Rodney Dangerfield and Cady Shack keep it fair, keep it fair, keep it 00:53:08 [Speaker Changed] Fair. No, I right now, you know, streaming wise, my, my wife makes this joke. So she, and, and my, my older sons, you know, will watch Yellowstone or something like that. I’ve always got my laptop open. Right. And so she’s like, you, you, you don’t really watch TV with us. You pretend to. But I think one of the fun things I’m watching, you know, friends and neighbors right now, 00:53:30 [Speaker Changed] So Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. It’s fun. It’s funny. Are you, are you caught up? 00:53:33 [Speaker Changed] Not caught up. Not caught up. I’m 00:53:34 [Speaker Changed] Looking at, oh yeah, so the, well, whatever the last episode was five. Really fun twist. No, 00:53:40 [Speaker Changed] No spoilers. 00:53:41 [Speaker Changed] No spoilers. Absolutely. But, but yeah, so on, not unexpected, but the way they execute it was really well done. Alright, cool. 00:53:49 [Speaker Changed] That’ll, that’ll, that’ll be some good binge. And I, I, I am still very fond of binge watching Law and Order. I will try purposely to hold out. ’cause I do like binge watching, really all of the above, right? So whether it’s organized crime or, or what have you. So 00:54:03 [Speaker Changed] My wife makes eight o’clock, the screens go away. You gonna watch tv, you have to put that away. So that means right before I go to bed the last couple of minutes, let me just see, 00:54:13 [Speaker Changed] We try to impose that rule. It kind of falls apart. 00:54:16 [Speaker Changed] No, no. She’s the strict stern task master. She who must be obeyed. Alright, so let’s talk about, you mentioned one of your mentors. Tell us about the folks who helped shape your career. 00:54:28 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and, and many of them are, are folks who’ve moved on. But I, I think there are certain people that I remember, you know, who really gave good advice and, and you know, I’ll give you a couple of examples. I had a boss, one of my first ones out of, out of, out of business school, and he basically said, look, I view my job as teaching you. I want you to listen and learn and then if you work hard, I view my other job is to help you create financial security for yourself and your family. Huh. But you have to do those things in order for that to happen. So if you listen and you work hard, I’ll try to keep up my side of it as well. And I, that always struck me and I thought that was a, a, a great way to put it. 00:55:12 You know, he viewed his job as teaching, but also if I did the right things to, to help me in the long term. And so I thought that was really interesting. Another mentor, you know, told me that you can be really good at what you do, but you really have to get along with people. You really have to be able to know where somebody else is coming from, work well with people because you can be great at what you do, but if you’re not pleasant to work with, it’s not gonna get you too far at all. And so I think that’s, that’s another lesson. I mean, you know, a lot of times you like to think you’re right in a certain debate or whatever, but you really do have to learn to bridge those gaps or it doesn’t even matter how good you are, what you do. Huh. 00:55:52 [Speaker Changed] Good, good advice for anyone listening, let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading currently? 00:55:59 [Speaker Changed] Well, reading How to Think Like a Monk. 00:56:02 [Speaker Changed] Huh? I saw that go by on Amazon. This 00:56:05 [Speaker Changed] Was a, yeah, no, it’s pretty cool. I had a friend of mine, I’m not sure why he recommended that book to me, and there might be a hidden message in there, but I think that’s pretty cool. 00:56:13 [Speaker Changed] Don’t read too much into 00:56:14 [Speaker Changed] It. One of my, you know, I I, I like history books and so, you know, I’ve read a lot of the Ken Burn stuff. I, I think in particular, the things I’ve been fascinated with the sixties I think really helped shape the world that we’re living in the For sure. So I’ve been a junkie of a lot of that stuff. And in terms 00:56:30 [Speaker Changed] Of name some authors and books you 00:56:31 [Speaker Changed] Like, oh no, Ken, the Ken Burns stuff. I love all of his Ken Burns stuff’s. Right? Yeah. Really like that. So, but, but I’ll watch any number of documentaries. I just think that really was a pivotal time for the country and the world and kind of has echoes and, you know, really long shadows. So I always thought that was, that was really interesting. I like a book that really kind of stuck with me over the years. It was about, you know, I love math statistics, all that stuff. It was a book called Against the Gods and it was the, oh, remarkable story Risk I 00:56:59 [Speaker Changed] Love about Peter Bernstein. Yeah. Oh my god. One of my favorites. One of the all time great finance books that most people Absolutely 100% should be reading. No, no doubt about that. So I always pick out a handful of books to read over the summer. I’m so happy sitting on the beach wave, crashing in the background, banging through book after book. What just came a couple of days ago was Ron Chernow’s, mark Twain. Oh wow, okay. And you know, Chernow did Hamilton, he did a bunch of giant books. I’m super excited about that. So I’ll I’ll let you know if that’s interesting. I can’t imagine it’s not given both the author and the subject matter. Alright, our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either investing or specifically fixed income and ETFs? 00:57:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think the most important thing is you have to be honest with yourself about what you like to do. And so I, I have met, I’ve met students who want, say they want to get into the markets, and you know, when you ask why that is, they have trouble articulating why. So I think part of it is you just really gotta want to do this because if it’s gonna be your life’s pursuit, you gotta wake up on good days and bad days and still wanna do it. Right? And there are good days and there are very bad days, and you still have to have that same sort of love of it. And so if you don’t love it, right, if it’s not, if you’re just saying, well, you know, I heard it’s a profitable thing, I want to, you know, I have, I have these certain personal goals, that’s, that’s not a good reason to do it. 00:58:34 But if, if you really do love the idea of markets and just this, you know, really elegant thing where somebody, you know, two people on the opposite sides of the planet can somehow find a common price. You know, what, what’s the saying? A trade is an agreement on price, a disagreement on value. I always thought that was love the coolest thing. Love. Right? So, you know, just this idea that, you know, the markets find a way. I, I think if you love that, then it’s the right career for you. But that, that’s the key thing. Find what you love and be really, really honest with yourself. And, you know, it’s fair to say, I don’t know yet. And that’s why you have to feel around a little bit, you know, whether you’re, you’re trying different things, you know, you may land on one desk and hate it, rotate to another one and love it. It’s, it’s, it’s a process, but you gotta really be honest with yourself. 00:59:19 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. And our final question, what do you know about the world of fixed income ETFs and investing today you wish you knew back in the 1990s when you were first getting started? 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I I’m going to admit this to you. I I know many of your, your admonishments about investing. I was, I was an original sinner on many of them. Hey, I, 00:59:42 [Speaker Changed] I, no one bigger than me. I, I, I learned the hard way. So 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] I, I did in fact do a lot of the common mistakes. You know, I I I chase things. I remember, you know, during the original internet boom, buying some really expensive racy mutual funds, which I subsequently rode into the ditch. So I think part of it is, you know, the long-term idea, you know, really, really taking like that long-term view. Now I I I did learn not to panic over the years. Right, right. And not, you know, sort of, 01:00:14 [Speaker Changed] You know, useful skillset if you run a trillion dollars, 01:00:17 [Speaker Changed] I think try to, try to, you know, keep your money, you know, don’t pay away too much of fees and definitely don’t chase the hot, hot thing. I think being diversified, you look, it may not be fun to talk about with your friends, but having a broad diversified portfolio over time, you’re gonna be fine. It’s, it’s, it’s hair raising sometimes, but you’re gonna be fine over the long term. Yeah. 01:00:37 [Speaker Changed] Very often the cocktail chatter, i i it’s not what makes you money. I love the title of Ned Davis’s first book. Do you wanna be Right or do you wanna Make Money? Right, right. And, and that really sums it up. Yep. Well, Steve, this has been really fascinating.

Title: Crypto Bull Run Over? Here’s What A Top Trader Just Said
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-bull-run-over-what-top-trader-just-said/
Time Published: 2025-06-23T09:00:44Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. With Bitcoin precariously recovering above the $100,000 mark and altcoins bleeding momentum, traders are asking the obvious: Is the crypto bull run over? According to systematic trader Adam Bakay (@abetrade), the answer is not so clear-cut. In a detailed market breakdown posted June 22, Bakay offered a technically grounded, cautiously defensive assessment—one that acknowledges geopolitical risks but stays rooted in positioning and price structure. “Looking at the monthly and weekly timeframes, we are still technically in an uptrend,” Bakay wrote, noting that “no key swing low was broken, and the 365-day rolling VWAP has been respected during the pullback in April.” Despite this, he admits that “the failure to make new all-time highs similar to the top in 2021” is a concern—especially given the accumulation by players like BlackRock, which now holds around 3.5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. It’s that divergence—between strong institutional interest and a market struggling to break higher—that has made Bakay more cautious in recent weeks. “This is why I have been very defensive and kept most of my trades short-term,” he said. His trading view focuses on two potential technical scenarios: either a reclaim of the $100,000 support area—“likely if the conflict in the Middle East does not further escalate”—or a dip into the $97,000–$95,000 range, where strong technical support resides in the form of the 200-day moving average, local price structure, and the 90-day rolling VWAP. Still, Bakay made it clear he’s not shorting the market. “I am not currently considering any short trades due to my current positioning,” he emphasized, adding that open interest is dropping and that we are starting to see the “first signs of clear spot bid interest since the April lows.” The options market, meanwhile, is flashing early caution: the 25-delta risk reversal skew sits around -5, not yet at panic levels, but trending more negative. On Ethereum, Bakay was notably blunt. “ETH almost had its moment, but of course had to become a disappointment,” he said. He attributes the failed breakout in part to how quickly the “DeFi Summer 2025” narrative went viral. “People are getting too horny, and market made sure to punish them,” he noted, referencing his own tweet from a few days earlier. The technical picture on ETH doesn’t inspire confidence either. “During significant market moves, like we had at the beginning of May, the last thing you want to see is price retracing throughout that area,” he explained, saying the next meaningful support lies near $1,800. On the daily chart, Ethereum is sitting right at a confluence of support—both the 90-day rolling VWAP and what he calls a “pivotal level.” Still, much like Bitcoin, Bakay sees Ethereum’s short-term fate as largely dependent on developments in the Middle East. On positioning, ETH also shows signs of an oversold environment, though Bakay believes high volatility in ETH options has caused traders to use spreads instead of outright directional bets. “Positioning is now very clearly pointing towards the possible upside reversal in both perpetual and spot,” he said. Altcoins received no reprieve. “Altcoins have not been having fun for quite a while,” Bakay wrote, pointing out that “every time it starts to look better, it will almost immediately get worse.” He notes that the expected rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins hasn’t materialized, and the real rotation now seems to be into crypto-related equities, which better reflect the ETF-driven macro trade. Even strong names like Solana are fading. “SOL has almost retraced the entire rally from April,” he warned. The key level to watch is $100. “There is not much of a technical support sub-$100,” and if “shit hits the fan,” Bakay would look to bid around that round number. Bakay also briefly touched on two newer altcoins—Hype and Fartcoin—saying one offers a solid product and the other draws interest through volatility and liquidity. “Fartcoin would become attractive if it could reclaim the $1 or $0.50 area. Hype could find a bounce sub-$30.” His closing thoughts were pragmatic: “We are not in easy market conditions, with a lot of geopolitical uncertainty, and markets can be significantly affected by a single news release.” While he believes the market may be “getting too short at the moment,” he remains highly conscious of the possibility that a multi-month correction is already in play. “I don’t think there is a need to be a hero and try to catch a falling knife,” he concluded. “I would much rather wait for some positive news and signs of lower timeframe reversals.” In essence, Bakay doesn’t call the top. But his post makes one thing clear: this is not a market for bravado. It’s a time for restraint, tight risk management, and respect for volatility—especially when the bullish case no longer has momentum on its side. At press time, BTC traded at $101,847. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it. Through his extensive work with NewsBTC.com and Bitcoinist.com, Jake has become a trusted voice in the crypto community, guiding newcomers and seasoned enthusiasts alike towards a deeper understanding of this dynamic field.

Through his extensive work with NewsBTC.com and Bitcoinist.com, Jake has become a trusted voice in the crypto community, guiding newcomers and seasoned enthusiasts alike towards a deeper understanding of this dynamic field. His mission is simple yet profound: to demystify Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and make them accessible to everyone. With a professional career in the Bitcoin and crypto scene that began right after graduating with a degree in Information Systems in 2017, Jake has immersed himself in the industry. Jake joined the NewsBTC Group in late 2022. His educational background provides him with the technical prowess and analytical skills necessary to dissect complex topics and present them in an understandable format. Whether you are a casual reader curious about Bitcoin or an investor seeking to navigate the latest market trends, Jake’s insights offer valuable perspectives that bridge the gap between complex technology and everyday usage. Jake is not just a reporter on technological trends; he is a firm believer in the transformative potential of Bitcoin over traditional fiat currencies. To him, the current financial system is on the brink of chaos, propelled by unchecked government actions and flawed Keynesian economic policies. Drawing from the principles of the Austrian school of economics, Jake views Bitcoin not merely as a digital asset but as a crucial step towards rectifying a failing monetary system. His libertarian views reinforce his stance that just as the church was separated from the state, so too should money be freed from governmental control. For Jake, Bitcoin represents more than just an investment; it's a peaceful revolution. He envisions a future where Bitcoin fosters a sustainable and responsible financial framework for generations to come. His advocacy is not about opposition but about evolution, about laying the groundwork for a system that prioritizes transparency and equity over secrecy and inequality.

As Krugman focused on Bitcoin’s wild price swings, Haun steered the conversation toward something else — stablecoins. “Stablecoins are really interesting and really important to this ecosystem to hedge against that volatility,” she argued onstage, explaining how digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar could offer the benefits of blockchain technology without the ups and downs of traditional cryptocurrencies. Krugman dismissed the idea entirely. It wasn’t exactly a turning point in Haun’s career, but it was one moment among others that have helped define it. A former federal prosecutor, Haun brings an unusual background to crypto investing, having spent over a decade investigating financial crimes and creating the government’s first cryptocurrency task force. After becoming the first female partner at Andreessen Horowitz in 2018 and co-leading its crypto funds, she founded Haun Ventures in 2022 with over $1.5 billion in assets under management. Hanging her own shingle hasn’t been without its complexities. Despite her role at a16z and the industry connections that came with it, the two haven’t publicly co-invested in anything since shortly after she launched her fund, and Haun stepped down from Coinbase’s board last year while Marc Andreessen remains a director. When asked Wednesday night at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event about her relationship with Andreessen Horowitz, she downplayed any potential friction while acknowledging they aren’t collaborators exactly. “There’s no ‘gentleman’s agreement,’” she said, echoing this editor’s question about whether there’s any understanding to avoid competing with her former employer. “In fact, I still talk to Andreessen Horowitz. You’re right that we haven’t really done any deals together of late.” The apparent lack of co-investment could reflect the cutthroat industry or the challenges associated with leaving one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent firms to compete directly with former colleagues. Whatever the case, Haun is now charting her own course, and at the heart of it is stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can swing wildly in value, stablecoins like Circle’s USDC or Tether’s USDT are meant to trade at exactly $1, creating a digital representation of traditional currency that can move on blockchain networks. Indeed, fast-forward to today, and Haun’s belief in stablecoins looks increasingly prescient. Stablecoins — which barely existed in 2015 — now represent a quarter of a trillion dollars in value. They’ve become the 14th largest holder of U.S. Treasuries globally. Reportedly, for the first time last year, stablecoin transaction volume exceeded Visa’s. “I think people who looked at stablecoins a few years ago thought, what is the value prop?” Haun said Wednesday night. “You’ve asked me this before. You said, ‘Why do I need stablecoins?’ And I said, ‘I refer to this as an ‘If it works for me, it works for everyone’ problem.” In reality, for most Americans, the existing financial system works reasonably well. We have Venmo, bank accounts, credit cards. But Haun, drawing on her prosecutor’s understanding of global financial systems, says she has long been aware that the U.S. experience isn’t universal. In countries with unstable currencies or limited banking infrastructure, stablecoins offer something unique, she argues, which is instant access to stable, dollar-denominated value that can be sent anywhere in the world for pennies. “People in Turkey don’t think of Tether as a cryptocurrency,” she said Wednesday. “They think of Tether as money.” The technology has evolved dramatically since those early debates, certainly. Stablecoins once cost $12 to send internationally. And Circle says its USDC stablecoin is fully backed one-to-one by dollars held in JP Morgan bank accounts and audited by Big Four accounting firms. Little wonder the corporate world is taking notice in a big way. Walmart and Amazon are reportedly exploring stablecoins, as are other goliaths like Uber, Apple, and Airbnb. The reason is simple economics. Stablecoins provide a way to move the value of U.S. dollars using cryptocurrency rails instead of traditional banking infrastructure, potentially saving these retail-heavy companies billions in processing fees. But the shift has critics worried about economic chaos. While Circle and Tether are committed to having enough reserves to support their tokens, unlike traditional banks, there’s no insured government protection behind these reserves. Relatedly, if major corporations can issue their own currencies, what happens to monetary policy and banking regulation? The concerns run deeper than just economic disruption. Not all stablecoins are created equal, and many lack the backing and oversight that companies like Circle provide. While well-regulated stablecoins like USDC are backed by actual dollars in U.S. Treasury securities, others operate with less transparency or rely on complex algorithmic mechanisms that have proven vulnerable to collapse. (TerraUSD has had the most specular crash to date, wiping out $60 billion in value when it nosedived.) Corruption concerns in particular came into sharp focus recently when President Donald Trump’s family issued its own stablecoin, a move that highlighted potential conflicts of interest in an industry where political influence can directly impact market value and regulatory outcomes. These concerns came to a head as Congress debated the GENIUS Act, legislation that would create a federal framework for stablecoin regulation. The bill passed the Senate early last week with bipartisan support, with 14 Democrats crossing party lines to support it. It now awaits a House vote before potentially reaching the president’s desk. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, has been particularly vocal in her opposition, calling the legislation a “superhighway for Donald Trump’s corruption.” Her criticism centers on a notable gap in the bill: While it prohibits members of Congress and senior executive branch officials from issuing stablecoin products, it says nothing about their family members. Asked about Warren’s concerns on Wednesday night, Haun practically rolled her eyes. “I think it’s really ironic that Elizabeth Warren or other Democrats who do call this corruption are not running to pass crypto legislation,” she said. “Had there been rules of the road in place [already], there would have been a framework, there would have been clear rules for what’s a security, what’s a commodity, and what are the consumer protections around that.” Haun — whose venture capital firm has made numerous stablecoin investments, including Bridge (acquired by Stripe for reportedly 10 times forward revenue) — is largely supportive of the legislation, unsurprisingly. But she had one notable criticism when asked what she doesn’t like about it: the bill’s prohibition on yield-bearing stablecoins. “I’m not sure that yield-bearing stablecoins are a good idea for consumers in the U.S., but I’m not sure that a prohibition is a good idea,” she told StrictlyVC attendees. The issue comes down to who profits from the interest earned on stablecoin reserves. Currently, that money goes to companies like Circle and Coinbase. But Haun wonders why consumers shouldn’t get that yield, just like they would with a savings account. “If you had a savings account or checking account and you’re getting yield on that, you’re getting interest,” she explained. “What if you just said, ‘No, the bank gets interest, not you,’ and they’re lending out your money?” Haun was less nuanced when it comes to another Warren concern: that if the GENIUS Act is signed into law, stablecoins could become a vehicle for money laundering and terrorism financing. “Criminals are great beta testers of all technologies,” said Haun. “But this technology is highly traceable, way more traceable than cash. The largest criminal instrument is the dollar bill.” (According to Haun, the Treasury Department has testified that 99.9% of money-laundering crimes succeed using traditional bank wires, not cryptocurrency.) Meanwhile, she said, the regulatory clarity that legislation like the GENIUS Act provides could actually make the system safer by distinguishing between legitimate, well-backed stablecoins from more experimental or risky variants. In fact, as the stablecoin ecosystem continues to mature, Haun sees even bigger changes ahead. She envisions a future where all kinds of assets — from money market funds to real estate to private credit — get “tokenized” and made available 24/7 to global markets. “It’s just a digital representation of a physical asset,” she explains. “BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, they’ve already tokenized their money market funds. That’s already happened.” According to Haun, tokenized assets could democratize access to investments in ways similar to how Netflix democratized entertainment. Instead of having to be wealthy enough to meet minimum investment thresholds, someone with $25 and a smartphone could buy fractional ownership in a share of Apple or Amazon, for example. “Just because something’s inevitable doesn’t mean it’s imminent,” Haun said on Wednesday. But she’s confident the transformation is coming, driven by the same forces that made stablecoins successful: They’re faster, cheaper, and, she insists, more accessible than traditional alternatives. Looking back at that 2018 debate with Krugman, Haun’s persistence seems to have paid off. A major question now isn’t whether digital dollars will reshape the financial system but perhaps more importantly, whether regulators can keep pace with the technology while addressing legitimate concerns about corruption, consumer protection, and financial stability. Haun doesn’t seem concerned. While critics point to the fact that stablecoins represent just 2% of global payments, questioning their product-market fit, Haun bats away that concern, too. Instead, she sees this as a familiar tech adoption story — one that has played out repeatedly and often takes longer than people initially imagine. “We think it’s really early days,” she told the crowd.

Title: The Sources of Global Economic Uncertainty
URL: https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/478633/
Time Published: 2025-06-22T04:45:06Z

22 June 2025 Time taken to read : 5 Minute The recent surge in government bond yields has forced business leaders and investors around the world to confront a critical question: Should corporations lock in debt at current interest rates before they rise further? At the same time, higher capital costs and persistent market volatility are compelling investors to reassess their portfolios. The question has become increasingly urgent as the yield on ten-year US Treasuries has climbed 50 basis points to 4.5% in less than a month. The yield on 30-year Treasuries is approaching 5% after rising 30 basis points in May alone. Beyond short-term market swings, at least five structural shifts could reshape the global economic landscape, with the potential to upend corporate strategies, erode investment returns, and further undermine growth prospects. First, there is the United States’ deteriorating fiscal position. The Congressional Budget Office’s latest forecast assumes a ten-year Treasury yield of 4.1% in 2025, falling to 3.8% by 2035. But given that the ten-year yield is already hovering around 4.5% and interest rates are expected to stay elevated, the federal deficit could expand far more quickly than previously anticipated. America’s fiscal trajectory is already unsustainable, with the CBO projecting that the federal budget deficit will increase from 6.2% of GDP in 2025 to 7.3% by 2055. Even more alarming, the debt-to-GDP ratio – currently 124.3% of GDP – could reach 156% by 2055 if current trends persist. The second source of uncertainty involves credit default swaps (CDS), which helped fuel the 2007-08 global financial crisis. Since Moody’s downgraded America’s sovereign credit rating from triple-A to Aa1 in May, the cost of insuring against a US default has risen sharply, as markets increasingly treat US government debt as a higher-risk asset. In fact, US CDS spreads now exceed those of countries with a similar credit rating, such as the United Kingdom, and are trading at levels comparable to those of Greece and Italy, both of which are rated BBB. Similarly, insuring US government debt now costs more than insuring Chinese government bonds, despite China’s lower A1 rating. A third issue is the opacity of private credit markets, which represents a long-term structural vulnerability. BlackRock predicts that private credit assets under management will more than double to $4.5 trillion by 2030. As more capital flows into private markets – both equity and debt – pricing becomes less transparent, making it harder for investors to value assets. The continued expansion of opaque private markets also increases the risk of leverage building up unnoticed. Much of this debt lies beyond the reach of regulatory oversight, leaving analysts and policymakers without the data needed to assess or model the true extent of systemic risk. In an environment marked by growing uncertainty, they must be prepared to adjust their portfolios and capital-allocation strategies to account for a wider range of risks and potential outcomes. Unregulated credit markets may be especially vulnerable to cascading failures, while persistently elevated interest rates heighten the risk of default. If left unaddressed, these vulnerabilities could result in widespread financial distress and job losses, ultimately triggering an economic downturn. Fourth, the relationship between the US dollar and interest rates appears to be changing. Historically, rising bond yields have supported a stronger dollar, while falling yields tended to weaken it. Since late March, however, bond yields have climbed even as the dollar has declined by 6% against the euro. This divergence suggests that global markets are repricing the premium on holding dollars and are now demanding higher returns. US stocks have also been volatile, suggesting that the repricing of risk premiums on dollar-denominated assets extends to equity markets. Rising yields reduce the value of existing bonds, signaling that Treasuries are no longer viewed as a reliable hedge against stock-market turbulence. Lastly, many Americans remain heavily exposed to equities. According to one estimate, stocks account for more than 70% of US households’ financial assets. This makes the recent surge in bond yields and the rise in economic uncertainty particularly concerning, as both developments point to fundamental shifts in market dynamics. The business leaders and investors most likely to succeed in this rapidly shifting landscape will be those who grasp the far-reaching implications of economic and geopolitical trends. In an environment marked by growing uncertainty, they must be prepared to adjust their portfolios and capital-allocation strategies to account for a wider range of risks and potential outcomes.

Title: Between the sheets glamour: Helen McAlinden on how to make your bed summer ready

Belfast native Helen McAlinden is a fan of natural fabrics, particularly in the bedroom. As a designer of the home range for Irish heritage brand Foxford for almost 20 years, she uses its new linen bedding in her own home, a sea-facing terrace in Blackrock. It comes in three stonewashed colours: a soft sunrise pink; an aqua green that is the colour of the Irish Sea; and a gentle glare-free white. It gives a look of casual ease, she says. “It’s not trying too hard but yet it looks really sophisticated. It’s light to sleep under, cool in summer and warm in winter, and you don’t need to iron it. I don’t want to iron or pay someone to iron for me.” It uses Irish flax that is woven in Guimarães, northeast of Porto in Portugal – a region known for its weaving – and dries faster than cotton. Its long fibres make it smooth to the touch and give it tensile strength, she says. “It’s also low maintenance. You just wash it and hang it out on the line.” Now you can see and touch this bedding range in the new Foxford shop in Dundrum Town Centre, as well as other outlets such as Arnotts, where Mags Fitzgibbon is the brand manager. “One thing Foxford has always had is distribution in the tourist industry, but it is more than that, it is a lifestyle brand,” says McAlinden. Indeed, its throws drape beds in ultra-luxe hotels such as Ballynahinch Castle and Ashford Castle and have found their way on to overseas hotel beds, including the Cornwall-based Hotel Tresanton, part of the Polizzi Collection. In addition to bed linen and throws, Foxford can supply almost all bedding needs, except the mattress, she says. For that she opts for a King Koil design, made in Ireland. She then layers her bed, starting with a mattress cover, made in Co Mayo for Foxford. A fitted bottom sheet is her foundation garment. Foxford’s new linen range has a generous depth of 40cm so it will fit any mattress height and stops you having to wrestle with the base to try to get the bedding over the mattress corners. She also insists on luxuriating under a top sheet, a touch that works in summer, on hot nights. Then it’s a featherlight duvet. Her main bedroom is bedecked in the aqua colourway, for it works with the warm grey of the walls, painted in Athena 858 by Benjamin Moore, and the seascapes of Dublin Bay that she can see from her home in Blackrock. The colours work with the animated greys and greens of the water breaking below. Her down duvet is Danish band Danica. “I spent €300 on it when I didn’t have €300, bought it in Copenhagen airport and carried it home as hand luggage. It’s the only thing I can sleep under.” On the nights when there’s a chill in the air, she adds a honeycomb waffle 100 per cent cotton throw, €139, also Foxford. The feather and down pillows are part of Foxford’s bedding range, made in Mayo. She opts for the empire-size, two of which will fit across her super-king bed. “It is an Irish-designed bed.” The new collection, launching in the autumn, will feature additional colours, including a denim blue, a deep inky green, a mauve and nacre, a pearlescent colour. There will also be stripes, fresh takes on toile de jouy, and contemporary checks for the Christmas market. The brand also offers a 400-thread count boxed cotton bedding set that can be customised with monogrammed embroidery or another such message, a great wedding gift to give. Easy ways to ensure your bed is well dressed, according to Mags Fitzgibbon, brand manager for Foxford at Arnotts Pillows should fit the width of the bed. If you sleep on a king-size bed buy king size pillows, which measure 50cm by 90cm instead of the standard 50cm by 75cm. This will fill in the gap in the centre of the bed. Continental pillows, 65cm squares, can be used to dress the bed. They also prop you up if you like to read or watch TV in bed. Mattress depths vary. There are about 10 different depths available. Before buying new fitted sheets, measure the depth of your mattress, to include any other layers; toppers, covers or electric blankets that will add to its height. Sales staff can then direct you to the brands that do those sizes. A flat sheet or top sheet has two purposes. It cuts down on how often you have to launder your duvet cover, and it adds a layer that feels silky to sleep under. When choosing a duvet, pick a size up from the size of the bed it will cover. Lay a king-size duvet on a double bed, for example, and so on. It gives a better look to the bed and hides part or all of the divan sides. It also gives enough cover to accommodate two people. The standard pillowcase with an inside flap, also known as the housewife, is so-called as it was developed in the 1880s by the Housewives Co-operative in Bolton to keep the pillowcase in place. Before that pillowcases were simple sleeves. Oxford pillowcases have the same internal dimensions as the housewife, but have an external edging. The pocket-springs in the Vesteroy mattress have been designed to respond independently to each other, meaning you can have a great night’s sleep regardless of whether your partner tosses and turns. The springs also allow air to circulate whilst you sleep. From €318 at ikea.ie. Rimel is a lacquered metal bedside table that comes in two colour options, the teal, pictured and a bone white. It stands 61.5cm high and has a circumference of 48cm, with a rattan top covered with tempered glass and a secret storage. €234.99 from laredoute.com. Joules Thornton king-size bedframe, €1,625, exclusive to DFS, comes in a blue stripe, floral or pink, to order. dfs.ie This velvet feather filled cushion, Fia, 40cm by 60cm, €58, also comes in 58cm squares, €75.

TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN paid to a 15-year-old boy from Dundalk who died by drowning after getting into difficulty in the river Nanny in Laytown, Co Meath. The boy has been named locally as Kofi Owusu, from the Blackrock area of Dundalk, Co Louth. It’s understood that he had jumped into the river with a number of other children from the footbridge in Laytown when he got into difficulty in the river. The principal of Coláiste Chú Chulainn in Dundalk, Thomas Sharkey, said that the school is heartbroken over the loss of Kofi. He told RTÉ News Kofi was a “fine young man, very kind, a very caring and a very diligent student.” Sharkey added that supports will be put in place for students and staff within the school community at this difficult time. The school posted a statement to social media which said that Kofi was a “very caring young man with a wide circle of friends” and an “accomplished sportsman”. Kofi had recently played in an All-Ireland basketball final and in a Leinster soccer final in his age group of under-16. He had finished his Junior Cert exams just ten days ago. Advertisement Junior Minister Thomas Byrne has said he was devastated to hear of Kofi’s death. “My heart goes out to his family, friends, all those who were around Laytown tonight, and all who are grieving. “A summer moment has turned into an incalculable loss. “Thank you to the Coast Guard teams, emergency services, and local volunteers who responded. “Please respect the family’s privacy and Gardai have asked to avoid sharing any images or details online,” he said. Local councillor in Laytown Carol Lennon told The Journal that the community is in shock following the tragic incident. “Kids jump off that bridge every year, and I suppose no group thinks the worst is going to happen, and yesterday it did. Someone had actually raised safety concerns about jumping off the bridge during the week in the town, and now this has happened three days later, it is just awful. “Everyone is thinking about the boy’s friends and family at this terrible time. “We need more affordable access to swimming lessons, and better water safety education through schools so children know what to do when it comes to public waterways, and also what the best thing to do is if someone you are with gets into difficulty, or if you yourself get into difficulty. There is basic knowledge there that we need to share, because it saves lives. “Unfortunately in this case it’s too late. This was a tragic, awful accident and support will be needed for the other boys who were there and witnessed this, who have lost their friend and been through something traumatic,” she said.

Tributes have been paid to a teenage boy who died while swimming near a Co Meath beach yesterday afternoon. The teen has been named locally as Kofi Owusu (15) from Blackrock, outside Dundalk in Co Louth. The teenager tragically died after he got into difficulty swimming in the water under the footbridge in the River Nanny near Laytown beach. It is understood that Kofi, who was with a group of friends at the time of the incident, was visiting Laytown on Friday for a day out at the beach. His body was recovered from the water by the coastguard and his remains were taken to Our Lady's Hospital in Navan where a post mortem will take place. He was a student of Coláiste Chú Chulainn and a talented soccer player, he played for Redeemer Celtic FC in Dundalk. Gardaí say they are aware of videos of this incident that are currently in circulation and are requesting footage and imagery not to be shared. In a tribute, the school said: “This is a terrible tragedy for Kofi’s family and friends, the Coláiste Chú Chulainn community and the local community of Dundalk and the surrounding areas, who are deeply saddened by this event. “Kofi Owusu completed his Junior Certificate in Coláiste Chú Chulainn in June 2025. “Kofi was a very caring young man with a wide circle of friends. He was a diligent student and a regular awardee for excellent attendance. Kofi was also an accomplished sportsman. He was a member of the school’s under 15 soccer team and represented the school in the recent Leinster Shield final on the 19th May 2025. "Kofi was also a member of the school’s under 16 basketball team and represented the school in the All Ireland final on the 23rd January 2025. "Our sympathy and thoughts are with Kofi’s family and friends at this time.” The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of the Department of Education and Youth have been in contact with the school and will be supporting and advising staff iin their efforts to assist our students. Redeemer Celtic shared a touching tribute to Kofi on social media, showing two of his number 6 jerseys laid down on a soccer pitch alongside a bouquet of flowers, with the caption: “We are heartbroken. Closed until further notice.” An outpouring of tributes from members of the Dundalk community was shared underneath the post. As a mark of respect, local soccer club Laytown United FC announced it had postponed a planned end of season presentation day scheduled for Saturday. “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this heartbreaking incident,” the club said in a statement on Facebook. “We appreciate your understanding. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.” Meanwhile, this is the second teenager that has been confirmed dead in two separate swimming tragedies as temperatures remain high across the country. Peter Byrne (17) tragically died after getting into difficulty while swimming in the River Barrow in Co Carlow on Tuesday. The late Peter Byrne. Photo: RIP.ie Separately in Co Dublin, four teenagers were injured after getting into difficulty in the water in two separate incidents in Howth. The Irish Coast Guard has issued an advisory reminding the public “to take extra precautions in and around water” over the weekend. Kofi Owusu, aged 15, from Dundalk died after getting into difficulty while swimming at Laytown on Friday evening Today's News in 90 seconds - 21st June 2025 Condolences have been offered to the family of Kofi Owusu for their “devastating loss”, local representatives said. Minister of State and Meath East TD Thomas Byrne said it was “devastating to hear of the tragic death of a teenage boy” in Laytown. “My heart goes out to his family, friends, all those who were around Laytown tonight, and all who are grieving,” he said on X. “A summer moment has turned into an incalculable loss.” Cathaoirleach of Meath County Council Wayne Harding said: "A young boy has lost his life tragically off our coast this weekend. My thoughts are with his devastated family at this time. "I want to thank all those who responded to the tragedy both in a professional and voluntary capacity. I ask that we be extremely vigilant to the dangers all our water courses pose during these good weather spells." Local East Meath Cllr Carol Lennon said: "The loss of life in tragic circumstances is devastating and we, as a community want to offer our sincere condolences to the families of the boys involved in the tragedy that occurred in the River Nanny on Friday night. “What started as a great summer's day ended with the loss of a young life, a teen, enjoying the first tasters of Summer of 2025. "I would personally like to thank the emergency services who attended so fast and showed great compassion to the friends and families at the scene”. Councillor Sharon Tolan said “a dark cloud” was hanging over the community on Friday night. “My thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the tragic accident in Laytown,” she said on Facebook. “Please think long and hard before posting any commentary on any social media pages.” Irish Coast Guard has issued an advisory reminding the public “to take extra precautions in and around water” over the weekend. In a statement shared on social media, the Coast Guard urged the public to take precautions and said rip currents “are the leading surf hazard for all beachgoers". Rips are described as strong currents “that start near the shore and rush out seaward, quickly taking you out of your comfort zone, from the shallows to deeper water.” If caught in a rip current, the advice from the Coast Guard is to remain calm and swim out of the current in a direction following the shoreline. According to the Coast Guard, rip currents “typically form at low sports or breaks in sandbars, and also near structures such as groynes, jetties and piers.” Meanwhile, the funeral of teenager Peter Byrne (17) who died swimming in Milford, Co Carlow will take place on Monday. Mr Byrne was swimming with two of his friends when he got into difficulty. The young man's body was recovered at 11.30pm Tuesday night by divers from the Garda Water Unit within a 10 metre radius of where he was last seen. "It is with a very heavy and broken heart that we share the devastating news of the passing of our much beloved youths player Peter Byrne who tragically passed away this week,” read a statement from New Oak F.C. "Peter was a pocket rocket in the team over the last number of years. Small in stature but big in personality. He was a huge character with a touch of Roy Keane about him, not afraid of anything or anyone. "Peter was the life and soul of the dressing room and training and will be sadly missed by his coaches Ernie, Danny and all his teammates who have not only lost a fellow player but a friend. "On behalf of everyone at New Oak F.C we would like to offer our deepest condolences to Peter’s family and friends. Our thoughts and prayers are with all who loved him. May Peter’s gentle soul rest in peace.” In Dublin, the Howth RNLI volunteer crew were involved in a multi-agency response to two cliff rescues off the coast of Howth, North Co Dublin, on Thursday afternoon. They received reports of three children cut off by the tide near Lion's Head, which is a popular swimming spot on the south side of the Howth peninsula, close to the Bailey Lighthouse. The injured teenager is winched to safety by Rescue Helicopter 116. Photo: Howth RNLI Shortly before 4.30pm, the inshore lifeboat was launched by the RNLI, with three crew on board, assisted by the Howth Coast Guard Unit and Coast Guard helicopter Rescue 116, who quickly made their way to the scene amid moderate sea conditions. Two teenagers, who were stranded on the cliff, were located by the Howth Coast Guard cliff team. As the team tried to recover one of the injured teenagers, the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Dublin, which coordinated the rescue, asked the lifeboat crew to remain on standby. While on scene, the lifeboat was diverted to a separate emergency nearby where a teenager had fallen from cliffs at White Water Brook, a remote beach below cliffs on the eastern side of the peninsula. Howth RNLI crew member climbs onto rocks at the base of cliffs in Howth. Photo: Howth RNLI The lifeboat crew were directed by beachgoers to a teenager, who had fallen approximately six metres onto rocks at the water’s edge, sustaining multiple lacerations and suspected fractures. A second teenager had swum to assist him and was holding him steady on a rock when the lifeboat arrived at the scene. The lifeboat crew made their way across rocks to assess the injured teen, assisted by the Howth Coast Guard and Howth All-Weather lifeboat. However, due to the swiftly rising tide, the injured teen needed to be immediately evacuated by a helicopter. The Rescue 116 deployed its winchman, who assessed the teen’s injuries and secured him in a rescue harness, winching them both to safety. The second teenager was showing the signs of hypothermia and was assisted across the rocks and brought aboard the inshore life boat. He was later transferred to the lifeboat and taken to Howth Lifeboat Station, where he was handed into the care of an ambulance crew and transported to the hospital. Helm of the inshore lifeboat, Killian O’Reilly, said: “This was a challenging afternoon with two serious incidents in quick succession, both in difficult, rocky locations.” "On a sunny summer’s day, it’s easy to underestimate the risks around the coastline – but the sea and cliffs can be unforgiving. "The teamwork shown between the RNLI, Coast Guard units, and Rescue 116 was exceptional and ensured the best possible outcome in tough circumstances,” he added. He urged the public to be aware of the dangers and know what to do where they might find themselves in difficulty in the water, especially during this spell of hot weather. “Air temperatures may feel warm, but water temperatures are cold enough year-round to trigger cold-water shock. If you get into difficulty, remember float to live: tilt your head back, with your ears submerged. Relax and try to breathe normally. "Move your hands and legs to help you stay afloat. Once you've regained control of your breathing, you can call for help or swim to safety,” he added. The members of the public are advised to call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coast Guard if they or someone else gets into difficulty near the coast.

What caught my eye this week. With AI chatbots and search overviews now vigorously putting the boot into an online media that was already on its knees, quality independent websites covering investing and money are shrinking faster than violets at an OnlyFans convention. Good news then that the curation site Snippet Finance has started maintaining a content hub for investors, with links to all kinds of resources. You’ll find a few Weekend Reading favourites in its listings. But there’s plenty of other lesser-seen websites, tools, and other useful stuff to explore, especially if you’re a professional or dedicated amateur finance nerd. Be sure to check out Snippet Finance itself. Creator Yuri is the Hemmingway of investment editorial. This introduction is twice as long as a typical Snippet post. Incidentally, I just dived into the Monevator vaults to find a similar listing I ran early in the life of this website. Of the blogs I tracked, only us, Mr Money Mustache, Financial Samurai, and Simple Living in Somerset (renamed) are still standing. Talking of the bonfire of the blogosphere, any investing maniac starting today who wants to talk about their favourite subject online – doubtless having been banned from doing so by exhausted family and friends – would probably have to gurn into an iPhone to create videos for YouTube or TikTok. Maybe that’s you – but then again maybe you’re more a great one for a witty adverb, rather than the next Mr Beast? If so then Monevator would benefit from a new and brilliant regular writer. We’ve had several over the years, but somehow they never last. Often they discover they haven’t got as much to say about FIRE, personal finance, or index funds as they thought they did after the third article. Most just can’t write the Monevator way. (It’s not so hard. Take the day off and yet still be at it at midnight. Never use two words when three will do. Add some obscure references to 1980s music and 1990s video games and you’re all set!) Honestly it probably won’t work out with you either. But I’d still love to hear from you if you’ve got a lot to share. Ideally you’ll be more towards the start of your journey than we are. Not phobic about smartphones and investing apps. Maybe you even bought an NFT of a cartoon gorilla during the 2021 crypto mania before repenting your foolish ways. But mainly you’ll be on-message with sensible investing. A bit of personal finance hackery – stoozing, credit card rewards, current account bonus chasing – wouldn’t hurt either. (It all adds up in your 20s.) We’d want a bit of personality in the mix. Judicious. Tasteful. Nothing too influencer-y. Can you point me to a bit of writing you did earlier? Brilliant. Get in touch via the Contact form if you’re the person all your friends go to about investing. Just so long as you write better than ChatGPT, and without it too.

Mashing up Gibson’s Necromancer (introducing Chatsubo’s bartender), in a world of affordable manufactured niche fintwit and financial micro franchises on X, Reddit and Substack, there’s something almost heraldic about sticking your neck out (and opening your wallet) to run a defiantly indie full service Website (remember those 😉 ) covering the gambit of UK related PF, FIRE and investing. Very 1990s/Gen X 🙂 Luv it. Long may you continue. Good luck finding a new contributing author. The root problem surely remains that FIRE, or pursuit of FI, for the vast majority of people boils down to earning more, spending less and stashing (MMM influence?) the surplus. How to string that out week after week is a challenge. As you wrote yourself we can all manage an article or three, probably based on our own habits, but to have the curiosity to keep seeking new opportunities is rare. I am always in awe of how people like Ermine find the inspiration to both keep going and maintain the quality. In my office I am the boring bloke that people approach every September when asked to submit their choices for the flexible part of our total compensation for the year ahead. That might make an interesting paragraph or three for those at my firm, but after that the well dries up. Hell, articles on cycling to work and packed lunches have been both done to death and made redundant by WFH. On a minor point, and I’m not grouching about compounding – > It all adds up in your 20s [stoozing et al. Is that really still a thing?] What really adds up in your 20s IMO is the muppetry you don’t do that your peers do. Primum non nocere. And this Good luck with the search! Hi I’ve been receiving your newsletter for many years, always looking forward to the interesting content and links. But since you’ve tried to monetise the site, the free content has become very week. Probably best to scrap it and concentrate on subscription. Interesting pieces by Swedroe/Alpha Architect and AQR. Problem is neither of AA nor AQR actually offer up any ISA/SIPP friendly, non-exorbitatant products to tap their research. Loved these from Snippet Finance “1984.. energy..made up 27% of S&P 500 earnings, today…1%”, cost of urban 1km tunnel in NY $4 bn, Paris $230 mn, and S. Korea $100 mn. Perhaps these explain why energy/commodities so underowned as a diversifier (despite mean reversion potential of being the worst performing asset class from 2011) and why UK/US infra ITs’/CEFs’ woes seem worse than you’d expect even given high rates. Nice set of links – thanks. Blanchett paper chimes with observations I have made @M (& elsewhere) over the last year or so. Interesting! I think it’s hard to get a younger contributor with the confidence to blog to an audience such as Monevator. There are lots of commenters who are deep into technicalities, strategies and picking of individual funds etc which can be somewhat intimidating, nevermind the suspicion that people are playing with a lot more capital than most 20-30 somethings will have amassed (notwithstanding City bonuses and tech stock options). Plus I suspect the audience may have a certain scepticism around those who have never been burnt by their own past poor decisions or inertia/inaction. However the FIREside chat format works well so having more volunteers in that space would be more than possible.

The combination of established finance and blockchain technology opens up different opportunities for asset ownership, liquidity and worldwide access. The economic environment is experiencing a paradigm shift as the migration of RWAs (real-world assets) onto blockchain networks is exemplified by creating digital representations of real, tangible value, including the ability to be traded, fractioned and accessed worldwide. This transition is not a mere case of technological innovation. Still, it can be considered a recasting of our worldview of ownership, liquidity and financial inclusion in this digital era. The tokenization revolution gains momentum Real estate asset tokenization has progressed from a speculative idea to a multi-billion-dollar global capability. Among the over $250 billion of tokenized assets, Ethereum holds about 55% of the market share and settles itself as the leading infrastructural platform of this digital transformation. That will include US Treasuries, real estate, commodities and intellectual property. The gains in this movement are charging at a fast pace. Assets such as real estate, treasuries and others are now being converted to liquid on the blockchain, which has over 18 billion in market value, and the prospects of it growing huge in the future. In the industry, it is anticipated that even greater growth will be evident in the future, considering that the market of tokenized assets, such as stablecoins, is currently forecasted to increase to 18.9 trillion in the year 2033, as suggested by a study by Ripple and BCG. Busting the conventional boundaries The idea of tokenizing assets is so popular because it helps to address the essential inefficiencies of conventional financial markets. Traditional asset ownership usually involves large down payment requirements, complicated intermediaries and statement periods. Tokenization resolves these concerns since this technology generates digital tokens reflecting fractional ownership of physical, real-world assets. Think of real estate – one of the most illiquid asset classes. With tokenization, commercial real estate valued in millions of dollars may be separated into thousands of digital tokens, each reflecting a minute share of ownership. Shareholders can buy these tokens at a much smaller financial outlay, sell them off on the secondary market, earn an equivalent fractional rent of the underlying property and have exposure to genuine property appreciation. This partial ownership is in no way limited to real estate. Art collections, vintage wines, precious metals (such as gold) and even income streams around intellectual property can be tokenized, enabling access to these investments to a broader pool than ever before. Thus, the investment process previously open only to institutional investors and the super-rich can be democratized. The technology foundation Asset tokenization is based on smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts whose terms are encoded directly into code. Such digital contracts automate several processes that have been handled by intermediaries up until now, such as the distribution of dividends or compliance checks. Embedding coded rules in digital tokens and the ability to observe and be linked to RWAs may result in financial tools enabling automatic compliance, capital calls and distributions, making more efficient end-to-end fund products. The blockchain platform on which such tokens run offers several essential benefits. Growth is institutionally adopted The tokenization sector gained considerable credibility with the arrival of large financial companies. BlackRock announced its tokenized fund in March 2024, and asset giants like Franklin Templeton have launched their tokenization plans. This institutional legitimization has fueled the adoption and made the space legitimate in the eyes of traditional investors. The use of tokenization in financial assets should continue expanding in 2025 as a concept and an implementation, as adoption among large banks and asset managers is already bearing fruit. These institutions’ participation contributes capital, regulatory know-how and operational infrastructure that needs to be adopted to get mainstream. The development of regulation and local dominance The global regulatory environment regarding tokenized assets is changing quickly, and various jurisdictions are approaching oversight and compliance differently. Increased regulatory sandboxes and similar programs will enable the permissible growth of tokenization use cases among financial institutions, with more nations in APAC remaining at the forefront. These sandbox regulatory places offer a controlled platform for financial companies to experiment with tokenization solutions. They closely collaborate with regulators to establish documented frameworks. This joint plan aids in balancing innovativeness, investor protection and financial stability. Nevertheless, there are still issues like regulation. The regulation of asset tokenization involves a serious debate between the necessity of data privacy and the transparency of blockchain technology. Moreover, in most jurisdictions, the legal maturity of smart contracts is unassured, putting tokenization ventures into question. Conquering challenges of implementation Although asset tokenization has excellent potential, it also has various practical challenges that should be overcome to be readily adopted. Success stories and acquisitions Asset tokenization is gaining ground in various sectors in the following areas. The way to the future In 2025, tokenized assets will coexist with traditional instruments, and combining innovations with tradition will generate specific hybrid models to ensure that the world of financial markets is faster, more transparent and accessible to more people. This hybrid scheme can be gradually adopted with enough consideration for traditional investors and regulators. Coupling the sale of tokenized assets with existing financial infrastructure opens up a massive opportunity for market players. Banks can implement new products and services, asset managers reach a wider audience of investors and portfolio diversification becomes feasible using access to new assets previously unattainable to an individual investor. Yet, it will be successful, provided it can overcome some of the present issues regarding the integration of technologies, clarity of regulations and market development. Companies that can afford to implement adequate infrastructure, maintain a proper compliance framework, and concentrate on the user experience will be in the best place to utilize the transformation. Conclusion RWA tokenization is a monumental change in conceptualizing ownership and value transfer in the digital economy. This innovation uses blockchain technology to provide digital versions of physical and financial assets, enabling the democratization of investment opportunities, increased market efficiency and new opportunities for institutional and retail investors. Although there are still hurdles regarding regulation, technology and market maturation, the trend is unmistakable because the industry is becoming increasingly institutional and the regulation less experimental. The companies that learn and respond to this change will be in a good position to take advantage of the future of the tokenization of assets market, which will be worth 18.9 trillion in the next decade. Not all aspects of the digital asset revolution involve technology. They include redefining the very structures of finance to be inclusive, efficient and accessible worldwide. In the future, we expect that the seamless connection of RWAs into blockchain networks will require constant interaction between technologists, regulators and financial institutions to create a more interconnected and globalized financial process.

Solana, XRP, and Litecoin spot ETFs are near-locks at 95% odds of approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of 2025, the analysts, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart of Bloomberg, wrote Friday. Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera, and Avalanche spot ETF applications are also sitting quite pretty, according to the analysts, with 90% chance of approval by year end. If the above altcoin ETF applications receive an SEC green light in the coming months, then the development would mark a substantial milestone in the history of Wall Street. Thus far, the agency has approved only two categories of crypto spot ETFs: Bitcoin and Ethereum. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 The success of those funds has spurred additional demand for crypto-focused ETFs and other related investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now manage well over $100 billion in assets, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) reaching $70 billion in AUM faster than any fund in history, based on company data. Crypto’s two top tokens have long been considered to belong to a league of their own in terms of legitimacy, stability, and staying power, and even their approval for mainstream trading was no easy feat. Among the current batch of contenders for spot ETF trading are tokens that have significantly smaller market values and less established reputations than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Dogecoin, for instance, is the world’s first meme coin; Avalanche is the native token of a network that boasts less than 2% of the total value locked on Ethereum. DOT, the native token of the Polkadot blockchain, boasts a market capitalization of just $5.2 billion, compared to $293 billion for ETH and $2.06 trillion for BTC, according to data provider CoinGecko. Should spot ETFs of such altcoins begin trading on Wall Street, that would mean that traditional financial institutions and retail investors would be able to gain direct exposure to the tokens, which have historically been volatile. Issuers of spot ETFs actually buy and store the cryptocurrencies represented by the financial products on behalf of clients. Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told Decrypt it was a foregone conclusion that crypto ETFs would explode as soon as President Donald Trump, who campaigned avidly as a pro-crypto candidate, was reelected last fall. “It is regarded as inevitable that we’ll see many other single-asset and multi-asset ETFs of digital coins and tokens,” Edelman said. “The Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs will prove to have been merely the first." “And all that’s just the start,” he continued. “Tokenization is underway and once all assets are tokenized, there will be thousands of ETFs, or their tokenized equivalents, launched. It’ll be the biggest explosion of investment opportunities ever." The Bloomberg analysts’ confidence that the SEC may soon approve so many crypto ETFs beyond BTC and ETH stems in part from the agency’s openness to engage with requests to list them in recent months—requesting updated details and public comments on numerous applications. The applications have been filed by several Wall Street firms, ranging from crypto-centric investment managers like Grayscale to TradFi stalwarts including Fidelity and Franklin Templeton. “Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion,” Bloomberg’s Seyffart said. Another factor that has likely increased the odds of imminent spot ETF approvals for the altcoins in question is the fact that, in recent months, the CFTC has approved futures markets for all of them. Futures ETFs track the prices of derivatives contracts for assets, but do not involve the actual buying or selling of the underlying asset. While the Bloomberg analysts are confident that altcoin spot ETFs will garner approvals before the end of the year, the exact timing remains uncertain. Seyffart said they could come in the next month, or perhaps not until the late fall—but that at this point, the question is a “matter of when not if.” Brian Rudick, chief strategy office at Upexi, a publicly traded Solana-focused treasury company, told Decrypt that while ETF approvals for certain altcoins with lower trading volume may not necessarily result in immediately higher demand for those tokens, Wall Street debuts could have a dramatic price impact on more popular tokens like Solana. “While demand for ETFs on long-tail alts may not materialize, ETFs based on top assets like Solana will likely see strong inflows and may act as a large positive catalyst for the price of the underlying token,” Rudick said. “Indeed, the spot ETFs were the main reason the price of Bitcoin more than doubled from when BlackRock applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF in mid-2023 through the exceptional inflows over the first six months after launch.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: All the reasons why Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in Q3!

A $750 million bet, whale surge, and momentum – ETH vs BTC heats up! Q2 is nearly on the books, and Ethereum [ETH] has delivered a comeback quarter in every sense. With nearly 40% quarterly gains so far, ETH has outpaced Bitcoin’s [BTC] 28.81% ROI, marking a sharp reversal from its bruising Q1. At the time, ETH bled nearly 50% from its $3,334 opening. That drawdown left a big chunk of holders underwater. And, despite Q2’s rally, many still haven’t fully resurfaced. Could Q3 be the inflection point where Ethereum finally delivers for the holders who sat through the pain? Q1 pushed Ethereum to the edge, and early Q2 didn’t offer much relief. Structurally though, the tide began to shift. ETH has steadily reclaimed market dominance, climbing back towards its 10% share – A sharp reversal from the record low of 6.95% on 22 April. At the same time, the ETH/BTC ratio hit a five-year low, lining up with ETH’s own multi-year bottom at $1,441 in mid-April. That moment felt like rock bottom. However, it also set the stage for a serious bounce. By early May, the ratio had ripped over 25% off the lows, right as ETH smashed through the $2k resistance and sprinted to a quarterly high of $2,878 on 11 June. And yet, the move doesn’t feel like it’s run its course just yet. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) Since mid-May, the ratio has moved sideways. However, it’s been printing higher lows with every dip – A classic sign of accumulation. Buyers are stepping in faster, the pullbacks are shallower, and rotational flows into ETH remain steady. If this pattern resolves higher, ETH could carry its Q2 breakout into Q3 with serious follow-through. This could set the stage for a potential trend reversal in the ETH/BTC macro structure. Smart money isn’t backing off Ethereum. In fact, BlackRock has deployed $750 million into ETH in June so far, and hasn’t sold a single coin. That kind of conviction doesn’t show up unless the upside looks meaningful. According to AMBCrypto, with a 40% quarterly rally already in the books, Ethereum has been drawing in serious capital chasing asymmetric returns. Case in point – Lookonchain flagged a sharp move where a whale borrowed 10 million USDT to buy 3,983 ETH at $2,510.64. Clearly, it’s not just institutional flows doing the heavy lifting. The whale address count (1k–10k ETH) surged to a two-year high of 4,970 too, signaling that deep-pocketed players may be stepping back in with size. Source: Glassnode And when that kind of capital rotates in, it’s usually not by accident. Given Ethereum’s clear technical and statistical edge over Bitcoin throughout Q2, this shift feels more like a calculated reallocation than a short-term trade. Zooming out, the signals might be aligning too. With rising whale activity, institutional flows, and a strong ETH/BTC base, ETH could be set to carry its Q2 dominance into Q3, finally giving LTHs the upside they’ve been waiting on.

The past seven days in Waymo’s world illustrates just how dynamic the burgeoning robotaxi business can be. The company limited service nationwide on June 13 ahead of scheduled “No Kings” protests against President Donald Trump and his policies. Days later, Waymo announced it was expanding its robotaxi service area by another 80 square miles in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Silicon Valley. And now Waymo is eyeing the biggest city in the United States: New York City. One note on NYC: This will be a marathon for Waymo. The company is applying for a permit to test its autonomous vehicles in the city, but even if it gets approved, it won’t mean driverless testing. A truly driverless (no human behind the wheel) vehicle will require a change in state law. Expect lobbying activity to ramp up in the state. Let’s get into the rest of the news. Got a tip for us?

Applied Intuition keeps attracting investors, and it has an eye-popping valuation to show for it. The buzzy startup, which makes software that helps companies and government agencies develop autonomous vehicle solutions such as simulation software and managing data, closed a $600 million Series F and tender offer. That round, which was co-led by BlackRock-managed funds and Kleiner Perkins, pushed its valuation up to $15 billion. Yes, $15 billion.Other investors included Qatar Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Greycroft, and more. Existing investors General Catalyst, Lux, Elad Gil, and Mary Meeker’s growth fund Bond also participated. Reminder: The round comes just one year after it completed a $250 million Series E, which put the company at a $6 billion valuation. Archer Aviation raised an additional $850 million through a registered direct offering of 85 million shares at $10 per share. The company noted in its announcement that this followed President Trump’s executive order to implement an eVTOL Integration Pilot Program in the United States. Senra Systems, a Southern California-based startup developing wire harnesses for aerospace, raised $25 million in a round co-led by Dylan Field, the co-founder and CEO of design software company Figma; VC firm CIV; General Catalyst; Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund; Sequoia Capital; Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC; and Andreessen Horowitz. This newsletter used to have a dedicated section for micromobility, a reflection of its popularity at the time. Micromobility went through a period of consolidation and tightening capital, which forced the industry to grow up. But it hasn’t disappeared, and that’s why I’m bringing it back this week (and occasionally in the future).Reporter Rebecca Bellan hosted a roundtable with Voi CEO Fredrik Hjelm, Bird co-CEO Michael Washinushi, and Dott/Tier CEO Henri Moissinac at the Micromobility Europe event in Brussels. Here are some of her insights from the panel and from the broader event: Honda launched an all-electric last-mile delivery vehicle called the Fastport eQuad. The eQuad comes in two sizes built on the same basic platform, small and large. Both are smaller than the smallest Mini Cooper but can carry between 320 and 650 pounds. They have pedals, and their top speed is limited to 12 mph (20 kph), both requirements to keep them bike-lane legal. VanMoof is back and has launched its first e-bike since bankruptcy. Reporter Rebecca Bellan digs into what is the same and what has changed at VanMoof. Bellan also provided a list of startups rolling out of Europe’s early-stage micromobility scene. Zoox has opened its first full-fledged production facility, where it expects to one day build 10,000 robotaxis per year. Tesla has partnered with Electrify Expo to launch full-weekend EV test drives. This is an interesting move by Tesla, which has historically used other methods besides third-party events like auto shows or expos to attract new customers. It also could make Electrify Expo a target of protestors who are behind the Tesla Takedown movement. Zoomcar, the Indian car-sharing marketplace, said a hacker accessed the personal data of at least 8.4 million customers, including their names, phone numbers, and car registration numbers. The company became aware of the incident after some of its employees received external communications from a threat actor who claimed to have gained access to the company’s data. The Paris Air Show included lots of news under the ever-evolving category I call “Future of flight.” Too much to cover everything here, but there were a few highlights: an announcement from U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy that the Federal Aviation Administration and four other regulators will collaborate on an advanced air mobility (AAM) roadmap; Archer Aviation showcased its Midnight aircraft and hosted delegations from more than 20 countries; and Beta Technologies’ Alia became the first electric aircraft to fly at the show.

Title: Why your business should start accepting Bitcoin today
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/accepting-bitcoin-payments-business/
Time Published: 2025-06-20T19:36:01Z

Share this article Just a few years ago, the idea of using digital currency to book a flight or pay for a service seemed unreal. Today, it happens in real time, and businesses of every size now accept Bitcoin. As of 2024, Crypto.com estimates that more than 650 million people worldwide now hold some form of crypto. Major financial institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, and PayPal have incorporated crypto into their offerings, which signals widespread crypto adoption. Consumers, especially Millennials and Gen Z, invest in crypto and actively look for ways to spend it. In this regard, businesses that adapt to these changing payment behaviors can gain a meaningful competitive edge. Let’s talk about practical benefits. When businesses accept Bitcoin payments, they often pay lower transaction fees. With Bitcoin, fees are often about $1-2, especially when using crypto payment gateways. Another key benefit? No chargebacks. Unlike credit card payments, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. It means fewer fraud claims and less back-office overhead dealing with disputes. Also, cross-border payments have become much easier. If your business serves international customers, Bitcoin can eliminate the headaches of currency exchange and high wire transfer fees. All this adds up to smoother, faster, and often cheaper transactions. Businesses of all sizes already accept Bitcoin. Shopify merchants have access to crypto payment integrations, which allow thousands of e-commerce stores to accept Bitcoin easily. In the restaurant world, spots like The Pink Cow in Tokyo and Crypto Street Restaurant in Florida made headlines for being early adopters. Even big corporations like Microsoft and AT&T have accepted Bitcoin in various forms. But it’s not just the giants benefiting. Independent cafes, freelance creatives, and small retailers report increased visibility and customer loyalty just by offering Bitcoin as a payment option. Consumers aren’t just curious, they’re ready to spend. A 2022 survey by Deloitte and PayPal found that 75% of retailers plan to accept crypto payments within the next two years, and 64% of surveyed consumers said they’d be more likely to shop with a business that accepts cryptocurrency. What’s driving this demand? Control, speed, and a sense of innovation. Consumers like to have choices, and they expect businesses to keep up with digital trends. Ignoring this shift could mean missing out on a fast-growing segment of tech-savvy customers. Let’s be honest, Bitcoin volatility is a valid concern. Prices can swing dramatically in short periods, which makes some business owners hesitate. The good news is that you don’t need to hold onto Bitcoin to accept it. Special platforms serve to convert Bitcoin into local currency instantly, which reduces your exposure to price fluctuations. Security is another common worry, but modern solutions make crypto safer than ever. Using a trusted crypto wallet for business adds a layer of protection, and payment processors handle much of the heavy lifting when it comes to compliance and fraud prevention. Getting started with Bitcoin payments is easier than you might think: Choose a payment processor. These services can integrate with your online store or point-of-sale system. Set up your wallet. Whether you use a custodial service or manage your own, having a secure crypto wallet is important to store your assets securely. Let customers know. Display online badges that show you accept Bitcoin. Promote it in your email campaigns or on social media. No deep technical knowledge is required, and setup costs are often minimal. In fact, many services are free to start with and only charge a small percentage per transaction. Accepting Bitcoin is easier than you might think. You don’t need to change how your business runs. Bitcoin payment just adds more payment flexibility for your customers. It’s affordable to set up, demand is growing, and the tools to start are easy to use. The benefits are big: you can reach new customers, save on transaction fees, speed up payments, and show that your business is forward-thinking. So why wait? The future of payments is here.

Title: Real-World Asset Tokenization Hits $24 Billion As Wall Street Bets Big
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/06/20/real-world-asset-tokenization-hits-24-billion-as-wall-street-bets-big/
Time Published: 2025-06-20T16:04:02Z
Full Content:
ByAnastasia Chernikova ByAnastasia Chernikova, Contributor. Major financial institutions are racing to tokenize everything from U.S. Treasuries to real estate, but how long will it last? The tokenization revolution is accelerating at breakneck speed with the Senate just passing the GENIUS Act, providing the first federal framework for digital assets that Wall Street had been waiting for. Over 185 crypto tokens are classified as Real-World Assets (RWAs) with their market capitalization over $10.62 billion, a 61% increase from the previous month, according to Tangem. On top of that, the total market value of tokenized RWAs on public blockchains had surged to nearly $18 billion by early 2025, up from about $10 billion just a year before. This unprecedented growth has been driven by institutional adoption that's finally materializing. “The adoption curve we’re seeing from major institutions like JPMorgan marks the opening chapter of a multi‑trillion‑dollar transition that will accelerate, not reverse, as infrastructure and regulation mature,” Colin Cunningham, Head of Tokenization at Chainlink Labs, told me in a written response. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund now holds $2.9 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, making it the world’s largest tokenized asset fund. Franklin Templeton’s BENJI follows at $776 million, while VanEck launched its tokenized RWA fund called VBILL, offering exposure to US Treasury bills across multiple blockchains in partnership with Securitize. “BlackRock tokenized a money market fund on Ethereum. Franklin Templeton is running US government bond funds on public blockchains. JPMorgan just ran a cross chain Delivery versus Payment pilot with Chainlink and Ondo. These are not retail projects. These are the most conservative institutions in finance validating a new model,” Mitchell DiRaimondo, founder at Steelwave Digital, told me in a written response. The current market shows $24 billion in total tokenized assets across 194 issuers, with over 205,000 asset holders, indicating steady growth despite market volatility. Tokenization strips away the friction that has plagued traditional asset management for decades. Settlement times drop from days to minutes, previously illiquid assets like real estate can be traded 24/7, and compliance becomes programmable rather than paper-based. “The biggest risk today is assuming that a legal wrapper and a blockchain alone create value,” Ian Balina, CEO of Token Metrics, told me. "Without real composability, reliable secondary markets, and trusted custody, tokenized assets remain stuck in marketing decks rather than investment portfolios." Ethereum still dominates the tokenized asset landscape, hosting the majority of Real-World Asset value. But emerging Layer 2 solutions are gaining ground as institutions seek faster, cheaper transactions. The infrastructure buildout extends beyond blockchain networks. Zero-knowledge proofs are enabling privacy-preserving compliance, allowing banks to prove asset backing without revealing sensitive financial information. Cross-chain interoperability solutions are connecting fragmented tokenized asset markets. "The introduction of zero-knowledge proofs—which make it possible to securely verify that RWAs are backed by real world assets, without revealing sensitive information—has been a huge catalyst for RWAs," Maxim Legg, CEO of The Pangea Foundation, told me in a written response. "Banks are able to prove that their tokenized funds are backed by real assets, without disclosing sensitive financial information." “It’s a structural evolution in how private credit and fixed income funds operate,” David Robnett, Managing Director of Asset Token Ventures, told me in a written response. “Tokenization solves real-world inefficiencies, such as post-trade friction, tax drag, and illiquidity. That makes growth not just sustainable, but inevitable.” Unlike the speculative crypto cycles of previous years, RWA tokens offer something fundamentally different: real yield backed by real assets. Tokenized Treasury bills currently yield 4-5%, while private credit tokens can offer 8-10% returns—comparable to traditional alternatives but with blockchain’s added benefits. “Unlike the NFT bubble, where speculative JPEGs dominated and predictably lost value, NFT 2.0, AKA Tokenized RWAs, are grounded in utility,” Dan Silverman, CEO at Balcony Technology, told me in an interview. "The RWA is worth what the underlying asset is worth, eliminating the volatility of speculative hype." While stablecoins, tokenized fiat currencies representing over $240 billion of the RWA market, have paved the way, the focus is now shifting to higher-yielding tokenized assets. The GENIUS Act’s framework creates the regulatory foundation for the broader RWA expansion. Here is the sector breakdown: U.S. Treasuries: $6.2 billion (led by BlackRock’s BUIDL at $2.5 billion and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI at $776 million) Private Credit: $12.9 billion (platforms like Centrifuge, Maple, and Apollo's new tokenized fund) Commodities: $1.4 billion (primarily tokenized gold through Tether Gold and Paxos Gold) Real Estate: Growing rapidly, with about $3.8 billion in tokenized properties "Real-World Asset is real and sustainable. It's likely to go in waves," Paul Brody, Global Blockchain Leader at Ernst & Young, told me in an interview. "We are going to move towards a second wave of real-world assets like real estate, physical infrastructure, intellectual property, and more that exist off-chain but could benefit from the automation possible with smart contracts and in the efficiency of on-chain settlement." Regulatory clarity and guidelines for tokenized assets remain critical for their future development. Infrastructure scaling with cross-chain interoperability solutions and institutional-grade custody services are also maturing rapidly. “Interoperability, regulation, and compliance are the biggest gating factors. Assets must move seamlessly across public and private chains, reference tamper‑proof data, and fit within clear legal frameworks,” Colin Cunningham of Chainlink Labs told me. “We’re already seeing some efforts from regulators to clarify the rules for digital assets, and institutions are adopting Chainlink’s cross‑chain messaging to avoid the ‘walled‑garden’ problem. I expect the tokenized market to expand materially over the next twelve months, both in the volume of assets onchain and the breadth of traditional finance players participating.” The RWA market is projected to hit a $50 billion market cap by the end of this year. For investors, this represents both opportunity and risk, but the institutional validation is real—BlackRock doesn't deploy billions into experimental technologies. "The promise of RWAs is to deliver the efficiency and immediacy of crypto markets to a wider investor pool," Stuart Popejoy, CEO of Kadena, wrote to me in a response. "We’re not trying to tear down the financial system. We’re upgrading it." The smart money is actively participating, with careful due diligence and risk management. Whether this marks the dawn of a new financial era will depend on execution.

Title: Banks that fuelled Ireland’s finance rebound face tariff angst
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/2025/06/20/banks-that-fuelled-irelands-finance-rebound-face-tariff-angst/
Time Published: 2025-06-20T15:43:55Z
Full Content:
When the United States launched sweeping tariffs against trade partners in April, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink found himself in Ireland, one of the countries with most to lose if US multinationals were forced to curtail their operations overseas. Fink, whose company was in the running for a big contract with the Irish government at the time, toed a careful line, claiming to “understand the logic” of Donald Trump’s move while not agreeing with it, and insisting there “does not need to be a true trade war”. Almost three months on, the Wall Street giants that created thousands of Dublin jobs since Brexit are in a similarly awkward position. They’re trying to balance the challenges created by their own government with the opportunities in a country that depends on US multinationals for more than 10 per cent of its jobs and a big chunk of tax receipts. For now, the banks are hopeful their multinational clients will adapt to the trade uncertainty. “It’s not obvious to me that that falls off a cliff” under the threat of tariffs, says Marc Hussey, the Irish-born JPMorgan Chase & Co executive who returned home to run the bank’s 1,500-strong Dublin business in 2022. Assuming multinationals will “shrink overnight” would be an “extreme view”, Hussey added, and he is “not sensing that from any of our clients”. He continues to see growth in the range of businesses he oversees including a global funds administration centre, a workplace solutions business that runs employment share programmes across the world and the EMEA hub for Chase payments technology. Ireland remains popular in JPMorgan’s head office too – chief executive Jamie Dimon will travel to Dublin next month to speak at an event, his fourth such trip in six years. Almost a decade on from the Brexit vote that cut off London’s banks from several markets inside the European Union, Ireland has become a big draw for foreign lenders. They now employ close to 15,000 people, according to a report from the Federation of International Banks in Ireland (FIBI) last month, with firms including JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America leading the way to set up big EU businesses in the State. That choice puts them at the eye of the tariffs storm in a market that has long been heavily exposed to US multinationals, prompting recent warnings about the outlook for the economy and the risk to financial stability. As part of the EU, Ireland’s fate is tied to negotiations with Trump in advance of a July 9th deadline, after which nearly all of the bloc’s imports to the US might be hit with a 50 per cent levy. Across the river Liffey from JPMorgan’s offices, Citi’s 2,900 staff are working across an innovation hub, the group’s EU bank headquarters and an international corporate banking businesses. Citi chief executive Jane Fraser was in town a few weeks ago to mark the bank’s 60th anniversary in the State, and hailed Ireland as “a hub for innovation, a magnet for multinationals and a vital part of the world’s economic landscape”. The bank’s new Dublin office, to be opened next year with space for an extra 400 staff, is “a symbol of our long-term investment in Ireland and in Europe”, she added in a LinkedIn post. Hussey is hoping the move increases the chances of a long-promised footbridge that would link JPMorgan on Dublin’s southside to the northside of the Liffey, where Citi’s new office will join the Central Bank’s headquarters. Davinia Conlan, Citi’s Ireland head and chairwoman of FIBI, argues that there is “a lot to be positive about from an Ireland domestic economy perspective” and she is hopeful that Citi will ultimately fill its 3,300 capacity in the new site, though she’s not putting any timeline on that. “We’re still expecting the economy to grow albeit at a slower pace than we would’ve seen previously,” she said. Ireland also offers companies the benefit of “ease of access” to Government, Conlan said. The Department of Finance will soon launch an industry consultation on its next international financial services strategy, a successor to the Ireland for Finance strategy launched in 2020 which covers banks, insurers, funds and other firms that, combined, employ about 60,000. Regulatory simplification will be high on the industry’s wish list, Conlan and her peers say, with firms set to call on Ireland to remove some “gold-plating” of EU rules and to push the bloc to be more competitive around regulation. The international banks’ federation, FIBI, is preparing a proposal on simplification which will offer examples of areas where regulation can be “more efficient”, Conlan said, declining to offer gold-plating examples before that. Investments in infrastructure and housing, including a long-promised airport metro, will also be on the list. Fernando Vicario, who heads Bank of America’s Dublin-based EU head office, is hopeful that imminent reform of the EU’s securitisation market will offer a further boost for his 1,300-strong team, which has been retaining its earnings to support future growth. “Ireland can be a place where these securitisation deals can be packaged out of Ireland into the rest of Europe,” he said, adding that the State already commands a big presence in this market. Vicario does not expect the Irish Government to pivot to protectionist sentiment, which has cropped up in some countries in response to Trump’s trade approach. “I learned in Boston that America is Irish,” says Vicario. “In business, people stick to their positions and do business. And we do business with Irish-headquartered companies and with Irish branches and subsidiaries of US companies, all day long. I have quite frankly no problem whatsoever with our passport referring to our US origin.” Ireland has shown it has no problems with US companies either: following Fink’s careful diplomacy, BlackRock was last month named a preferred bidder to help manage the State’s upcoming multibillion-euro auto-enrolment workplace pension programme. – Bloomberg Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: New York Times and Roger Cohen Promote War Again

The NY Times has been a major promoter of US “regime change” operations for decades. Today, while President Trump considers directly involving a US attack on Iran, the NYT is again performing this role despite many readers being skeptical or opposed. A June 19 NYT news/analysis is titled “An Islamic Republic With Its Back Against the Wall” by Roger Cohen. It seems written to pave the way for yet another US-backed or -directed “regime change”. The first sentence asserts without providing evidence that the Tehran government is “an unpopular and repressive regime”. An “Iran expert” is quoted saying, “The Islamic Republic is a rotten tooth waiting to be plucked, like the Soviet Union in its latter years.” . Screenshot from NYT . When Israel bombed the Iranian TV broadcast station as a female news anchor was reading the news, Cohen writes that “Some Iranians were overjoyed”. Cohen uses Netanyahu’s description that Israel’s attacks on Iran are “pre-emptive” and designed to “stop Iran using its enriched uranium to race for a bomb.” He does not mention that even the US intelligence agencies agree that Iran does NOT have a nuclear weapon program. Cohen goes on to quote former BlackRock executive and now German Chancellor, Friedrich Merz: “This mullah regime has brought death and destruction to the world.” Iran has invaded no countries while the US has invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria while Israel has attacked Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and now Iran. After suggesting some causes for caution, Cohen closes with his core message: the Tehran government may fall like the Berlin Wall. He quotes the “Iran expert” again: “The Islamic Republic is a zombie regime.” Roger Cohen has been an influential participant in NYT distortions and lies. In 2002, he became NYT foreign editor during the crucial run up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. As stated at his Wikipedia page, “He supported the invasion.” The deceit about the non-existent “weapons of mass destruction” was under Cohen’s direction. In early March, 2011, Roger Cohen said he was against Western intervention in Libya. Two weeks later, he urged the West to be “ruthless” and to kill the Libyan leader. This has turned out to be yet another disaster. The Libyan people are still paying the price while Roger Cohen has forgotten about it. Roger Cohen, representative of the Times, consistently finds a few voices of opposition, claims without evidence they represent a large group or the civilian majority, then promotes intervention, violence and “regime change”. He did this with Iraq, then Libya, now Iran. Judging from the most popular reader comments, many NYT readers are critical of this “news analysis”. The most popular comment has 1,600 endorsements. Dr. Finn Majlergaard from France says, “What right do you (Americans) think you have to decide who should be in power in sovereign countries when you can’t even deal with your own domestic dictator and the US regime’s gestapo methods against foreigners?” The second most popular comment is from Florence Massachussetts. The reader asks, “Will it be okay if a truly democratic nation bombs the United States in order to encourage regime change away from our current authoritarian rulers?” The vast majority of reader comments are critical of the drive to attack and possibly overthrow yet another government. Apparently they have learned from past foreign policy failures while the NY Times and foreign policy establishment have not. Another disaster based on false assumptions and arrogance lays ahead. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.
