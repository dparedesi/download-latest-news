There’s a quote, though the source isn’t exactly known, and it goes like this: “Whenever people need a hero, we shall supply him.” I can’t quite shake the feeling that Donald Trump is that controlled opposition hero, and this story has me all the more unsettled: Trump is reportedly funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to software giant Palantir, building out a massive domestic surveillance and data collection network, which includes American citizens. From a report at Yahoo Finance: Since Trump signed an executive order in March calling for more interagency data sharing, Palantir has quietly become the go-to vendor for building that digital infrastructure. The company has landed more than $113 million in new and extended federal contracts since Trump took office including a blockbuster $795 million deal with the Pentagon last week. Palantir's Foundry platform is already in use at Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, and engineers were recently embedded at the IRS to begin building a unified, searchable database for taxpayer records. Talks are also underway with the Social Security Administration and Department of Education, suggesting more agencies could follow. To make matters worse, a slew of MAGA sycophants are promising critical thinkers that this is a “good thing” for Americans, because it’s how we identify all of the threats that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris imported into the country during their reign of terror—one such example is seen below: If you’re a patriot, you want Trump using every tool to keep you safe. — Pregnant Redhead (@PregnantRedhead) May 30, 2025 Perhaps she never heard the wise remark attributed to Benjamin Franklin: “Those who would trade freedom for safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” To follow Franklin’s observation to its logical conclusion: “Those who would trade freedom for safety will get neither liberty nor safety.

Thiel is a billionaire member of the World Economic Forum, and in 2023, Thiel’s gay lover was found dead after he reportedly blew the lid on the alleged affair to Thiel’s husband. He doesn’t quite strike me as a “conservative,” or an America-first type of guy. Here’s another disturbing aspect: the name “Palantir” comes from J. R. R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings tale, as it was the name of the indestructible crystal ball that the evil Saruman used to surveil events throughout Middle Earth, even those far into the future. With Palantir’s use of AI to run algorithms and assess future threats, this is looking a little like the plot to Minority Report. UPDATED: I have just come across a relevant video.

Title: Regulations are making homes unaffordable … around the world!
URL: https://www.wnd.com/2025/06/regulations-are-making-homes-unaffordable-around-the-world/
Time Published: 2025-06-01T17:44:33Z

By Joel Kotkin, Wendell Cox, Real Clear Wire June 1, 2025 Next to inflation, Americans ranked housing as their top financial worry in a Gallup survey last May. It’s only gotten worse. January home sales were down 5% from last year’s dismal numbers. Record numbers of first-time buyers are stuck on the sidelines as housing affordability stands at the lowest level ever recorded, while one in three Americans now spend over 30% of their income on mortgage or rent. The housing crisis is not just an American problem, but a global phenomenon that hits the middle and working classes the hardest. Studies of the Canadian, British, European, and East Asian markets have also found that housing prices have risen far faster than household incomes and inflation. A report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development concluded that “housing has been the main driver of rising middle-class expenditure.” In prosperous and communitarian Switzerland, Zurich studios sell for well over $1 million, and small houses even more, making downpayments unaffordable to affluent people despite the overwhelming financial advantages to homeowners. Underlying the plight of home buyers worldwide is a sometimes overlooked but profound influence – the spread of restrictive land-use regulations. It’s reshaping political and economic alignments in ways that may further destabilize the social order. Home ownership is strongly correlated with positive social indicators, and as renting grows twice as quickly as buying, this trend poses a threat to Western democracy by deepening economic inequality, depressing demographic vitality, and undermining the upward mobility that has driven Western progress for the past century.

Cost of Over-Regulation The price increase may seem surprising because there has not been a huge spike in fundamental demand. In California, and most of the United States, as well as Europe and East Asia, population growth is tepid, if not declining. Today’s higher interest rates are below those that prevailed from 1970 to 1995, when housing costs were considerably lower relative to incomes. Nor is this predominantly a technical problem; the rise of remote work, which is connected to migration to smaller metros, as well as new technologies for building, including using 3D printers, actually offers the chance to build more cheaply. And yet, the principal cause for housing shortages and rising prices stems from the failure to build enough new housing units, particularly the single-family homes consumers most desire. Homebuilders built 1 million fewer homes (including rental units) in 2024 than in 1972, when there were 130 million fewer Americans. One estimate puts the U.S. housing market shortage at an estimated 4.5 million homes, according to Commerce Department data. The rapid inflation of housing costs stems primarily from ever more constricting land-use regulations. Inflated prices are particularly rife in countries and states with strict regulations like California, where high-income households now utterly dominate the housing market, and more than a third of all real estate transactions in recent years topped $1 million. At the crux of the problem is a series of housing policies referred to as “urban containment.” First implemented in Britain at the end of the Second World War, urban containment policies typically seek to manage growth by imposing boundaries or greenbelts around urban areas, outside of which new development is either prohibited or severely limited. Decades ago, there was ample land within these boundaries, but this has changed as population growth has stimulated more demand. The simple fact is that once the urban limits are reached, land prices along the boundaries – the suburbs and exurbs – and in the areas still open to development inevitably rise. This mimics the effects of the 1970s gasoline embargoes that drove prices through the roof – and is nothing more than basic economics. Rationing tends to increase prices. To this flawed approach, many jurisdictions have imposed other costs such as high-impact fees, lengthy environmental reviews, minimum parking mandates, and historical preservation designations. But generally, nothing quite compares with urban containment, as it drives up land costs by restricting development on the periphery, where land prices are the lowest. In almost all cases, the highest housing prices occur in markets that are characterized by this planning strategy. This includes all markets in Australia and New Zealand and many in Canada, the United Kingdom, the U.S., Western Europe, and China. In the U.S., the worst housing inflation has been in California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, and Colorado, all states that apply the tightest large regulatory noose around new developments, particularly on and beyond the urban fringe. The connection between policy and prices is clearly evident. As late as 1970, only a few markets were shaped by urban containment. As its influence grew, so did prices. As late as about 1990, national price-to-income ratios were “affordable,” at three or less in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. Today, the median multiple in these countries tends to be over five. But the worst results, as seen in most recent Demographia International Housing Affordability Study – Hong Kong, Sydney, San Jose, Vancouver, Los Angeles, Adelaide, Honolulu, San Francisco, Melbourne, Brisbane, as well as Greater London, are at a remarkable nine or above. Perhaps counterintuitively, higher density development – often seen as the alternative to “sprawl” – does not lower prices, as is sometimes suggested. In fact, U.S. data suggests a positive correlation between greater density and housing costs. Among 53 major metros, those with more single-family housing and larger lot sizes (key indicators of lower density) have substantially better housing affordability. The effects of density-focused policies on people and regions are profound. One study found the median family in San Jose or San Francisco would need 125 years (150 in Los Angeles) to save enough money to afford a down payment on a median-priced home; in Atlanta or Houston, the figure is 12 years. Highly restrictive planning policies also impact renters. A recent RAND study of California found that policy-driven delays, strict architectural standards, green mandates, and the requirement to pay union-level wages have increased the cost of construction of subsidized apartments twice as much as in Texas, while taking almost two years longer to get approved. Portland, Ore., a pioneer in urban containment, embraces high-density housing, but high prices have driven multifamily construction to the lowest level in a decade. Collapse of the Dream Urban containment and other planning policies have devastated middle-class aspirations in every country or region that adopts them, even in countries like Australia, which enjoy a vast land mass and a smallish population. Australian cities once characterized by family-friendly neighborhoods are now dominated by dense apartments and condominiums. Planning regulations now add 55% to the price of a home in Sydney, according to a recent Reserve Bank of Australia study. In greater Sydney, the median home price recently passed A$2 million (approximately US$1.3 million). This is higher relative to incomes than in Los Angeles, London, New York, Singapore, and Washington. Even Adelaide, geographically isolated and far from a dynamic global business locale, has higher prices, based on income, than Seattle, one of the world’s most dynamic tech hubs. According to projections from the Urban Taskforce, apartments will make up half of Sydney’s dwellings mid-century, whereas only one quarter of Sydney dwellings will be family-friendly detached homes. Young people are most impacted by this policy regime. In the U.S., homeownership for people under 35 has fallen fairly steadily since the Great Recession of 2008 and is now half that of people over 45. Similarly, in Australia, the percentage of households aged 25 to 34 owning homes has dropped from more than 60% in 1981 to only 45% in 2016. Similar trends are seen in other high-income countries, including Ireland, where only a third of millennials own a home, compared with almost two-thirds of baby boomers when they were the same age. At least one-third of British millennials are likely to remain renters permanently. Much of the same is occurring in the U.S. Whereas in 1969, the median price of a home cost about five years of a young adult’s income, today it costs nearly nine years. A new Institute for Family Studies report, “Homes For Young Families: A Pro-Family Housing Agenda,” says that since 1970, the share of young adults who own the home they live in has declined from 50% to around 25-30%. Ignoring Preferences In advocating such urban containment and other high-density housing policies, planners, backed by academia and most big media, set themselves against the overwhelming preferences of the public for less density and more spacious housing. Judge Glock, who is now affiliated with the Manhattan Institute, has noted that in Census Bureau data since 1950, the average density of the major continuously built-up urban areas has dropped from 6,000 people per square mile to 3,000. In recent years, smaller metropolitan areas have been growing the fastest, while net domestic migration is away from areas of higher density to areas of lower density. Since 1950, the share of U.S. population in core cities has fallen from 24% to under 15%. Even in California, despite government resistance, virtually all the growth over the last decade has been in farther-flung suburbs. As elsewhere, the preference for single-family homes is “ubiquitous,” according to recent research by Jessica Trounstine at the University of California, Merced. “Across every demographic subgroup analyzed,” she observes, respondents preferred single-family home developments by a wide margin. Relative to single-family homes, apartments are viewed as “decreasing property values, increasing crime rates, lowering school quality, increasing traffic, and decreasing desirability.” Once, it was widely suspected that young people would head to big core cities like New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Denver. But surveys reveal that nearly three in five younger people see homeownership as an essential part of the American dream, while two-thirds favor suburbs as their preferred residence. Three out of four Californians, according to a poll by former Obama campaign pollster David Binder, opposed legislation that banned single-family zoning. A big driver of suburban growth is minorities and immigrants. In the 1950s and 1960s, mass suburbanization was widely associated with “white flight” and discrimination against minorities. But in the past decade, over 90% of all suburban growth in the U.S. came from minorities; currently, more than three-quarters of all African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians in major metropolitan areas in the U.S. live in the suburbs. Similar patterns are also evident in Canada, Australia, and the U.K. Today, most high-income countries are primarily suburban. A Statistics Canada analysis of 2021 census results indicates that more than 75% of the population lives in the suburbs, which absorbed more than 80% of the growth between 2016 and 2021. Even in transit-rich and land-short Japan, residents of Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya are dispersing away from the urban core to suburban and exurban areas after these cities nearly monopolized national population growth over the previous decade. Much the same can be said of Seoul, South Korea, which is even denser than the Japanese megacities. An analysis of the 53 U.S. major metropolitan areas finds that more than 85% of residents live in suburban or exurban neighborhoods and that more than 90% of the population growth since 2010 has been in the suburbs and exurbs. These choices underscore an analysis of Canadian poll results by Sotheby’s, which suggests a “disconnect” between urban planning and consumer preferences: The “picture is of young urban families overwhelmingly preferring detached houses, and decidedly not the condominiums into which planners are driving them.” As Sotheby’s puts it, “The report dispels myths about young, urban families’ housing preferences.” Among Americans under 35 who do buy homes, four-fifths choose single-family detached houses. According to a recent National Homebuilders Association report, over 66%, including those living in cities, prefer a house in the suburbs. Almost two-thirds of U.S. millennials (25 to 44) favor being owners, which is also the case in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. The future vision of the planners has little attraction among the public. Upward Mobility or Neo-Feudalism? Whatever their desires, without an affordable home, millennials and Gen Z will face a formidable challenge in boosting their net worth. Homes today account for roughly two-thirds of the wealth of middle-income Americans; homeowners have a median net worth more than 40 times that of renters. Not surprisingly, most young people still believe in creating wealth through ownership. Yet rather than allowing for greater dispersal of wealth, as was the case in previous decades, the decline of housing affordability is a critical factor driving inequality, notes a recent study by Bank for International Settlements (Berne) economist Gianni La Cava. In more historically feudal Great Britain, land prices have risen dramatically over the past decade, and less than 1% of the population owns half of all the land. On the continent, farmland is increasingly concentrated while urban real estate has fallen into the hands of a small cadre of corporate owners and the mega-wealthy. The left-wing economist Thomas Piketty has identified high housing costs as a driver of increasing inequality even in purported social democracies like Germany and France. This is also the case in the U.S., where about 71% of the increase in housing wealth between 2010 and 2020 was gained by high-income households, according to the National Association of Realtors. Increasingly, home ownership relies on the classic feudal formula – being born into “the funnel of privilege.” In the U.S., millennials are three times as likely as boomers to count on inheritance for their retirement. Among the youngest cohort, those ages 18–22, over 60% see inheritance as their primary source of support as they age. In high-price markets like Los Angeles and Orange County, California, close to 40% of loans rely on family money for qualification, up from 25% in 2011. Threat to Democracy Most democratic or republican societies in history – in Athens, Rome, the Netherlands, Britain, France, North America, Oceania – were created and sustained by a broad property-owning middle class. In the twentieth century, middle-class asset growth was accomplished in large part by the expansion of an urban footprint beyond the city core, allowing many more citizens to buy property in spacious, safe environments offering a measure of privacy. The ideal of broadly dispersed property ownership has long been promoted by politicians, both right and left, in most high-income countries. “A nation of homeowners, of people who own a real share in their land, is unconquerable,” said President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He saw homeownership as critical not only to the economy but to democracy and the very idea of self-government. Today, the trend towards democratization of landownership is being reversed, with more and more people being pushed into living in rented apartments or houses, with little chance of gaining financial independence. An economy where most people rely upon wealth transfers from the more fortunate cannot easily coexist with a tradition of individual initiative and self-governance. At the very least, the drive to create lifetime renters and forced densification sets a stage for a future political conflict and social disruption, particularly for the younger generation. In a Harvard poll of 18- to 29-year-olds this year, housing ranked as the third-most important issue overall, after inflation and health care. In California, almost 70% of residents consider housing costs a major concern, while in Britain, housing rose to be one of the top five issues for voters, well ahead of defense, security, poverty, and crime. The housing affordability crisis impacts a host of life decisions. Studies of the U.S. have found that higher house prices had a direct impact on the decision of couples to have children. Research in Germany and across 18 European and North American nations also found that high housing prices defer family formation, leading to lower fertility as well as marriage rates, particularly among the working class. On the flip side, a new study by the Federal Reserve Board reports that homeowners are not only more affluent than renters, they are also physically and mentally healthier, vote more often, and their children achieve higher levels of education. Many advocates of forced densification and renting justify their views around “green” and “sustainability” concerns. The environmental magazine Grist has envisioned “a hero generation” that will escape the material trap of suburban living and work that engulfed their parents. One magazine editor proudly declared herself a part of the GINK generation (as in “green inclinations, no kids”) that she said meant not only a relatively care-free and low-cost adult life, but also “a lot of green good that comes from bringing fewer beings onto a polluted and crowded planet.” Less motivated by planetary concern, major Wall Street investors are also focusing on crowding people into small spaces and a life of permanent rentership. Britain’s Lloyds Bank and BlackRock have placed multi-billion-dollar bets on buying homes for the rental market. In the first quarter of 2021, investors accounted for roughly one out of every seven homes bought, a marked increase from previous years. A notion embraced by some financial groups as well as greens is one of a rentership society where people remain renters for life, enjoying their video games or attending to their houseplants, never knowing the pleasure of having a real garden or backyard of their own. It might assure a steady profit for the landlord class, but it would destroy the dream of ownership for the average person. The broader effect may resemble a modern form of feudalism, where both inherited wealth and institutional ownership, often the Church, concentrate control over housing. Need for Reform If unchecked, the pattern of declining ownership and rising prices for housing could shape the politics of the future, particularly among young people. Not surprisingly, many renters tend to favor leftist policies such as rent control and housing subsidies. The development of a class of permanent renters seems ideal for fomenting class warfare directed at an ever-shrinking number of owners, by a vast majority with no real assets, and little chance of getting any. Ultimately, the battle over land and property will define our future. We either accommodate hope among those in the next generation or force them to accept a lifetime of rental serfdom and permanent subservience to the state, or big capital, or both. As Conor Dougherty of The New York Times put it, “For all the focus on billionaires and stock prices, it’s home values that are a primary source of wealth inequality and the root of a generational schism between the housing-rich baby boomers and young adults today.” He quotes Edward Glaeser, a premier housing economist at Harvard, who said that the housing crisis has become “a huge hindrance on the quest for well-being and the pursuit of happiness.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

Asset manager BlackRock has shown interest in acquiring a 10% stake in USDC stablecoin issuer Circle. The highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) will attract large crypto and traditional finance firms. This follows a thickening institutional plot in the crypto market, adding an extra layer of legitimacy for the high-flying assets. BlackRock is preparing to acquire part of Circle’s shares in its upcoming IPO, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Per a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Circle’s Chief Executive, Jeremy Allaire, plans to raise about $624 million in the IPO. The deal, which is expected on June 4, has recorded multiple orders for the shares available. The sources said the deal’s details are not finalized, and the $9 trillion asset manager could swoop in for a stake through another vehicle or opt out entirely. BlackRock and Circle are not strangers, as previous deals have already been struck. BlackRock manages a money market fund for Circle that backs the USDC stablecoin. The Fund now holds approximately $53.5 billion. USDC adoption is projected to build on gains in the past three quarters. Recent institutional developments in the United States, with its user base soaring, are tipped to favor the asset. Incoming stablecoin rules will also push its compliance in multiple jurisdictions. Circle initially filed for its IPO on April 1 but delayed due to rising economic concerns amid US tariff wars. The company has attracted big crypto firms like Ripple and Coinbase as users flock to its USDC stablecoin. Fortune reported informal sale talks with Coinbase and Ripple. However, Circle insisted it was not for sale following reports of a $4 billion bid deemed too low. According to the rebuttals, Circle remains committed to its long-term goals. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest is also preparing a $150 million swoop in Circle’s IPO. Digital asset traders remain thrilled as more institutional investors increase their exposure to the crypto market. According to experts, inflows have positioned assets for major upswings in Q2 2025. From investment in Bitcoin mining firms to stablecoin issuers, traditional players have raised the bar. Strategy, H100, and Addentax made recent Bitcoin acquisitions as the price closed at $110k. Meanwhile, GameStop announced a $513 million purchase, picking up 4,710 BTC.

Title: Bitcoin Suddenly Braced For $7 Trillion ‘Critical’ Price Tipping Point After Stark BlackRock Warning

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 06/01 update below. This post was originally published on May 30 Bitcoin has fallen sharply since hitting an all-time high last week, down 6% despite the U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge bitcoin prediction. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last two years, turbo-charged by Wall Street adoption led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and then U.S. president Donald Trump’s embrace of the technology (with Elon Musk quietly plotting what could be a bitcoin price game-changer). Now, as fears swirl the U.S. dollar could be teetering on the verge of collapse, a serious BlackRock warning that quantum computing could pose an existential risk to bitcoin has been escalated by a Google research paper that found encryption-breaking quantum computers could be a lot closer than previously thought. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has emerged as one of the most bullish voices supporting ... More bitcoin on Wall Street, helping the bitcoin price boom. “This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate,” Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney wrote, referring to the number of quantum computer qubits needed to break a public-key encryption algorithm similar to that used by bitcoin. “If this is even remotely true, combined with everything else happening right now, the only safe trade are hard assets and, dare I say, gold,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya, a vocal supporter of bitcoin who claims to have first bought some when the bitcoin price was just $100, posted to X in response to the paper. 06/01 update: The bitcoin price has now plummeted by almost 10% from its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, falling to just over $103,000 and fast approaching the closely-watched $100,000 level. "Next week will be critical for both the crypto market," analysts with 10x Research led by Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note that suggested long-term bitcoin holders are beginning to sell. This coming week will see slew of economic and labor market data—topped by Friday’s monthly U.S. jobs report—as well as U.S. president Donald Trump’s controversial "big, beautiful" tax bill coming to the Senate and legal back-and-forth expected over Trump’s market-crashing barrage of global trade tariffs. Meanwhile, bullish bitcoin price analysts are predicting small changes in “sentiment” could trigger outsized market swings, with huge volumes of cash still sitting on the sidelines. “With roughly $7 trillion still parked in money market funds and another $2 trillion in fixed income ETFs, even a modest shift in risk sentiment could redirect meaningful capital into crypto and other high-beta assets,” Matt Mena, research strategist at crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) company 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “If bitcoin breaks out of the $105,000 to $110,000 range with conviction, we could see a sharp move to $120,000 and, more importantly, reach our previously year-end price target of $138,500 per bitcoin by the end of the summer.” Earlier this month, BlackRock quietly added a serious warning about quantum computing to the list of risks to its huge spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024. The fund now holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $70 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher, hitting an all-time high of around $112,000 per bitcoin last ... More week before dropping back. “If quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock’s amended regulatory filing for its bitcoin fund read. The quantum computing risk to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has exploded recently, with tech giants including Google making strides in quantum computing research. “At this point, no blockchain is ready to withstand a quantum attack when this becomes possible, which could very well be much earlier than 2030,” David Carvalho, the chief executive of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure blockchain Naoris Protocol, said in earlier emailed comments that warned bitcoin is “sleepwalking into a disaster.”

Bitcoin’s $8B decline signals potential for a rebound, but macro challenges and bears remain in control. Macro headwinds are starting to weigh on the market. FUD is picking up, demand is clearly slowing, and bears are beginning to find their footing. Bitcoin [BTC] hasn’t established a reliable support base yet, and with long positions stacked up, the risk of a liquidation cascade is real. Still, the market feels like it’s on a knife’s edge. One decisive move from the bulls could flip the momentum fast. The next move likely defines the short-term trend. Let’s take a look at Bitcoin’s daily chart. You’ll see five straight red candles lighting up the board. On the 27th of May, BTC briefly touched $110K, then bears crashed the party hard, triggering a swift sell-off that squeezed the bulls tight. But the catch is, this liquidity surge followed Trump Media’s $2.5 billion Bitcoin treasury buy. Normally, that’d fuel a pump, but instead, traders hit the brakes, dialing up the risk-off mood. The culprit? Trade war jitters. As AMBCrypto pointed out, retail cash is fleeing back to safe havens like bonds, draining momentum from crypto. And it’s not just retail. Amid the U.S. equity slowdown, institutional capital is stepping back, too. BlackRock sold 4,100 BTC, snapping its 52-day streak of consecutive inflows. Source: Farside Investors Bears are flexing. In fact, Funding Rates on Bybit turned red for the first time in almost a month, adding to the downside pressure with the macro scene looking shaky. But here’s the thing: Bitcoin’s been dropping in a straight line – no crazy swings, no solid support yet, no bounce back. So what’s brewing? A full-blown distribution dump or just a tight liquidity squeeze ready to snap back? Putting macro noise and futures flows aside, a single sell-off won’t flip the script to distribution just yet. In fact, on the 29th of May, at $105,521, spot wallets saw an outflow of 8,175 BTC – signaling serious accumulation, not panic selling. On the derivatives front, as AMBCrypto flagged, on the 23rd of May, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) hit a record $80 billion, lining up with its all-time price high. What followed? A sharp round of deleveraging. At press time, Bitcoin’s OI slid to $71.86 billion. That’s a staggering $8 billion flush in just seven days. Source: CoinGlass That explains Bitcoin’s controlled, linear bleed. But without signs of capitulation from weak or strong hands, the bulls still have a window to strike back. So far, this looks less like panic and more like the board getting reset, ready for a healthier leg, once the macro clouds clear.

Title: Adani Energy to raise $502 million through stake sale
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/adani-energy-to-raise-502-million-through-stake-sale-11748747659636.html

(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Gautam Adani-controlled Adani Energy Solutions Ltd. approved raising 43 billion rupees ($502 million) via a stake sale. The Adani Group unit’s board approved a proposal to raise the amount via “Qualified Institutional Placement” in one or more tranches, according to an exchange filing Saturday. Adani companies, with interests stretching from ports to green energy, are steadily regaining investor confidence after a US indictment of the founder soured sentiment. The group in April raised about $750 million for an acquisition, with BlackRock Inc. subscribing to about a third of the bond issue. Last week, its ports unit raised $150 million from DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in a bilateral loan. In March, Fitch Ratings removed Adani Energy from a rating watch and assigned it a negative outlook, citing moderating risks associated with the group’s liquidity. “The Adani group has demonstrated adequate funding access” since the US bribery charges, Fitch said in a statement.

Title: Letters: Michael McDowell is wrong about RTÉ being infiltrated by ‘Stalinists’ at the height of the IRA’s war against the Irish people

Senator Michael McDowell. Photo: Gerry Mooney Madam — In last week’s Sunday Independent (May 25) senator Michael McDowell took a sideswipe at those of us who worked in RTÉ current affairs at the height of the Provisional IRA’s war against the Irish people. In doing so he distorted the historical record and recycled the hairy old conspiracy theory that RTÉ had been “infiltrated” by The Workers Party activists who held the station’s current affairs coverage in a “vice-like grip”. I was one of the “Stalinists” senator McDowell was getting at in his interview with Dónal Lynch. For the record, I wasn’t “infiltrated” into RTÉ in 1978 but was offered the post of producer/director after a rigorous open public competition. I joined the current affairs programme Today Tonight in 1980 and was part of a large editorial team who robustly debated how to cover the biggest story of the day: the Provisional republican movement’s attempt to take power in Ireland, North and south, through “the ballot box and the Armalite”. Like the majority of my producer and researcher colleagues in RTÉ at the time I supported the ban on Provo and loyalist frontmen appearing on air to justify their terror campaigns. In backing Section 31, I and others like me in RTÉ, believed we were acting in defence of Irish democracy against an evil sectarian insurgency that sought to plunge the island of Ireland into a full scale ethnic civil war. In Dáil Éireann Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats all embraced this point of view. Workers Party TDs took the opposite view and voted in support of the arguments advanced by purist advocates of free speech and most RTÉ journalists. Their contention was that the apologists for murder would be held to account by tough forensic journalism. That never happened. In 1994 the ban on Sinn Féin appearing on RTÉ was lifted. At that time the Provos had no TDs sitting in Dáil Éireann. Thirty years later, despite being unrepentant about the war crimes of its military wing, Sinn Féin has 39 TDs, one more than Fine Gael. Like senator McDowell I regard the Provisional IRA campaign that Sinn Féin justifies as an “abomination”. That murderous Provisional “abomination” was at its most lethal in the 1970s and 80s. I am proud to state that I was one of many RTÉ programme makers who saw the slaughter perpetrated on behalf of “Irish freedom” by Provo “volunteers” for what it was, and called it out when it was most needed. Gerry Gregg, Blackrock, Co Dublin Madam — In years to come, a global generation of young people will confront their parents with two simple questions. What did you do to oppose the catastrophic genocide of innocent civilians in Gaza and what did you do to resist the deliberately induced famine? The very least we should be able to answer is that we demanded of our TDs an immediate implementation of the Occupied Territories Bill. A piece of legislation which in and of itself is a totally inadequate response to the incremental displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank and yet consecutive Irish governments have found multiple excuses to not apply even this deficient response. If we do not mobilise as a national collective to demand our representatives act on Israeli genocide, we, too, will have to bear the guilt of the morally outraged, yet at the same time otherwise engaged citizen. Kevin McCarthy, Killaloe, Co Clare Madam — I read the article last week, ‘Doctor sees nine of her 10 children killed in new IDF atrocity’, and wondered why it wasn’t on the front page. These awful atrocities by Israel continue and our national news is more interested in what new disrespectful, bully-boy tactics have been dreamed up by Trump, giving him priority. What has happened in the world where poor children can just be killed by a powerful and rich nation, cheered on by the USA (a country I used to respect), while the rest of the world seems afraid to show our total disgust. The bad will continue to wreak havoc uncontested if the good remain silent. I am proud that Ireland is vocal in its condemnation of Israel, but the media needs to give it more priority. Less prominent pages of newspapers can be reserved for Trump news. Siobhán Buckley, Mallow, Co Cork Madam — Letter writers last week wrote about the suffering of children in Gaza and accused Israel of genocide. No mention that the current war began when Hamas perpetrated the highest number of murders of Jews in one day since the Holocaust. If the Israeli military campaign in Gaza was genocide then the Allied campaign against Nazi Germany would have been genocide, too. Ciarán Masterson, Cathedral Road, Cavan Madam — John Boyne writes that he came out as gay to unequivocal family support. Many of us were not so lucky. He also says he was too afraid to attend Pride as a teenager. Many of us attend Pride, and campaign for our community, in spite of or even because of that fear. If all he can do at a time of rising anti-LGBTQ+ hate across the world is sit on the sidelines and throw barbs at a community he has never needed or aided, that might go some way to explain why our community doesn’t need or heed him now. Jess Connor, Glasnevin, Dublin 9 Madam — In his recent article, John Boyne argued for the repeal of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) 2015, referring to it as “problematic at best, and deeply misogynistic at worst”. Yet he offers no explanation as to what these problems might be. The issue of gender recognition has been thoroughly examined by the Irish courts and the Dáil since Dr Lydia Foy’s case began in 1997. To scrap this legislation would make Irish law incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Mr Boyne mentions “fear of being attacked” as a teenager. Yet repealing the GRA (the mechanism by which trans people can update documents to match their gender, presentation and appearance) would force trans people to out themselves constantly. We face the same hatred, from the same people, but Mr Boyne refuses to empathise with us. He would prefer to split our community based on our differences, rather than unite under our shared struggle. Ciara Witts, Birr, Co Offaly Madam — John Boyne’s column reads like a lengthy exercise in privilege, positioning himself as a spokesperson for a “respectable” gay minority. His account of coming out to unequivocal family support, a string of relationships, and public success is not just his personal experience — it’s a profoundly atypical one. His suggestion that Pride is no longer necessary because his life is comfortable reveals a breathtaking detachment from the daily realities still faced by many LGBTQ+ people. Pride was not built for those who never needed it. Boyne’s attempt to distance himself from LGBTQ+ culture does not make him brave or insightful. It makes him condescending. To imply that queer students are just “ruthlessly straight middle-class” dilettantes, or that trans women pose a threat to women’s rights, is scapegoating — fear dressed as reason. He praises the Cass Review as if it were universally respected, failing to acknowledge the flaws that have prompted criticism from within the medical and academic communities. What Boyne dismisses as hollow allyship — being told he is “loved, seen and heard” — is, in fact, empathy. His rejection of it says more about his own discomfort than the intentions of allies. Empathy, not elitism, is what underpins meaningful progress. Caz Koopman, Cobh, Co Cork Madam — I wish to compliment John Boyne on his brave, balanced, honest and insightful article about being gay. He sums it up very well when he says, “it is just the way I was born”. I agree. Dr Pat Mc Grath, Monkstown, Co Dublin Madam — It is wonderful to read John Boyne’s clear and refreshing refutation of our modern “Pride” celebration and the LGBTQ+ label. At a time when Pride flags are draped year round outside secondary schools and youth centres, we have to wonder what confusing ideology is being promoted to our youth in the guise of compassion and inclusion. The pendulum has swung too far and clear thinking and maturity is needed from the leaders of our community. Boyne is clearly showing leadership here and I hope our educators listen. Alan Coakey, Roscommon town Madam — As someone who has visited the United States many times, it saddens me that I will probably never go there again. Trump’s recent intention to have the social media accounts of visa applicants looked at is not only creepy, but scary. To me it is the last straw. This is going to cause widespread damage to the plans of students in Ireland who go to America every summer to work on a J1 visa. And after he is gone, his legacy will still linger as the much younger and even more right-wing JD Vance, the vice president who has publicly let it be known that he dislikes foreigners immensely, especially Europeans, will carry on Trump’s catastrophic policy of ripping America’s reputation to bits. Mike Burke, Sixmilebridge, Co Clare Madam — I want to congratulate Nikki Hayes for being so candid with Niamh Horan in last week’s Sunday Independent. I was stuck by the veracity of Nikki’s story and I want to take this opportunity to wish this brave woman every good wish for the future. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Madam — As an Irish pro-choice, pro-gay marriage feminist, I was delighted to read in the Sunday Independent that the commencement of the Government’s recently enacted surrogacy legislation has been paused and that a reconsideration is taking place. It is simply not the case that only conservative people oppose this legislation. There are very many liberal feminists in Ireland who oppose surrogacy because they want and work towards the best possible life for women and girls and this does not include having babies for anyone other than themselves. Anne Weadick, Galway city Madam — How timely was Niall MacMonagle’s interview with artist Michael Kane. Niall interviewed the artist before the opening of his exhibition in the Taylor Galleries. Michael died the day after. This particular interview captured the essence of the artist and this particular column is to be treasured because it captures the essence of the man. Niall is a superb interpreter of the art world and we could do with more words and more space from this columnist. Phyl Herbert, Rathmines, Dublin 6 Madam — Your restaurant critic’s review is my “go-to” page in Life magazine. It is always enjoyable. Last week, Lucinda asked: “Could this be the first 3-star?” This being Chapter One restaurant in Dublin and the 3-star being the elusive Michelin award. She supports her suggestion by telling us that, at the recent RAI awards, Chapter One, a Michelin 2-star restaurant, took the gong for the best restaurant in Dublin. I have no doubt that this is truly deserved. However, at the very same awards ceremony, Dede in Baltimore, also a Michelin 2-star restaurant, not only took the gong for the best restaurant in Ireland, but, as it happened, retained the gong won in 2024 for the best restaurant in Ireland. I would respectfully suggest that the Michelin Man should be more inclined, if and when they give the 3 stars, to look at the best in Ireland, rather than the best in Dublin — even if it is in West Cork, rather than in the capital. Michael Kenefick, Whitegate, Co Cork Madam — Gabija Gataveckaite and Mary Regan’s timely piece recently highlighted growing coalition unease over James Browne’s performance as Housing Minister. It’s hard not to ask: why didn’t Simon Harris, as FG leader, take the role himself? With housing in crisis, it would have been a clear signal of leadership. Instead, he chose Foreign Affairs and Defence. As Shane Ross noted recently, Ireland is acting like “a small country with a swollen head”. With record homelessness and housing starts at a four-year low, Harris’s decision speaks volumes. When the house is on fire, he is out installing satellite dishes. A housing tsar might yet be appointed, but we needed a political heavyweight months ago. Dylan Redmond, Leixlip, Co Kildare Madam — In response to a letter writer who pined for a more charismatic and youthful president of the United States, I wrote a letter to your newspaper with “Boring Joe Biden is doing just fine. He doesn’t have to leave his basement to get votes and instead concentrates on policy and enacting legislation”. Your predecessor edited those words to “Boring old Joe Biden” and gave me €50. Reading Shane Ross’s article last week, ‘Politics is a vocation where vanity captures its victims — I should know’, I’m reminded of that ageist sentence. Joe Biden was boring but by any standard he was one of the most successful bipartisan legislators of the past 50 years in US politics. What he was not good for though was selling newspapers or advertisements on cable TV. And therein lies the problem in the English-speaking western media. The 46th US president may still have lost to Donald Trump had he resisted the pile-on from the media and others to step down, but his record in government will stand the test of time. Tom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry Madam — If mass is the scientific term for the quantity of matter in a given object, and Mass is the ceremony that celebrates the sacrament of the eucharist, might it be a good idea to differentiate the two by using lowercase and uppercase? Mary Lally, Clontarf, Dublin 3 Madam — Having watched Uncharted on RTÉ, may I compliment the real heroes, the camera crew and the back-up team who took serious risks to get the daring footage. Well done also to Ray Goggins and the other amazing participants on their bravery.

Buckle up, folks. You’ll have a lot of words coming your way, but they’re the good kind of words. The ones with nothing but earnest intentions, that want to help people, not hurt them. While Refused are more know for their overbearing aural sounds, they’re aiming to contribute a bit more to society. A global society that needs it for sure. Now that the band is approaching the upcoming start of the European leg of their farewell tour, they’ve got a plan that involves them raising hella money to donate to pro-Palestinian causes across the land. Besides it being the right thing to do, their decision came after finding out information about some of the festivals they’re scheduled to play, and who might be financially backing those festivals. They call out KKR specifically, saying how they “invest in Israeli cyber security among other fucked up things.” Read the band’s lengthy but explanatory statement and action plan below: “So a week ago we found out that some of the festivals we’re playing this summer are backed by an entertainment conglomerate called Superstruct in which a bad bad actor named KKR is part owner. KKR invests in Israeli cyber security among other fucked up things. Our first instinct was to immediately jump ship, to boycott. We communicated this to the festivals and the organizers wrote back saying they shared our values and felt like we did, that they loved what they did and were proud of the festivals they’d created, that the majority of their audience would be sympathetic to our position and that they were gutted that bastards like KKR had bought into Superstruct after they started working with them, staining their life’s work by extension. One of them also questioned our other associations (cheeky, but he was right), saying that live nation are behind some other festivals and shows we’re playing, one of whose owners are Blackrock, a multinational heavily invested in weapons manufacturing, and that our music is on Spotify which donated money to Donald Trump’s inauguration and also invests in military AI. The scum of the earth basically. These festivals also told us they wanted us to make noise for the Palestinian cause, one of them even offered to give us a large amount of money just to donate to pro-Palestine organizations. So, the conundrum became: boycotting these festivals would make us feel good about ourselves, the band’s legacy wouldn’t be tarnished by association with these disgusting companies. it would feel nice. But it wouldn’t do any good; being morally superior doesn’t put food in the mouths of starving Palestinians. also, it wouldn’t make headlines; we’re not top billing on these festivals because, although we have a strong following within a specific subgenre of heavy music, we’re not a huge band. Some Swedish leftists sitting out a few festivals wouldn’t raise many eyebrows. We’ve mulled this over and although there’s a strong argument for taking a stand against KKR and this development of amoral private equity and hedge funds buying into the arts because it’s non-controversial and comparatively safe, it would be naive to think our boycott would even register for them. Rather the opposite, if people like that knew what we talked about on stage they would rather have us stay home, and with the charred bodies of Palestinians burned alive stacking up in the concentration camp/graveyard that Gaza has become, we have decided to make some noise, to go meet our people, to celebrate the resistance and raise money for the Palestinian cause this summer. To us, it is the right thing to do, to get out there and be a thorn in the side of Zionists, fascists, venture capitalists and to fan the flames of discontent together with our bright, informed comrades all over Europe. A lot of you have already bought tickets and are expecting us, so we’d love to get suggestions from local organizations and activists we could work with in all the countries and cities we’re playing. Free Palestine!!!” In a follow up post, they continued their statement with: “These kinds of deliberations are not new to us. In our late teens, coming out of the DIY underground, we were obsessed with ending our involvement in systemic oppression through the power of boycott, through spreading awareness of the human rights abuses in the countries that produced the consumer objects our generation coveted, the environmental impact of eating meat, the horrific abuses carried out by the USA in South America in order for us to have cheap bananas. These were all hot topics in the leftist punk underground at the time (and if we’re being self-critical for a moment, it’s obvious now that we were deluded in thinking that creating leftist utopias outside of the mainstream would achieve the great system change we were aiming for. Instead we left the parliaments to the neo-Nazis we used to fight in the streets [Antifa did the lion’s share of the fighting, but once or twice we fought them as a band, though most of the time we were too outnumbered and out-menaced to do shit], who gladly put on suits and toned their rhetoric down in order to gain power, an endeavor in which they succeeded beyond our wildest nightmares, as we can see all over the west right now), and it took us uneducated working class morons a while to learn what many picked up during two or three classes at UNI: that all of us in the west are complicit in the exploitation and subjugation of a huge part of the non-western world and while we worked hard to rid ourselves of this complicity by becoming incredibly conscious consumers, we slowly started to understand the immense machine of oppression that Europe and the US have constituted from the 1500s to this day, a fact that made our twenty-something consumer choices in the north of Sweden seem pretty insignificant. This didn’t deter us, but it definitely put us in check. What we quickly realized though was that we were always gonna be a gateway band. The underground community is a beautiful place, but after having seen the hundredth band preaching about the evils of capitalism or organized religion to a crowd of people dressed exactly the same as them, reading the same books, listening to the same bands, you start to wonder what the point really is: do we want to be right or do we want change? Refused was always a different animal than the pure, DIY or die-bands, and we did things they could not. That was kind of the point, to try and bring these ideas into the light. The centre-right government of Sweden gave us an award once (thank you @psl) and although we fucking hated their guts, we accepted the award just so we could stand right there in the corridors of power and ridicule them, humiliate them to their faces. There were minor deals with minor devils made, but through it all, we reached kids who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise: we turned a lot of people on to vegetarianism and veganism through our music, and there’s no counting the amount of people who have come up to us and said that our songs sowed the first seed of what grew to be a radical political life. It’s what we’re most proud of, the many activists, teachers, human rights lawyers, doctors and environmentalists for whom we were a companion (or even a stepping stone) on the way to a life of serving the greater good. They didn’t preach to the converted, they didn’t freak out about bar codes on CDs, they actually went out there and did shit. I guess what we’re trying to say is, these choices are not easy for us but we take them very seriously, and we’ve driven ourselves mad trying to bat a hundred in a crooked game. Which is why our next project will be DIY, more on that later…” Refused are sticking to their justice-forward, equal rights, mutual aid roots, and that’s what we need right now.

To us, it is the right thing to do, to get out there and be a thorn in the side of Zionists, fascists, venture capitalists and to fan the flames of discontent together with our bright, informed comrades all over Europe. A lot of you have already bought tickets and are expecting us, so we’d love to get suggestions from local organizations and activists we could work with in all the countries and cities we’re playing. Free Palestine!!!” In a follow up post, they continued their statement with: “These kinds of deliberations are not new to us. In our late teens, coming out of the DIY underground, we were obsessed with ending our involvement in systemic oppression through the power of boycott, through spreading awareness of the human rights abuses in the countries that produced the consumer objects our generation coveted, the environmental impact of eating meat, the horrific abuses carried out by the USA in South America in order for us to have cheap bananas. These were all hot topics in the leftist punk underground at the time (and if we’re being self-critical for a moment, it’s obvious now that we were deluded in thinking that creating leftist utopias outside of the mainstream would achieve the great system change we were aiming for. Instead we left the parliaments to the neo-Nazis we used to fight in the streets [Antifa did the lion’s share of the fighting, but once or twice we fought them as a band, though most of the time we were too outnumbered and out-menaced to do shit], who gladly put on suits and toned their rhetoric down in order to gain power, an endeavor in which they succeeded beyond our wildest nightmares, as we can see all over the west right now), and it took us uneducated working class morons a while to learn what many picked up during two or three classes at UNI: that all of us in the west are complicit in the exploitation and subjugation of a huge part of the non-western world and while we worked hard to rid ourselves of this complicity by becoming incredibly conscious consumers, we slowly started to understand the immense machine of oppression that Europe and the US have constituted from the 1500s to this day, a fact that made our twenty-something consumer choices in the north of Sweden seem pretty insignificant. This didn’t deter us, but it definitely put us in check. What we quickly realized though was that we were always gonna be a gateway band. The underground community is a beautiful place, but after having seen the hundredth band preaching about the evils of capitalism or organized religion to a crowd of people dressed exactly the same as them, reading the same books, listening to the same bands, you start to wonder what the point really is: do we want to be right or do we want change? Refused was always a different animal than the pure, DIY or die-bands, and we did things they could not. That was kind of the point, to try and bring these ideas into the light. The centre-right government of Sweden gave us an award once (thank you @psl) and although we fucking hated their guts, we accepted the award just so we could stand right there in the corridors of power and ridicule them, humiliate them to their faces. There were minor deals with minor devils made, but through it all, we reached kids who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise: we turned a lot of people on to vegetarianism and veganism through our music, and there’s no counting the amount of people who have come up to us and said that our songs sowed the first seed of what grew to be a radical political life. It’s what we’re most proud of, the many activists, teachers, human rights lawyers, doctors and environmentalists for whom we were a companion (or even a stepping stone) on the way to a life of serving the greater good. They didn’t preach to the converted, they didn’t freak out about bar codes on CDs, they actually went out there and did shit. I guess what we’re trying to say is, these choices are not easy for us but we take them very seriously, and we’ve driven ourselves mad trying to bat a hundred in a crooked game. Which is why our next project will be DIY, more on that later…” Refused are sticking to their justice-forward, equal rights, mutual aid roots, and that’s what we need right now.

KKR invests in Israeli cyber security among other fucked up things. Our first instinct was to immediately jump ship, to boycott. We communicated this to the festivals and the organizers wrote back saying they shared our values and felt like we did, that they loved what they did and were proud of the festivals they’d created, that the majority of their audience would be sympathetic to our position and that they were gutted that bastards like KKR had bought into Superstruct after they started working with them, staining their life’s work by extension. One of them also questioned our other associations (cheeky, but he was right), saying that live nation are behind some other festivals and shows we’re playing, one of whose owners are Blackrock, a multinational heavily invested in weapons manufacturing, and that our music is on Spotify which donated money to Donald Trump’s inauguration and also invests in military AI. The scum of the earth basically. These festivals also told us they wanted us to make noise for the Palestinian cause, one of them even offered to give us a large amount of money just to donate to pro-Palestine organizations. So, the conundrum became: boycotting these festivals would make us feel good about ourselves, the band’s legacy wouldn’t be tarnished by association with these disgusting companies. it would feel nice. But it wouldn’t do any good; being morally superior doesn’t put food in the mouths of starving Palestinians. also, it wouldn’t make headlines; we’re not top billing on these festivals because, although we have a strong following within a specific subgenre of heavy music, we’re not a huge band. Some Swedish leftists sitting out a few festivals wouldn’t raise many eyebrows. We’ve mulled this over and although there’s a strong argument for taking a stand against KKR and this development of amoral private equity and hedge funds buying into the arts because it’s non-controversial and comparatively safe, it would be naive to think our boycott would even register for them.

Title: Is Ethereum Preparing For A Move To $3,800? Analysts Predict Bullish Phase Ahead

Trading in the mid-$2,000 range, Ethereum (ETH) has repeatedly teased a move toward $3,000, only to fall short and retreat back into its current range. However, several crypto analysts remain confident that ETH’s ascent to $3,000 and beyond is only a matter of time. In a recent X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted ETH’s bullish price action. The analyst shared the following daily ETH chart, showing the cryptocurrency breaking out of a bullish flag following a period of consolidation – potentially setting its sights on a target of $3,800. Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto shared Titan’s outlook, saying that ETH is “holding up really well right now.” In a separate X post, the analyst added: It looks like a breakout is coming, and $3K is just around the corner. The fact that it’s outperforming #BTC this quarter is a strong sign that altcoin season is warming up. Meanwhile, crypto trader Jelle urged patience. Sharing the following chart of ETH’s recent price movement, he emphasized that ETH is behaving as expected as it continues to challenge a key resistance level. According to Jelle, the “real fun” will begin once ETH hits $3,000. Notably, ETH continues to attract strong institutional interest. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows for Ethereum topped $91 million yesterday, with BlackRock alone accounting for $50.4 million of that total – a clear sign of sustained confidence in the digital asset. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez also highlighted significant whale accumulation. According to Martinez, wallets holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 ETH acquired over 1 million ETH in the last 48 hours – a strong signal of long-term bullish sentiment. Large ETH ETF inflows and whale purchases signal rising institutional confidence and aggressive accumulation – trends that often precede bullish price action. By reducing the available supply on the market, these moves can help fuel upward momentum and price appreciation. From a technical standpoint, Ethereum is showing encouraging signs. Crypto trader Merlijn The Trader pointed out that ETH appears to be closely following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern. In this pattern, the spring phase involves a false breakdown below support to shake out weak hands, followed by a test to confirm waning selling pressure. This sets the stage for the jump – a strong rally above resistance with significant volume, marking the start of a new uptrend. According to Merlijn, ETH has already completed the spring and test phases and is now poised to enter the jump phase – potentially setting the stage for a move toward a new all-time high (ATH). That said, all eyes are on the FTX creditor payouts expected later today. Experts warn that the massive $5 billion distribution could temporarily dampen ETH’s bullish momentum by increasing short-term selling pressure. At press time, ETH trades at $2,603, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

IRISH RAIL HAS announced that its services between Dublin’s Connolly Station and Dún Laoghaire will be unavailable this weekend as commuters flock to a series of bank holiday events. Between today and Monday, 2 June, restrictions and alterations will apply to both rail and bus services because of limited capacity due to annual summer gatherings such as the Bloom festival and the VHI Women’s Mini Marathon taking place. Here are the main changes to note across the primary public transport services. A revised timetable will be in place for the weekend, with Monday’s times operating as Sunday schedules for Dart and commuter services. Dart services between Connolly Station and Dún Laoghaire will be unavailable due to major works on the line between Connolly and Blackrock which will also impact Rosslare Intercity services. However, rail tickets on affected routes are valid on Dublin Bus. Dart services are operating between Malahide/Howth and Connolly, and between Dún Laoghaire and Bray/Greystones. All other rail services are also off between Connolly and Dún Laoghaire for the entire bank holiday weekend, and Rosslare services will be operating from Bray only. (You can find full details here). Advertisement Irish Rail is reminding customers to pre-book tickets to ensure a seat on intercity trains because of high demand on Heuston-bound rail for the purpose of attending the Bord Bia Bloom festival in Dublin’s Phoenix Park. Some Dublin-bound trains from Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford are already fully booked, so additional trains will operate out of Cork and Galway to accommodate passenger numbers heading to Bloom Extra early trains from Cobh, Midleton and Mallow will be laid on to provide for high numbers attending the Cork City Marathon on Sunday. The company says all services will operate to a Sunday schedule this weekend. This will include Dublin’s Expressway services serving Ballina, Cavan, Donegal, Dundalk, Letterkenny, Monaghan, Sligo, Waterford and Wexford as well as serving Cork, Galway, Limerick and Tralee. Customers are strongly advised to pre-book their tickets and allow for delays if heading to and from Dublin Airport on Expressway due to holidaymakers jetting abroad. The VHI Women’s Mini Marathon in the capital will cause road closures, so Bus Éireann says people must check service updates on its website for the latest travel information. The company’s Monday service will operate to a Sunday schedule. Its Nitelink service will continue today, but will not be in place tomorrow. Customers are told to be aware of traffic diversions in place across the city to facilitate the Women’s Mini Marathon tomorrow. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Dublin is ridiculous. Here's why I still love it
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/05/31/ruby-eastwood-why-would-anyone-choose-to-live-in-a-city-as-ridiculous-as-dublin/
Time Published: 2025-05-31T05:30:00Z

You hear stories about how people survive in this impossibly expensive city. Couples who stay in loveless relationships because they can’t afford to separate. Strangers from Facebook groups sleeping in the same room. A bed rented by one person in the day and a different person at night. Tenants paying their landlords with sex. Artists squatting illegally in their studios. People sleeping in storage units. These stories are full of human ingenuity and degradation. They’re really quite strange when you think about them properly. The strangest part is how common they’ve become. [ Ireland’s rising rents: ‘Our budget would have been €1,300 a month, there isn’t even anything listed for that’Opens in new window ] About a year ago, my best friend in Dublin moved to Berlin, where he says it’s still possible to be broke and live well. When he left his damp, windowless room near Connolly Station – which cost just under a thousand euros a month – there were people queuing for the privilege of being next. Now he lives in a sunlit attic for a fraction of the price, and drinks Fritz Colas and Berliner Pilsners on the rooftop. Every so often, during our calls, he tries to convince me to join him. His logic is hard to fault: Dublin is untenable. Unless you have private wealth or can stomach a corporate job, you resign yourself to chronic financial dread – the kind that squats over your life like Fuseli’s goblin in the painting. At least in other expensive cities, such as New York or London, you can escape your overpriced room into a pulsing metropolis, with endless distractions and some of them free. In Dublin, all you can really do is go to the pub, and even that costs too much. The city is very small, and it seems to constrict as the years pass. You can’t leave the house without seeing a face you know. In fact, there are no faces you don’t know. They approach from all sides. And the rain. The constant rain. I recognise the truth in this, and it’s hard to argue with. Why would anyone choose to live in such a ridiculous city? I don’t know if I really understand my own reasons for staying. I suspect they’re quite shameful: they have more to do with a romantic or aesthetic impulse than with anything practical. I just like Dublin. I like the harsh beaches and the Martello towers. The silvery, rinsed-out light. I like walking through the sprawling industrial wastelands on the city’s fringes. I like the canals in spring, all fragrant with weeds and strewn with sunk bicycles. Strangers here seem to want to tell you things – like the old lady who, for no discernible reason, wanted to talk about the time she heard Bob Marley singing Redemption Song at Dalymount Park. You witness things. Once, on Talbot Street, I saw a man with an arm in a cast get into a physical fight with a man on crutches. I like Dublin on the rare occasions when it snows. I like the hot, malty smell from the Guinness factory. I like the Liberties, where you can hear the quiet rush of subterranean rivers, and church bells, and horses’ hooves. I like that ugly statue of Oscar Wilde with the pervert’s smile. I even like the loud, sentimental music on Grafton Street, and the whiskey-soaked ballads streaming from the pubs in Temple Bar. The idea of leaving Dublin becomes more, not less, appealing as I become more entrenched here ... we can weather all sorts of adversity, but banal contentment is the real deadener Mainly, though, I like Dublin because I chose it. The first time I visited, I was 21. I had some half-baked but very attractive notion of what Ireland represented: something to do with resistance, with migration and nostalgia and alcoholism. I had a copy of Finnegans Wake and I think I got about three pages in on the bus ride into town before falling asleep. When I woke up, I scrambled off and left the book behind. I had oysters for lunch that day and pictured my whole life in the city. It felt just the right size to make mine. I’ve lived in bigger cities: Barcelona, where I grew up, and London, where I lived before coming here; and smaller, random places: Brighton, Siena. I’ve spoken to quite a few Dubliners who are desperate to move to other European cities and can’t understand my decision to stay. There’s a kind of faith involved in choosing a city. You respond to its atmosphere, its pace and texture, the way it opens up to you – or doesn’t. Dublin, for all its flaws, felt like it might yield something if I stayed long enough. The beginning in a new place is always the hardest part: slow, bitty, full of doubts. I didn’t know anyone. I’d been accepted into a master’s programme but couldn’t fund it and had to defer my place by a year. When my sublet ended, I had to return to London for a while because I couldn’t find another room. I worked in bars and signed up with a temp agency that sent me on scattershot catering shifts around the city. The jobs were mostly tedious, but they offered a kind of education. I learned how the different bits of the city fit together, like a giant jigsaw. The glassy conference rooms down by the Quays. The Leopardstown racecourse, where West End men come on weekends to get extravagantly drunk. The grand Georgian hotels and restaurants, where they throw out so much good food it makes you want to cry. The methadone clinic at the end of the bus line where you hear the wildest conversations and sometimes get drawn in. [ Dublin: The 13th best city in the world ... supposedlyOpens in new window ] It occurs to me that the difficulty of establishing yourself in a city confers a special kind of meaning on your relationship to it. Like in a toxic romance, if you can weather the lows, the highs are incredible. Who knows – maybe the expensiveness and impossibility of a place like Dublin, far from being deterrents, actually deepen its appeal, the way we fetishise designer handbags but never their identical fakes. I’ve always had this wrong-headed idea that the value of something is revealed by the sting of its attendant sacrifice. Gradually, my life in Dublin took on more solidity. I was lucky enough to receive a university grant. I met people. I signed a lease. I moved in with a friend and we painted all the walls fresh white. She bought velvet floral curtains in pastel colours and hung them in the livingroom. I found a few prints in charity shops. I got a Persian carpet from a lady in Blackrock Market. A friend gave me a desk she no longer needed. Sometimes the city sends you little signs of progress. The quiet, stoical man in the corner shop at the end of my road has started calling me “honey”, and occasionally smiles. I have a friend’s spare keys on my keyring. I know the name of my neighbour’s dog. I know which cobbler to go to for the best deal. Still, there are days when I fantasise about leaving. It would be nice to buy lunch in a cafe without feeling frivolous. It would be wonderful not to feel like I’m stuck in a recurring nightmare every time rent comes around. Oddly, the idea of leaving Dublin becomes more, not less, appealing as I become more entrenched here. Maybe that’s no coincidence. To return to the toxic romance analogy: we can weather all sorts of adversity, but banal contentment is the real deadener. Recently, I spoke to a friend in London who’s moving to Iowa City for a master of fine arts degree. He told me he’s spent hours on Google Maps, exploring the place through Street View. The images all seem to have been captured on sunny days – it looks green and beautiful, full of classic American wood-frame houses. He’s begun to associate the town with Iowa Dream by Arthur Russell, all melodic guitar lines and soft lyrics. The self he pictured living there was different from the one he knows in London: less anxious, more social, content to spend long afternoons drifting around and hanging out with friends. [ Trevor White: I love Dublin. But there’s no point in pretending it’s a great small cityOpens in new window ] I also indulge in this kind of cartographic dreaming. I explore prospective cities on Street View: Beirut, Paris, Berlin. It’s a surreal activity. You pick a spot on the map and drag yourself along, imagining a parallel life. Sometimes, from one click to the next, the sun disappears and rain slicks the tarmac. Figures with blurred faces vanish or are replaced by others in different clothes further down the road. You realise the map is stitched together from footage taken on different days, in different moods. Another thing my friend hinted at stayed with me: that emigration can be indistinguishable from escapism. When I imagine myself in another city, I don’t picture myself as I am now, but a physically and intellectually tweaked version. In Paris, I’m gaunt with a perfect bob; I smoke straights and read Lacan for pleasure. In Beirut, I am somehow fluent in Arabic; I drink less; I am sharper and more spiritual. I study ancient manuscripts. In Berlin, I am reunited with my best friend and we live together like Robert Mapplethorpe and Patti Smith before it all fell apart, looking cool and making great art. The fantasy isn’t really about the new city. It’s about becoming a new person. [ Emer McLysaght: Five lessons Dublin can learn from ZurichOpens in new window ] There’s a way of reading this that feels a little bleak. You could say it reflects a kind of ambient self-disgust, or an inability to accept life as it is. A symptom of being stuck in the wheel of samsara: trapped in a cycle of craving and disappointment, forever projecting some improved self just over the horizon, never quite admitting that the old self follows you everywhere. There’s truth in that, but it’s not the whole story. There’s another, more generous way to see it. Maybe it isn’t escapism, but a kind of unconscious recognition that we are always in the process of becoming. Cities aren’t just stages on which our lives play out. They are the biggest collaborators. They shape how we speak, how we move, how we think. They alter our trajectories. When you choose to stay in a place, you’re submitting to its influence. To live in a city is to enter into a kind of contract. You agree to spend your time, your energy, and your labour in its service. In return, it promises transformation, but on its own terms. Like the enchanted gift in a fairy tale, the city will change you in ways you can’t predict, and not all of them will be kind. The point is you don’t get to choose. It’s a gamble. Is it one worth taking? Ruby Eastwood is a writer living in Dublin © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Financials Shift from ‘Green’ Agenda to Greenbacks

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change By Vijay Jayaraj In a slow but steady retreat, the world’s most powerful financial institutions are abandoning their once-lauded climate pledges in the beginning of a long-overdue correction. From BlackRock’s quiet exit to the mass defection of U.S. banking giants, the climate bandwagon is losing passengers. And what replaces it could finally bring a necessary focus on real-world developmental finance for both Western economies and the Global South. In 2024, the U.S. banking sector staged a collective retreat from the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). Exiting the alliance were six of America’s largest banks – Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase. Their reasons: legal and fiduciary concerns, coupled with mounting pressure from Republican-led states accusing the banks of violating antitrust laws by coordinating climate policies that could limit the financing of fossil fuel enterprises. Wells Fargo went further, explicitly dropping its pledge to achieve “net-zero” and stating it would instead “meet clients where they are in their chosen energy and transition strategies.” HSBC diluted its 2050 goals, acknowledging the impracticality of abrupt decarbonization. In January, BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager with approximately $11.5 trillion under management – left the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. BlackRock’s exit was a body blow to Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), the U.N.-backed coalition launched in 2021 to align institutions with decarbonization goals. These reversals coincided with Trump-era policy shifts: rescinding clean energy subsidies, green-lighting fossil fuels and prioritizing energy security. Republican-led lawsuits, such as the one filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, alleged that climate-focused investment strategies suppress industries like coal. These political headwinds have made finance executives wary of aligning with the likes of GFANZ On April 29, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) quietly abandoned its $500 billion commitment to decarbonization efforts. The reason? Canada’s updated Competition Act now treats exaggerated environmental claims as potential greenwashing – a criminal offense. The delicious irony is that this announcement came just one day after Mark Carney – former U.N. climate finance czar and a founder of GFANZ – was elected Prime Minister of Canada. Carney’s GFANZ, launched at COP26, boasted 450 firms managing $130 trillion. Today, it’s a ghost town. RBC’s exit epitomizes the alliance’s collapse. GFANZ demanded banks phase out fossil fuels. Instead, banks phased out GFANZ. RBC said the new legal framework made it “infeasible” to quantify progress on the goal without risking regulatory breaches. The entire edifice of net-zero commitments – built on ambiguous projections and unverifiable metrics – has begun to collapse under the weight of the laws meant to enforce them. Crying “betrayal,” critics of banks and asset managers departing climate coalitions lament a “backward slide.” But how could regulating atmospheric CO₂ reasonably be the job of your neighborhood bank? Wall Street was never meant to be an environmental regulator. It is supposed to allocate capital where it generates value. And the green agenda, riddled with faulty science, speculative technologies and political overreach, simply does not qualify as valuable. The green exodus has exposed the folly of policymakers at the U.N. and other global institutions that coerced financial giants into a quixotic crusade bereft of rationality. The world’s big banks have handed nearly $7 trillion in funding to the fossil fuel industry since 2016, the year when the Paris Agreement was formed to decapitate fossil fuel expansion. Critics decried this as an abandonment of climate goals, but for 2.2 billion households globally, it meant affordable energy and economic stability. The exit from climate politics heralds a crucial return to prioritizing genuine economic development. Sluggishness in many Western economies is, in part, a consequence of misallocation by climate hysteria. Some have questioned whether this shift is permanent, noting the powerful political forces that have driven the climate industrial complex may be disinclined to surrender. However, there is no doubt that to the extent financial institutions unshackle themselves from impractical climate pledges, they can refocus on supporting innovation, infrastructure and industries that generate real growth and jobs. This commentary was first published at RealClearEnergy on May 28, 2025. Vijay Jayaraj is a Science and Research Associate at the CO₂ Coalition, Arlington, Virginia. He holds an M.S. in environmental sciences from the University of East Anglia and a postgraduate degree in energy management from Robert Gordon University, both in the U.K., and a bachelor’s in engineering from Anna University, India.

So they – and their predecessor, the Useless Tories – are already borrowing substantially. Interest is the 12 months to end March 2025 was £109,000 million, so they’re already borrowing to pay the interest. Borrowing to pay the interest bill rarely ends well. . . . Auto 150,000 million = 150,000,000,000,000. That is 150 trillion and does not seem right. A thousand million is a billion, and a million million is a trillion. Therefore 150,000 million is 150 billion. 150,000 million does not equal 150,000,000,000,000. A million is 6 zeros, not 9. This is the lawsuit being formed against them. https://app.screencast.com/ZMpNTvkLD7DDJ Imagine being a finance MBA trying to explain to a judge this science and why they were so willing to put other people’s money to back this nonsense. https://app.screencast.com/DFd1viHxsRjq7 Countless investors were defrauded into funding this political agenda. In conclusion, a clear message emerges from our analysis: those who viewed responsible investing as the definitive solution to address sustainability issues in the corporate world may need to reconsider. While responsible investing has clear merits and can lead to positive impacts, our research highlights the importance of scrutiny and regulation to disentangle true sustainability from greenwashing. https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/smoke-and-mirrors-look-inside-esg-fund-portfolios Wall Street Firms deliberately ignored the political risks of these investments. https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/chris-wright-department-of-energy-carbon-capture/2025/05/30/id/1213033/ None of these Green Industries were self sustaining and yet Wall Street poured billions of other people’s money into them. “Imagine being a finance MBA trying to explain to a judge this science and why they were so willing to put other people’s money to back this nonsense.” First I’d have to imagine a judge that was listening. If they have a talent it would be figuring out what I’m going to say in the next 2 hours during the first 2 minutes. ‘They’ really believed they could entice/force people off the living standard cliff to bankrupt Capitalism. They bought the media and drove it into the ground with lies and thought they could sustain the lies and people wouldn’t care their lives were upended and deteriorating. Now their media is unbelievable and worthless. Couldn’t happen to a nicer bunch of Marxists. It’s good to see the big banks and investment institutions coming to their senses by realizing their clients are concerned primarily with steady returns. As long as the money isn’t being used to finance the sex trade, recreational drug production, and illegal arms smuggling, they don’t want to see it being used to prop up fashionable social and environmental issues like supposedly fighting the mythical climate crisis. And when they’re informed that despite billions in subsidies for renewable energy initiatives, fossil fuels still provide 82% of the world’s primary energy, they realize that using their investment proceeds to prop up wind and solar is a classic case of backing the wrong horse. In the situation with Mark Carney, he knew the only way to win the recent Canadian election was to dump the much-reviled carbon tax that was just increasing living costs while having an almost-imperceptible impact on reducing national emissions. Ah yes, it looks like the plutes are finally drifting away from climate madness, and following Marcus Aurelius’s advice: “The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.” Login Sign up to comment or become a paid supporter: Click Here “Walk toward the fire.

Title: Apple CEO Tim Cook miscalculates, goes quiet as his influence with President Trump fades
URL: https://macdailynews.com/2025/05/30/apple-ceo-tim-cook-miscalculates-goes-quiet-as-his-influence-with-president-trump-fades/
Time Published: 2025-05-30T21:37:24Z
Full Content:
Update font size. Reset Before President Donald Trump’s recent Middle East trip, the White House invited CEOs and representatives from numerous U.S. companies to accompany him. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, chose not to attend, according to two sources familiar with the matter. This decision seemed to irritate President Trump. During his visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, he made several remarks critical of Mr. Cook and Apple. Tripp Mickle for The New York Times: ‎ During his speech in Riyadh, Mr. Trump paused to praise Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, for traveling to the Middle East along with the White House delegation. Then he knocked Mr. Cook. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Huang at an event attended by chief executives like Larry Fink of the asset manager BlackRock, Sam Altman of OpenAI, Jane Fraser of Citigroup and Lisa Su of the semiconductor company AMD. Later in Qatar, Mr. Trump said he “had a little problem with Tim Cook.” The president praised Apple’s investment in the United States, then said he had told Mr. Cook, “But now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.” On Friday morning, Mr. Trump caught much of his own administration and Apple’s leadership off guard with a social media post threatening tariffs of 25 percent on iPhones made anywhere except the United States. The post thrust Apple back into the administration’s cross hairs… Nu Wexler, principal at Four Corners Public Affairs and a former Washington policy communications executive at Google and Facebook, said Mr. Cook’s “very public relationship” with Mr. Trump has backfired. “It has put Apple at a disadvantage because every move, including a potential concession from Trump, is scrutinized,” Mr. Wexler said. Because Mr. Trump didn’t “have much incentive to either go easy on Apple or cut a deal on tariffs,” he said, “the incentive to crack down is much stronger.” The timing of the White House’s new tariff plan couldn’t be worse for Mr. Cook, who has led Apple for nearly 14 years. Last month, the company suffered a stinging defeat in an App Store trial. The judge in the trial rebuked Apple executives, saying they had “outright lied under oath” and that “Cook chose poorly,” and ruled that Apple had to change how it operates the App Store. Jony Ive, Apple’s former chief designer who became estranged from Mr. Cook and left the company in 2019, joined OpenAI last week to build a potential iPhone competitor. Its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, released in January 2024 to fanfare, has been a disappointment. And in March, Apple postponed its promised release of a new Siri, raising fresh doubts about its ability to compete in the industry’s race to adopt artificial intelligence. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Apple needed a new CEO at least a decade ago. Instead, the endless iteration parade continues, with each year’s entries now unveiled via canned videos, growing ever more tiresome, diffused with ever more vapor, as each new paradigm shift is blindly missed by an aging, boring-as-beige CEO surrounded by burnt-out, surfeited VPs. We’ve long been the canaries in the coal mine. This lack of focus, lack of attention to detail, lack of striving for perfection will catch up to Apple eventually if it is not arrested and corrected in time. So – sigh – we once again present to Apple CEO Tim Cook, where the buck supposedly stops, the Trophy for Misplaced Priorities: The Misplaced Priorities Trophy — MacDailyNews, November 29, 2017 Apple is not firing on all cylinders. The quality has been slipping for years and the mistakes, bad designs, stupid decisions, product delays and worse have been piling up. – MacDailyNews, May 18, 2017 Steve Jobs is irreplaceable, but someone with vision, taste, and focus is what’s required here. The magic of Steve Jobs was vision, focus on the products from the user’s point of view, fastidious attention to detail, and next-level marketing acumen. – MacDailyNews, January 29, 2018 Steve Jobs could make a power cord seem insanely great. Tim Cook could put a room to sleep while unveiling teleportation; he makes watching paint dry seem like must-see event. Apple is currently helmed by a charisma black hole. Sparks are therefor not emitted. Lacking a charismatic leader who could sell ice cubes to eskimos, execution is the key. High quality products and services that just work with timely updates in sufficient supply at launch… Apple’s issues with late, old, sometimes problematic products and services do more to dampen excitement and devotion than anything. – MacDailyNews, January 4, 2019 You know, some people get upset when we point out that Tim Cook is a boring, reactive caretaker who’s not really the best person to be running Apple today or for at least the past several years. Operations manager Cook should have been a 3-5 year stopgap after Steve Jobs’ untimely passing, running the iteration playbook, providing continuity for the company while it found a real CEO. Instead, he hung on — and keeps hanging on — well past his sell-by date. – MacDailyNews, August 22, 2024 ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

With watchOS 11.5, Apple once again leads with a new Pride watch face. At this point, how many do we need? It feels like every update is more about social signaling than product improvement. We’ve got powerful health features, training tools, and performance updates… but the spotlight is always on Pride. Can every belief or identity get this kind of platform? Or just the ones Apple chooses? I miss when Apple led with innovation, not ideology. Pretty sure Steve Jobs would’ve kept the focus on the product. We now have enough Pride watch face and band iterations to wrap every Pride-wearing Apple Watch around the globe 8 times. Yes, I did the math (estimated). And more than the population of the world. Don’t forget the pregnant man emoji! Meanwhile Donald is on a golf course fudging his score. Sounds like you should switch to Windows since you are so offended that Cook isn’t kissing the fat ass of your favorite mob boss. Apple will be just fine, if it continues to act with respect and good faith with its suppliers and customers. Of course Timmy has always flown the gay pride flag, it’s who he is. Who cares. It doesn’t hurt anyone. The USA, however, is burning the bridges with all its former allies, and will be in recession or stagflation soon as the unilaterally stupid trade restrictions take effect. It will take years to recover. And no, neither Canada nor Greenland is ever going to become a US state. The insulting proposals to take over sovereign territories is beyond insulting. A cure needs to be found for the poor TDS sufferers. “… burning the bridges with all its former allies,…” Did you hear the great news? The Trump backed nationalist for Poland’s President won and beat out the favored globalist candidate. How much longer must we endure the caretaker which is Tim Cook? And becoming a broken record… Failed Car Program Failing Vision Pro program completely Missed AI and in rapid catch-up mode – if possible. Dude managed for 5-7 years too long at the helm. Need a visionary and innovator to lead the way and Cook ain’t it. Duh… Any suggestions? Because the best people are running their own companies and aren’t going to take a pay and power cut to run Apple. Jobs himself handpicked Cook to succeed him apparently without any consideration for him being a short-term “caretaker” CEO. The idea of the top person being the creative trailblazer is also a distortion. What’s important is for leaders to hire good lieutenants, delegate and allow for creative freedom. Don’t tell me there aren’t MANY brilliant people at Apple who for systemic reasons don’t have enough sway. Maybe Cook is the bottleneck but there’s no silver-bullet unicorn free agent out there. Craig Federighi would be a logical choice but who knows if he’s a good enough leader to run the entire organization. I heard from someone who met him that he’s an a-hole “do you know who I am?” but then again so was Jobs so it might be a good fit. Bringing an outsider who has no experience in Apple’s culture and structure could make things much worse, be careful what you wish for… Best to stay clear of the chaos that is the White House. MacDaily has become a Trump mouthpiece rather than a Mac-centric news site. People outside the USA can see what’s happening and now working around the chaos. The business performance of Cook in his worst year is substantially more successful AND SUSTAINABLE than the 6x bankrupt, 31x felon that this site worships. Speaking of waning influence … when Donald loses his last appeal for his attempts to take dictatorial power, including of course the power of taxation, away from the peoples’ representatives …. youll see manbaby melt down like the empty suit he is. All the reforms that could have been passed easily through the Republican legislature aren’t happening, because they are almost as inept as the Executive. So easily rescinded exec memos will be reversed in 3 years, and hopefully someone with fiscal responsibility will also undo the reckless spending AND reckless destruction of international trade. The USA has been severe crippled by the make-it-up-as-we-go diplomacy , the vindictive international diplomacy, and the now record debts this administration has presided over. Every nation in the world is now working hard to replace the USA as a trading partner, because nobody can trust the POTUS to keep his word. Awww… I bet you were so happy while the country under the senile idiot walking cadaver was in the WH. When he allowed MILLIONS of illegals in to country, did NOTHING to stop Russia to invade Ukraine, the economy in shambles while wasting BILLIONS in woke BS. Wrong. Biden, who actually nominated a competent staff which passed congressional reviews without controversy, urged congress to support Ukraine with weapons. Now Trump has halted the deals, which were profitable to the USA as well as successful in halting Russian ground advances, since Trump thinks he can bargain with his old buddy Putin. Turns out Trump can’t solve anything with “just a phone call”. Trump looks like an idiot, untrusted by both adversaries. Letting Putin become emperor of the former USSR with new allies North Korea and China would be the worst possible outcome of the situation. No US president has taken the necessary actions to strengthen US-European ties to ensure democracy survives in Eastern Europe. But feckless Donny has done a bang-up job destroying everyone’s confidence in the USA. Donny is happy to bomb Yemen but just doesn’t have the balls to fight communism or even help those countries who are. Or, in this case, since communism no longer exists, it is now Russian oligarchs’ fascism wrapped in a red flag. Something Donald has repeatedly claimed to admire. So much for the USA supporting the expansion of democracy in the world. Donny must really have enjoyed all those extra curricular activities at his pageants in Moscow, now he’s selling out the efforts of 4 generations of Americans who fought and died to prevent communist takeover of the world. Pathetic. After years of daily visits to MacDailyNews I am leaving it. Its zeal for the disgusting person at the White House is beyond endurance Good riddance Don’t see the “zeal” you describe. It’s invisible. I do see a lot of very warranted criticism of the current management of Apple. A cure needs to be found for the poor TDS sufferers. “People outside the USA can see what’s happening and now working around the chaos.” Did you hear the great news? The Trump backed nationalist for Poland’s President just won and beat out the favored globalist candidate. A cure needs to be found for the poor TDS sufferers. We have a president who virtually never thinks rationally, logically, or even in sequential steps. Nor can he fully comprehend causes and effects. His base of knowledge on virtually all subjects relating to governance and economics and world affairs is minimal. He lacks empathy, conscience, morality, and remorse for the wrongs he commits. He is a pathological liar. He has severe and destructive personality disorders-narcissism, sociopathy, and paranoia. He speaks at the level of a fifth-grader, at best. He can barely spell and do simple math. And his already limited mental capacity deteriorates with each passing day. No one has lasting influence with this idiot. The prior one actually had no capacity to think! LOL Too bad Biff Tannen has no such thing as a brain… Almost half of Americans are too blind and brainless to notice that evidence, alas! WTF?! Obama has been out of the White House for quite a while now. Why bring him up other than the fact he was controlling Sleepy Joe. Sorry, but there was an election last November, and the man you described is no longer President. A guy named Trump won, and he is really making strides. He’s correcting all of Biden’s disasters. “We have a president who virtually never thinks rationally bla bla bla…” Your diatribe is based on nothing as usual. What we have now is a President with the courage and tenacity to actually do something other than kick the can down the road and I am grateful. Newsweek online published a story that had this in it. ?”For the first time in over 20 years of polling, Right Direction EXCEEDS Wrong Track today,” Mark Mitchell, a Rasmussen pollster, wrote in a post to X,,,” The TDS is coming hard from this one! Tim Cook FAILED. He, who incredibly, took Apple from $1B (they called it bankrupt in 1998) to the first $1T, first $2T, first $3T co. in history, nearly wasted his entire legacy, by reducing his iQ to putting all his eggs in 1 basket, China. During C-19, China shut down factories for months, Apple desperately sought outsourcing to alternatives in India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam etc. but is it too late and are Westerners too closed-minded/short-sighted/immature/infantile/naive to not think China would retaliate by moving out of their country? Tim met TRUMP so many times, yet still is the most affected by tariffs, making Apple suffer the biggest drop in years, so what is the point of Tim being close to T and where is his/Apple’s leverage?! How useful is Tim now? Is his presidency as dormant/senile as Biden’s? Tim could have been fired by iSteve, who did elect him, since Tim did not use Apple’s mojo since iSteve 2011-10-05, but only used iteration, updates, not even upgrades on all products. Tim Cook feel ASLEEP at the wheel, failed AppleCar “Project Titan” (2000>20204-02-27), failed iWatch cam, failed Apple Mail, failed Apple social media, failed Search engine, failed HomePod, SmartHome, failed ai etc. Perhaps Tim’s biggest miss is having let go of JONY IVE? Apple losing its soul/dna/mojo for 14 years since iSteve left an ambience of zero interest for Jony, who left 2019-07. Now Jony sells LoveFrom (off’l; Neo-Bauhaus? ; ) unnamed but prototyped AI hardware (release 2027?) to OpenAI, when he could have made it for Apple, which in so many recent failures could’ve gained its next iPhone moment & saved its mojo! Will the AI neck device by Jony/Altman, as a first in series of OpenAI hardware, kill Apple/Meta/Goo/Msft/Xiaomi/Huawei like an unexpected tsunami, as they figured out the perfect balance for the elixir or alchemy of iDevices, that defies gravity & flummoxes all competitors that go the wrong way… Of course, it is certainly not a pride to keep contact with a dangerous liar who plays with his country and the world as if it were a Monopoly game… First apple needs to return to live WWDC event. No pre recorded presentation, everything needs to be a live demo. No more DEI representation at the WWDC. Put the people forward that actual have ideas and can lead a talk without a teleprompter. Apple has turned into a fake mockery of their old self. First step on the road to recovery is return to live people. No more social engineered fake presentations by clueless people chosen as a diversity check box. Whhaaaaattt? Greasing Taco Don’s paw with a million bucks doesn’t endear him to the convicted felon? Sucking up to him – but not enough, apparently? Maybe Timmy shouldn’t have expected loyalty from a guy who measures that in time-stamped dollars. Giving him a million bucks months ago; jeez, that expired just about immediately. Trump is trashing America “the brand” worldwide. Tourism to USA down, American product purchases are cratering in Europe. The world is pivoting away from American goods and services…. And i suspect it will continue whilst the Trump is at the helm. It’s making you “Think Stupid”. A take on Apple’s “Think Different”, as some MDN commenters have gone from that Apple philosophy, to not thinking at all, the TDS philosophy. Take a hard look at the ossified, glad-handing, CYA, elitist Board of Directors. There was a time when Board Members were intelligent, insightful, people who actually created new stuff. Now, at best, the Board Members just administrated stuff created ages ago by others. Caretaking is their stock in trade. Boring. I love the arm chair quarterbacks. We are so smart but the guy running Apple is so stupid. If you want to concentrate on stupid look no further than your convicted felon TACO baby bone spurs. You know when he is lying, his lips are moving. The world sees the shithole country you are becoming under his NAZI rule but you cannot see the forest for the trees. You will regret the day you alienated all your allies to cozy up to the dictators of the world. Just think how bad it has to be to piss off Canadians so bad that they boycott your country and products. Canadians will put up with just about anything yet you managed to screw them over.

This week: GameStop sinks after buying a boatload of Bitcoin, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF continues flying high, and Metaplanet makes a potentially risky sprint to amass a lot of BTC very quickly. GameStop Bitcoin flop GameStop found out this week that sinking half a billion dollars into Bitcoin isn’t universally flattering for share prices. The video game retailer spent $512 million on Bitcoin earlier this week, and the GME share price climbed as high as $35.78 the morning the BTC buy was announced. But it fell sharply the same day and still hasn’t recovered. GME closed Friday at $29.80—nearly 17% lower than that short-lived Wednesday peak. Now, don’t get us wrong: The revival of Trump tariff trouble has dealt a blow to crypto assets and securities alike. But GME was deep into its post-Bitcoin buy slide before an appeals court ruled that Trump’s tariff policies would remain in place. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter—the only Wall Streeter who still officially covers GME—told Barron’s that he’s not sold on GameStop being an attractive buy because of its Bitcoin ambitions. “It doesn't make sense to me that [GameStop] would be a 'better' steward of Bitcoin holdings,” he said. Pachter pointed out that the retailer is in no position to weather having a large portion of its treasury sitting in a volatile asset. For example, if Bitcoin were to drop 30% to about $70,000—a price it’s seen as recently as October—that would leave GME with an unrealized loss equal to its past four quarters of operating income. Interestingly, in April, Strive CEO Matt Cole highlighted purported infighting at GameStop over its Bitcoin strategy. But his advice that the company buy as much Bitcoin as it can, as quickly as possible, hasn’t aged particularly well. IBIT euphoria The BlackRock Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, pulled in more than $6.22 billion in net deposits this month to make this its best month on record—and that’s before the closing bell has rung on the last trading day in May. It helps, of course, that Bitcoin flirted with and then set a few new all-time high price marks. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out on X that it’s not a typical trajectory for a newly launched fund. “IBIT on fire lately, now has $72B in assets which ranks it 23rd overall, absolutely bonkers for a one-year-old,” he wrote. The fund has been so dominant that it’s accounted for 90% of all spot Bitcoin ETF flows in the past month. As a group, the twelve ETFs account for more than 6% of the circulating 19.8 million Bitcoin supply. But at $70.2 billion, IBIT accounts for 55% of the total $126 billion worth of assets under management by the issuers. But the milestone underscores what critics like Rep. Mike Flood (R-NE) say is a unique risk: There are only four different custodians used by the issuers to hold the Bitcoin that backs ETF shares. “This concern is amplified by the fact that none of the custodians are banks,” he wrote in a statement in February. At the time, he cited the SEC’s recently rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121. Despite the rule being rescinded, there hasn’t been much change in the lineup. Many of the issuers—including BlackRock, Grayscale, WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, and Valkyrie—use Coinbase Custody. The Invesco and Galaxy fund uses Galaxy as its custodian, but some of that BTC gets routed to Coinbase as a sub-custodian. BlackRock added Anchorage Digital as an additional custodian for its IBIT and ETHA funds in April. Fidelity self-custodies the BTC backing shares of its Fidelity Bitcoin Trust, or FBTC, which is the next-largest fund. Metaplanet sprints—but at what cost? Japanese Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet is running, not walking, towards its goal of acquiring 10,000 BTC by the end of the year. That’s over $1 billion worth at the current price. With another buy earlier this week, Metaplanet now holds 7,800 Bitcoin. But that has, very literally, come at a cost to the company: Its debt-to-equity ratio has climbed to 8.43, according to Reuters. For context, the same ratio for Strategy—the company it’s trying to emulate—was 0.24 as of March 2025. There aren’t many comparisons we could make that would leave Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin juggernaut looking conservative after acquiring some $60 billion worth of BTC, but this is one of them. If Metaplanet’s game plan works out, then it could amplify returns for investors. But if Bitcoin tanks, then it could blow up spectacularly.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs see $358 mln exit – First outflow after 10-day inflow streak ends

Fidelity and Grayscale ETFs lead redemptions, while BlackRock and ETH funds maintain strong momentum. After a strong 10-day run of consistent inflows totaling over $4.26 billion, U.S. spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs faced a sharp reversal with $346.8 million in net outflows as per Farside Investors. This marks the largest daily withdrawal since 11th March, highlighting renewed investor caution. On a day marked by significant outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the exit with $166 million pulled out. This was followed closely by Grayscale’s GBTC, which saw $107.5 million in net redemptions. Several other funds, including those from Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck, also experienced capital flight. Interestingly, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) went against the wider market movement by drawing in $125 million in net inflows. This extended its impressive 34-day streak of daily inflows, with its total inflow nearing $49 billion and assets under management now topping $70 billion. In contrast to the recent downturn in Bitcoin ETF flows, spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs continued to attract investor interest, recording $92 million in net inflows on the 29th of May alone. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) recorded more than $50 million in fresh inflows, raising its total to $4.5 billion since launching in July 2024. Seeing this, ETF Store President Nate Geraci had mentioned that this activity coincides with a broader trend, as over the past five weeks, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted more than $9 billion, while gold ETFs have seen nearly $3 billion in outflows. With Bitcoin’s price slipping from $111K to around $105,615, the recent market correction may be fueling the shift in ETF momentum. The evolving market cycle appears to be increasingly driven by growing institutional involvement, particularly following the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. This shift has reshaped investor sentiment and market dynamics. Reflecting on this trend, CryptoQuant founder Ji Young Ju acknowledged a misjudged bear market prediction made in early 2025, only to witness Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high just two months later. Young Ju put it best when he said, “It feels like it’s time to throw out that cycle theory. New liquidity sources and volume are becoming more uncertain, signalling a transition as the Bitcoin market merges with TradFi.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is reportedly continuing to add data centers after opening a cluster of them in Mexico earlier this year. The company is building new facilities in Chile, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, AWS CEO Matt Garman said, per a Friday (May 30) Bloomberg News report. As it works to increase its capacity to power artificial intelligence, AWS also aims to expand its stock of Nvidia’s latest semiconductor, the GB200, according to the report. “Demand is strong,” Garman said. PYMNTS reported in April that Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at AWS, said in a LinkedIn post that the company continues to see “strong demand for both generative AI and foundational workloads.” At the time of that report, AWS had 114 availability zones and plans for 12 more in 36 global regions that serve 245 countries and territories. An AWS spokesperson told PYMNTS in April that availability zones refer to a cluster of one or more discrete data centers. AWS does not disclose its actual data center count. In January, AWS said it plans to invest at least $11 billion in Georgia to expand infrastructure to support cloud computing and AI. “AWS’s ongoing infrastructure investments across the United States demonstrate our relentless commitment to powering our customers’ digital innovation through cloud and AI technologies,” Roger Wehner, vice president of economic development at AWS, said at the time in a press release. The server market is expected to hit $1.3 trillion by 2028, according to a January report by IDC. The biggest builders of data centers include Amazon, Microsoft and Google Cloud as well as data center companies Digital Realty and Equinix. AI data centers are needed because traditional data centers and power grids are struggling to accommodate the intense computational power, data storage and energy required by AI. It was reported May 21 that one of OpenAI’s future data centers secured $11.6 billion in funding commitments. The center, which is being constructed in the Texas community of Abilene, is slated for completion next year and is set to become the ChatGPT maker’s largest. In March, xAI and Nvidia joined a $30 billion AI infrastructure project called the AI Infrastructure Fund, which is backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and MGX.

Title: The New Safe Haven: How High-Net-Worth Investors Are Rethinking Liquidity In 2025

Time Published: 2025-05-30T19:15:06Z

In times of stress, wealth always chases after safety, but in 2025, the definition of “safe” has become much murkier. The investment landscape for high-net-worth (HNW) investors is undergoing a significant transformation, and the definition of safe assets is being re-evaluated. In a world marked by geopolitical instability and unpredictable market responses, liquidity is increasingly viewed as a measure of control, autonomy and psychological reassurance. Investors are quietly rewriting their liquidity playbooks, showcasing a shift in wealth psychology. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. U.S. Treasuries have long been the go-to choice during times of crisis. However, given recent events, even this asset class is being tested, and the long-standing fortress is showing some cracks. Once considered a safe corner of the market, it has become a battleground for hedge funds engaged in “basis trading”—speculative bets on price gaps between Treasuries and their futures. These trades depend heavily on repo funding, which can dry up suddenly in market stress. When that happens, funds can be forced to unwind positions en masse, potentially triggering liquidity spirals. This played out in March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a global dash for cash and repo markets abruptly tightened, forcing hedge funds to unwind their positions. This led to increased volatility and liquidity strains in the Treasury market. To try to stabilize, the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented emergency measures, including large-scale purchases of Treasury securities. Today’s market faces similar worries. The issue isn’t just volatility—it’s structural fragility and the interconnectedness of financial institutions, which can result in systemic risks, especially during sudden liquidity withdrawal. The Fed is concerned about the web of dependencies connecting hedge funds, clearinghouses and banks via the Treasury repo market. Still, Treasuries aren’t dead, and it’s too early to write them off. Short-duration T-bills, in particular, remain a preferred instrument among risk-aware investors because they strike the combination of traits that many HNWIs crave: relatively low risk, reasonable yield and—most importantly—liquidity. In a world where things can go sideways overnight, the ability to exit positions swiftly and without disruption is valued more than incremental returns. If T-bills represent cautious optimism, Bitcoin is starting to reflect something else: digital autonomy. Cryptocurrencies are no longer a niche domain for risk-happy technophiles. Bitcoin is finding its way into the portfolios of younger HNW investors who view it less as a speculative instrument and more as a tool of financial independence. In an era of bank bail-ins, frozen accounts and political uncertainty, Bitcoin offers psychological insurance—a way to preserve access to one’s funds independently of centralized banking systems. For many, it represents a safety net in a world where financial infrastructure feels increasingly fragile. Moreover, the credibility of cryptocurrencies as an asset class has grown considerably in recent times. Bitcoin is now held in ETFs and on major custodial platforms like BlackRock and Fidelity, reinforcing its legitimacy as an institutionally accepted asset. Notable regulatory milestones such as MiCA in the EU and ETF approvals in the U.S. are reframing crypto as a “compliant asset.” This is a big boost to their appeal among conservative HNWIs. Crypto as a whole still remains a volatile asset class. But, in a way, that volatility is understood and accepted these days. Bitcoin’s appeal persists because what rattles people more is not volatility but the lack of access. Being unable to move one’s money in a moment of stress is the greatest fear that transcends crypto and touches every asset class right now. In that regard, cryptocurrencies offer an increasingly popular alternative option. That said, most institutional capital continues to flow into Bitcoin—and to a lesser degree, Ethereum. But not the broader crypto ecosystem. The narrative of legitimacy appears to be mostly confined to these two assets for now. Gold has also re-entered the spotlight, but not for the usual reasons—this time, the focus is not on inflation fears and the metal’s traditional role as a hedge. Gold’s demand today is driven by the desire to de-dollarize and mitigate geopolitical exposure. Central banks around the world are increasing their reserves, seeking insulation from financial shocks and growing geopolitical tensions. Many countries now view gold as a neutral reserve asset that can be used to insulate their economies from U.S. monetary policy and reduce reliance on the dollar in international transactions. High-net-worth investors are also taking note of this trend, choosing gold as a store of value not just to diversify, but to reduce exposure to global fiat-driven volatility. Gold offers something that other assets cannot: a tangible, non-digital store of value that operates outside the influence of any single currency or government. Unlike Bitcoin, you can’t email it to yourself across borders, but in terms of psychological safety, it still holds a unique place. In an increasingly digitized and interconnected world, gold reminds people that some wealth should be physically untouchable to feel permanent and reliable. It’s as much about emotional security as it is about portfolio strategy. What all of these asset shifts have in common is a growing recognition that liquidity is not just a technical metric, it is also an emotional comfort zone. Investors no longer ask, “Can I sell this?” They ask, “Can I get out if things go bad, before everyone else?” How quickly and predictably they can do so when market conditions deteriorate is a key factor up for consideration these days. Recent events have demonstrated just how quickly liquidity can vanish. From the UK’s LDI pension crisis to Silicon Valley Bank’s overnight implosion, the lesson is clear: in a digital, interconnected world, liquidity crunches arrive with little to no warning. Not because of poor asset selection, but because too many people hit the “sell” button at the same time, and the markets just can’t handle it. This results in a new set of investor priorities. Access, execution flexibility and operational resilience now rank alongside—or above—yield and long-term appreciation in wealth management discussions. So what does this mean for advisors, private banks and family offices? It means that traditional approaches to portfolio construction are no longer sufficient. Today’s clients are asking deeper questions about asset behavior under stress, and they expect precise, actionable answers. In response to this changing mindset, asset managers should keep several strategies in mind. First: segmentation matters. Advisors need to start viewing portfolios not just in terms of risk and reward, but also in terms of exit timelines. What can be liquidated in a day? A week? A quarter? Segment portfolios by liquidity tiers to offer greater clarity and control. That’s how investors are learning to think now. Second: diversify not just across assets, but across liquidity types. Investment-grade corporate bonds might carry more credit risk than Treasuries, for example, but they offer alternatives for those seeking yield without locking up capital long-term. Third: embrace transparency and offer real-time monitoring tools. Dashboards that show bid-ask spreads, margin call thresholds and funding market stress aren’t just for CIOs anymore—clients want to be able to see them too. In 2025, liquidity is no longer just a technical detail. It’s a board-level issue. It influences asset selection, client satisfaction and, ultimately, institutional resilience. The biggest takeaway? Liquidity must be built before it’s needed. In volatile periods, buffers are tested, often brutally and with no warning, so make sure to construct them while there’s relative calm. Stress test everything, and remember: the true mark of safety isn’t an asset’s label or historical reputation—it’s how it behaves when the music stops. Investors and institutions must take the initiative to prepare for liquidity shocks, because when the stress hits, the window to act is often measured in minutes, not days.

Title: Refused Debate Festival Boycott in Supporting Palestine
URL: https://loudwire.com/refused-debate-effectiveness-festival-boycott-support-palestine/
Time Published: 2025-05-30T18:40:14Z
Full Content:
Refused admittedly considered boycotting some upcoming festival appearances after learning that one of the financial backers had invested in Israeli Cyber Security amidst the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. But rather than doing so, they detailed some of the thought provoking conversations that took place in deciding how to approach what to do in trying to share their support for Palestine amidst reports from Al Jazeera of starving citizens due to Israel's blockade from aid. The veteran rockers announced that they would be embarking on a farewell tour this year and that includes a number of appearances at music festivals around the world. The band revealed their initial gut reaction to drop off an unnamed festival after learning that the event had a financial investor that didn't align with their political view and had.dealings in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict. But, when reaching out to the festival to share their concerns, they were confronted with discussion of some of the problematic players that have a hand in other parts of their business. That led to a multi-layered discussion about how to proceed, the effectiveness of the band boycotting the festival and what the band could actually do to best show their support for the starving Palestinians that inspired their reaction. As stated, rather than immediately acting on the impulse to boycott select festivals they were playing that had a perceived problematic financial backer, Refused reached out to festival organizers that led to a larger discussion on how to best address their concerns. The band shared a detailed account on social media about some of the discussions that were had, which can be read below: So a week ago we found out that some of the festival we're playing this summer are backed by an entertainment conglomerate called Superstruct in which a bad bad actor named KKR is part owner. KKR invests in Israeli Cyber Security among other fucked up things. Our first instinct was to immediately jump ship, to boycott. We communicated this to the festivals and the organizers wrote back saying they shared our values and felt like we did, that they loved what they did and were proud of the festivals they'd created, that the majority of their audience would be sympathetic to our position and that they were gutted that bastards like KKR had bought into Superstruct after they'd started working with them, staining their life's work by extension. One of them also questioned our other associations (cheeky, but he was right), saying that Live Nation are behind some other festivals and shows we're playing, one of whose owners are Blackrock, a multinational heavily invested in weapons manufacturing, and that our music is on Spotify which donated money to Donald Trump's inauguration and also invests in military AI. The scum of the earth basically. These festivals also told us they wanted us to make noise for the Palestinian cause, one of them even offered to give us a large amount of money just to donate to pro-Palestinian organizations. So, the conundrum became: Boycotting these festivals would make us feel good about ourselves, the band's legacy wouldn't been tarnished by association with these disgusting companies. It would feel nice, but it wouldn't do any good; Being morally superior doesn't put food in the mouths of starving Palestinians. Also it wouldn't make headlines; We're not top billing on these festivals because, although we have a strong following within a specific subgenre of heavy music, we're not a huge band. Some Swedish leftists sitting out a few festivals wouldn't raise many eyebrows. We've mulled this over and although there's a strong argument for taking a stand against KKR and this development of amoral private equeity and hedge funds buying into the arts because it's non-controversial and comparatively safe, it would be naive to think our boycott would even register for them. Rather the opposite, if people like that knew what we talked about on stage they would rather have us stay home, and with the charred bodies of Palestinians burned alive stacking up in the concentration camp/graveyard that Gaza has become, we have decided to make some noise, to go meet our people, to celebrate the resistance and raise money for the Palestinian cause this summer. To us, it it the right thing to do, to get out there and be a thorn in the side of zionists, fascists, venture capitalists and to fan the flames of discontent together with our bright, informed comrades all over Europe. A lot of you have already bought tickets and are expecting us, so we'd love to get suggestions from local organizations and activists we could work with in all the countries and cities we're playing. FREE PALESTINE!!! The band continued their discussion in the comments section of their post. "These kinds of deliberations are not new to us. In our late teens, coming out of the DIY underground, we were obsessed with ending our involvement in systemic oppression through the power of boycott, through spreading awareness of the human rights abuses in the countries that produced the consumer objects our generation coveted, the environmental impact of eating meat, the horrific abuses carried out by the USA in South America in order for us to have cheap bananas," they shared. "These were all hot topics in the leftist punk underground at the time (and if we're being self-critical for a moment, it's obvious now that we were deluded in thinking that creating leftist utopias outside of the mainstream would achieve the great system change we were aiming for. Instead we left the parliaments to the neo-nazis we used to fight in the streets [Antifa did the lion's share of the fighting, but once or twice we fought them as a band, though most of the time we were too outnumbered and out-menaced to do shit], who gladly put on suits and toned their rhetoric down in order to gain power, an endeavor in which they succeeded beyond our wildest nightmares, as we can see all over the west right now)," Refused added. They continued, "It took us uneducated working class morons a while to learn what many picked up during two or three classes at uni: that all of us in the west are complicit in the exploitation and subjugation of a huge part of the non-western world and while we worked hard to rid ourselves of this complicity by becoming incredibly conscious consumers, we slowly started to understand the immense machine of oppression that Europe and the US have constituted from the 1500s to this day, a fact that made our twenty-something consumer choices in the north of Sweden seem pretty insignificant." From there the group offered, "This didn't deter us, but it definitely put us in check. What we quickly realized though was that we were always gonna be a gateway band. The underground community is a beautiful place, but after having seen the hundredth band preaching about the evils of capitalism or organized religion to a crowd of people dressed exactly the same as them, reading the same books, listening to the same bands, you start to wonder what the point really is: do we want to be right or do we want change? Refused was always a different animal than the pure, DIY or die-bands, and we did things they could not. That was kind of the point, to try and bring these ideas into the light." READ MORE: Bands Who Broke Up + Ones Who Reunited in 2024 "The centre-right government of Sweden gave us an award once (thank you @psl) and although we fucking hated their guts, we accepted the award just so we could stand right there in the corridors of power and ridicule them, humiliate them to their faces," they recalled. "There were minor deals with minor devils made, but through it all, we reached kids who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise: we turned a lot of people on to vegetarianism and veganism through our music, and there's no counting the amount of people who have come up to us and said that our songs sowed the first seed of what grew to be a radical political life. It's what we're most proud of, the many activists, teachers, human rights lawyers, doctors and environmentalists for whom we were a companion (or even a stepping stone) on the way to a life of serving the greater good. They didn't preach to the converted, they didn't freak out about bar codes on CDs, they actually went out there and did shit," continued the band. In conclusion, they stated, "I guess what we're trying to say is, these choices are not easy for us but we take them very seriously, and we've driven ourselves mad trying to bat a hundred in a crooked game. Which is why our next project will be DIY, more on that later." As stated, Refused are in the midst of their farewell tour. The band kicked off a North American run earlier this spring. They'll start up their next tour leg on June 13 at the Nova Rock festival in Nickelsdorf, Austria with European dates booked through Aug. 22 in Vilar De Mouros, Portugal. More dates in the U.K. and Europe will follow in October with the band currently booked through Oct. 12 in Munchen, Germany.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs See $9 Billion Inflows Amid Escalating Shift Away From Gold

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Recent trends in the Bitcoin ETFs market reveal a significant shift in investor sentiment, with funds flowing into BTC exchange-traded funds while gold-backed funds experience notable outflows. According to a Bloomberg report, US Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $9 billion in inflows in the past five weeks, primarily driven by BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). In contrast, gold-backed funds have seen outflows exceeding $2.8 billion during the same time frame. This divergence in investor behavior comes as easing trade tensions have diminished demand for traditional safe havens like gold. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a viable alternative store of value amid growing concerns about US fiscal stability. Furthermore, the market’s leading cryptocurrency reached a record high of $111,980, buoyed by favorable regulatory developments and rising macroeconomic uncertainty. Although gold remains up more than 25% this year, it has retreated from its recent peaks, currently trading approximately $190 below its all-time high. Analysts suggest that this rotation towards Bitcoin ETFs indicates a growing acceptance of the cryptocurrency as a legitimate hedge within investment portfolios. Christopher Wood, global equity strategist at Jefferies, expressed optimism for both gold and Bitcoin, noting their effectiveness as hedges against currency debasement in the G7 nations. However, skeptics argue that Bitcoin’s notorious volatility still undermines its position as a true safe haven. Historical instances of macroeconomic shocks have shown Bitcoin falling sharply alongside other risk assets. Yet, some experts believe that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature gives it an advantage over gold in times of financial system risks. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, highlighted Bitcoin’s dual role as a hedge against both private sector risks, such as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, and government-related concerns, including the stability of the US Treasury. Kendrick pointed out that recent threats to Federal Reserve (Fed) independence, alongside tariff escalations and broader concerns about US policy credibility, further bolster Bitcoin’s appeal. In addition to these factors, Bitcoin appears to be shedding its previous reputation as merely a tech-adjacent risk asset. Dilin Wu, a research strategist at Pepperstone, noted that Bitcoin’s intraday correlation with major indices like the Nasdaq, as well as with the dollar and gold, has significantly decreased. The backdrop of growing fiscal strain has intensified the discourse surrounding these assets. Moody’s recently downgraded the US from its last triple-A credit rating, citing concerns over ballooning deficits and national debt. This downgrade aligns the US with other ratings agencies, including Fitch and S&P Global, which already rate the country below the top tier. Despite the recent surge in Bitcoin’s popularity, gold continues to outperform on a year-to-date basis, boasting gains of about 25% compared to Bitcoin’s rise of approximately 15%.

Title: STEPHEN MOORE: Why Are Trump’s Regulators Fighting A War On Coal?
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/05/30/opinion-why-are-trumps-regulators-fighting-a-war-on-coal-stephen-moore/
Time Published: 2025-05-30T14:55:17Z
Full Content:
In one of the most convoluted lawsuits of all time, a cabal of state attorney generals and the Federal Trade Commission are now accusing financial firms Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard of monopolistic behavior. The complaint asserts that these firms bought coal stocks and then helped impose radical environmental restrictions on the companies they partially own, so that coal output would fall and the price of coal would rise. The lawsuit alleges that this strategy generated “supra-competitive profits” for those investors. If your head is spinning around trying to make heads or tails out of this loopy conspiracy theory – it should be. If it were true, then these asset managers must be capable of pulling off the equivalent of a triple-bank shot in billiards. They allegedly invested in coal companies, then partnered together with climate change groups to drive coal companies bankrupt, which then drove up the price of coal. If that tactic worked to make money, Kelloggs would stop making Frosted Flakes so that the price of the last boxes on the grocery store shelves sold for $100. (RELATED: STEPHEN MOORE: Biden’s Student Loan Forgiveness Made Defaults Skyrocket) What’s laughable about this lawsuit is that the Vanguards of the world didn’t need to conspire to restrict coal production: that’s what Democrats like Joe Biden and the environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, have been doing for years. They are the ones who are guilty of any conspiracy to rip off consumers, bankrupt an American industry, put blue collar workers out of jobs, and raise energy prices. They ran multi-million dollar campaigns to “kill coal” by advancing a “net zero” fossil fuel energy policy on America with the explicit goal of shutting down coal plants. Their plan – at least temporarily – wildly succeeded. Over the past 15 years, 63 major coal companies have closed their mining operations. And just where exactly are these Supra-profits” that the FTC and the state lawyers are asserting? It’s true that for a short while in 2022 and 2023 coal and oil profits soared as a result of Biden’s war on energy. Maybe this isn’t taught in the top law schools, but money management firms with trillions of dollars of asset like Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard don’t invest in companies and then try to steer them into bankruptcy. That’s a money-losing proposition every time – except in Mel Brooks’ famous broadway show The Producers in which two scamsters conspire to make a show that would intentionally flop. That was a make-believe comedy. This lawsuit is too, but no one is laughing. Even the claim that the three firms on trial here worked with environmental groups to reduce coal output is highly suspect. It is true that some of the large investment companies promoted the radical climate agenda? And just like Bud Light, they paid a hefty price for their political activism. Unleash Prosperity – a group I cofounded – has done the seminal analysis over the last several years on how investment firms voted on radical green agenda shareholder resolutions dealing with among other things shutting down coal. It is true that State Street has been a strong and persistent supporter of some of these shareholder resolutions aimed at advancing the radical anti-coal green agenda. But Vanguard almost never votes in favor of resolutions hostile to the industry. And Blackrock in recent years has sworn off the ESG investing fad. So they all can’t all be guilty here since their shareholder activism runs in opposite directions! Apparently, their real crime was owning coal stocks at all. If this lawsuit were to succeed, then three of America’s largest investors would pay a giant penalty for that sin. The biggest loser will be the coal industry itself, as a guilty verdict would chase billions of dollars of desperately investment out of the coal industry for many years which will mean coal miners will lose their jobs. This may explain why many of the state attorney generals from coal producing states like Kentucky and Ohio didn’t join this flimsy case. Sadly, Andrew Ferguson, the chair of the FTC, may do more to destroy the coal industry than all of the radical climate change groups put together. But wait. Trump has run for president and signed executive orders to support King Coal in America. He wants an American coal renaissance. How can that happen when the FTC stands ready to sue these company’s investors if they dare make “supra profits?” Sounds like if Trump wants to make American coal great again, he might want to make a call over to his handpicked FTC chair Andrew Ferguson and get him to cease and desist.

Title: SEC clarifies proof-of-stake isn’t ‘security’ – Road clear for spot ETH ETF staking?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/sec-clarifies-proof-of-stake-isnt-security-road-clear-for-spot-eth-etf-staking/
Time Published: 2025-05-30T14:00:52Z
Full Content:
There’s only one obstacle for ETH ETF to clear before staking approval. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Division of Corporation Finance, clarified that some staking activities are not security transactions. Commenting on the directive, Commissioner Hester Pierce acknowledged it as a ‘welcome clarity’ for firms offering staking services. “Today’s statement provides welcome clarity for stakers and “staking-as-a-service” providers in the United States. The Division’s statement is applicable to persons who self-stake certain covered crypto assets on a proof-of-stake or delegated proof-of-stake network.” This meant that PoS systems like Ethereum [ETH], Solana [SOL], Cardano, and others are non-securities. Besides, the guidance applied to self and custodial (delegated) staking, including liquid staking, according to Rebecca Rettig, Jito Labs’ legal officer. “This bodes very well for other types of non-custodial staking activity, including liquid staking.” Compared to the Biden-era regime, this was a massive shift. The Biden-era SEC fined Kraken exchange $30M, claiming that its staking service constituted unregistered security offerings. Now, under the new Trump-era SEC, offering such service doesn’t need registration with the agency. This followed a similar update on PoW (proof-of-work) or mining-based blockchains like Bitcoin. Put differently, both PoW and PoS arrangements aren’t securities offerings. This begs the question: Will the agency greenlight the much-sought U.S. spot ETH ETF staking? ETF Store’s Nate Geraci noted that the only remaining hurdle was the IRS tax clarification. “Another hurdle cleared for staking in spot ETH ETFs. Now need clarity from IRS on how staking revenue handled in grantor trust (which is the structure used for spot ETH ETFs).” In Q2, ETH staking saw renewed interest, growing from 33M ETH to over 34M ETH, with an average annualized return of 3%. If approved, ETF buyers could enjoy these staking rewards without worrying about the complicated ways of staking individual ETH or the risks involved. So, staking rewards could improve demand for products apart from relying on price appreciation alone. In fact, most ETH ETF holders were underwater, according to Glassnode. “The average investor in the BlackRock and Fidelity Ethereum ETFs are now substantially underwater on their position, holding an unrealized loss of approximately -21% on average.” Source: Glassnode That said, the positive news didn’t stir the ETH price. In fact, the altcoin’s spot market demand declined further, as shown by the downward movement on the spot CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta). But, the Open Interest (OI) remained elevated, suggesting high speculative interest and market leverage. Source: Coinalyze Unless ETH’s pot market demand improves, the high leverage could complicate the rally and heighten liquidation risks. At press time, the altcoin was valued at $2.62K and has been consolidating between $2.3K and $2.7K in May.

One answer, and an increasingly popular one at that, is: pivot to crypto—or more specifically, become a crypto treasury company. The previously unknown online gambling marketer SharpLink Gaming did just that earlier this week, when it announced it had raised $425 million in investment to establish an Ethereum treasury. It was a notable departure from the more common route of building a Bitcoin treasury, with Ethereum being the second largest and most liquid crypto asset on the market next to Bitcoin. As part of the raise, Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin joined SharpLink’s board of directors. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) Before going all in on Ethereum, SharpLink had a market capitalization of around $2 million, trading for just over $2 per share and was just weeks ago dangerously close to being delisted from the Nasdaq for falling below the $1 per share minimum. On Tuesday, everything changed: The company’s stock jumped 420% to $35 per share, with a market cap above $23 million. It’s a strategy reminiscent of, well, Strategy. Michael Saylor’s company, formerly known as MicroStrategy, laid down the blueprint for how this works: you buy up a bunch of Bitcoin (or, in Sharplink’s case, Ethereum), and your stock functions as a proxy bet on the crypto asset. Shares in a crypto treasury company will often trade at a premium to the digital assets because, for the average investor, it’s much easier to buy stock than fiddle around with crypto directly. Before being worth $101.76 billion and amassing a Bitcoin treasure chest worth over $60 billion, MicroStrategy was floundering at a double-digit share price as a fairly average business intelligence software solutions company. MicroStrategy then bought $425 million in Bitcoin in the fall of 2020. The same amount in Ethereum that SharpLink plans to buy. Back in 2020, MicroStrategy came out of nowhere. Just like SharpLink did Tuesday. So what is SharpLink, and where did it come from? SharpLink was co-founded in 2019 by now-CEO Rob Phythian and former COO Chris Nicholas, who left the company in 2024. Tori Roberts joined the team in 2021 as vice president, in charge of affiliate marketing with Robert DeLucia following in 2022 as chief financial officer. According to the official SharpLink site, there are also three independent directors in Leslie Bernhard, Robert Gutkowski, and Obie McKenzie that make up the board of directors, chaired by Phythian himself. Bernhard has previously served as a director and chairman in multiple Nasdaq-listed companies, Gutkowski helped seal a $486 million cable distribution deal, and McKenzie was a managing director at BlackRock. So, it appears at least, the directors are a capable bunch. Put simply, SharpLink Gaming uses technology to help match sports betting companies with fans. According to its LinkedIn page, the company now uses an AI tool that collects and analyzes behavioral insights on users, pushes relevant betting content onto those users, and converts them into paying customers. Trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker SBET, it currently sits at a market cap of $55 million trading at nearly $80 per share, already doubling its price since Tuesday, according to data on Trading View. If you bought SBET stock five years ago, though, you’re still down around 67%. The company’s revenues declined 26.1% from 2023 to 2024, last year's financial report showed, with cash on hand decreasing by 42.2% to $1.43 million. That said, it saw a positive net income of $10 million, a notable rise from a net loss of $14.2 million. In 2024, SharpLink Gaming sold two of its businesses for $22.5 million, used most of these proceeds to write off outstanding debts, and completed a domestic merger that changed the company from an Israeli LLC to a Delaware corporation, according to a company release. In July 2024, the board of directors started a formal review process to “evaluate strategic alternatives” that would “drive growth and create and maximize value” for stockholders. It appears that in this process, the board of directors started to consider cryptocurrency more seriously. In February 2025, the company announced that it acquired a 10% equity stake in Armchair Enterprises Limited, a company that owns CryptoCasino.com, as part of a strategy to become the “first Nasdaq-listed company focused on crypto gaming.” “We carefully evaluated more than two dozen compelling opportunities,” SharpLink CEO Phythian said in a release, referencing the board’s review process. “And [we] determined that the combination of market expansion, cost efficiency, security and player demand makes crypto gaming one of the most promising growth opportunities in the online gaming industry today.” But this initial crypto pivot wasn’t enough to prevent the price of SBET stock from dropping 60.8%, from $5.75 to $2.26, over the next two and a half months. During this period, SharpLink announced a reverse stock split to stay above Nasdaq’s stock price minimum requirement of $1. And then a $4.5 million public stock offering in order to regain “compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum requirement for total stockholders’ equity.” Things were existential for SharpLink. But that was before the Ethereum treasury strategy led its stock price to surge 420% on Tuesday to $35 a share—and now more than doubling that. Rob Phythian co-founded SharpLink and today serves as its CEO and chairman of the board of directors. And now he’s the Ethereum Michael Saylor. Pythian founded SharpLink after he spent almost nine and a half years as CEO of SportsHub Technologies, a company that created games and apps for sports gaming sites. Prior to that, he’d also co-founded SportsData LLC, a sports experience creator, and served as its CEO and president. During his time at SportsHub, he was named by a local business publication as one of the top 100 people to know in Minnesota. Phythian was hailed a pioneer and a “sports tech godfather.” One former business partner told Decrypt that he has great respect for Pythian. "I worked with Rob maybe 10 or 15 years ago on [an unnamed] skill gaming venture,” Matthew Warneford, CEO of Roblox game creator Dubit, told Decrypt. “Rob's a great guy, very smart, and good to work with. Have nothing but positive things to say." By 2023, now CEO of SharpLink, Phythian and his company started to embrace artificial intelligence. In a guest blog post for Sportico, he outlined a future where AI could help personalize the sport fan experience, while also batting away concerns that AI outputs are too generic as he believed that the tide was turning. A year later, it was clear that the company needed a new direction, and Pythian led the company through its shift to crypto gaming. And now he’s leading SharpLink into its next phase as the Microstrategy of Ethereum. The question now is: Will it work? If Phythian follows Saylor’s playbook, then the next step will be to sell shares, or debt against those shares, to buy more Ethereum. Then rise and repeat. That likely bodes well for ETH—and perhaps even SBET shareholders. But what it means for SharpLink as a business is an open question. It’s a gamble, but one that so far appears to be paying off.

Title: Why Ethereum’s 45.98% Q2 returns might just be the start of what’s next

Stay tuned as ETH looks to extend its outperformance and challenge new highs. Though fleeting, a sharp divergence on the 29th of May threw a curveball at the crypto crowd. Ethereum [ETH] surged 1.87% intraday, breaking out to a fresh three-month high at $2,791. Meanwhile, Bitcoin [BTC] took a counter move, dipping 2.01%. According to AMBCrypto, it underscored a rare ETH-BTC decoupling that’s turning heads on the order books: Could this subtle divergence be the spark that ignites Ethereum’s next power rally? Q2 has been nothing short of a flex for Ethereum. It has nearly doubled returns, leaving Bitcoin’s 30.2% gains eating dust, despite BTC notching fresh all-time highs. Still, most of the liquidity has been BTC-bound, with ETH grinding sideways for weeks. But that script may be flipping. The ETH/BTC pair is perking up, printing a breakout structure that mirrors early May setup. Over the last four sessions, the ratio has climbed close to 6%, while Bitcoin has dropped 5.05% on the week. Ethereum, on the other hand, has only slipped 1.06%, showing notable relative strength. According to AMBCrypto, it is the kind of setup that often front-runs a rotation play. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) Case in point: Back in early May, ETH broke free from a sluggish range and ripped 50% higher in under a week, while Bitcoin chopped sideways near $103k. As May comes to a close, Bitcoin is once again caught in a tight trading range, potentially setting the stage for Ethereum to capitalize on its relative strength. Ethereum’s divergence from Bitcoin wasn’t a coincidence. Instead, it’s backed by some serious flow action. On the 29th of May, while BTC ETFs hemorrhaged nearly $340 million in outflows, Ethereum ETFs raked in a solid $91.9 million. Fidelity and Bitwise both saw fresh inflows, bucking the trend set by Bitcoin’s heavy BlackRock IBIT ETF-driven inflows. Meanwhile, whales (holding 1,000+ ETH) are loading up fast over the past four days, perfectly syncing their moves with Bitcoin’s recent slump. Source: Glassnode On both the charts and the chain, Ethereum looks primed to capitalize on another rotation window, setting the stage for a potential mega rally against BTC’s volatility. As Q2 wraps up, with ETH historically outpacing BTC by a wide margin, all eyes should stay locked on Ethereum, as it looks like it’s gearing up to deliver more alpha for savvy investors.

Title: How Institutional Investors Are Ramping Up Climate Investments In 2025

ByMindy Lubber ByMindy Lubber, Contributor. In today’s investment landscape, large institutional investors are increasingly matching capital with a clean energy future. A recent Mercer Investment study of 74 large asset owners-- with more than $2 trillion in assets--found that 70% now integrate responsible investment goals into their strategies, a seven percentage jump from last year. Despite shifting rhetoric in some corners of the market, momentum continues to build. The Mercer study underscores this powerful trend—a growing majority are not only setting clear responsible investment goals, they’re also increasing how much they allocate to those investments. Responsible Investment Goals Now Central to Portfolio Strategy From New York to Oregon to Ontario, asset owners-- the investors that include pension funds, endowments, insurers, sovereign wealth funds, and wealth managers--are making clear that managing climate risk and seizing investment opportunities are central to long-term fiduciary duty. In 2025, that’s translating into investors pouring more capital into climate solutions at scale, reporting progress on portfolio emissions, and supporting public policies that enable a future-ready economy. Major Pension Funds Raise Expectations for Asset Managers Across North America, public officials and investment leaders are raising the bar for themselves-- and the asset managers they do business with. In April, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees the city’s pension funds, laid out clear transition plan expectations for investment managers. Asset managers working with the New York City Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Retirement System, and Board of Education Retirement System must deliver credible, detailed transition plans—or he would recommend putting those managers’ investment mandates out to bid. Highlighting the financial stakes for states and the public funds they manage, Maryland’s state comptroller released a report in April on how inaction on extreme weather issues is straining the state’s economy and budget. Economic impacts include workforce disruptions, agricultural losses, tourism declines, supply chain disruptions, infrastructure damage, and loss of essential services. And underscoring the critical role of policy advocacy in helping asset owners meet their fiduciary duty, Oregon State Treasurer Elizabeth Steiner backed state legislation introduced in January to strengthen the Treasury’s ability to manage risks. The bill supports the Treasury’s ability to pursue the near- and long-term investment strategies needed to reduce climate-related investment risks and protect the Oregon public employee retirement fund. Momentum is also strong north of the border. In February, a group of Canadian asset owners representing CAD 53 billion issued a call for the country’s financial institutions to stay committed to their net zero goals and to translate them into robust action plans--essential for maintaining a competitive and stable financial system. European Investors Reconsider U.S. Exposure The consequences of wavering on climate action are also becoming increasingly tangible. Major European investors are reassessing their exposure to U.S. asset managers amid concerns about declining policy certainty and a perceived erosion of leadership in the clean economy. Dutch pension fund PME, which manages €57 billion, is reviewing a €5 billion mandate with BlackRock following its exit from a key responsible investing group. Meanwhile, Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, noted last month that clients have “massively repositioned” to avoid U.S. markets, driven by unease over inconsistent clean economy policy signals and other geopolitical concerns. The message from institutional investors in 2025 is clear: climate strategy is foundational to fiduciary duty. As stewards of long-term capital, asset owners are not just adapting to a changing world; they’re shaping it.

Title: BlackRock’s $70 Billion Bitcoin Price Nightmare Just Got A Lot Worse

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 06/01 update below. This post was originally published on May 30 Bitcoin has fallen sharply since hitting an all-time high last week, down 6% despite the U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge bitcoin prediction. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last two years, turbo-charged by Wall Street adoption led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and then U.S. president Donald Trump’s embrace of the technology (with Elon Musk quietly plotting what could be a bitcoin price game-changer). Now, as fears swirl the U.S. dollar could be teetering on the verge of collapse, a serious BlackRock warning that quantum computing could pose an existential risk to bitcoin has been escalated by a Google research paper that found encryption-breaking quantum computers could be a lot closer than previously thought. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has emerged as one of the most bullish voices supporting ... More bitcoin on Wall Street, helping the bitcoin price boom. “This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate,” Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney wrote, referring to the number of quantum computer qubits needed to break a public-key encryption algorithm similar to that used by bitcoin. “If this is even remotely true, combined with everything else happening right now, the only safe trade are hard assets and, dare I say, gold,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya, a vocal supporter of bitcoin who claims to have first bought some when the bitcoin price was just $100, posted to X in response to the paper. 06/01 update: The bitcoin price has now plummeted by almost 10% from its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, falling to just over $103,000 and fast approaching the closely-watched $100,000 level. "Next week will be critical for both the crypto market," analysts with 10x Research led by Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note that suggested long-term bitcoin holders are beginning to sell. This coming week will see slew of economic and labor market data—topped by Friday’s monthly U.S. jobs report—as well as U.S. president Donald Trump’s controversial "big, beautiful" tax bill coming to the Senate and legal back-and-forth expected over Trump’s market-crashing barrage of global trade tariffs. Meanwhile, bullish bitcoin price analysts are predicting small changes in “sentiment” could trigger outsized market swings, with huge volumes of cash still sitting on the sidelines. “With roughly $7 trillion still parked in money market funds and another $2 trillion in fixed income ETFs, even a modest shift in risk sentiment could redirect meaningful capital into crypto and other high-beta assets,” Matt Mena, research strategist at crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) company 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “If bitcoin breaks out of the $105,000 to $110,000 range with conviction, we could see a sharp move to $120,000 and, more importantly, reach our previously year-end price target of $138,500 per bitcoin by the end of the summer.” Earlier this month, BlackRock quietly added a serious warning about quantum computing to the list of risks to its huge spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024. The fund now holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $70 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

More week before dropping back. “If quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock’s amended regulatory filing for its bitcoin fund read. The quantum computing risk to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has exploded recently, with tech giants including Google making strides in quantum computing research. “At this point, no blockchain is ready to withstand a quantum attack when this becomes possible, which could very well be much earlier than 2030,” David Carvalho, the chief executive of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure blockchain Naoris Protocol, said in earlier emailed comments that warned bitcoin is “sleepwalking into a disaster.”
