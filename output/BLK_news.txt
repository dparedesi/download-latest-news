Title: Should You Invest in the TIAA Real Estate Account (QREARX)?

I get asked lots of questions about specific investments. Mostly, the question is asking me to look into my crystal ball and tell them what will provide the best return over their investment period. Aside from the fact that I'm not licensed to recommend specific investments (or paid to do so; even for our real estate sponsors, we only introduce, not recommend), the main issue here is that my crystal ball is usually about as cloudy as that of the person asking the question. However, I get this particular version of the question often enough that it seemed worth a blog post. “I practice in an academic setting and, like many of us at academic institutions, I have access to TIAA’s Real Estate Account. I have not been able to find any high-quality reviews of this account to help decide if it is worth investing in, and I was wondering if your team would be up for writing an article about it to provide us with your insight. Some questions that come to mind are whether it is a good investment compared to other direct real estate investing opportunities, if TIAA is considered competitive as an investing institution in the real estate world, and if the benefits of being able to invest in it in a 403(b) outweigh the tax benefits real estate investments offer investors in taxable accounts.” I have known about the TIAA Real Estate Account (fund) for decades, although I admit I don't follow it particularly closely, as it has never been accessible to me as an investment. TIAA-CREF provides a lot of 403(b)s across the country to academics, teachers, and others, and it is generally considered one of the better retirement account providers—or at least it was a decade or two ago before investing became pretty much free with the advent of sub-10 basis point index funds from providers like Vanguard, Fidelity, Blackrock, and more. The draw of the TIAA fund is that it provides DIRECT investments into real estate, rather than just buying shares of publicly traded REITs. That means there is one less layer between you and the actual investment. Presumably, that would reduce costs and reduce volatility and correlation with the overall stock market, like other direct real estate investments. Of course, one can very reasonably argue that the volatility of private real estate isn't reduced; it's just hidden due to assets not being marked to market regularly. Presumably, QREARX does have to mark to market more regularly than most direct investments, given its high liquidity. When I first learned about this fund two decades ago, I heard people speak positively about it and assumed it was pretty good, but then I forgot about it because I never had a 403(b) with access to it. Imagine my surprise when I looked it up and learned that maybe it wasn't all that awesome. Take a look at this chart from Morningstar accessed in May 2025. The top line is fund performance, and the third line is the performance of its category. See what I mean? Ten-year returns of 3% and even 15-year returns of 6% are pretty hard to get excited about. Real estate hasn't done as well as US large cap tech stocks over the last 15 years, but it hasn't been a bad asset class in which to invest. Let's compare it to my preferred publicly traded real estate investment, the Vanguard Real Estate Index fund (VNQ). This fund/ETF owns all the equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) traded on US markets. That 1.5% lower per year (15-year returns of 7.73% vs. 6.20%) isn't as bad as I expected, but it's still a substantial underperformance. It looks even worse over the last five years with an underperformance of 6.5% a year. It really makes you wonder what has been happening at QREARX in the last five years. Like private real estate investments, QREARX isn't marked to market as quickly as VNQ. I'm not surprised to see the delay in the poor returns, just as we saw with MANY private real estate investments that had rough years in 2023 and 2024, especially when compared to the overall stock market. QREARX VNQ If you read its documents, you can learn a lot about how an account/fund/annuity/whatever actually operates. Let me quote from it: “The Real Estate Account is designed as an option for retirement and tax-deferred savings plans for employees of non-profit and governmental institutions. Investment Objective: The Real Estate Account seeks to generate favorable total returns primarily through the rental income and appreciation of a diversified portfolio of directly held, private real estate investments and real estate-related investments, while offering investors guaranteed, daily liquidity. Investment Strategy: Real Estate-Related Investments. The Account intends to have between 75% and 85% of its net assets invested directly in real estate or real estate-related investments with the goal of producing favorable long-term returns primarily through rental income and appreciation. These investments may consist of: The Account’s principal strategy is to purchase direct ownership interests in income-producing real estate, including the four primary sectors of office, industrial, retail, and multi-family, and alternative real estate sectors (defined as real estate outside of the four primary sectors noted above). In addition, the Account is authorized to hold up to 25% of its net assets in liquid real estate-related securities, including publicly traded REITs and CMBS. Management intends that the Account will not hold more than 10% of net assets in such securities on a long-term basis. As of December 31, 2024, the Account did not hold any publicly traded REITs or CMBS.” The document also notes that 15%-25% of the fund's money can be invested in liquid securities like Treasury bonds and money market funds. More information here: How to Start Investing in Real Estate The Tax-Advantaged Income from Our Passive Real Estate Investments I'm sure plenty of people love investing in QREARX. It has $22.6 billion in it. Let's consider what they probably like. The first pro of QREARX is that it provides you with a way to invest in real estate in your TIAA-CREF 403(b). You'll enjoy some tax efficiency from having your real estate investment in a retirement account. And if a huge chunk of your money is in this account, it may be the only way to have a substantial real estate investment in your portfolio. The second pro of QREARX is that it allows you to invest more directly in real estate than via a REIT mutual fund, such as VNQ. That likely results in less volatility. Of course, that works both ways. In 2021, VNQ was up 41%, but QREARX was only up 18%. On the downside, VNQ dropped 26% in 2022, and QREARX only dropped 17% across 2023-2024. All else equal, lower volatility is good. QREARX provides daily liquidity, like a typical mutual fund. That's very different from most direct real estate investments, which are generally private and offer much less liquidity. However, it does limit you to transacting once a quarter (presumably to prevent market timing) on the day of your choice. This account has only been around since 1995, but frankly, that's an eternity in the private real estate space. Few syndicators and private fund managers have been in business anywhere near that long (blog sponsor MLG is a notable exception). And TIAA itself has been around for more than a century (1918). Like investing in VNQ, you don't have to spend a lot of time worrying about being the victim of a scam here or TIAA going bankrupt. That's often not the case in the private real estate world. This investment is in your 403(b), so there is zero tax preparation required for it. That's definitely NOT the case for a portfolio of syndications or funds sending you multi-state K-1s or having to file multiple Schedule Es each year for your direct real estate investments. VNQ is just as passive as QREARX, and many private funds are similarly passive, at least after the initial due diligence. But lots of real estate takes a whole lot more work than that. Like any investment, there are pros AND cons. QREARX is no different. But the cons depend on your comparison. You have to invest in SOMETHING. Although all real estate is optional, it seemed most reasonable to compare it to the other real estate investments typically used by white coat investors rather than stocks, bonds, or some other asset class. These include public REITs via something like VNQ, passive private syndications and funds similar to those on our real estate sponsor list, and truly direct ownership of income-producing rental property (aka landlording) like we teach in our No Hype Real Estate Investment online course. Investing in VNQ, like most Vanguard index funds, is awfully close to free. The expense ratio is 0.13%. That's not the 0-5 basis points you see on a total stock market fund these days, but it's still a whole lot closer to free than most funds charge. On the other hand, QREARX charges more or less the classic “1% a year.” In fact, it's slightly more at 1.015% a year. Those fees/expenses have to come from your returns. There is no other place to take them from. Fee comparison with private passive investments is a lot more challenging. At first glance, they seem a lot higher—often something like 1% plus 20% of returns above 8% or so. But you have to keep in mind that some of those fees are often going to the expenses of running the investment itself. Those expenses aren't included in the ER of VNQ. It's not entirely clear how operating expenses show up with QREARX. Some private investments (like the DLP funds) don't charge you any fees until you've received your preferred return. QREARX isn't offering anything like that. I'm not sure how else to describe the last decade or two of returns for the TIAA Real Estate Account. They're obviously lower than those provided by the even more liquid and significantly cheaper VNQ. They also seem to be quite a bit lower than the returns offered by most passive private real estate investments. Let's compare a somewhat similar investment, the DLP Housing Fund. This fund isn't as liquid, although it does offer more liquidity (annual redemptions) than most private real estate investments. It is, like QREARX, evergreen—also unlike most real estate investments. How has it been doing the last few years? Let's take a look. Unfortunately, Morningstar doesn't make a nice little graph every day for private real estate investments, but I carefully track my own returns in all of these investments. I invested $250,000 in this fund in June 2021 and have an annualized return from then until the end of April 2025 of 13% a year. By year, the returns look like this: Needless to say, 13% is way better than whatever QREARX has done over that time period—perhaps by as much as 11%-12% a year. They're both actively managed real estate funds and past performance doesn't necessarily indicate future performance, but you do have to ask yourself how much you trust the QREARX manager to do better after an underperformance like that. Even if I had just gone with VNQ, I'd be significantly ahead of QREARX. I could have taken less risk, too, and done better. Real estate debt funds have performed just fine over the last five years. We own three of them (including the DLP Lending Fund), and our returns for that asset class are a very stable 9.56% per year since we started investing in it in 2017. Now, not every private real estate turned in better performance than QREARX, but most of mine did. While it's not necessarily an indicator of future performance, low returns may be my biggest con about the TIAA Real Estate Account. QREARX may be available to you. But it's not available to me or most white coat investors—at least not without changing jobs or at least opening an IRA with TIAA-CREF. You can probably only put as much money in it as you have in your TIAA 403(b). Unlike a private equity real estate investment, you can't put it in a taxable account and enjoy passive income sheltered by depreciation. And if you use your 403(b) space for real estate, that means you can't put something else (bonds?) in there. More information here: How the IRS Treats You as a Real Estate Investor The 60+ Worst Mistakes You Can Make in Real Estate Investing While I find the concept of a liquid direct real estate investment available to non-accredited investors in their employer-provided retirement accounts very interesting, it's hard for me to get over the additional expenses and lower returns seen with QREARX. And if you're really interested in putting in some time and effort into real estate investing, you're probably not going to end up in this fund. What do you think? Do you invest in the TIAA Real Estate Account? Why or why not? What do you like/dislike about it? I was curious why QREARX has such middling returns even compared to VNQ and did a little digging. I think it might be because it is relatively conservative in its loan-to-value ratio. From the fund’s 8-K: “As of March 31, 2025, the Account’s loan-to-value ratio was approximately 18.0%.” https://www.tiaa.org/public/pdf/performance/REA_FAQ.pdf For comparison, the three largest REITS in VNQ are WELL (debt to equity of 0.45), PLD (debt to equity of around 0.6) and AMT (leverage ratio of 5.1). All have much higher internal leverage. 18% LTV is extremely conservative in the real estate investing world. Your email address will not be published.

The world’s largest asset manager will announce a data centre partnership with Digital Gravity Partners, one of a string of deals to be announced during President Trump’s state visit, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 13 September 2025 06:32, UK The world’s largest money manager will use President Trump’s state visit to the UK next week to unveil a £500m plan to invest in UK data centres, one of the fastest-growing areas of global infrastructure spending. Sky News has learnt that BlackRock plans to announce a joint venture with Digital Gravity Partners, a digital infrastructure investment manager, that will focus on acquiring and modernising existing data centres to improve their capacity. The project will be among dozens hailed by the government as evidence of the strength of the economic partnership between Britain and the US, as President Trump arrives in the UK against the politically tumultuous backdrop of Lord Mandelson's sacking as the US ambassador. BlackRock, which has more than $12.5 trillion in assets under management, has a significant presence in Britain, and will next week open a new Edinburgh office employing about 1,300 people. Earlier this week, Sky News revealed that Larry Fink, BlackRock's chairman and chief executive, would be part of the business delegation accompanying President Trump on the state visit. Other bosses in attendance will include Jensen Huang of Nvidia, the world's most valuable public company, and Sam Altman of ChatGPT architect OpenAI. Bloomberg News reported on Friday that the two companies would launch a multibillion-pound investment in the UK next week that will form part of the vast $500bn Stargate data centre project. A vanity trip or a powerful card to play? What Trump's second state visit to UK really means Donald Trump urges NATO countries to stop 'shocking' Russian oil purchases to end Ukraine war 'I'm afraid of leaving the house' - what it's like to live undocumented in Trump's America The vast quantities being spent on artificial intelligence-related data centre infrastructure around the world represents one of the most important trends in the global economy, with the attendant strains on power resources also being throw into sharp focus. The government hopes to announce early next week aggregate figures for investment and job creation that will rival the £63bn it claimed to have secured as a result of last October's International Investment Summit, according to insiders. Critically, at a difficult time for an economy which official data shows is flat lining, the string of major corporate announcements will be hailed by Sir Keir Starmer's administration as evidence that Britain remains a top global destination for foreign investment. The Office for Investment, which was recently given a beefed-up role in Whitehall, has been involved in coordinating many of the deals to be announced next week, which will encompass energy, financial services, nuclear power and technology, according to insiders. Corporate and Whitehall sources said that BlackRock's £500m data centre deal would reflect the efforts of the prime minister, his business adviser Varun Chandra and chancellor Rachel Reeves to strengthen the government's relationship with the asset management behemoth during the last year.

President Trump's visit will, however, come amid tensions over his tariff regime, with continuing uncertainty about the impact on British manufacturing sectors, including steel. There are also continuing tensions between the UK government and major drugmakers over pricing, with the US administration pressuring pharmaceutical companies to slash the price of prescription medicines in the US. BlackRock declined to comment.

Title: Return of ‘world class’ Aoife Wafer just what the doctor ordered ahead of France clash

Time Published: 2025-09-13T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
She’s only 22 and she has only played 15 Tests, but Aoife Wafer’s name stands out above all others in the Ireland team to play France in Sunday’s World Cup quarter-final (Sandy Park, Exeter, kick-off 1pm). Of course, this is largely because of her long-awaited return from knee surgery in July. But it’s not just that. When the former Irish player Jenny Murphy underlined the importance of Wafer’s return by simply describing her as “world class” on Second Captains this week, it wasn’t remotely wide of the mark. After all, Wafer has been named on the World Dream Team and was also the RPI’s Players’ Player of the Year and Young Player of the year in 2024. That all came before her coronation as the 2025 Six Nations Player of the Championship. She earned the latter honour despite missing the last-day loss to Scotland. In four games, Wafer scored four tries, which was the joint highest for a forward. She made 70 carries – the most of any player in the tournament – for a staggering 424.7 metres and beat 17 defenders, the second highest of any forward. Her two tries inspired the 36-10 statement win over Australia in Belfast at the start of last season, as did her two early tries in the ensuing win over New Zealand at WXV1 in Vancouver – powering over first from a tap penalty and then off a five-metre scrum. While this team has strong carriers in Brittany Hogan and Grace Moore, it’s doubtful any other Irish player would have scored them. Similarly, Wafer’s two tries inspired the comeback which came up just short against France in Belfast last March but which fuels belief ahead of this quarter-final, as well as another brace in the win over Wales. It’s not just the tries. Wafer can bend games to her sheer will with her carrying beyond contact, turnovers and tackling, It’s a huge ask, no doubt, for Wafer to magically rediscover her best rugby in a first outing since April, but it’s a gamble worth taking. Better to get 50 or 60 minutes out of her from the start than 20 or 30 at the end, and maybe wonder what might have been. Besides, as former Ireland international Alan Quinlan suggested during the week, the Irish management may well have opted to increase Wafer’s training load last week in preference to giving her a cameo off the bench against New Zealand last Sunday. As with this World Cup and her career, it’s clear that Wafer’s athleticism, strength and footballing ability has been fuelled by a fierce competitive nature and passion for the game, as well as her rugby roots. From Ballygarrett in Wexford, Wafer and her younger sister Orla used to watch their two older brothers play rugby in Gorey RFC. One of the boys, Sean, played for a Leinster Under-18s club side. She eventually nagged their mother Samantha into letting her play as well. Wafer also recalls passing time in the car one day with her brothers by naming as many Irish players as they could. “They were there naming Johnny Sexton, Brian O’Driscoll and all these big names in the men’s team and I named the whole women’s panel. It was a 38-player squad and I named every single one of them. They just sat there and said ‘no, you can’t do it that like’.” In the days before replica women’s jerseys could be bought, the former Ireland women’s coach Philip ‘Goose’ Doyle sent an autographed Irish jersey to Wafer for her tenth birthday. It has been hanging on her bedroom wall ever since and has since been joined by one of her own. At 12, she stopped playing with the boys team in Gorey and transferred to the girls’ Under-15 team before moving to Enniscorthy RFC at 18. It was an important staging post where she switched from a bossy little scrumhalf to a backrower, before moving on to Blackrock and Leinster. On foot of captaining the Ireland Under-18 side, her mother received a call from the IRFU offering Wafer a full-time contract with the Ireland sevens. She relayed that news to her daughter after collecting her from school. It came with a proviso that she first complete her Leaving Cert. That was fine by her. Wafer always wanted to go into healthcare in either medicine or physiotherapy and duly studied the latter in UCD. Alas, days after her Ireland XVs debut in the 2022 Six Nations against Italy in Musgrave Park, the then 19-year-old tore her hamstring in sevens training. Between that and other things, Wafer didn’t win her second cap for another 560 days. That came as a replacement in the WXV 15-13 win against Spain in Dubai in 2023. In the 2024 Six Nations, she was twice player of the round before her 2024-25 breakout campaign. She is not shy about stating her desire to become the best player in the world and, to that end, is joining Harlequins this season. They’re in for a treat, not least as she can play the uilleann pipes, tin whistle, classical flute and the traditional flute. She brings her flute or tin whistle on rugby trips. As her Irish debut song, Wafer famously belted out Miley Cyrus’s Party In The USA on the pitch with her teammates. But after a pre-match meal of pancakes and some chill-out music, she’ll listen to a track or two of traditional Irish music. She’s been missed, but she’s back and will revive her familiar matchday routine ahead of this quarter-final. It’s not stretching things to suggest that, with Wafer in the team, Ireland have a better chance of winning it.

Title: Ondo Finance Surges 20% Weekly Amid Hype and Growing DeFi Demand

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ondo Finance (ONDO) has risen as one of the top performers in the market this week, surging 20% to trade around $1.10. The rally comes as demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization accelerates, pushing Ondo’s TVL to record highs. The recently launched Ondo Global Markets platform has been a major growth driver, attracting over $160 million in assets within days. The service enables investors to access tokenized versions of more than 100 stocks and ETFs, including Tesla, Nvidia, and Google. By bringing Wall Street assets onto the blockchain, Ondo is positioning itself as a leader in the $26 billion RWA tokenization market. Analysts argue that this move could transform global investing, particularly for users outside the U.S., who have traditionally faced barriers to stock market participation. Beyond its equities platform, Ondo Finance has seen explosive growth across its ecosystem. TVL on its DeFi protocols has surged from $563 million earlier this year to more than $1.57 billion today. This spike is primarily fueled by Ondo’s yield-bearing products, such as: The firm’s lending arm, Flux, has also expanded rapidly, now managing $42 million in assets compared to just $4 million last November. Like Aave’s Horizon, Flux lets users borrow stablecoins against tokenized U.S. Treasuries, creating new liquidity avenues. Ondo has also launched its own blockchain, tailored for tokenization, which strengthens its moat in a sector projected to reach trillions of dollars in value. Technically, Ondo has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a bullish reversal signal. The token recently broke past the $1.05 resistance and is now eyeing a breakout above $1.145, last seen in July. A successful move could open the door toward $1.18 and even $1.26 in the short term. However, traders are watching closely for profit-taking risks, as ONDO’s relative strength index (RSI) signals overbought conditions. Regardless, with BlackRock signaling blockchain-based ETFs and Fed rate cuts expected to fuel a broader risk rally, momentum could remain in Ondo’s favor. If sustained, Ondo Finance’s surge not only grows its role as a DeFi leader but also builds the fast-growing demand for tokenized real-world assets.

ONDO swing traders should be on the lookout for a bearish trend reversal at the key supply zones just above the current market price of $1.08. The launch of Fidelity’s FDIT on-chain money market fund highlighted ONDO’s growing list of top-tier asset manager partnerships, but the price movement in the coming days might not reflect intense bullishness. Major asset managers continued to tokenize traditional financial products. Fidelity launched the Fidelity Digital Interest Token (FDIT) on the 10th of September. It is an on-chain money market fund backed by U.S. Treasuries, mostly from Ondo Finance’s [ONDO] Short-Term U.S. Treasuries Fund (OUSG) as the only anchor and largest investor. In doing so, Fidelity joined BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton in offering tokenized money market or Treasury funds. Since the OUSG launch in June 2023, Ondo Finance was one of the first tokens with on-chain access to U.S. Treasuries. Over the past two days, ONDO has gained 14.1%, rallying from $0.95 to $1.08. Bitcoin [BTC] was up 3.3% and Ethereum [ETH] climbed 5.4% during the same period, helping explain ONDO’s bullish sentiment. However, technical analysis showed that the token was headed toward a supply zone, and traders and investors should be wary of a trend reversal. Source: ONDO/USDT on TradingView The 1-day market structure was bullish, and the key swing high and low were marked in orange. They were at $1.17 and $0.85, respectively, while a range formation (white) was also identified. ONDO has traded within this range since July. At the time of writing, the price was at a key supply zone from mid-August at $1.08. Another 7% move higher would take ONDO to the range highs. However, it was unclear if the current move could reach the range highs. The CMF on the daily timeframe was below -0.05, showing strong capital outflow from the market. Even though the MACD showcased bullish momentum, the seller dominance was not overthrown. Therefore, ONDO swing traders should be on the lookout for a bearish trend reversal at $1.08 and $1.17. Sustained buying pressure and high trading volume alongside a breakout past $1.17 would be a strong bullish signal in the coming weeks, but until then, the range formation would likely be respected.

Crypto exchange Gemini hit a $4.4 billion valuation on its Nasdaq debut Friday. At the time of writing, the company’s shares—which trade under the GEMI ticker symbol—are hovering around $34. That’s a 22.6% gain from when the stock began trading. Gemini was founded in 2014 and granted a BitLicense by the New York State Department of Financial Services the following year. The company raised $425 million through its IPO, according to Decrypt calculations based on regulatory filings. Reuters was first to report yesterday that the firm’s IPO was significantly oversubscribed. But there’s been drama brewing between the company’s founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, and Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Chair nominee Brian Quintenz. The CFTC nominee shared screenshots of a July text thread with Tyler on X. The messages show that Quintenz was contacted about a complaint Gemini filed regarding alleged misconduct at the regulator. Gemini paid $5 million to settle its CFTC lawsuit in January, just a few weeks before the trial was set to begin. But in June, the company’s lawyers filed a complaint alleging the CFTC was wrong to have gone after the exchange in the first place. “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise,” he wrote. “It’s my understanding that after this exchange they contacted the President and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” There were a few people in the thread calling foul on his timing, especially given that his current firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has a large stake in Gemini’s direct competitor, Coinbase. Gemini is the most recent, but not the only crypto company to make its big public debut this week. Crypto lender Figure began trading on the Nasdaq under the FIGR ticker Thursday, seeing shares jump 24%. The firm stepped into public trading with an even bigger, $5.3 billion valuation. Its share price ahead of the closing bell on Friday sits around $33.46, about 33% above its $25 IPO price. “Our IPO showed what’s possible when blockchain meets capital markets: speed, transparency, efficiency,” the company said Friday on X. “IPO day was a celebration of our people, partners, and the vision driving us forward, and we’re even more excited for what’s next.” Figure CEO Michael Tannenbaum told Decrypt that the company is showing Wall Street how blockchains can be used to create more efficient markets for real-world assets, while also helping investors better grasp concepts like tokenization. Tokenization—that is, taking real-world assets such as stocks and creating blockchain-based equivalents—has been getting a lot of buzz lately. According to a recent report in Bloomberg, Blackrock is considering tokenizing its ETFs. No, not just BUIDL, its flagship tokenized fund launched with Securitize in 2024. The scope for this move would be much broader—and bring trillions worth of dollars with it. Even Nasdaq has expressed interest to the SEC in allowing tokenized stocks to trade on its exchanges. The company proposed that issuers would get to opt in to having tokenized versions of their securities trade. Crypto exchange Coinbase has claimed that the SEC has done “irreparable harm” by destroying documents from its Gary Gensler era. "The Gensler SEC destroyed documents they were required to preserve and produce,” Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wrote on X Thursday, alongside a link to the court filing. “We now have proof from the SEC's own Inspector General." A report last week by the SEC’s Office of the Inspector General found that nearly a year of then-Chairman Gary Gensler's text messages were permanently deleted between October 2022 and September 2023. Coinbase has been pursuing internal SEC documents for a long time through the Freedom of Information Act and sued when the regulator denied its requests.

The company noted its $500 million worth of Bitcoin increased in value to $528 million by the end of the quarter.

Photos by Billie Winter For nearly two years, every sunrise in Gaza has brought more death, destruction, and dislocation. To be Palestinian today is to live under unrelenting bombardment, displacement, and starvation, your community rendered a target by an Israeli regime that openly declares its intent of eradication. It is to watch American leaders respond not with outrage but with plans envisioning luxury “Gaza Riviera” resorts and surveillance states on the same land where children’s bones are visible from hunger and their bodies are charred by US-funded bombs. This is not a natural disaster. It is a human-made horror. And yet, to be Palestinian is also to persist. To insist on life in the bowels of doom. To keep organizing, cooking, singing, teaching, and loving because to surrender your humanity is to surrender what can never be taken by force. There is no greater defiance than the will to live, to dance, to gather, even when the world seems indifferent to your existence. That is what makes this year’s second annual Palestine Will Live Forever Festival all the more urgent. It arrives not only as Gaza continues to endure mass death and forced displacement, but as Black, Brown, immigrant, trans, and poor communities across the US face escalating state violence, while reproductive freedom, environmental justice, and democracy itself hang in the balance. Yes, the day will feature an all-star lineup: Macklemore, Prometheus Brown, Fem du lit, Bambu, Jamila Woods, Noura Erakat, Nikkita Oliver, and more, but it is not just a concert. It is a gathering that reminds us that our fates are braided together, that either liberation is collective or it is not at all. Saturday will further testify that our will is not passive. It is the marrow of our survival and the pulse that refuses silence. To love one another in the face of annihilation is a political act. The festival is not merely a celebration; it is a forging. A place where joy becomes a weapon against despair, where solidarity is sharpened into strategy, and where we remember that endurance is not simply to survive, but to triumph. The Stranger spoke with four of this year’s organizers—Maher Joudi, Gabriel Teodros, Nikkita Oliver, and Lexi Peterson-Burge—about what it means to hold space for Palestinian liberation, to model cross-movement solidarity, and to create a festival that feeds the long struggle rather than just marking a single day. The Palestine Will Live Forever Festival takes place Saturday, September 13, from noon to 9 p.m. at Volunteer Park. Tickets are available here. This is the second year of this festival. Every day we’re seeing new horrors in the headlines and on social media. For you all, what was the onus to make sure this happened again? Why was it important to participate—whether organizing, performing, or bringing performers? What was the impetus for doing year two? Maher Joudi: That’s a layered question, man. Personally, even leaving last year, the calls started coming in within a week—people asking if it would happen again. I assumed we’d try to run it back at the start of this year. Then a lot changed with the election of President Trump. We had real conversations about whether it should happen, especially from a safety perspective—this was around when Mahmoud Khalil had just gotten taken. There was a lot to weigh. Ultimately, as a team, we decided it was necessary. Then we talked about intentionality—what this year should look like—because the horrors in Palestine had only gotten worse. And here in the US, our people—Palestinian, Black, Latino, immigrant—were getting taken too. The need for a day like last year’s had grown so much that it felt necessary. Gabriel Teodros: The need to gather—and to normalize resistance—became really clear, especially around the election. Rights were getting stripped at an exponential rate: undocumented people getting snatched, transgender people getting arrested for trying to use the bathroom. The list goes on. If we were going to do the festival—and we should—we wanted it to be about collective liberation, to model how our struggles are connected and our pathways to liberation are bound together. That’s the direction we took. Lexi Peterson-Burge: To be transparent, we as organizers have varied identities, backgrounds, and lived experiences. That informed tough discussions about whether to move forward with a second year. We had hours of conversations about protecting communities and ourselves; about what kind of organizing meets the moment; [about] whether centering joy and a celebration of culture and resistance was appropriate and safe. We asked if it would fill the organizer cup for everyone involved—because our communities were experiencing different kinds of harm at the same time. We landed on this: The source of our communities’ struggles—oppression, genocide, etc.—comes from the same place. The festival could say this isn’t one community’s fight; it’s a collective fight against imperialism and capitalism and all the forces fueling the many ways our communities are being oppressed, historically and now. It gave us a chance to model cross-racial, cross-cultural, cross-movement solidarity—and to center joy as resistance while keeping our people as safe as possible. It took a month or two of serious, hard conversations. I wouldn’t have had it any other way. Nikkita Oliver: I actually stepped back from organizing for a couple months to be sure I was in alignment about why I was participating. “All of us or none of us” is key for me. What’s happening to our communities is due to empire, colonialism, capitalism—rooted in anti-Blackness. Our organizing has to target those structures so we don’t end up with a world where some of us get free at the expense of others. Art and culture are resistance—doing them out loud is resistance. But we have to go further: have present organizing bodies people can plug into. We need not just mobilized communities, but organized communities. So the festival centers intersectionality, resistance, and joy while bringing in those doing hyper-local, national, and global organizing—so when people leave, they have places to plug in. It’s more than a day; it’s a galvanizing moment that feeds the uncelebrated work between the big moments. Having organizers, vendors, and movement workers present helps make that real. There’s so much heaviness, locally, nationally, internationally. How do you balance that while planning an event that centers joy, uplifts, and mobilizes? What has that process been like? Teodros: Helping organize has been a constant reminder of what’s possible—and that we don’t get through this time alone. I’m looking at a screen full of graphics, with Zahyr [Lauren]’s beautiful art staring back at me—what they captured is a reminder of what it’s like when our movements come together. Working on the festival has helped me get through this year emotionally. It’s that daily reminder: it’s collective liberation or not at all. “All of us or none of us”—it’s right there in the name. Peterson-Burge: This year’s been harder for me—energy-wise, emotionally. A lot of organizers burn out, especially those with layered identities who are directly impacted by what’s unfolding. There’s a push-pull: The push is knowing you have to do something to stay whole and authentic, to show up for resistance, joy, and cultural preservation. The pull is that doing this month after month while witnessing harm drains you. Then there’s capitalism—families, bills, survival. Still, I feel obligated to show up for my people. And a big reason I can is this group. We’re honest when something hits hard—“I need a day or two”—and we show up for each other. Without this group, I don’t know that I could keep doing something at this scale right now. Oliver: Last year, the energy to do it came easier—even though it was exhausting. Now it’s a daily barrage: executive orders, neighbors snatched by Gestapo, worsening prison conditions, targeting of gender-expansive trans and queer people, the invisibilizing of Sudan and Congo—so much to hold as an organizer and conscious person. It’s overwhelming. What’s kept me in it is that we’re having the hard conversations—crying with each other, sometimes at each other—and practicing principled struggle. Some won’t see the value because arts and culture are central. I’d argue without arts and culture, we don’t exist—that’s where our stories, histories, poems, relationships live. We engage culture every day—from clothes to music to what we read. Doing principled struggle in a space of art-as-resistance makes me want to keep going, even when it’s exhausting. Also, hearing folks’ energy for it is a reminder of how important gathering is. It’s not always a 3,000-person festival—sometimes it’s dinner, a Zoom, a walk. The constant gathering matters. I’m looking forward to being in community with people who share our values and take this as a call to make our movements as intersectional as possible. Joudi: I agree—this year is harder. I’ve probably had one-on-ones with everyone here saying that. It makes me emotional to hear it out loud. Last year, I was excited—everything was new and fast, and I didn’t have time to grasp the magnitude. This year, with more time and intentionality, I feel pressure: to show up right for our organizing team, my community, and the global community, and to represent ourselves well. I’m the oldest or second oldest on this call, but the youngest in organizing. Every day, I’m learning how to show up with intention and authenticity. I hoped Palestine would be at least a little better by now. It’s 10 times worse. And once you peel back layers, you can’t unsee them. Days are tougher—and organizing becomes a second job. But to Nikkita’s point, the energy from artists, vendors, and community—people asking to be involved—has been real. Only recently did I feel the full magnitude of what this means to the community. That gives you your second, third, 10th wind when a small team is wearing a ton of hats. Knowing what this day will mean to everyone is what keeps me making calls, finishing docs, hopping on Zoom—grounded in why we’re doing it. This is the only group I could do this with—the one that teaches, gives grace and support, and helps us grow together. We’re seeing mobilizations globally and nationally—marches, strikes, flotillas, and more. How do you see this festival in conversation with those acts of solidarity? Oliver: Shout out to Gabriel and Maher for the lineup ideas—that’s where intentional solidarity shows up. Who we invited and why had everything to do with the messaging artists already live in their art and movement work. The lineup alone speaks to how we aim to operate in solidarity. Palestine is at the center of why we came together, but we’re also clear that we’re resisting larger structures. We want folks to leave with a deeper analysis of what we’re fighting and how. As an artist and cultural worker, I think about music, poetry, visual art—even the food we choose—as ways to bring us back to each other. Actions like the flotilla aim to break a siege, meet basic needs, and galvanize organized response to empire’s violence. The festival does parallel work: supporting HEAL [Palestine]’s care for children who’ve lost limbs; the Transgender Law Center’s protection of our trans siblings; La Resistencia’s frontline organizing at the Northwest Detention Center. These are tangible, often hyper-local ways to show up. Choosing beneficiaries like Water Protectors, the Black Panther Party, and BLM Washington reflects that our struggles are interconnected. Palestinians benefit from La Resistencia’s work; Black queer folks benefit from the Transgender Law Center and the Panthers. We’re showing up in multifaceted ways—care, organizing, resistance—and that starts on stage. No matter who you hear, you’ll get that message. Deepening our analysis deepens our resistance and commitment. I hope people leave with their cup filled and a fire to act. Peterson-Burge: I remind myself: Showing up in the streets is as important as showing up for cultural preservation, togetherness, breaking bread, teaching dances, eating the foods we’ve missed. All of it matters so we don’t lose ourselves while we fight for everyone. Creating space to preserve ourselves and our cultures is powerful, transformative, revolutionary—and necessary. Joudi: At the core, these movements are the same: people from all walks of life standing against oppression. Forty-plus countries supporting a flotilla is all of us understanding we must stand for all of us. That’s what we embody—through many avenues. Cultural preservation is huge. Speaking as a Palestinian, erasure includes stealing our culture—claiming hummus, rewriting our history. Supporting Palestinians isn’t only about Gaza and the West Bank—there’s immediate need, yes, but Palestine lives forever by preserving our culture. That’s true for every community represented here. Preserving who we are is how we win. For folks new to this movement or who didn’t attend last year, what do you want them to take away after attending? Joudi: For my community: the need for collectiveness. I’ve shouted for Palestine my whole life, and I “got” interconnectedness—Ferguson in 2016—but I hadn’t truly connected the dots on intersectionality and riding for each other. Our heroes have been telling us: Leila Khaled said 50 years ago there is only one oppression. The Panthers visited Philistine and stood with Palestine. Kids in Gaza held “I stand with Ferguson” signs. Our movements fall apart when we’re convinced to battle each other for attention. I want folks to understand it all needs to be discussed and fought for at the same time—it’s the same fucking move. The music, speakers, vendors are dope—we’ll feel good—but I need everyone to leave knowing we’re all connected against them. If you’re with them, you’re not with us. If you’re with us, you’re with all of us. Teodros: As a musician, I want artists to walk away less afraid and less alone in speaking up for Palestine. Somehow calling a genocide a genocide is still controversial. We intentionally booked people already making bold stands for humanity. I want that—and collective liberation—to become the norm. Culture helps by modeling it and building our own stages when others won’t book this—we have to do it ourselves. Also, let’s name it: Live Nation’s second-largest shareholder is BlackRock; Ticketmaster is part of that ecosystem—there are corporate interests in silencing artists. We can’t let them dictate culture. We do that—community, people, artists. Oliver: It would be easy to assume we had every resource from day one. We didn’t. We showed up finding resources as we went. You can have a big vision and then call your homies and make it happen—that’s how this happened. If we want more control, we have to build it. Our communities have long built institutions outside government—mutual aid networks, survival structures—out of brilliance and necessity. I hope folks leave thinking: We have the capacity to build our own structures for self-governance. Many hands make light work. And I hope the Black community sees our trans siblings as central to Black struggle; that we see immigrants’ fights against ICE and Indigenous fights for resources as ours too. There is no single-issue struggle. We can build what we need, together. Peterson-Burge: I want everyone to leave feeling, “I really needed that—and I got it.” To have been in space with our people and felt joy. And then I want folks to plug into an organizing home—consistently. If you don’t have one, find one: a book list, political education classes, places to learn our intertwined histories. I want cross-pollination—Palestinian homies connecting with the Black Panther Party; Black queer siblings pulling up with La Resistencia. Also, as a fundraising person, sustaining our movements means mobilizing the masses to support them. The festival is a vessel to move resources to under-resourced movements so our people can keep doing the work. If we can give a small grassroots org two more months of budget to keep stopping detentions, that matters. If five more people give $10 so they can buy water for volunteers, that matters. Our beneficiaries span different movement spheres to reach widely, rooted in intersectionality and collective struggle. I hope folks take action. Is there a moment from the past year of putting this together that represents the hope of what this festival means? Teodros: From an artist’s perspective: seeing artists meet through the festival and then collaborate. Even before the first one, watching Desirée Dawson—a Black woman in Canada—covering Samer, a young Palestinian artist’s, song, and sharing it online. Seeing Bambu and the Neighborhood Kids meet at the festival and then collaborate on music and a series of events. Maher was involved in events around the country with lineups that mirrored ours. Bringing folks together and watching them keep working—that’s meaningful. A post shared by Bambu DePistola (@bambudepistola) Joudi: Those moments were heartwarming. Where it really clicked for me—this isn’t just an event, it’s moving a movement forward—was in the last week or so. Vendors reaching out: “I missed the deadline, but I need to be there.” Artists asking to get on the lineup. Those are hard conversations—we want to keep it fresh and platform new voices—but the community’s feedback at every level has been powerful. Even on logistics calls—like with the video wall folks—people who weren’t involved last year were hyped because of the cause. Last year, stage staff told us how grateful they were to work the festival—we’re feeling that again. Stepping outside myself, I feel grateful and blessed to help make this happen, no matter how hard the work is, knowing what it means to people and what it will do for the community. Oliver: Two moments. First: Last year, a homie brought his elementary-aged son. I was stage-managing and saw them dancing together during Native Guns’ set. Afterward, he told me it was a transformative moment—passing down the cultural work of artists who politicized him, and watching his son be politicized by the same art, in joy. That’s joy as resistance—creating space to pass down resistance through art. Second: During Whodinii’s set, the Palestinian community—and comrades—broke into a big circle dance. Organizers and volunteers literally lost themselves in that moment, because they knew we built a space where we care for each other. You didn’t need your head on a swivel like at a protest. It was unbridled, embodied resistance. That’s what the festival is about—and the world I hope we get. Peterson-Burge: I was going to name that dance moment too—seeing Palestinians and other Arab folks teaching others how to do it was beautiful. Two other (selfish) moments for me: walking into the grounds that morning and seeing the banner and stage set with last year’s image—realizing, “We did that.” I had to walk off and cry. It represented weeks of late nights, fundraising, calls, crying, arguing—the whole thing—becoming real. Then at the end, bringing all the organizers onstage, arms around each other, taking a deep breath: “Dang, we did that.” Most of us didn’t know each other closely before last year—we put that first festival together in six to eight weeks. Now these people are my family. They’re coming to my wedding. That kind of relational, transformational organizing—where I can have hard conversations and be heard—was what I needed. It’s a huge reason I’m doing this again. If my people are doing something, I’m showing up—tired or not—because I know they’ll show up for me.

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. executive Rick Rieder is rising up the list of contenders to serve as the next chair of the Federal Reserve after Jerome Powell’s term expires in May, according to an administration official. In a wide-ranging interview that lasted for two hours on Friday in New York, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Rieder discussed monetary policy, the Fed’s organizational structure and regulatory policy, the person said, who requested anonymity to discuss a private meeting. Bessent has so far interviewed four of the 11 candidates publicly named as under consideration for the top central bank job, the official said, emphasizing that the process is ongoing. One or two more names will likely be added to that list, according to the person. Rieder is one of the most senior executives at BlackRock, overseeing the firm’s fixed income business. He joined the company in 2009, following nearly two decades at Lehman Brothers Inc. A representative for BlackRock had no immediate comment. Bessent was impressed with Rieder’s long career in markets running large groups and his deep understanding of micro- and macro-contributors to the economy, according to someone familiar with the Treasury secretary’s thinking. Rieder would bring a calm demeanor and in-depth knowledge of financial firms outside the banking system if he becomes Fed chair, the person said. Bessent appreciates Rieder’s ability to use forward-looking frameworks to assess the economy, rather than relying on backward-looking data, the person said. The Treasury chief was impressed by a similar intuitiveness after a conversation with Fed Governor Christopher Waller over the summer. President Donald Trump has been frustrated with Powell’s dependence on data to guide the Fed’s next moves, giving him the nickname “Too Late.” Two senior staffers, one who is a macro-economist and another with regulatory and markets expertise, were in the room for Bessent’s meeting with Rieder. Trump last week said that his top candidates for Fed chair include Waller, former Fed official Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council. However, he has deputized Bessent to run a comprehensive search process. The Treasury chief has said that he will interview all the contenders and offer Trump a shortlist of three to four to consider later this fall. --With assistance from Silla Brush.

Title: BlackRock Weighs Tokenized ETFs Following Bitcoin Fund Surge

BlackRock is moving deeper into tokenized funds, and the moves are starting to look like a bid to bring traditional ETFs onto blockchains. Reports have disclosed that the firm’s tokenized money market product, known as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund or BUIDL, is already live on the Ethereum network and works with firms such as Securitize and BNY Mellon for transfer agent and custody roles. According to filings and industry reports, the BUIDL fund is backed by cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Transfer agent duties are being handled by Securitize while custody services are provided by BNY Mellon. Other infrastructure providers named in reports include Fireblocks, BitGo, Coinbase and Anchorage Digital. The fund pays yields to token holders on a daily basis using blockchain rails, and it is being positioned as a bridge between classic cash-like instruments and programmable token holdings. JUST IN: BlackRock plans to tokenize ETFs following success with $BTC fund. pic.twitter.com/yQD0E4VjpX — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) September 11, 2025 Executives have been quoted as saying tokenization could scale far beyond a single fund. Reports have put a potential addressable market figure as high as $10 trillion if a broad array of assets and ETFs are moved on-chain over time. Industry trackers also show that the total value locked in tokenized real-world assets passed $10 billion in recent months, a sign that the market is no longer purely experimental. BlackRock’s activity has prompted comparisons with other large asset managers, such as Franklin Templeton, which have also launched tokenized offerings. Proponents say tokenized ETFs could allow fractional ownership and round-the-clock transferability, and they could speed settlement in some cases. Reports say tokenization may also boost transparency since ownership records can be viewed directly on the chain. At the same time, uncertainty remains over how tokenized ETF shares will interact with existing market structures such as APs and market makers, and whether on-chain trading will be treated the same as exchange trading under US securities rules. Regulators, custodians and auditors face hard choices about legal rights, disclosure and investor protections for tokenized securities. On the basis of sector coverage, firms continue to sort out custody architectures and legal wrappers that provide enforceable claims on the underlying assets to token holders. Various jurisdictions might draw different conclusions, which would impede cross-border adoption or confine rollouts to individual markets. BlackRock’s investigation into tokenized ETFs is a follow-up on the success of its Bitcoin fund, already attracting robust inflows and market interest. The firm’s success in that department is now generating speculation that its next move will be to take pieces of its multi-trillion-dollar ETF business on-chain. Should the transition occur, it would represent one of the biggest steps so far by a global asset manager towards investment products based on blockchain.

Title: When You May Want To Add Guaranteed Income To Your Financial Picture
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cicelyjones/2025/09/12/when-you-may-want-to-add-guaranteed-income-to-your-financial-picture/

ByCicely Jones , Contributor. Due to many investors’ uncertainty about today’s market, I’ve seen many people opt to move entirely to cash and take investing off the table, but I’ve also had many investors approach me with questions about how to protect their investments and guarantee income. At the end of the day, the right investment for you entirely depends on your financial goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, and alternative options you are considering. Here is information on how guaranteed income may fit into your financial picture. When investors are fearful, I often see them do one of a few things: If your asset allocation is well-diversified and consistent with your risk tolerance and you can remain disciplined, most of the best advice indicates that if you can stand it, to go with the first option. Moving toward cash and cash alternatives in the moment can feel satisfying in the moment but will ultimately diminish your purchasing power and reduce your lifetime income potential. Making speculative bets can easily result in losing your entire portfolio. I recently asked an investor how he landed on his investment portfolio because it did not appear to be following a cohesive strategy, and it was losing badly to every benchmark. He responded, “Youtubers and vibes.” While that has some entertainment value, I don’t recommend that sort of strategy for anyone who wants to reach a financial goal like retirement. There are several types of annuities and structured products, but I’d like to focus on indexed annuities and variable annuities because they can solve for longevity risk, inflation risk, volatility risk, interest rate risk, and taxation risk for the right investor. A variable annuity is a long-term financial product designed for retirement purposes. In essence, an annuity is a contractual agreement in which payment(s) are made to an insurance company, which agree to pay out an income or a lump sum amount at a later date. Typically, variable annuities have mortality and expense charges, account fees, investment management fees and administration fees. In addition, annuity policies have exclusions and limitations, early withdrawals may be subject to surrender charges and, if taken prior to age 59 1/2, a 10% federal income tax penalty. Variable annuities are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of principal. An indexed annuity is a type of insurance contract that pays an interest rate based on the performance of a market index. It differs from a fixed annuity, which pays a fixed rate of interest, and a variable annuity, which bases its interest rate on a portfolio of investment options chosen by the annuity owner. Indexed annuities are sometimes referred to as equity-indexed or fixed-indexed annuities. One of the biggest questions when determining your retirement income need is how long you might live. According to Flowing Data, using information from the Social Security Administration, a female 40-year-old has: Essentially, the odds are highly in your favor of making it past age 80. This can present a problem when you try to make your money stretch potentially over 40 years. Because annuities are designed to pay out for someone’s entire life, regardless of what happens in the market, this can be particularly attractive to those with a family history of longevity. According to a 2024 BlackRock study, 97% of annuity owners say their annuities cause them decreased stress about running out of money. Over the last 100 years, inflation has averaged about 3% per year. That means that every year, to live the same lifestyle, your cost will go up. Let’s say your fixed expenses are $2,000 per month today. In 10 years, assuming 3% inflation, that monthly expense would be almost $2,700 per month. If you are considering sitting in cash, you will be losing purchasing power each year. While some annuities just pay a fixed amount every year, others can grow your payment amount each year through some combination of market returns or a guaranteed roll-up. When you are still in your accumulation phase without a thought of near-term withdrawals, you may be able to easily handle portfolio volatility. However, when you end up needing distributions, volatility can be a serious problem. Let’s go through two examples: Investor A has a portfolio value of $1,000,000 and an income need of $50,000 per year: Investor B has a portfolio value of $1,000,000 and an income need of $50,000 per year: Even though they started with the exact same amount, needed the exact same income, and had the exact same average return in two years, Investor B is in a significantly worse position because they started with a negative year instead of a positive one. If you take extend these small differences out 40 years, Investor B is more likely to run out of money than Investor A if they start in a worse market but ultimately achieve the same average return. Guaranteed income products attempt to eliminate that risk of timing issues leading to depletion of retirement savings. In retirement, I often see investors turning to money market funds, CDs, and fixed income investments. All of these are subject to interest rate risk. In the not-too-distant past, investors were getting between 0-2% on these types of investments, not even keeping up with inflation. Annuities are designed to provide some stability and predictability with guaranteed rates, making retirees less susceptible to interest rate risk. In nonretirement accounts, guaranteed income products offer tax-deferral during the accumulation phase. This means that unlike in brokerage accounts where you pay taxes every year on interest, dividends, and rebalancing, you will only pay taxes on the growth when you distribute funds. There is a good reason that annuities of the past have had negative associations. Not all guaranteed income products are created equal and it’s essential to speak with a qualified financial professional, about your goals and if a guaranteed income product is the right fit for a piece of your financial picture. In today's uncertain market, adding guaranteed income product offerings like annuities can address risks such as longevity, inflation, volatility, interest rates, and taxes. However, it's crucial to consult with a financial professional to ensure these products align with your unique goals and circumstances, enhancing your financial security and future planning.

Title: Nineteen Years of Shifting Goals

It is time for 19! Number 19 – Corvette No, not that 19. The blog turns 19 today. Ever WP.com admits I have been around that long. The annual WP.com greeting And 19 years is kind of a long time, with nearly a third of my life involving me tapping out typo filled first drafts and pressing the publish button more than 7,500 times. But we’ll get to the silly stats a bit further down the page. And yet it feels a bit like a lesser turning of the years, just one shy of 20, a nice big round number that is so much more impressive than 19. 19 feels like it is almost there, while 20 has arrived. Or so it goes with those of us who count in base 10 I suppose. As part of Blaugust I reflected a bit on the writing process, as I am wont to do, but also considered the goals of the blog, what my writing assignment here is, was, and might end up being. I say that because I certainly didn’t start out the way things are now. It took a while to establish whatever we call what I am doing now. If we go back to that very first post back in September of 2006, I seemed to want to write about games I had already played, to go over my history. And I certainly did some of that. I wrote about early online games like Stellar Emperor and Air Warrior and TorilMUD. I tried to tease out memories of things like Starsiege: Tribes and the early days of EverQuest. You can find more than a few posts about games I played before I started blogging. But things quickly turned to talking about MMOs and what might come next. We were in both the age of blogging and of MMORPG popularity. We were going to have all sorts of MMOs, and they were going to be about anything and everything. Even Micheal Jackson. Planet Michael… only to be imaged, never to be seen And then the WoW killer… because surely somebody would come along and dethrone the mighty king of MMORPGs… never appeared. It captured and dominated the market and its peak was never eclipsed in the west and developers game up on that and started trying to cash in on the next trend, which was Facebook games or free to play MMOs or MOBAs or Kickstarted nostalgia farming name driven projects… all of which I covered some here and there. Almost all of them failed to live up to their promise and most failed to survive for very long. As part of that I started posting about events and launches and expansions and updates, if only just to establish a timeline so that I could remember what changed when. Along the way I wrote about what I was playing. At first those posts were haphazard, lacking in detail and mostly just “I did a thing” without much around it. That developed as a style, focused around the instance group and our adventures in Azeroth, but also around EVE Online and the ongoing struggle to find the game in the sandbox. That expanded to other games we played and got more detailed. Likewise, once I found my niche in null sec, posts about the ups and downs of space empires in New Eden began to figure much more. For no real reason beyond “it seemed like a good idea at the time” I wrote a Month in Review post at the end of that first September and have continued to do so every since. While those posts feature quite a bit of fluff, the revisiting of what I wrote about a year ago, five years ago, ten years ago, and so on… that became a cornerstone of my own experience with the blog, reminding me of the past and where I have been and what I have done online. In the end, it turned out the blog turned out to be about games I had played, my gaming history and such. I was just writing it as it went and it slowly became nearly two decades of history, and not all of it a complete waste. There is a whole page or so in Empires of EVE: Vol II that reprints my observations on the battle at 6VDT-H. My account, written the next day while the events of the battle were still fresh in my mind ended up being, ended up being able to provide some flavor of the battle in a book about the conflict of empires in which I was just one guy in a ship. And I still get a nod now and then for having written up something that didn’t make the news or other outlets. Recently I even got a nice message from Asher Elias, head of the Imperium, who is working on his own history of the game and null sec who said: your site has been so helpful it’s hard to overstate the value I feel pretty good about that. The blog, in the end, became something of what I intended, if not in exactly how I envisioned getting there. Though, again, that might apply more to EVE Online that other titles due to the nature of the game. The player driven nature of New Eden means that major events, battles and such, are one time unique events. Meanwhile, in WoW for example, every Deadmines run faces the exact same set of challenges, so the tale of our group is hardly unique save for the fact that we were there for that particular moment. What do I take from that? Don’t hesitate to write down some event? Maybe. Different from where I started for sure. And even these anniversary posts have evolved over time. As I always say, look at all the work I put into some of those early posts. They had themes! Now… well, go back and look at some of the old ones if you want fancy. Here they are: That is the preliminaries. Actually, I even gave you most of the reflections up front this time. Not sure what I’ll have at the back end. We shall see. The Basic Stats Days since launch: 6,940 (+376, because I had to calculate early last year) Posts total: 7,572 (+400) Total Words: 6,783,396 Average words per post: 895 (+58) Post Likes: 25,294 Average posts per day: 1.091 (-0.001… I am slowing… so very slowly) Comments: 40068 (+1,089) Average comments per post: 5.29 (-0.12) Average comments per day: 5.77 (-0.25) Comments written by me: 8,264 or 20.6% Space used by images: 4.7 GB used, 9.1 GB (70.2%) upload space remaining. Blog Subscribers: 3,523 (+975, mostly spammers) US Presidents since launch: 4 British Monarchs since launch: 2 Prime Ministers of Italy since launch: 9 Summary: I write a lot of words still and we have a retread president. Also, last year in my rush to get on a plane for our 25th wedding anniversary trip I totally didn’t update some of those numbers and I am too lazy to go re-figure the increment. But nobody commented on my, for example, saying I had surpassed the word count for the Wheel of Time series of books when the number I was showing was clearly less than that. But I am well past that now. Data Unfiltered So what is going on here at the blog? People still come to visit. Not as many as used to, but many more than I figured ever would. So let’s see what the numbers are, starting with page views. Year 19 – Page views by month If you add up the numbers along the right hand side it comes out to something like 6,863,443 page views over the life of the blog. That is more than I ever expected, though probably less than somebody like Amazon gets over the course of a minute on any given day. You can see the peaks and valleys of the site over the years. The high point was 2012, as I have oft indicated. Things really fell off after Covid, with 2021 and 2022 seeing the lowest numbers since the first year of the blog. Then things have revived a bit. Summed up by full year… so leaving out 2006 and 2025 so far… the trend looks like this. TAGN Page View Traffic by Full Years – 2007 through 2024 2007 remains the full year with the lowest count, but 2022 wasn’t that far behind. And then there is one more chart I usual toss in here. I usually just paste in an image of it, but I prefer actual numbers rather than pictures of numbers, so I am once again going to let WP format some data from Excel. So that is either a nicely formatted chart with numbers or a bunch of mushed up garbage, likely the latter if you’re reading this on your phone. Sorry about that. As you can see, until this year the number of words per post had been mostly rising. I don’t know what got into me in 2024, where I got close to 1,500 words per post, but this year I am down somewhat. Part of the rise in words has to be my month in review posts, which get a chunk longer every five years. But most of it is likely me taking care to fill in more details about things in posts as you never know what is going to end up being a critical or interesting tidbit of information years down the road. Who Sends People Here? Search engines. Seriously, that is most of the traffic. And Google is 98% of the search engine traffic. He is how search engines shake out. Google is on there three times… though Google Image Search isn’t the mighty referral engine it once was… because Google decided to just download all your images… excuse me, it cached them. On the bright side, Bing recognizes me again. It had de-indexed me for a stretch. On the flip side of that, does it matter? Also, hello my two AOL users, because I doubt the same AOL user landed here twice. Then there is social media and social media like sites… who no longer send me that much traffic anymore. At one time social media was a lot better at sending traffic out. But now sites like X go out of their way to keep people from leaving. Not that I post anything to X in any case, I deleted my account there more than a year back. New on the list, the AI sites are coming for us! Not really a force to be reckoned with at this point, but some of those sites only recently started trying to show their work. Then there are my fellow bloggers. They do send me a bit of traffic, more than some social media sites I post to daily. Here are the top ten blogs that send me traffic. Eight of those ten are Blogger based blogs that use the dynamic blogroll sidebar widget. Two of those eight aren’t even updated regularly, but still send me traffic due to that blogroll option. The Greybill is a fellow WP.com blog and just linked to me about a couple of EVE Online things, which I appreciate. And then there is I Has PC… or there isn’t I Has PC, as the site no longer responds. But is sent me a bit of traffic right up until the very end. More Frivolous Data We’ll start once again with the top ten categories of posts here, and the change since last year. Out of 104 total categories, a number unchanged since last year, these are, were, and remain, the most used. Null Sec, which is a sub-category, made it on to the list this year. Meanwhile, Sony Online Entertainment, a category that hasn’t been valid or used for the last decade, that finally fell off the top ten. Then there are tags, which represent the land of chaos. Tags I slap on a post at a whim, as a joke, as a futile attempt to signal tone or intention. And sometimes I use tags for games I am not sure quite deserve a category yet. No Man’s Sky is only a tag so far. So there are 5,065 tags used on the blog, up 287 from last year. For tags I feel like I have to do a top 20 just to get some scope. As always, the category often drives the tags used. If I write more EVE Online posts than anything else, then there are more EVE Online related tags. And, as I have done in the past, here are the tags I have used exactly 19 times over the last 19 years. It turns out there are ten of them. I actually know what all of those are related to. Last year I had a couple of “uh?” items on the list. What Do People Read Here? Here are the Top 20 most viewed posts over the last 12 months here on the site: That tells you what is popular, or at least what Google sends me. I seem to be answering some Pokemon Go questions for people, with five posts on the list. I am also interested to see how much No Man’s Sky traction I have gotten. As a game I haven’t elevated it to its own category yet because I have only written 16 posts with the associated tag, and a couple of those are month in review summaries. Maybe I should fix that. I gave Elite Dangerous a category slot and only used it four times. Certainly NMS has gotten more play time out of me. Also, I seem to have hit a nerve with my iTunes post. That was… last week, and it made the top 20 for the last 12 months? Then there is the ALL TIME TOP 20 posts list. First of all, I doubt I will ever have another post pass the 50K page view mark. The three that are up there are cemented by having been popular during the peak era of the blog. The average number of page views for the top 500 posts, which is all WP.com will let me see, is 1,457. The average for all 7,572 posts is probably double digits, even with Alamo and the Play On Guild Name Generator sitting above 60K. There are a lot of posts with 5 page views. There are also some classics in there. The EVE Online tutorial post, which was the fourth post on the site, and the first one addressing a game I was actively playing… well, it was a different time. No screen shots, just ire. I have suggested that it was my desire to rant about that tutorial that finally drove me to start a blog. Otherwise, that is a load of stuff that Google liked at one point or another. The Inevitable Summing Up Sometimes I arrive at this point in these annual posts and wonder aloud if I should take a break, not write so much, or change up what I write about. But if you’ve read down this far you’re not falling for that. I can’t even fool myself on that front anymore. Hell, last year I said I might not bother to do an annual review post, but here I am, Mister Unreliable Narrator. No matter how tired I am at the end of the day, I somehow always have something I want to post about. And it is even about video games most days! My goal, which I ended up setting a year or two in when I decided to reign in chaos and maybe have a plan, was to have a post on every week day, leaving aside weekends for overflow or non-gaming topics of whatever. I have somehow exceeded that plan… to the point that I have posted every day for the last 1,993 days in a row, or every day since March 29, 2020. Maybe I could give up on that streak… though, again, just seven more days for a round number. Really, though, I am wondering what I should do for the 20th next year. Open to ideas. Just 12 months to work that out. I started reading during the Casino War. The blog epitomized that Eve is a game I love reading about but never want to play. I stayed for the WoW and “history of Silicon Valley” content. Now you’re now a daily read for me. Congrats on 19 years! LikeLike Congratulations for the milestone. When it comes to the referral stats I’ve always wondered what it counts old school accessing via a favourite/ manually typing in the address – which is what I still mostly doing But yes, I can quite see your blog now being a resource for EVE history (and MMOs in general) quite similar to reviewing old newspapers. A contemporaneous record which reminds me, in a strange way, of some of the mediaeval annals I used to study at university. Which also used to have digressions onto this and that, just like your blog does. Anyways, hope you have a good twentieth year, and that these virtual worlds allow you to escape at least now and then from the “real” world, whatever the hell that is anymore. LikeLike Grats on another year. I do rememner when you were wondering out loud how much longer you’d go on. Glad to hear that’s stopped! Shame to hear I Has PC has folded. I thought I’d seen a couple of comments by Isey here and there, this year. I tried to look something up on Herding Cats the other day and Liore’s gone too. Confusingly, there is an unrelated blog called I Like Herding Cats… Still, I keep them all in that so-useful Blogger blogroll because if any of the dead ones ever sputter back into life, they pop up right back at the top and everyne knows about it. It’s like a public service now… LikeLike Well done. If in Australia your blog would be starting its second year of legally being able to drink alcohol. While I might go research something you have said – I don’t recall ever fact checking you, so I missed the wheel of time test. LikeLike Congrats! Has your blog signed up for Selective Service yet? LikeLike I had to look that up… and I guess it is still a thing. I did that 42 years ago. LikeLiked by 1 person My son had to do that when he turned 18, but my daughters are still exempt. I’m counting down the days until he turns 26 so he’s no longer eligible, but that also means he’ll no longer be on my insurance. LikeLike Proud to link to you from both my blogs! And I just wanted to say I also find your “posting to mark various events/milestones” useful, even as someone who doesn’t play EVE. There has been more than one occasion when I’d wonder about something like “didn’t I read about Everquest doing something like that once” and your blog is often a great place to verify random MMO trivia like that. I’ve also found your whole attitude towards blogging inspiring and am definitely emulating it a bit in the sense that I also post about many things with an eye to wanting to be able to have a reference point in the future.

Title: Asset Managers Point to Dangers of ‘Over-Customization’ of Portfolios

“Personalization gone too far I think erodes the value of really great active management with really great risk management wrapped around it,” said one asset manager. September 12, 2025 Over the last five years, direct indexing has been talked about as the next frontier in investment management, and demand for these strategies continues to rise. As of the end of 2024, there were $864.3 billion in direct indexing strategies, according to Cerulli Associates. Several asset managers, speaking at the Future Proof Festival in Huntington Beach, Calif., this week, confirmed the demand for personalized and customized investment strategies. But they also warned against “over-customization.” “Personalization can mean vastly different things when it comes to investing,” said Andrea Lisher, head of Americas, Client, J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “If you look at long-term track records, it’s very, very difficult to beat the markets, and if every individual could do that—do their own thing—you wouldn’t need firms like ours who spend hundreds of millions of dollars on research and traders and risk managers and generating alpha.” Lisher said it’s one thing if a client wants to invest based on their personal values and they’re willing to make the tradeoffs, or if a client has a concentrated stock position. “That’s not what I’m talking about,” she said. “I’m talking about the notion that personalization has gone too far, I think, erodes the value of really great active management with really great risk management wrapped around it.” Related:AI Disruption Fear Sparks Investor Scrutiny of Software Stocks She added that direct indexing must be a delicate balance of art and science, and it’s very difficult to get right. Jaime Magyera, head of BlackRock’s U.S. Wealth Advisory business, said it comes down to client segments. “For let’s call it 80% of investors out there, a strategic asset allocation, long-term asset allocation that’s diversified across equities and fixed income is the path to success,” she said. “There is a segment—that high-net-worth investor, someone who has deep beliefs—where they want to align the S&P 500 but they want to customize that.” The tax management aspect of direct indexing is designed for high-net-worth investors, she said, who actually have enough capital gains to benefit from the strategy. It’s not for everyone. “I worry about getting a little overcustomized, overpersonalized and over-direct indexed when a portfolio of ETFs across equity and fixed income with a strategic asset allocation is a very fine solution,” she said. Kristie Feinberg, president and CEO of Manulife John Hancock Investments, agreed that personalization has different meanings for different people, and that overcustomization could be an issue. But she said there’s a real benefit to providing tailored solutions, and technology can make it easier. Related:Powell Opens Door to Interest Rate Cut, Citing Labor Markets “I do think there is a real need for personalization within portfolios,” she said. “That’s what we do today; we create plans that are personalized. To be able to do that in a way that brings in technology to make it more efficient, to make it more effective, is where you’re going to see the real power.” Both BlackRock and J.P. Morgan have made big bets on direct indexing. In 2020, BlackRock announced its acquisition of Aperio, a creator of tailored index strategies. That same year, J.P. Morgan announced plans to acquire 55ip, a fintech startup that provides advisors with automated tax technology and a tax-smart investment strategy engine. BlackRock’s Magyera said direct indexing is one of the fastest-growing areas of the market, especially for higher-net-worth clients looking for real after-tax returns. “If you’re going to win with that segment, you do need to have differentiated, unique solutions, like direct indexing, like option overlays.” Diana Britton Executive Editor, WealthManagement.com Diana Britton is the Executive Editor of WealthManagement.com, covering independent broker/dealers and RIAs from all angles.

Title: This 12% CEF Could Be Gen Z’s Next Investing Obsession
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/09/12/this-12-cef-could-be-gen-zs-next-investing-obsession/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T14:21:00Z

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. We all know that stocks can rise on nothing but hype for long periods. But at the end of the day, it all comes back to one thing: profits! If they don’t rise, the stock will tank. It’s just a matter of time. Consider the case of Peloton Interactive (PTON). When the pandemic had everyone exercising indoors, speculators piled into the stock, hoping that soaring earnings would ignite the company’s value. Peloton’s net income was deep in the red then. Fast-forward to today, and it’s still negative. The stock has, of course, dropped to reflect that. What I’m getting at here is the idea that a stock can gain on hopes of future earnings, but that only lasts for so long. When investors give up hope, losses are inevitable. Of course, that isn’t the only way to make money in stocks. Those who invest based on the idea that profits will rise in the future can make a profit. Look no further than Peloton itself: Anyone who bought in 2020 with the expectation that demand for that stock would rise in the coming months made a bundle. Indeed, there were over 400% gains within a year for the most aggressive traders. Can we play this supply/demand game with high-yielding assets like closed-end funds (CEFs)? Yes. One way to do so is to buy a CEF when its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) is wide, and market fears are peaking. Consider the 27.3% price gain the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), a holding of my CEF Insider service, saw as its discount narrowed from 13% in October 2024 to 7.7% now. The gain in the market price was just part of the story—BSTZ’s NAV also rose. That’s why CEFs tend to be solid long-term investments: We get upside from the appreciation of the portfolio and gains in the market price as investors bid it up, cutting the discount. I bring all of this up now because I’m expecting demand for CEFs—especially tech-focused CEFs like BSTZ—to rise in the years ahead. The source of that demand may surprise you: younger investors—particularly Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012. Now, “young investors” and “dividends” aren’t often mentioned in the same sentence, but that’s changing. Bloomberg recently reported that dividends are increasingly catching young people’s attention. In a September 4, 2025, article, reporters Denitsa Tsekova and Vildana Hajric write: As a result, Bloomberg reports, Gen Z is moving away from the riskier investments that dominated the headlines in recent years and turning to more staid payouts that older investors have used to obtain financial independence for over a century: dividends! “Unlike meme stocks or crypto moonshots, this strategy—what might be referred to as dividends and chill [italics mine]— preaches control and consistency, a monthly drip over flash-in-the-pan riches,” Bloomberg continues. “Not YOLO, just yield.” There is a key difference between how young and older investors are approaching dividends, however. Right now, according to Bloomberg, Gen Z is focusing on ETFs that “offering eye-popping yields generated by complex derivatives.” These, of course, come with their own risks. Consider the 66.6%-yielding (not a typo) YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (TSLY), which has attracted a billion dollars in assets because the fund buys Tesla (TSLA) shares, sells covered calls on them, and passes the income to investors. The good news? It isn’t losing money. The bad news, though, is it’s returned a paltry 17% in the last three years with dividends reinvested. Nonetheless, an interesting thing is likely to happen as young investors start to collect dividends (even outlandish ones like this): They’re likely to want more. And when they mature a little, they’re likely to pivot to sustainable high yields from funds like BSTZ, whose total return (in orange below) that far exceeds that of TSLY over this same time period. Not only does BSTZ boast a high yield and stronger performance than TSLY, but it also trades at that 7.7% discount to NAV, too! (ETFs, for their part, never trade at discounts, as we CEF buyers know well.) It makes no sense for a high-yield, high-return fund like BSTZ to trade for less than the value of its assets. When Gen Z recognizes this, the savviest of them will likely buy in, boosting the fund’s market price and narrowing its discount. By purchasing BSTZ today, we can set ourselves up to capture the profits from that future demand while we enjoy the fund’s high yield.

Title: BlackRock eyes tokenized crypto ETFs and stocks – Report

Analyst questioned the potential impact of tokenized market BlackRock wants to expand beyond its BUIDL tokenized money market fund and bring crypto ETFs, stocks, and others on-chain. Is the financial market revolution here? BlackRock is reportedly exploring expanding its tokenized product line to cover its popular crypto and other exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to a report by Bloomberg, the world’s largest asset manager is mulling going all in on the segment and bringing even stocks on-chain to be traded as digital tokens. However, the plan would be subject to regulatory approval, per the report, citing people familiar with the matter. In less than two years since launching its spot Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs, BlackRock’s crypto holdings have surged to $100 billion. Its first tokenized money market fund, BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Liquidity Fund), was launched in March 2024. Now, the product has a market cap of $2.2 billion, held by 90 firms and is spread across six chains. Early this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said, ‘Every asset can be tokenized…If that happens, investing will be revolutionized. Markets would never need to close. Settlements would be instantaneous.” He added that it would be the most ‘disruptive innovation since ETFs.’ However, some critics still questioned the value of such a move. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the ‘on-chain’ group was still too small to warrant the hype. “I don’t see the value add for the consumer to get them to switch. ETFs are always underestimated.” Source: X Interestingly, Nasdaq also asked for the SEC to allow it to list tokenized equities with equal rights as traditional shareholders. That said, tokenized stocks will still be securities, according to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. Hence, they must still follow securities law. But the regulators are racing to offer clear rules for the road amid increasing interest in the segment.

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Minute Media, a sports-focused media holding company backed by BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, has acquired VideoVerse, an Indian AI startup that specializes in extracting highlights and creating content from sports footage. The acquisition, announced on Monday, is considered the largest for Minute Media in terms of value and size. VideoVerse, founded in 2016 by Vinayak Shrivastav, Saket Dandotia, and Alok Patil, has raised $105 million to date from investors such as Bluestone Equity Partners, A91 Partners, Alpha Wave, Evolvence India, and Moneta Ventures. While the exact valuation of the acquisition remains undisclosed, sources indicate that VideoVerse was valued between $200 million and $250 million during its last funding round in 2023. The Mumbai-based startup initially developed various AI tools, including those for detecting smoking and drinking scenes in movies, and object identification for e-commerce sites. However, in 2016, VideoVerse shifted its focus to building video editing and detection tools for sports broadcasters, starting with a project for Hotstar (now owned by Jio) to identify specific action points in cricket. VideoVerse operates as a SaaS tool, charging based on the number of footage hours processed. The company has grown to $65 million in revenue with a healthy EBITDA margin of 35% to 40%. Recently, VideoVerse launched new AI-powered tools that allow clients to automatically generate content by defining rules, such as creating a package of all three-pointers made by a specific basketball player for social media publication. Minute Media plans to leverage VideoVerse’s technology along with its own publisher network, which includes properties like Sports Illustrated, The Players’ Tribune, and 90 Minutes, to distribute content more effectively and generate ad revenue. The sports media company reaches over 200 million monthly users and offers a B2B platform used by nearly 500 publishers. Asaf Peled, CEO of Minute Media, stated, “With VideoVerse, we can pitch an AI suite for content creation to our customers, then add our distribution and monetization capabilities to get more value out of the content.” The acquisition will enable Minute Media to attract more U.S.-based leagues to its highlight-generating platform, responding to a market shift where fans seek diverse content beyond traditional coverage, especially on mobile devices. Peled added that although the company is not actively seeking funding now, it may pursue further funding rounds in the coming quarters for additional acquisitions.

For energy, the North Field expansion is still proceeding toward 126 mtpa by 2027, with trains already financed and contractors committed. The risk is more in the realm of perception: insurers, banks, and buyers may begin to build a sovereignty-breach premium into contracts. Watch for whether the Saudis or Emiratis lean toward treating the strike as an aberration or as a tolerated precedent. If they quietly normalize it, markets may read Doha as more exposed. If they close ranks around Qatar’s sovereignty, that reassures investors that the strike was a one-off shock. By Friday morning, Qatar was kicking the diplomatic posturing into overdrive. It’s a delicate balancing act. Doha’s posture has to be precisely calibrated. The foreign ministry denounced the strike as “state terrorism” and vowed legal action. Doha is explicitly putting itself in damage-control mode, trying to preserve its mediation legitimacy while positioning Israel as the aggressor. Qatar needs to show its domestic and regional audience that it will not be cowed, but it also cannot abandon the one role that keeps Washington and European capitals invested in its utility. Doha’s narrative is that hosting Hamas was always transparent and coordinated with the U.S. and Israel, shifting blame back onto Netanyahu. The calculation is to rally Gulf and Arab partners around sovereignty while reminding Washington that undermining Qatar also undermines hostage and ceasefire channels. Adani Ports, which controls India’s largest private port network, has now barred any vessel under U.S., EU, or UK sanctions from calling at its facilities. Agents must certify that ships are clean of designations before berthing. Mundra, Adani’s flagship port, is a key entry point for Russian crude handled by IOC and HPCL-Mittal; those flows will now face new friction. Refiners can reroute via non-Adani ports or source non-designated tonnage, but costs will rise and scheduling will tighten. The move is significant because India’s formal policy has been to ignore unilateral Western sanctions and only respect UN mandates. A private operator is effectively tightening compliance on its own, underlining the liability calculus of global finance and insurers. Washington will interpret this as success based on Trump’s pressure. Moscow will see another crack in India’s ability to shield its imports. For India’s refiners, the adjustment is immediate: higher freight and insurance premiums, more reliance on gray-fleet tonnage, and the risk of cargo delays. Longer term, it marginally weakens Russia’s grip on India’s oil basket and nudges refiners to keep Middle East and African barrels in reserve. Discovery & Development Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) struck oil again in the Potwar region, chalking up its second big find in the Dhok Sultan Block, District Attock. The Dhok Sultan-03 well, spudded in January and drilled to 5,815m, is the second deepest oil strike in fractured carbonate formations in the area. Initial tests showed strong flows — 1,469 bpd oil and 2.56 mmscfd gas on a tighter choke, rising to 2,113 bpd and 4.13 mmscfd on a wider one. PPL holds 75% in the block with Government Holdings (Pvt) Ltd (GHPL) at 25%, calling the discovery a major milestone for both partners. Shell has cut a farm-out deal offshore São Tomé & Príncipe, handing Petrobras big stakes in frontier ultra-deepwater Blocks 10, 11, and 13 while keeping 40% and operatorship. ANP-STP retains 15% across the blocks, with Galp holding 20% in Block 11. The acreage sits in the Gulf of Guinea, an emerging “elephant play” zone that’s drawing major attention despite its frontier risk. Petrobras sees the move as a way to rebuild reserves and diversify, while Shell trims exposure but stays in control of a potentially giant prize. MOL and O&GD have hit oil at Galgahévíz-4 in Hungary’s Mogyoród concession, flowing about 1,000 bpd from 2,400m depth after a 37-day drill. The crude is processed at MOL’s Danube Refinery, with volumes split 51/49 between O&GD and MOL, and represents roughly 4% of MOL’s domestic oil output. The find underscores MOL’s push to boost supply security as Hungary still leans heavily on imports, adding to a string of recent discoveries at Vecsés and Somogysámson plus 25 shallow gas successes since 2019. The timing dovetails with the 60th anniversary of the Algy? field, still a supply pillar, now being paired with renewables as MOL builds a 37.4 MWp solar park and 40 MWh storage system to cut emissions and green its legacy hub. BP has walked away from the Pau Brasil block in Brazil’s Santos basin after its much-hyped pre-salt wildcat failed to deliver a commercial find. The company re-entered Brazil in mid-2024 after more than a decade away, drilling with the Valaris DS-15, but results showed only traces of oil in 2,283m water depth. Pau Brasil was part of a production sharing contract, and BP has now relinquished the acreage back to ANP. The move contrasts with BP’s recent pre-salt success elsewhere in Brazil, showing how hit-or-miss frontier drilling in the basin remains. ReconAfrica has inked a PSC with Gabon for the 1,214 sq km Ngulu Block C-7 in shallow water, positioning itself as operator with 55% alongside Record Resources (20%), Gabon Oil Co. (15%), and the state (10%). The block holds the historic Loba discovery, drilled in 1976 with 140m gross pay, plus 28 mapped prospects in Gamba-Dentale plays likened to the Gulf of Mexico. Recon plans geological work, 3D seismic reprocessing, and at least one well during the initial 4-year term, with an option to extend. Loba alone is thought capable of flowing 20,000 b/d, making the block a potentially material addition to Gabon’s offshore profile. Mergers and Acquisitions BlackRock and a Gulf-backed consortium are in advanced talks to raise ~$10.3B for Aramco’s midstream assets, according to sources cited today. The financing push signals strong institutional appetite despite higher global rates, and gives Riyadh another lever to monetize pipelines without ceding equity control. The structure also keeps Western capital tied into Saudi energy infrastructure at a time when Aramco is under pressure to fund expansion, dividends, and domestic megaprojects simultaneously. A $215M merger between Pelican Acquisition, Greenland Exploration, and March GL has created Greenland Energy Co., the first U.S.-listed firm dedicated to developing Greenland’s Jameson Land Basin. ARCO once spent $275M mapping the basin and left behind 1,800 km of seismic and infrastructure, now reprocessed by March GL to identify 50+ drillable targets. Greenland Energy holds rights to up to 70% of three licenses spanning 2M acres, with Halliburton tapped for drilling and heavy equipment already mobilized for the first well site. Executives pitched the venture as both a watershed for Greenland and a strategic play for U.S. and allied energy security in one of the Arctic’s richest undrilled basins. Westgate Energy has scrapped its planned $5.1M (C$7M) acquisition of Mannville Stack assets in East-Central Alberta after failing to secure required third-party consents. The vendor returned Westgate’s C$700K deposit plus interest, ending the deal that would have added 14.5 sections and 57 potential horizontal well locations near Frog Lake. The move comes as Westgate focuses on its own drilling program, where three new wells are still cleaning up and showing promising early rates, with a follow-up campaign at Beaverdam slated for Q4. Management stressed it remains committed to its Mannville Stack growth strategy, calling the play one of the best oil economics in Western Canada. EQV Ventures Acquisition Corp. and Presidio Petroleum have filed with the SEC to merge in a $660M deal that will create Presidio Production Company, a dividend-focused C-Corp set to list on the NYSE under ticker FTW. The transaction is set to close in Q4 2025 and will build on Presidio’s strategy of optimizing mature, low-decline wells for steady cash flow rather than drilling new ones. Anglo American and Teck are merging in a $50B (£36B) deal to form Anglo Teck, headquartered in Vancouver but keeping a London listing. The combined miner will be 70% weighted to copper, with iron ore and zinc rounding out the portfolio, and Anglo shareholders will get a $4.5B special dividend. Anglo will hold 62.4% of the new company, which expects $800M in annual synergies by year four, with CEO Duncan Wanblad leading and Teck’s Jonathan Price as deputy. The move triggered political backlash in the UK as a hit to London’s business standing, though investors sent Anglo’s stock up 7.8% on the news. To access this exclusive content...

Today's top news: Wall Street’s biggest asset manager is about to take tokenization mainstream. Bloomberg reported that BlackRock is preparing to tokenize ETFs and other real-world asset (RWA) funds, expanding beyond its existing on-chain cash management product, BUIDL. The move is pending regulatory approval, but it represents a major step toward bringing traditional investment vehicles onto blockchain rails. BlackRock launched BUIDL with Securitize in 2024, giving institutions tokenized exposure to U.S. Treasuries. Now, the firm wants to extend that model to ETFs and additional fund structures, which would mark the first time a traditional manager has tokenized mainstream funds at scale. Potential types of funds include: These sectors represent Trillions in assets ($12.5T in Q2 2025 to be exact). And a huge chunk of them (maybe eventually all) are coming on-chain. “Just like everyone downplaying digital assets being proven wrong over the last decade. Those downplaying tokenization will likely be proven wrong as well” - James Seyffart, Bloomberg “BlackRock is tokenizing their ETFs and you're bearish? Everything will be tokenized.” -Graeme Moore, Head of Strategy at Project 11 reminder: all ETFs and all equities will eventually be tokenized because assets will naturally flow to where they can be used as the most efficient collateral and most of that lending/borrowing will happen on Ethereum L1/L2 https://t.co/ulTmfcsBRA — DCinvestor (@iamDCinvestor) September 12, 2025 So why do we care about tokenization of real world assets? Tokenized ETFs would: And bringing these assets onchain grows the overall crypto market cap. No, it doesn’t mean that new liquidity will flock to every alt L1 or meme coin. But it’s not a stretch to think it will flow to the best assets, and it will certainly send stablecoinx up significantly. DeFi assets would likely win as well. And there’s a real chance that most of these funds are tokenized on Ethereum (where BUIDL is). If that’s the case, ETH is likely the biggest winner here. So this is a big one to root for the regulators to approve. And once BlackRock gets the approval and executes, everyone else will follow.

September 12, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited TORONTO, Sept. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (“BlackRock Canada”), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”) (NYSE: BLK) is announcing changes to two funds. Index Methodology Changes for iShares Exponential Technologies Index ETF The iShares Exponential Technologies Index ETF (“XEXP”) currently seeks to replicate the performance of the Morningstar Exponential Technologies Index (the “Index”), net of expenses. XEXP is expected to experience higher than normal portfolio turnover due to upcoming changes to the evaluation process used to determine the composition of the Index. The composition of the Index will change as part of regularly scheduled rebalances (the “Rebalances”) of the Index on September 19, 2025 and December 19, 2025. Morningstar, Inc. (“Morningstar”), the index provider of the Index, announced on June 6, 2025, that: (1) the Index will be reviewed quarterly in March, June, September and December instead of annually in December; (2) the exponential technology themes will be updated to replace the big data & analytics, hyperconnectivity, and energy transition themes with the artificial intelligence, cybersecurity & defense technology and energy innovation themes; the cloud computing and nanotechnology themes will be removed from the Index; and (3) the Index will transition from being an equal weighted index to a float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index with the weight of each constituent issuer capped at 4% and the weight of each exponential technology theme capped at 25%. As a result of the Rebalances, XEXP may experience higher than normal transaction costs and realize net capital gains. Annual Management Fee Reduction for iShares India Index ETF Effective on September 12, 2025, the annual management fee of the iShares India Index ETF (“XID”) will change as follows: This action is part of the firm’s regular review of its pricing strategy to reflect continued growth in its product offerings and ability to leverage its scale to benefit investors.

Title: BlackRock to arrange up to $10.3bn for Aramco’s Jafurah gas development

Time Published: 2025-09-12T09:24:21Z
Full Content:
A consortium led by Global Infrastructure Partners, part of BlackRock, is in negotiations with several banks to secure up to $10.3bn in financing for Aramco’s Jafurah gas development deal, reported Reuters, citing two sources familiar with the matter. JPMorgan and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking are among the financial institutions in discussions to support the transaction. Combine business intelligence and editorial excellence to reach engaged professionals across 36 leading media platforms. Find out more The funding arrangement is expected to be divided into short-term and long-term loans. Under the terms of the agreement, a new subsidiary, Jafurah Midstream Gas Company (JMGC), will be responsible for leasing the development and usage rights of gas processing facilities within the Jafurah gas field. These rights will then be leased back to Aramco for a duration of 20 years. This deal follows last month’s $11bn leaseback agreement involving Aramco’s Jafurah gas processing facilities. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The Jafurah field, the largest non-associated gas development in Saudi Arabia, is expected to hold 229 trillion standard cubic feet of raw gas and 75 billion stock tank barrels of condensate. Aramco intends to increase its gas production capacity by 60% from 2021 to 2030 to address the growing requirement for gas. JMGC will receive tariffs from Aramco in exchange for exclusive rights to process and treat raw gas from the field. Aramco will maintain a 51% ownership in JMGC, with the remaining 49% held by the investor group. The parties involved, including Aramco, BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, have declined to comment on the financing details.

(PTI) JioBlackRock Mutual Fund on Thursday said that it would launch its first active equity product, JioBlackRock FlexiCap Fund, on the Systematic Active Equity platform on September 23. However, he did not set any collection target for this fund during the initial offer period. “This is our first active equity fund. Three or four other active equity funds are in the pipeline, which may see the light of day this fiscal. Other products, including ETFs, will follow in due course,” JioBlackRock AMC chief investment officer Rishi Kohli said. The fund, built on BlackRock’s globally proven SAE platform, follows a rules-based and predominantly machine-driven process tracking 400 signals. About 95 per cent of the investment process will be technology-driven, aiming to eliminate key-person risk, reduce cognitive biases, and ensure disciplined fund management. The SAE Flexi-Cap Fund will maintain a controlled active risk of no more than 3-4 per cent, lower than industry averages, with a focus on downside risk protection and consistent returns for investors. Kohli said a 10-year simulation indicated the model could deliver 3-4 per cent outperformance over the benchmark index, similar to results achieved in other BlackRock country funds. “In an uncertain market environment, where equity markets have been tough, we believe it’s a good time to launch a product that manages risk on the lower side compared to other active funds and still aims for attractive alpha in the long run,” Kohli said. JioBlackRock, the partnership between Jio Financials and the world's largest asset managers BlackRock, received its license in May and currently manages around ₹18,000 crore in assets across eight cash and index funds. The fund house will continue to focus on digital distribution in the near term. The official, however, did not comment on AUM targets or a break-even timeline.

While the crypto market’s broader bullish sentiment is being driven by the strong possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut decision, the tokens' rise coincides with BlackRock’s plans to introduce exchange-traded funds onto public blockchains, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Ondo is up nearly 10% on the day to $1.10 after clocking more than 21% gains this week, CoinGecko data shows. Thursday's gains follow last week's launch of tokenized versions of more than 100 U.S.-listed stocks, ETFs, and other equities on Ethereum via the DeFi protocol's Global Markets platform. Lai Yuen, investment analyst at Fischer8 Capital, told Decrypt Ondo’s price rise is likely driven by “excitement around tokenized stocks.” Onboarded partners and advisors for Ondo’s Global Markets, which includes the likes of WisdomTree, have helped grow the platform by $160 million in TVL over nine days. That all but “underscores the project’s strong early traction,” Yuen said. Ondo Finance's total value locked, meanwhile, has nearly tripled since the start of 2025, growing from $611 million to $1.57 billion, DefiLlama data shows. The long-term outlook remains bullish, according to Yuen, who posits that even if the project captures 10% of the stock market, it would translate to “substantial fee generation for Ondo token holders.” “The project’s regulatory moat, bolstered by its advisory board, provides a durable long-term advantage that will be difficult for competitors to replicate,” he said.

Title: Trailblazer Tania Rosser brings a different school of thought to Gonzaga head coach role
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/09/12/trailblazer-tania-rosser-brings-a-different-school-of-thought-to-gonzaga-head-coach-role/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
It’s a Thursday afternoon, Tania Rosser is on her way to Gonzaga College in Ranelagh, south Dublin, to take training for the senior cycle rugby players. First though, before they hit the pitches, about 50 of those pupils will do yoga, an innovation she has introduced since taking the position of head coach to the Senior Cup team during the summer. It’s a statement appointment, and not in a headline-courting manner. In coming through an interview process conducted by principal Damien McCaul and vice principal Stephen Carey, she wasn’t just the best woman for the position – she was the preferred and best applicant. The New Zealand native, who arrived in Ireland 23 years ago, played international rugby across three different codes – touch, sevens and XVs. She won 58 caps for Ireland and participated in three World Cups, during the last of which she came out of retirement to help orchestrate Ireland’s victory over New Zealand in 2014. Rosser was a player-coach at DLSP and Blackrock College, coached J1 (seconds) men’s team and did skills work with the AIL squad in Clontarf. She coached the women’s team in Old Belvedere and several of the Irish touch rugby international teams before leading the Leinster women to back-to-back interprovincial titles during a three-year tenure that started in 2021. Her passion for rugby stems from childhood. The youngest of five siblings to Denis and Nancy, she grew up on a “massive farm” in Hawke’s Bay before the family subsequently moved into the town of Hastings when she was a little older. Brothers Ray and Dan were sent to boarding school and the only time she got to see them was at rugby matches on weekends. Rosser admits to being the tiresome little sister, a shadow for her brothers who were eight and 10 years older. She wanted to play rugby but her parents forbade it, directing her towards netball and basketball, at which she excelled. She used to sneak out to play rugby until she was caught and grounded. That rebellious streak – the refusal to have other people define her boundaries – has travelled with her in life. She badgered her father to set up a touch rugby footie team, to legitimise her participation. The first time her parents saw her play rugby was for Ireland in a 43-0 defeat to France at the 2006 World Cup in Edmonton, Canada. She wanted to be a police officer but qualified as a primary schoolteacher at the behest of her mother, who thought the former occupation was too dangerous. She then moved to Ireland with her husband Simon Broughton, who had received a rugby-playing offer from Ballymena in the All-Ireland League. It was supposed to be two years but relocating to Dublin changed the plan. Simon – now the Leinster Academy manager – played with DLSP and Leinster, as did Tania. Her first coach at the Kilternan club was George Hook. During Covid she enrolled in a high-performance coaching course with World Rugby. Former England and Australia backs coach Scott Wisemantel was one of the mentors, while she got to do online workshops with former Ireland coach Eddie O’Sullivan and New Zealand mental skills guru Gilbert Enoka. When her three years at Leinster finished, she was on the lookout for another challenge and decided to pursue the position at Gonzaga. Long-time Senior Cup team (SCT) coach Declan Fassbender, who led his alma mater to three Senior Cup finals including a first ever success in 2023, vacated the role to concentrate on coaching Lansdowne. So why Gonzaga? “I just decided to throw my name in, send in my CV in and see what would come of it. “I (was) really disappointed that I couldn’t keep going with Leinster. So, I was looking for a new challenge and thought why not apply? I got the interview, went in and met the principal and deputy principal and had an honest conversation. They seemed open to it.” She’s not the first woman to be involved in coaching an SCT team, even in Ranelagh. Sandford Park school, a middling punt from the entrance to Gonzaga, had former New Zealand sevens and rugby league international Mere Baker – she also worked with the Railway Union club at the time – as part of their senior coaching team in the early to mid-2010s. Rosser started working with her new charges during the summer. “The boys started doing strength and conditioning in July, about 40 kids. I thought it would be a good idea to go in, sit with them, meet them one-on-one, find out what’s driving them, what they like about rugby, what they don’t like about rugby, just asking them a bit about themselves. “And just having that opportunity to say to them, look, my job is to make sure that they’re okay as people first. If they’re not well, or if they’re struggling in school or something, it’s okay – just come and tell me before training, and then we know that you’re off. “Sometimes when these players turn up, we don’t know what’s happening at home or at school, or if they’ve had a hard day. And a lot of times these kids don’t get to say it because they’re too afraid. It’s taken the boys a while to warm to being open with their feelings but there has been a little purchase of late.” Rosser’s principles in coaching young people is refreshing. “My whole thing is, there has to be life after this (schools rugby) for them. Too many kids don’t go on and play club rugby after the Senior Cup because they’re beaten up or broken, or they haven’t enjoyed it. “So how can I keep them, give them longevity, because there’s a long journey in their life and rugby career, if they continue to play club rugby. It’s just a holistic approach. It’s probably very different from other Senior Cup teams and I’m okay with it. I’m okay with people going ‘she’s mad’ or ‘this is ridiculous’. “I don’t care what people think outside the programme or the environment. I look at doing things differently – bringing in yoga, making the boys bring recovery food to every single session before they get on the pitch, checking in with them. “I like using different approaches. I shared with them my journey growing up, you know, facing racism (her mum is Maori), and being on an isolated farm, so they got a sense of who I was. The most important thing I said, the first thing is, I’m a mum. “By the time we get through this campaign, you’ll be like my kid. If you need me, if you give me all you can, I’ll always have your back, on and off the pitch. It’s just how I am with players.” Rosser looks to empower them on the pitch too. Her coaching operandi is inclusive rather than despotic. She’s had conversations with the boys, teasing out options for the game plan on the basis that if they don’t work, they can be discarded. It’s an interaction that wouldn’t be commonplace. At home there is a fair amount of rugby talk with Simon as Leinster academy manager and her son Serge, a pupil at St Andrew’s College and part of the Leinster Under-19s squad. He’s a scrumhalf, like mum, “only better”, in her words. He’s named after the great French fullback Serge Blanco, whom both his parents loved as a player. Serge was very nearly called Fionn. Tania couldn’t pronounce the name adequately with her Kiwi accent, so her then-Ireland rugby teammates advised her not to go there. She’s never been cowed by how others perceive her and is excited for what lies ahead. Rosser doesn’t look at glass ceilings, she just does what she has to do because it never occurred to her not to. She has encountered misogyny, asked whether she was the physio or the manager, but it doesn’t ruffle her savoir-faire. In the past, she’s noticed that “between a male counterpart in my role and myself, I’d say that the male counterpart gets things a lot easier than I would”. She added: “And I’m okay with that. I’m okay with working to try and break down barriers. I’ll push the boundaries as far as I can, ask questions and try to make things better for our set-up.” The Gonzaga boys will be the latest beneficiaries of that mindset. From her childhood days, she’s had to persuade people to give her an opportunity and that she’d take care of the rest. The level of success that ensued speaks for itself. A trailblazer and a woman for others, to tweak the Jesuit mantra. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Avalanche Targets $1 Billion Fundraising Goal For Two AVAX Treasuries

Time Published: 2025-09-12T04:00:01Z

The Avalanche Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain ecosystem, is reportedly seeking to raise $1 billion through a major fundraising campaign to create two AVAX treasuries. This initiative aligns with a broader trend in the cryptocurrency space, where various organizations and traditional finance firms are experimenting with crypto treasury models to strengthen their financial stability and operational capabilities. According to the Financial Times, the Avalanche Foundation is in advanced talks to create two crypto treasuries in the United States. These moves come at a time when the foundation is gaining traction among institutional investors, with firms like BlackRock and Visa already utilizing the Avalanche blockchain for their operations. The foundation’s strategy involves launching one digital asset treasury company while converting an existing firm into a treasury vehicle. The goal is to secure approximately $1 billion, with the expectation to finalize these deals within weeks. The funds raised are earmarked for the acquisition of millions of AVAX tokens, which will be offered at a discounted price directly from the Avalanche Foundation. This approach is aimed to not only support the foundation’s growth but also to enhance the liquidity and market presence of AVAX amid an increasingly competitive treasury companies landscape. Per the report, the first fundraising deal aims to secure up to $500 million through a private investment led by Hivemind Capital, with expectations to finalize the agreement by the end of the month. Notably, Anthony Scaramucci, a crypto investor and former White House press secretary, is advising on this initiative. The second funding endeavor involves a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) sponsored by Dragonfly Capital, which is also targeting a $500 million raise. This deal may take longer to conclude, potentially stretching into October. Both initiatives will focus on purchasing discounted AVAX tokens held by the Avalanche Foundation, which has a total supply of 720 million tokens, with approximately 420 million currently circulating. The broader cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in fundraising activities this year. Companies have raised over $16 billion to stockpile crypto assets, often inspired by the successful Bitcoin (BTC) treasury model of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Tokens associated with other blockchains, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), have also seen significant price increases. These tokens were selected by major publicly traded companies in the US for their respective crypto-focused treasuries. Although AVAX has not experienced the same upward momentum, CoinGecko data shows that it has recorded gains of up to 17% in the weekly time frame. As of this writing, the AVAX price is approaching the key $30 mark, a level not seen since February of this year.

More Info Investors in Saudi Aramco’s Jafurah natural gas project have approached a group of lenders to secure $10.3 billion in funding for the project. Jafurah is at the center of Saudi Arabia’s plans to develop its natural gas resources, diversifying from crude oil. With a price tag of a total $100 billion, the Jafurah development is described as the largest unconventional gas development outside the United States. Its reserves are estimated at some 229 trillion cu ft of natural gas plus 75 billion barrels of condensate. Production has been scheduled to start in the current quarter. According to Reuters, BlackRock, via Global Infrastructure Partners, is in talks with potential lenders interested in funding the project. These include JP Morgan and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, unnamed sources in the know told the publication. The source said BlackRock will contribute $1.8 billion of its own money to the total. According to Bloomberg, which also cited unnamed sources, the funding has already been secured. Per the Bloomberg sources, the funding package consists of a seven-year loan that could be refinanced on the bond market and a 19-year loan facility. In addition to the abovementioned banks, the banks involved in the loans also include Citi, Mitsubishi UFJ, and Mizuho. The news of the loan deal comes a month after Aramco sealed a deal with Blackrock’s Global Infrastructure Partners to invest $11 billion in a lease deal for Jafurah. Under the agreement, the BlackRock-led group will lease midstream facilities that serve Jafurah and then lease them back to Aramco for 20 years. The two set up a subsidiary company to manage the midstream facilities that BlackRock will lease, in which Aramco got 51% and BlackRock got 49%. Earlier in the year, Aramco also announced the signing of a slew of contracts for the Phase 2 development of Jafurah. The contracts’ total value was $12.4 billion, to involve the construction of gas compression facilities and associated pipelines, expansion of the Jafurah Gas Plant—including the construction of gas processing trains—and utilities, sulfur, and export facilities. Another $8.8 billion worth of contractual work was awarded to companies that will expand the project’s Master Gas System to boost its total capacity by an additional 3.15 billion standard cubic feet per day by 2028 through the installation of around 4,000 km (2,485 miles) of pipelines and 17 new gas compression trains. The billions have been piling up as Aramco moves the project closer to commercial production. While not known for being stingy, Saudi Arabia has clearly made a priority of developing its natural gas reserves and not a moment too soon, either. Despite attempts by the climate change activist lobby to discourage natural gas use due to emissions—natural gas demand has been on a strong and steady rise. The latest driver of this demand, of course, is the artificial intelligence race between IT giants that everyone in forecasting expects will fuel a veritable surge in electricity demand. Just this week, the Energy Information Administration reiterated its prediction that electricity consumption in the United States this year and next will hit a record high. America’s power use will hit 4,187 billion kilowatt-hours in 2025 and then rise to 4,305 billion kWh in 2026, according to the latest edition of the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook. The previous record of 4,097 billion kWh was set in 2024. Gas demand is rising globally, too, opening up a growing market to Aramco, which plans to ramp up the country’s natural gas production by as much as 60% by 2030 from 2021 levels, when gas production stood at 10.1 billion cu ft, according to Aramco.

Title: LNG carbon bomb tops Carney’s list of major projects

Prime Minister Mark Carney hammers a few nails at a carpentry school before announcing five major projects as part of his plan for Canada to navigate changing trade relationships in Edmonton on Thursday September 11, 2025. Photo by: Amber Bracken / The Canadian Press A major carbon bomb sits atop Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first tranche of major projects, sparking backlash from environmental and Indigenous communities who say that doubling down on liquified natural gas is placing a dangerous bet on Canada’s future. The LNG Canada terminal in Kitimat, BC, is the primary way to export liquified natural gas (LNG) from the Montney Play. This region of British Columbia and Alberta is home to gas fields that, if fully tapped, would surpass Canada’s 2030 emissions targets 30 times over. It is a globally recognized “carbon bomb,” and LNG Canada Phase 2 — that doubles capacity at the site, making it the second largest facility of its kind in the world — was announced Thursday as a priority for Ottawa. The remaining projects include: The Darlington New Nuclear project in Ontario; The Port of Montreal’s Contrecœur terminal expansion in Quebec; McIlvenna Bay Foran Copper Mine project in Saskatchewan; Red Chris Mine expansion project in BC. Thursday’s announcement is a major step on a central campaign promise made by Carney to rapidly build major infrastructure. Speaking in Edmonton, he said the first batch of major projects would add $60 billion to the country’s economy. “For too long, when federal agencies have examined a project, their immediate question has been, ‘Why?’” Carney said. “From now on, Canada's new government starts by asking ourselves for major projects: How? How can we do it bigger? How can we do it faster?” Carney did not say how much federal financial support the companies building these projects would receive, but acknowledged projects would likely get some federal funding. Regardless, even by sending them to the newly launched Major Projects Office to help coordinate financing, public resources are being spent to push these projects over the finish line. The five projects Carney will now send to the Major Projects Office for review were already well under development, with some scheduled to begin operations next year. He acknowledged as much, noting that the first tranche of projects are owned by proponents who “have already done much of the hard work,” and “already meet many of the necessary regulatory standards.” In fact, government sources earlier told Canada’s National Observer that having the project already underway was one of two basic criteria used to choose the first round, making it easier for Ottawa to score political points for successfully completing it. The other was that the project is considered “stuck” in the regulatory process. “I'm not at all surprised they would pick projects that are already in the system,” said Martin Olszynski, an associate professor and chair of energy, resources and sustainability at the University of Calgary. “The idea is they'll be hustled the rest of the way.” At an estimated cost of $25 billion, LNG Canada Phase 2 is the largest in the first round of major projects. Environmental advocates and Indigenous leaders, key constituents and rights-holders who Carney has promised to respect, were quick to condemn it. Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs president, said in a statement he was “gravely concerned” that the federal government is “deliberately” sidestepping its duty to consult First Nations. “Rather than being met with partnership, we are given an ultimatum: accept fossil fuel expansion or be pushed aside,” he said. “LNG Canada is not only a massive source of greenhouse gas emissions, but also drives destructive fracking, further threatening our lands, waters and communities — emissions do not recognize territorial boundaries. “We reject any process that tramples our inherent and constitutionally protected title and rights, ignores free, prior and informed consent, and sacrifices the climate for foreign corporate profits,” he added. LNG Canada’s owners are Shell, Mitsubishi, the Korea Gas Corporation, Petronas and PetroChina. An analysis from TD described Carney’s inclusion of LNG Canada Phase 2 as “superficial support,” because whether or not the project actually goes ahead depends on its owners. The bank said it would have liked to have seen the Ksi Lisims LNG and related Prince Rupert Gas Transmission Pipeline projects included to indicate federal support for the LNG sector. An analysis from Clean Energy Canada, published last year, estimates the greenhouse gas emissions from the already operating LNG Canada site are economically devastating. Doubling the export terminals capacity dramatically increases that harm. Specifically, the think tank found that the annual social cost of carbon — a widely used metric to approximate economic damages (such as health care costs) per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions — estimates $11.1 billion in damages by 2030 and annual costs of $14.8 billion by 2050. If Phase 2 were built, by 2050 the annual social cost of carbon emissions from the LNG Canada site soars to $29.6 billion. Over the project’s decades-long lifecycle, both phases of the project amount to nearly $1 trillion in damages — a supreme liability hanging over the country’s head, following the International Court of Justice’s finding this summer that countries could be held responsible for knowingly committing climate harm. Beyond its climate harm, forecasts suggest a global supply glut of LNG is looming, making new investments economically risky. “It's not in our national interest to increase our carbon emissions when we've had devastating fires year after year,” said Richard Brooks, climate finance director with Stand.earth. “They're exactly the opposite of what we should be doing.” Olszynski said he understands why many will be upset about LNG Canada Phase 2’s inclusion, but given the economic system we have, it’s not surprising to see it included. Even if risking “white elephants” — a term for major stranded assets — if banks are willing to invest, projects are likely to see those investment dollars flow. “There's the world that we want, and the world as it is,” he said. There’s a constant tension in market-based economies between planning for the future and market forces looking to profit in the short term. “There will always be forces pushing for more planning [and] for more logic, and then there will be those who push very strongly against them, and say that is contrary to market principles where the market will decide, that markets are efficient, and that markets will figure this out.” “(Former prime minister) Trudeau probably was prepared to tip the scales more towards planning [than] the current prime minister,” he said. Given the trade threats from the United States and push to diversify Canada’s trading partners, alongside the state of the Canadian economy as is, Carney “is saying I can't keep pissing those guys off — the folks who control the purse strings.” The Darlington nuclear project is a multi-billion dollar investment in small modular reactors. Once in operation, Carney said it would drive $500 million annually into Ontario’s nuclear supply chain and provide enough electricity to power 1.2 million homes. Ontario Power Generation was granted a licence earlier this year to begin construction. The two mining projects in the first tranche, the McIlvenna Bay copper mine in Saskatchewan and the Red Chris copper and gold mine in northwestern BC, Carney said would strengthen Canada’s position in the global critical minerals trade. The Red Chris copper mine, owned by Colorado-headquartered Newmont — whose majority shareholders include powerful US financial firms Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street and Van Eck Associates — has been fought by conservation groups and First Nations warning of risks to the environment. In a letter filed with the BC government, the SkeenaWild Conservation Trust warns the planned expansion will lead to sulphate, copper and selenium concentrations “exceeding” BC water quality guidelines. Similarly, a letter from the Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska says “we are alarmed by reports of ongoing seepage at the Red Chris site and the failure to contain contaminated surface waters.” “This is an urgent matter that demands enforcement action — not expansion,” the letter adds. Foran Mining Corporation — whose major shareholders include US-based Agnico Eagle Mines, Toronto-headquartered Fairfax Financial and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board — is developing the McIlvenna Bay Copper Mine in Saskatchewan. In recent years, the project has been protested by members of the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation. The mining project threatens at-risk woodland caribou and 13 hectares of muskeg — valuable peatlands that absorb carbon dioxide from the air. Carney had previously teased that the Contrecœur expansion project at the Port of Montreal would make his list of major projects. The expansion, fought by environmentalists due to its impact on critical habitats for fish and frogs, involves a new container terminal to handle an additional 1.1 million containers per year, and was already planned and receiving cash from Quebec. It is scheduled to begin operations in 2029. Earlier this year, Xavier Barsalou-Duval, transportation, infrastructure and communities critic with the Bloc Québécois called on Carney to not include it as a project in the national interest. “A project of this magnitude should only proceed if it can be demonstrated that it can be carried out in strict compliance with existing environmental standards,” he said. “This burden, which falls to the Port of Montreal, must not be shirked or truncated by the Liberal government.” Carney said several other major projects are far from being ready, but are worth considering. He is asking the Major Projects Office to create business development teams to help advance them. The Major Projects Office will consider regulations, financing and supply chains for critical minerals, including in the priority areas of Ontario’s Ring of Fire, the Slave Geological Area in the Northwest Territories and in the Labrador Trough overlapping Québec and Labrador. The office will also study large-scale clean power with a focus on Nova Scotia’s proposed Wind West project. Carney said the offshore wind megaproject could generate one quarter of Canada’s entire electricity demand, and should be studied in tandem with the Energy East Partnership (a proposal to strengthen Atlantic Canada’s power grids) and the development of Gull Island being pursued by Québec and Newfoundland and Labrador. An “Arctic Economic and Security Corridor” will also be pursued, Carney said. The project would be anchored by a new port at Grays Bay in Nunavut, and include new roads and military capabilities. Upgrading the Port of Churchill will also be considered with plans to increase port capacity, rail lines, marine ice-breaking capabilities and an “energy corridor” to be studied, he said. The project would be developed with Manitoba’s Crown-Indigenous Corporation. Delivering on high-speed rail between Quebec City and Toronto is also a goal the Major Projects Office will study, with plans to be put in place within four years. Carney said the Major Projects Office will also help develop a “Canadian Sovereign Cloud,” to build computing capacity and data centres he framed as essential to economic competitiveness with artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The last major initiative the Major Projects Office will study promises to be controversial. The Pathways Alliance’s $16.5-billion proposal to pipe carbon dioxide captured from oilsands sites in northern Alberta to an underground storage site south of Cold Lake, will be considered. Carney dubbed the project “Pathways Plus” — with the plus being the possibility of a new oil pipeline being built, if the carbon capture megaproject is built. He framed the possibility as a way to strike a grand bargain as Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has called for, that could see “decarbonized oil” flow to new markets. As previously reported by Canada’s National Observer, “decarbonized oil” is not a credible term, leading climate scientists say. Carney said a second tranche of major projects to be referred to the Major Projects Office would be announced by Nov. 16. Geoffrey Pounder | September 11th 2025, 04:37 pm Carney: “For too long, when federal agencies have examined a project, their immediate question has been, ‘Why?’ From now on, Canada's new government starts by asking ourselves for major projects: How? How can we do it bigger? How can we do it faster?” Yes, let's not ask ourselves why or if we should build a project. Let's not ask ourselves whether a project is worth doing. Let's not conduct a cost-benefit analysis. Let's not identify and quantify the impacts of projects, singly and cumulatively. Let's just do it. Let's just go straight to figuring out how to build projects. Bigger and faster. In what world does that strategy make a lick of sense? In what world does failure to plan not lead to disaster? Cost overruns, delays, bad design, unforeseen consequences, not to mention local opposition? How is this good government? Geoffrey Pounder | September 11th 2025, 04:39 pm Article: "Environmental advocates and Indigenous leaders, key constituents and rights-holders who Carney has promised to respect, were quick to condemn it." Our trusty reporter fails to mention the not inconsiderable indigenous support for LNG: - Haisla Nation: A majority owner of the Cedar LNG project, partnering with Pembina Pipeline Corporation. - Nisg̱a'a Nation: A joint venture partner in the Ksi Lisims LNG project. - Gitxaala, Kitselas, Yekooche, and Stellat'en First Nations have signed benefits agreements related to LNG development. - Gitxsan Nation: Supports the natural gas pipeline that would supply the Ksi Lisims LNG project. Some indigenous communities see fossil-fuel "development" as their path out of decades of poverty. To what extent indigenous support is coerced is another question. If they do not have the right to say NO, their YES does not mean much. Alex Botta | September 12th 2025, 01:07 pm In reply to Article: "Environmental… by Geoffrey Pounder Yes, there is Indigenous support for LNG. There are are also Indigenous opponents, and that has caused a division among and within First Nations. Those who have an equity stake will enjoy significant revenue up to what ever ceiling evolves, perhaps less than the original hype due to cost overruns during the construction of supply infrastructure meeting a supply glut and undercutting international competition. Or perhaps a longer run of returns into the mid-2030s out to 2040 where a peak in demand is looming. Either way, support among BC's First Nations for LNG, as mixed as it is, will never in a million years be reflected in another Northern Gateway pipeline proposal carrying diluted bitumen. Roy Brander | September 12th 2025, 09:08 am It's a mistake to think Carney has that much agency. His votes were a frankly unnatural reverse of what was going to happen, last election. It could flip back any time if he is seen as "weak". (Biden didn't fall because he sounded senile; Trump has sounded senile for years. Biden's sin was to appear weak.) The (insane, but real) prevailing belief is that traditional solutions are "strong" and new, untried technologies are "weak". Those who remember PCs vs Mainframes in 1980s corporations recall when that was the dynamic for IT. The LNG expansion is the hardest proposal to fight, because it leverages the sunk cost of the existing plant, the site and the foundations and pipes and powerlines to it. It's the smallest concession he could make, frankly. And climate activists should have a little confidence that the new technologies are not weak, and that their strength will be quite obvious to all, not just to experts, in five more years. By the time this expansion is built, there will be no calls for more. Alex Botta | September 13th 2025, 01:25 am In reply to It's a mistake to think… by Roy Brander "By the time this expansion is built, there will be no calls for more." I certainly hope you're right. Proponents calling for more are a dime a dozen. The real test will be finding proponents who are willing to risk their own resources to built more by assuming the majority of the costs. There are a few who are big on LNG, hoping for a few years of profitable revenue even with the mounting evidence of a glut and powerful competition from international producers with lower priced product, but none who have presented a business case for more oil pipelines. Danielle Smith seems to think the federal government should build more oil pipelines, including a million-barrel a day monster to Prince Rupert, if private investors don't take the majority of the risk. Fat chance. Even with Hodgson leading the way federally, Canadians will not accept funnelling hundreds of billions into pipelines while social programs are put under threat. However, there is an alternative: Smith can put Alberta into the position of assuming the majority of the financial risk, and as the main proponent, Alberta will be the central figure caught in the middle of court battles brought on by First Nations that pitch C-5 against the Constitution, and in diminishing demand for heavy liquid petroleum in China, the current leading market demand entity in Asia. Refined oil products for road transportation have already peaked in China. Smith can deny demand destruction "theories" all she wants, but China's consumption peak in gasoline is a fact, not a theory, as is China's increasing influence on electrification and renewables in Asia and the Global South. Until Smith puts up $50+B of Albertan's money and debt risk for new pipelines, we know her continuing rhetoric goading the feds and cavalierly dismissing the critics amounts to nothing but political theatre. Roy Brander | September 13th 2025, 08:46 am In reply to "By the time this expansion… by Alex Botta You have to read the industry news, not the regular news. Try this news, just this morning: https://cleantechnica.com/2025/09/12/fossil-demand-decline-in-india-chi… ...the investors for this very expansion may get cold feet in a year or two, early enough to pull out the rug. I suspect a big part of the "go, go, go" attitude is because they know the end is coming, and imagine they can get public money to "de-risk" it. So I sneeringly say that all approvals are a done deal, as long as it's all private money, a double-dog dare. Big investors can see we passed mere inflection points a few years back, and now the actual turning points are imminent and inescapable. The Trump administration is pushing back a tide with a pitchfork. Their wish is to sell a vital supply to those who have little choice. China and India were counted upon as certain importers, and "energy dominance" was about playing the same role to them that Saudis played for America and Europe through the 70s. Oddly enough: China and India don't like their role in that story, and have found ways around it. As those technologies prove themselves, and get more investment, the tide is going to undercut the sand the fossil investments are built upon. Tris Pargeter | September 12th 2025, 11:07 am Martin Olszynski is right; he sees the POLITICAL realities that unfortunately but absolutely NECESSARILY preclude the full-scale climate change action required, a situation that is also very much mirrored in Europe right now, making Carney's unprecedented effort to turn away from the States and toward the EU the most important message. Ultimately, that involves OUR economy as it IS, banks and big corporations very much included, unfortunately. So for all the purists and activists who are currently threatening what political capital progressives currently HAVE, barely but most fortuitously wrested away from the cons, again I point out that you are ALL becoming part of the problem, heroic though you claim to be. For many of you, I quote Falstaff who said "honor is a mere scutcheon," and for many more I'd say wake up and smell the coffee because this is as good as it gets UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, which we ALL are, always. The Liberals are also forming an environmental caucus for us all, proof of why they are the only rational choice and we're lucky to have them AND Carney, period. He summed up the situation recently when a reporter questioned his choice of an adviser who was involved with the tobacco industry by pointing out that last time he checked that although he doesn't approve of any of it, there IS a tobacco industry and it is NOT illegal to smoke. The same can unfortunately still be said for the fossil fuel industry, but people still need to heat their homes and drive their cars to work. Because the stakes are much higher, in fact couldn't be higher, all the more reason we need unusually adroit leadership, which we fortunately HAVE. Paul Berger | September 12th 2025, 09:13 pm In reply to Martin Olszynski is right;… by Tris Pargeter Causing the immense suffering of others may be slightly better than causing very immense suffering, but that's a very low bar. We would be fortunate if the Liberals had been climate leaders in any real sense in the last decade. No matter what Carney does, he's already lost in sending the message, consistent with JT, that we're not in a climate emergency. For shame. Tris Pargeter | September 13th 2025, 07:55 am In reply to Causing the immense… by Paul Berger Yes, but that is STILL where the bar IS is my point. How do you not see what is happening right now when it's MATH? Scaring people has clearly sent a substantial number of them toward the conservatives, who comfortably deny climate change, pathetic, surprising, and irrational though that IS. Emily Dickinson said it best, "Tell the truth, but tell it slant." And again, we BARELY won the last election, so my other point is that your right but too "righteous" NDP cohort shares a refusal to accept reality with the conservatives, making you very much part of the problem. The voting public already told you that; your party just refuses to listen, blaming the Liberals, AGAIN, like the conservatives. I'm worried your seven MP's will remain petulant and vote against the budget, thereby voting against their and ALL of our best interests at this point in time, AGAIN, like the conservatives.

BlackRock explores tokenizing exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares as part of its push to expand its digital asset infrastructure beyond traditional market boundaries. As Bloomberg News reported on Sept. 11, the firm weighs creating blockchain-based versions of ETFs tied to real-world assets (RWA), including stocks, according to sources familiar with the confidential planning. The initiative builds on BlackRock’s $2.2 billion BUIDL tokenized money-market fund, launched in March 2024, two months after the debut of its Bitcoin ETF. CEO Larry Fink previously stated that every financial asset can be tokenized, most recently reiterating it in his 2025 annual letter to investors. Tokenized ETF shares would enable trading beyond Wall Street’s standard hours, improve international access to US products, and create new collateral opportunities within crypto networks. The report comes in the same week as Nasdaq filed with the SEC to trade tokenized stocks and ETFs on its platform. BlackRock has tested tokenized fund shares through JPMorgan’s Kinexys infrastructure and positioned itself as an early adopter of digital settlement models.

Excluding private credit, tokenized money funds are the largest RWA category, with a $7.4 billion market cap as of Sept. 11. At the same time, ETFs offer broader asset exposure and trading mechanics that are well-suited for blockchain deployment. Exchanges including Kraken, Robinhood, and Coinbase already offer tokenized stocks internationally or plan to do so. However, the report noted that current challenges include reconciling ETF settlement through Wall Street clearinghouses with blockchain’s instant, 24-hour trading capabilities. These challenges create technical and regulatory questions for custodians managing the transition between traditional and digital infrastructure. BlackRock’s exploration reflects mainstream finance’s evaluation of blockchain technology for enhancing market infrastructure, including improvements in collateral flows and settlement speed. The firm’s digital asset advocacy, combined with regulatory shifts, positions tokenized ETFs as another bridge between traditional and decentralized finance systems.

BlackRock is exploring how to bring exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto public blockchains, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The sources said the asset manager is weighing tokenizing funds tied to real-world assets such as stocks, though any rollout would depend on regulatory approval. The discussions follow BlackRock’s first experiment with tokenization last year. The firm introduced the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL. The fund, which is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries, repurchase agreements and cash, has quickly grown into the world’s largest tokenized Treasury product, managing nearly $2.2 billion. Tokenizing ETFs would represent a deeper step into blockchain-based financial products. In practice, it would mean that shares of the funds — traditionally traded on stock exchanges during market hours — could be issued and transacted as tokens on chain. Proponents argue this shift could bring clear benefits. A tokenized ETF could be traded around the clock, rather than only during exchange hours. Settlement, which often takes two business days in traditional finance, could be completed within minutes. Investors in markets where ETFs are not easily accessible might gain exposure through blockchain rails. The products are pending a green light from regulators, the people said. BlackRock’s exploration underscores a wider trend across finance, as banks, fintechs and asset managers test blockchain rails for bonds, private credit and now mainstream equity funds.
