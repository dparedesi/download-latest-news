Title: TRUMP meme coin pumps, then dumps after fake utility news

Share this article The TRUMP meme coin saw a sudden 19% surge before plummeting after false reports circulated that it would have real-world utility. The digital asset jumped from $10.4 to $12.4 after DB, a prominent crypto news outlet, posted on X that the TRUMP token would “have real utility” on Thursday. The surge was short-lived as a follow-up post appeared approximately seven minutes later claiming the account had been compromised. The TRUMP token price fell to $10.8 following the statement. Initially, it was uncertain whether hackers or DB posted the second tweet. Ansem and others in the crypto community observed a grammatical error in the tweet, suggesting the security breach had yet to be resolved. Some X users reported that DB’s account also shared fake news that BlackRock had filed for a spot HYPE ETF. DB has since removed the unauthorized posts and issued a statement asking users to disregard messages posted during the security breach. The news outlet confirmed an investigation is in progress and will provide updates when available. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Sarah Healy on becoming European Indoor champion: ‘I knew people thought I was capable of a lot more’

Sarah Healy is sitting in a hotel room in Dubai, a glowing picture of health and confidence, and talking openly through some of the back pages of her running career. As if she was another athlete then, and very different from that now. She takes the Zoom call on a six-day stopover en route to Nanjing, where at the World Indoor Championships starting on Friday week, Healy hopes to add another medal to the gold she won on the European indoor stage in Apeldoorn last Sunday – that 3,000m victory at the age of 24 a liberation of sorts. By her own repeated admission, Healy had often buckled under the pressure of her own expectations, and those of others, losing focus in races right when it mattered most. Perhaps worse still she lost some of the enjoyment from the sport she first discovered at Blackrock AC in South Dublin at age nine. “I’ve always enjoyed it, always enjoyed training and everything,” she says. “I think it’s more having fun with competing that has been the problem. I’m not even sure if I’ve taken it too seriously, but I’ve also associated competing with some really big disappointments, and I think when you’re bringing that much emotion into it, it can make it more scary, because you know there’s this possibility that you’re going to be so devastated. “So I think this indoor season, I’ve kind of like just been reminding myself that it’s not such a be all, end all thing. And remind myself that I’m going to be okay no matter what happens. And then that in turn just makes it less nerve-wracking, or less pressurising, because it just doesn’t feel as daunting that way. “I suppose it’s just trying to appreciate where you are, realising how lucky I am to get to do this, to travel around and race as a job. That is really cool, so just enjoying the competing aspect a little bit more, and obviously it brings out better performances.” This sort of thing can happen to any athlete, only for Healy, given her exceptional underage success which included a European under-18 1,500m/3,000m double in 2018, any growing pains entering the senior ranks were certainly magnified. The 2022 European Championships in Munich, for example, where she bombed out in her 1,500m heat after running a world-class 4:02.86 earlier that summer, taking three seconds off Sonia O’Sullivan’s Irish under-23 record set 31 years previously in Monaco. Healy mentions several critical turning points since then, bringing her to where she is now. It started with her move to Manchester in late 2023 to train with husband-and-wife coaching team of Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, whose M11 group includes Keely Hodgkinson, the Olympic 800m champion in Paris. “Just because that was a really hard decision to make, and quite a big thing to do,” she says. “And then I think it also kind of represented me sort of becoming a full-time athlete, and really just kind of going all in on athletics. So I took confidence in the fact I was able to get through that and make a home for myself over there. “Then of course it was obviously a turning point just in terms of having a team and training group, which has physically, obviously, pushed me on so much. “Then I think the other major turning point would be the Olympics last year, and kind of just the aftermath of that [she finished fourth in the Paris repechage, one place short of the semi-final]. But I think after some time, I managed to turn that experience into a bit of a lesson, or a big lesson, and this indoor season really changed the way I was approaching things, based off that.” Moving to Manchester also afforded her the first-hand experience of living and training alongside Hodgkinson and Georgia Hunter Bell, who won the Olympic, 1,500m bronze in Paris. “When you think of someone like her [Keely], who’s just been such a prodigy and an Olympic champion, you feel like they probably wouldn’t be a normal person and do normal things, but Keely is a similar age to me and is just like a friend now, and so it kind of normalises that as well. “She’s training really, really hard but at the same time, I think both with her and Georgia that they have something special in their mindset as well. And I think in Paris last year, Keely just had that mindset. And the same with Georgia, she just thinks, ‘no, there’s no reason I can’t come in here and be one of the best’. Obviously, they’re both physically extremely talented as well, but you need that mindset too.” [ Sarah Healy, Mark English and Kate O’Connor to chase more medals at World Indoor ChampionshipsOpens in new window ] Comparisons with O’Sullivan may continue for a while yet – O’Sullivan won a World Indoor 3,000m silver back in 1997 – but Healy views those things differently now. “I think when people would say things like that, I definitely never got carried away and thought, ‘oh, I’m going to be amazing just because I’ve done these things as a junior’. “It’s just been the last few years, as a senior athlete, I underperformed a good number of times at major championships. Because it happened so many times, I definitely felt a bit of pressure to perform, because I knew people thought I was capable of a lot more than what I was doing. “I think another thing that has helped my performances recently has been really just focusing on myself. At the end of the day, no one really cares too much what I do, apart from myself. I think worrying about other people, what they think, is definitely not helpful.” Ian O'Riordan is an Irish Times sports journalist writing on athletics Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Jamie Dimon changes tune on tariffs: ‘Uncertainty is not a good thing’ | CNN Business

Time Published: 2025-03-13T00:27:37Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Two months ago, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had a curt message for people protesting President Donald Trump’s tariff policy: “Get over it.” But with stock markets lower and cracks appearing to form in the US economy, Dimon himself might not be over it. “I don’t think the average American consumer who wakes up in the morning and goes to work… changes what they’re going to do because they read about tariffs,” Dimon said in an interview with Semafor on Wednesday. “But I do think companies might,” he added. “Uncertainty is not a good thing.” Dimon appeared to shift his focus on tariffs after the CEO of America’s largest bank said to “get over it,” when discussing tariffs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He said they could be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon” to promote fair trade, depending how they’re used. “I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” Dimon said in an interview with CNBC at the time. “National security trumps a little bit more inflation,” he added. Since then, Trump’s on-and-off tariff policy has caused volatility in the stock market. Although broader markets rebounded on Wednesday, the S&P 500 was still down more than 7% over one month. On Wednesday, Trump imposed sweeping 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imported into the United States — the latest round of tariffs in a global trade war — with Canada and the European Union swiftly retaliating. He has said his goal is to revitalize American manufacturing, slow illegal immigration and end fentanyl smuggling, but economists have warned that broad-based tariffs threaten to drive up prices on everything from food to new homes. Dimon wasn’t the only CEO sounding off on Wednesday about the risks of tariffs. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said he believed the economy was weakening due to tariffs. “The collective impact in the short run is that people are pausing, they’re pulling back,” Fink told CNN’s Kayla Tausche in an exclusive interview. “Talking to CEOs throughout the economy, I hear that the economy is weakening as we speak.” Still, Fink said the Trump administration’s policies, including tariffs, could be beneficial to the United States in the long run. “Right now the president is focusing on tariffs, but when he talks about reciprocal tariffs, actually, that may bring down tariffs over the long run,” Fink said, adding that he remains bullish on America in the long term.

Title: First, World Leaders Complain, Then They Do What Trump Wants

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/12/2025 5:04:04 PM PDT by bimboeruption Even before Trump took office, he began laying out a long list of demands for both U.S. allies and adversaries—demands he believed would ultimately benefit American taxpayers. Despite facing resistance, with many critics calling him “Hitler,” the world is slowly falling in line with his requests. Canada backed down from an energy export surcharge threatened against the U.S., Mexico rounded up cartel members and handed them over to U.S. authorities, Zelensky agreed to a ceasefire, and Europe is ramping up its defense spending, assuming the financial responsibility for Ukraine’s defense. Panama withdrew from the Belt and Road Initiative and then sold key assets to BlackRock, effectively neutralizing the Chinese threat to the Panama Canal. Canada’s Retreat from Export Surcharge: Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced that he was suspending the 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the U.S., which had been imposed earlier that week. This decision followed a conversation with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, during which they agreed to meet in Washington to discuss a renewed United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement ahead of President Trump’s April 2 tariff deadline While Canada is matching U.S. tariffs dollar for dollar, it has also agreed to a $1.3 billion investment in enhancing border security. This includes joint efforts with U.S. authorities to combat transnational criminal activities, particularly fentanyl trafficking. Mexico’s Cooperation on Cartel Crackdown: The Mexican government conducted a large-scale operation to round up cartel members, directly handing over key figures to U.S. authorities for prosecution. This move came after considerable pressure from Washington, where Trump demanded that Mexico take a stronger stance on drug cartels and border security. Mexico’s actions were perceived as a necessary step to maintain diplomatic ties with the U.S. and avoid any re-escalation of trade barriers or tariffs. Ukraine’s Agreement to a Ceasefire: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, a move strongly supported by the United States. Trump had advocated for a ceasefire to push both Ukraine and Russia toward negotiations. Despite initial resistance from Ukrainian leadership to compromise on territorial issues, Zelenskyy ultimately agreed, seeing the potential benefits in securing continued U.S. military and financial support. Europe’s Increased Defense Spending: European military and political leaders are holding high-level talks this week to discuss rearming the continent and increasing aid for Ukraine, amid concerns over a less engaged United States. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans emphasized the urgency of fortifying Europe’s security, noting that Europe can no longer rely on U.S. protection. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a significant boost in defense spending, proposing an $873 billion plan to rearm Europe and support Ukraine, including relaxing fiscal rules and increasing defense spending by 1.5% of GDP annually for the next four years. Europe Assuming Ukraine Defense Responsibility: France’s President Emmanuel Macron took decisive steps toward forming a European peacekeeping force for Ukraine. Macron’s meeting in Paris with military leaders from over 30 nations, including European countries, Japan, and Canada. While the media may frame this as either a win for globalism or a loss of power for the U.S., Europe is essentially doing what Trump has advocated for all along: he wants America out of Ukraine and expects Europe to address its own security concerns—something it has neglected to do for the past 80 years. Panama’s Withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative: In 2025, Panama has withdrawn from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which had initially been signed in 2017 under pressure from Beijing. This decision was influenced by U.S. demands for countries to limit Chinese influence in critical infrastructure, particularly concerning strategic assets like the Panama Canal. Panama also reached an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its largest ports to BlackRock, an American investment firm. This sale further aligns Panama with U.S. interests, as it reduces China’s presence and strengthens the U.S. economic influence in the region. The move was seen as a direct response to Trump’s call for Latin American nations to reduce reliance on China and prioritize U.S. partnerships, reflecting Panama’s compliance with U.S. demands to safeguard the Panama Canal from Chinese control. The international response to President Trump’s demands highlights a trend where countries, after initial resistance or criticism, eventually agree to ‘America First.

Panama withdrew from the Belt and Road Initiative and then sold key assets to BlackRock, effectively neutralizing the Chinese threat to the Panama Canal. Canada’s Retreat from Export Surcharge: Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced that he was suspending the 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the U.S., which had been imposed earlier that week. This decision followed a conversation with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, during which they agreed to meet in Washington to discuss a renewed United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement ahead of President Trump’s April 2 tariff deadline While Canada is matching U.S. tariffs dollar for dollar, it has also agreed to a $1.3 billion investment in enhancing border security. This includes joint efforts with U.S. authorities to combat transnational criminal activities, particularly fentanyl trafficking. Mexico’s Cooperation on Cartel Crackdown: The Mexican government conducted a large-scale operation to round up cartel members, directly handing over key figures to U.S. authorities for prosecution. This move came after considerable pressure from Washington, where Trump demanded that Mexico take a stronger stance on drug cartels and border security. Mexico’s actions were perceived as a necessary step to maintain diplomatic ties with the U.S. and avoid any re-escalation of trade barriers or tariffs. Ukraine’s Agreement to a Ceasefire: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, a move strongly supported by the United States. Trump had advocated for a ceasefire to push both Ukraine and Russia toward negotiations. Despite initial resistance from Ukrainian leadership to compromise on territorial issues, Zelenskyy ultimately agreed, seeing the potential benefits in securing continued U.S. military and financial support. Europe’s Increased Defense Spending: European military and political leaders are holding high-level talks this week to discuss rearming the continent and increasing aid for Ukraine, amid concerns over a less engaged United States. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans emphasized the urgency of fortifying Europe’s security, noting that Europe can no longer rely on U.S. protection. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a significant boost in defense spending, proposing an $873 billion plan to rearm Europe and support Ukraine, including relaxing fiscal rules and increasing defense spending by 1.5% of GDP annually for the next four years.

Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans emphasized the urgency of fortifying Europe’s security, noting that Europe can no longer rely on U.S. protection. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a significant boost in defense spending, proposing an $873 billion plan to rearm Europe and support Ukraine, including relaxing fiscal rules and increasing defense spending by 1.5% of GDP annually for the next four years. Europe Assuming Ukraine Defense Responsibility: France’s President Emmanuel Macron took decisive steps toward forming a European peacekeeping force for Ukraine. Macron’s meeting in Paris with military leaders from over 30 nations, including European countries, Japan, and Canada. While the media may frame this as either a win for globalism or a loss of power for the U.S., Europe is essentially doing what Trump has advocated for all along: he wants America out of Ukraine and expects Europe to address its own security concerns—something it has neglected to do for the past 80 years. Panama’s Withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative: In 2025, Panama has withdrawn from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which had initially been signed in 2017 under pressure from Beijing. This decision was influenced by U.S. demands for countries to limit Chinese influence in critical infrastructure, particularly concerning strategic assets like the Panama Canal. Panama also reached an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its largest ports to BlackRock, an American investment firm. This sale further aligns Panama with U.S. interests, as it reduces China’s presence and strengthens the U.S. economic influence in the region. The move was seen as a direct response to Trump’s call for Latin American nations to reduce reliance on China and prioritize U.S. partnerships, reflecting Panama’s compliance with U.S. demands to safeguard the Panama Canal from Chinese control. The international response to President Trump’s demands highlights a trend where countries, after initial resistance or criticism, eventually agree to ‘America First.

The Atlanta Hawks recently celebrated Women’s History Month with their annual Women’s Empowerment Night presented by BMW, recognizing women in leadership, business, and sports at State Farm Arena, and we got a double dribble of all the deets. The evening featured a special graduation ceremony for the SheLEADS Class of 2025, a halftime performance from Shamea Morton dedicated to women’s empowerment, and a star-studded lineup of speakers and honorees.

Entering State Farm Arena alone as media, I was guided through the media entrance, passing through tunnels beneath the bleachers where athletes prepare for the game. Security personnel, trainers, and physical therapists moved efficiently, ensuring everything was in place before tip-off. I was escorted to the event through the VIP elevators and hallways by Tai McDonald from the Atlanta Hawks Communications team. She led the way to the SheLEADS graduation room, which was filled with the program’s participants and their supporters, preparing to celebrate their achievements. Source: Lauryn Bass The setting reflected the significance of the moment—decorated with glass windows, hues of pink and florals to set the scene of the ceremony. They also served hors d’oeuvres! The SheLEADS Class of 2025 celebrated the completion of its eight-month leadership development program, which supports early-career women in business, sports, entrepreneurship, and STEAM fields. The wonderful host keeping up the energy of the night was media maven MiAsia Symone, Radio Host of Atlanta’s #1 Hip-Hop station Hot 107.9. The program, powered by BMW and the Atlanta Hawks, was designed to address key barriers preventing women from advancing in leadership roles. Source: Lauryn Bass According to Alexis Roe, VP of DEI Impact & Strategic Initiatives at the Atlanta Hawks, who served as the program’s moderator, the eight-month structure was intentional. “I was a part of Lead Atlanta and a number of other leadership development programs and the reality is: after one work day you’re not going to learn all the things, right? So what we really did was curate an experience. We looked at all the women in the workplace and studied key things that women struggle with. At the time, women in Georgia ranked number forty-nine in the country for ‘Women’s Empowerment,’ which is women’s access to healthcare and education. We couldn’t understand why, out of all the amazing women in Georgia, they were not able to climb and rise into leadership and economic mobility.” Alexis Roe & Lauryn Bass/ Source: Lauryn Bass The night featured a keynote address from Margaret Lane, Executive Vice President of Talent & Development at Penske Automotive Group, as well as a panel discussion titled, “Navigating the Path to Leadership: Wisdom and Tactics from Trailblazing Women.” Source: Lauryn Bass Lane emphasized how impactful a program like this would have been for her as a young professional. “I would’ve given anything for something like this. The young people [in] this program, I have no doubt that in the future they are going to be fabulous. I have a lot of confidence in them, and I am so excited.” With DEI programs facing challenges nationwide, Lane also spoke on the importance of continued investment in initiatives like SheLEADS. “I’m hoping so! No matter what you are, what acronym you use, or who you call yourself to be—it’s the inclusivity that’s so important. Why wouldn’t you want to be? The Atlanta Hawks and the Atlanta-area BMW Centers have done such an incredible job supporting this.” For the graduates, the impact of SheLEADS extended beyond professional development—it fostered a sense of belonging and confidence. Source: Lauryn Bass Teevyah Yuva Raju, business strategist and COO Team at BlackRock, shared her excitement about completing the program. “I feel incredible—for myself and my fellow SheLeaders! We learned a lot and I can’t wait to see all of us grow in the upcoming years.” When asked what SheLEADS offered that only participants would understand, she highlighted a common struggle for women in leadership. “The biggest thing I’ve learned is to overcome imposter syndrome. A lot of the women who are SheLeads sisters to me are in incredible positions. They’ve taught us that every position that we are in is well-deserved and that we’re going to continue to grow because we deserve it. We deserve where we’re at and we deserve where we’re going.” For Meag Taylor, founder of WomenInRadio and digital content producer at The Steve Harvey Morning Show, SheLEADS wasn’t just about professional growth—it provided genuine friendships and support. “SheLEADS is the best decision I made since moving to Atlanta in 2020. I am so happy to have been accepted into the program. The quality of women I have met and gained as friends is just amazing. We really support each other in real life, and oftentimes, that’s hard to find.” Janna Pruiett, Customer Success Manager at Omnissa, echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the invaluable community and confidence-building she gained. “Being part of the SheLEADS program was an incredibly empowering experience! I loved connecting with so many dynamic women from different industries, each with unique insights and inspiring stories. The program provided an invaluable space for learning, growth, and collaboration, and I left feeling more motivated than ever. The Atlanta Hawks and State Farm Arena truly created a community where women can thrive, and I’m grateful to have been a part of it!” You could feel the energy in the room from the testimonies, trophies, champagne toasts and gift baskets. This was a space where women were giving back to each other, and it spoke volumes. This truly was a celebration that fell on the perfect night of the year, #InternationalWomensDay!

Source: Paras Griffin / Getty Play At halftime, the arena lit up with an all-female Drumline Live performance, paying tribute to the HBCU marching band legacy with powerful rhythms and choreography. Throughout the evening, the ATL Hawks continued to give tribute to women who inspire the world every day. Play The ATL Dancers also performed a special routine featuring women from the Hawks’ corporate team, reinforcing the organization’s commitment to diversity both on and off the court. There was even an interactive cartoon race between three cars—two male and one female—for children to engage with during the night. Though the male cars played dirty to win, the female car kept her energy and stayed on her path to victory. The crowd was able to cheer her onto victory, and to recognize that even the smallest things can impact children in their game seats. Women’s Empowerment Night was more than a themed game—it was a testament to the Hawks’ and BMW’s commitment to investing in women. What a perfect game to win against the Pacers. Curtis Snyder, BMW’s Southern Region Marketing Manager, reinforced why programs like this matter. “At BMW, we believe in the power of women—our daughters, mothers, and partners—to inspire change, break barriers, and lead with confidence.” There was everything to gain this night! With SheLEADS continuing to grow, the event showcased the success of women already making waves in their industries while setting the stage for the next generation of leaders. Oui Love To See It!

Title: AI to fuel bumper year for M&A in US power sector
URL: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/ai-fuel-bumper-year-ma-us-power-sector-4996806
Time Published: 2025-03-12T20:20:04Z

Business FILE PHOTO: A new Facebook data center is under construction in Eagle Mountain, Utah, U.S., May 14, 2019. Picture taken on May 14, 2019. REUTERS/George Frey/File photo Dealmakers expect 2025 to be a bumper year for mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. power industry, with a voracious appetite for assets as the sector gears up to meet massive demand growth from data centers for artificial intelligence. Record power demand and dizzying projections for electricity consumption for AI have made power generation and infrastructure assets, and companies which own them, attractive to energy companies, private equity and other institutional investors. The biggest growth in the sector in generations has already fueled a deal bonanza in the first months of the year, according to a dozen industry and financial sources who spoke to Reuters. The sources included several attendees at the annual CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. In January and February, there were 27 U.S. power deals worth a combined $36.4 billion, headlined by Constellation Energy's $16.4 billion acquisition of Calpine. This surpasses, both by value and volume, the first two months of every year barring one during the last 20 years, according to data from LSEG. Busy power sector deal-making is in contrast to the overall market for M&A, which recorded its weakest start since the global financial crisis, amid market volatility and uncertainty over the Trump administration's policies and what they mean for the economy. U.S. President Donald Trump has declared an energy emergency to facilitate the build out in the power sector, calling it "an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the United States' national and economic security." Opportunities are significant and stretch across the power sector, said Kathleen Lawler, managing director at investment firm KKR. "I don't think we have ever been busier," said Lawler. KKR and Canadian pension fund PSP Investments agreed in January to buy a 20 per cent stake in some of American Electric Power's transmission network for $2.8 billion. DEMAND Strong price increases have boosted power companies' shares, meaning they can do bigger transactions or give up less of the company to clinch a stock-fueled deal. Even with stock market falls in recent days, independent power producers Vistra, Constellation and NRG Energy are trading between 82 per cent and 220 per cent higher than the start of 2024. Potential acquirers may be emboldened too by the reaction of Constellation investors to the Calpine deal. Constellation's share price rallied 25 per cent on the day of the announcement - when typically buyers trade lower when announcing a large deal funded by the issuance of shares to the seller. That is because the share issuance dilutes existing shareholder positions. Private equity firms, pension and infrastructure funds have in recent years raised huge sums for energy investments. The total capital raised but still waiting to be deployed, known as dry powder, into infrastructure investments at the end of 2024 was $334 billion, according to data provider Preqin. Ways this cash could be invested include buying stakes in companies pioneering developing technology, and acquiring businesses that service existing energy infrastructure. David Foley, global head of Blackstone Energy Transition Partners, told a panel discussion at CERAWeek the booming power market has created "opportunities for investment in equipment manufacturing, the picks-and-shovels types of companies." It could also be used to take listed power companies private. The year has already seen Altus Power, one of the largest owners of U.S. commercial-scale solar plants, agree a $2.2 billion sale to TPG's climate investment arm. Reasons to go private differ, depending on the type of power company. Smaller utilities may struggle to compete for contracts with technology companies building and operating data centers, so being owned by a large investment firm could help challenge larger peers. Long-term institutional investors could offer higher valuations than public markets, especially for renewable power companies. These firms have seen their share prices slump since the election of Trump, who has called for fossil fuels to be prioritized at the expense of green energy. "The market could see more (utility) take-privates over the next few years as there is significant infrastructure capital that has been formed in recent years that is highly focused on this asset class," said Greg Hort, managing director at Lazard. Another source of deal flow will be utilities continuing to offload business units, or stakes in them, to help fund huge expansion of power infrastructure to support heightened demand, the people said. On top of the AEP deal with KKR and PSP, Eversource Energy said January 27 it had agreed to divest its Aquarion Water unit for $2.4 billion, and National Grid announced on February 24 it would offload its U.S. renewables business to Brookfield Asset Management. The deal fervor is also allowing buyout firms who own power assets to exit profitably. This includes small portfolios of power generation, or individual power plants, which in recent years saw limited buyer attention due to their size. Particularly sought-after are natural gas plants constructed in the last decade, which are more efficient and were built when U.S. power demand was in its 20-year plateau. Relative scarcity was part of the rationale behind the purchase in January by Blackstone's energy transition arm of Potomac Energy Center from Ares Management. "Many private equity firms, which took ownership of their assets three to five years ago, will be seeking liquidity events," said Hill Vaden, executive director of energy capital insights at S&P Global. OVERCOMING HURDLES The momentum behind power dealmaking will endure despite market ructions, as the uncertainty only makes existing assets more prized, the sources said. While Trump's economic agenda is expected to make it easier for energy projects to secure necessary permits, key components are still hard to source, with the wait for turbines for a natural gas power plant stretching out towards the end of the decade. The president's tariffs on materials critical to the power sector will likely push up costs. This includes steel and aluminum, and potentially copper, whose conductivity makes it essential in a host of products. Uncertainty around whether tax credits for renewable projects, including those introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act, will be scrapped is also casting a shadow on new clean energy generation. Reverberations from immigration reform, which threatens to deport millions of non-citizens, will also weigh on constructing new projects. "I've even told members of the Trump team that we're going to run out of electricians as we build out data centers," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said at the CERAWeek conference, when asked about the impact of deportations on the U.S. economy.

Title: Major Bank Trade Group Announces DEI Award Despite Trump's Executive Order

The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) just announced its 2025 “Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) Advocate Award” despite several major members of the trade group winding down their DEI programs after President Donald Trump’s executive order to restore “merit-based opportunity.” SIFMA, the preeminent U.S. trade group for securities firms, banks, and asset management companies, revealed the winner of their annual DEI award on Tuesday to be the DEI chief of Washington, DC law firm WilmerHale, Yoon-Young Lee. Notable members of SIFMA include Bank of America, BlackRock, Capital One, Citigroup, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo — most of which have all but abandoned their prior DEI goals since Trump’s return to office. The president’s January 21 executive order, titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,” prohibits private companies, including financial institutions, from conducting any DEI employment programs for jobs funded by federal contracts. A late February Bloomberg report revealed major changes coming to Bank of America (BoA), with a source saying the North Carolina-based company will no longer have “aspirational” DEI goals. An annual report released that week by the bank replaced numerous references to “diversity” and “equity,” switching out the words with “talent” and “opportunity.” “We evaluate and adjust our programs in light of new laws, court decisions and, more recently, executive orders from the new administration,” a BoA spokesperson said in a statement to the outlet. “Our goal has been and continues to be to make opportunities available for all of our clients, shareholders, teammates, and the communities we serve.” BoA is also set to change the name of an internal “diversity and inclusion” human resources group to “opportunity and inclusion,” the source revealed. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser told staffers around the same time that the company’s “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Talent Management” team will be renamed to “Talent Management and Engagement,” and that the institution will end its diversity hiring goals, Bloomberg reported. A mid-February Wall Street Journal article also revealed that JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were “removing or watering down” their DEI efforts, while Wells Fargo had begun reviewing its DEI language. The Wall Street Journal reported that BlackRock also recently removed references to DEI in its annual report — just three years after CEO Larry Fink said the company “must embed DEI into everything we do.” Deloitte employees working with U.S. government clients were instructed to remove gender pronoun identifiers from their email signatures and to roll back its DEI programs, but the London-based firm’s staff in the U.K. were told that diversity “remains a priority,” the Financial Times reported earlier last month. Goldman Sachs also dropped a diversity requirement for companies it takes public and slashed its DEI section from its latest annual filing, Reuters reported. CEO David Solomon said the changes were made to “reflect developments in the law in the U.S.” In Capital One’s case, the entire section labeled “Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging” in its 2024 annual filing was missing from the 2025 release, but the company still has its DEI webpage up. Despite Trump’s anti-DEI order, SIFMA’s website states that there is a “business case for DEI,” citing a study by McKinsey that found that “companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on their executive teams were 21 percent more likely to experience above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile” — though the trade group acknowledged that “correlation does not equal causation.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: Beware of Li Ka-shing’s Supersized Value Trap
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/beware-of-li-ka-shing-s-supersized-value-trap-11741807049528.html

Full Content:
(Bloomberg Opinion) -- From Chinese tech stocks to European defense shares, President Donald Trump’s second term seems to be lifting the world’s biggest value traps. One of the most prominent and controversial is the holding company owned by Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing. CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. has agreed to sell most of its ports, including those near the Panama Canal and a larger unit that has operations across 23 countries, to a consortium led by New York-based BlackRock Inc. It was a major victory for the US president, who had complained loudly that China had taken over the critical waterway. Market response was overwhelmingly positive. The $19 billion cash proceeds were about the same size as CK’s market cap before the deal was announced. That’s remarkable considering the entire port business, including in China and Hong Kong that were not sold as part of the deal, accounted for about 28% of the conglomerate’s operating free cash flow, according to the latest data available. CK’s stock rose 22% on the date the news came out, the most in over two decades. But as the initial excitement starts to fade, investors are growing nervous, wary of a billionaire family that has a poor track record on shareholders’ returns. The Li clan takes pride in the myriad of businesses and markets it operates in. But what kind of value-add can a diversified conglomerate offer when globalization is out of favor and geopolitical risks are on the rise? CK’s de-rating has accelerated since Trump’s first term, with the stock trading at just 35% of its book value even after the recent share bump. The complex business dealings have made enterprise valuation an impossible task. Apart from a 76% stake in CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd., which has made 30 deals totaling $50 billion according to Bloomberg data, CK operates telecom assets across Europe, as well as 12 retail brands with more than 16,000 stores in 28 markets worldwide. The number of equity analysts that cover the holding company’s stock has dwindled to just seven, versus 17 a decade ago. In a sign of deep capital market skepticism, CK seems to have trouble monetizing its assets. Its health and beauty subsidiary A.S. Watson is still privately-held, a decade after postponing an ambitious $6 billion dual listing in Hong Kong and London. Softer consumer sentiment in China, once a growth market, has become a drag. Last summer, CK Infrastructure did a secondary listing in the UK, hoping to widen its investor base. Trading volume has hardly improved since. CK has not indicated how it plans to deploy the $19 billion from the port deal. In the past, the company did not announce special dividends or buybacks after major asset disposals, which would have pleased investors. Analysts say the proceeds could go into acquisition deals in infrastructure assets in the UK, considering CK Infrastructure’s recent interest in UK water supplier Thames Water Utilities Inc. as well as waste firm Viridor Ltd. Though nicknamed “Superman”, Li’s aura has long faded in some investing circles. In 2015, minority shareholders revolted and blocked a proposal by CK Infrastructure to buy out another subsidiary, Power Assets Holdings Ltd., in a rare setback to the tycoon who sought to consolidate his businesses before handing over control to his elder son Victor. This is the perhaps the last chance the 96-year-old will have to make amends with disgruntled shareholders. Instead of more empire-building, the Li family can perhaps share its winnings with outsiders. After all, stock buybacks are often the best use of corporate capital, especially when shares are trading below their fair value. That would be real superpower.

Ireland Under-20 head coach Neil Doak has made three changes and three positional switches to the run-on team that lost 22-12 to France for Friday night’s game against Italy at the Stadio Monigo di Comunale (7.45pm Irish time). Ciaran Mangan moves from the left wing to outside centre with UCC student Gene O’Leary Kareem heading in the opposite direction. The first of the changes is at scrumhalf where Queen’s University’s Clark Logan is once again back in the team, replacing Will Wootton. Chris O’Connor, who played for St Michael’s in the Leinster Schools Cup last year and is currently with the Terenure club, will win a first cap off the bench in backing up Logan. Up front, Henry Walker and Mikey Yarr swap roles once again with the former starting and the latter dropping to the bench. David Walsh, another ex-Michael’s pupil playing with Terenure, gets his first start of the campaign as he is named in the backrow in place of Bobby Power, who is named among the replacements. Michael Foy, outstanding in the defeat to France, will wear the number seven jersey for the first time having previously played blindside flanker in the other matches. Éanna McCarthy continues to captain the team from number eight. Paddy Moore, Tom McAllister, Conor Kennelly, Sam Wisniewski and Conor Fahey are once again named on the bench as Ireland look to avoid a fourth defeat in five matches. Italy are in the same boat as Ireland with just one win in the campaign to date, both having beaten Scotland. The home side lost 20-18 to Wales, 58-5 to France, both in Italy, while they went down 33-24 to England at the Rec last time out. Italy are currently one point ahead of Ireland (fifth place) in the table.

Title: Rice College Westport win FAI Senior Cup final defeating Blackrock College on penalties

A schools cup final that packed a season’s amount of incident and drama into the final hour of action culminated in Rice College being crowned the national senior champions for the first time in their history in Athlone. Backboned by the majority of the team that lost last year’s Junior (Tom Ticher) Cup final a year ago at the same venue, it looked for the opening 45 minutes as if Blackrock College’s superior physicality and power might give them the edge, even though that period passed by without either goalkeeper being seriously tested. The Westport side posed much more of a threat after the interval when they tried to work the ball into attacking areas much more methodically rather than looking to simply hit lone striker Jack O’Malley from 20 yards away or more, but Blackrock also found it easier to break through, with Jack Kelly testing Michael McDonnell from close range in the first minute. Harry Weir and Geordy Lavin down the left-hand side showed outstanding craft and ingenuity to open up the Rice defence on a couple of occasions, but the breakthrough never came, and instead it was Rían Durkan who broke the deadlock, coolly rolling the ball to the net after Jack O’Malley’s composure wrong-footed the Blackrock defence. That only served as the cue for Blackrock to step up the pressure, and when Cormac Sheahan headed the equaliser from Conor O’Neill’s corner, the South Dublin side and 2003 national champions had all the momentum. Nothing came of it however, meaning that the contest moved to overtime, when Durkan again gave Rice the lead when he slipped a low shot inside the near post with four minutes of overtime remaining. Those four minutes were as frantic as you’d imagine, with Rice College missing a chance to score while Ronan Ffrench was caught upfield, and that looked fatal when Lavin curled a free around the wall and into the bottom corner with the last kick. Penalties began, the drama continued. Evan Durkan set the tone by opening with a Panenka chip, McDonnell’s save on Lavin looked to give Rice College the upper hand, only for two saves from Ffrench to leave Peter Walsh with a kick to win it. A thunderous strike off the bottom of the crossbar, bouncing a yard out from the goal line, showed the wafer-thin margin between victory and defeat, all the more when captain Alex Halpin hit the top corner with the first sudden death kick and Jack Luff’s pulled effort wide of the post confirmed the Mayo school’s win. RICE COLLEGE: M McDonnell; E Moran (T McGeough FT), M Staunton, C McGing, S Casey; Jamie O’Malley (D Reynolds 56), K Conway (C Cannon 71, S Popov 104); A Halpin, E Durkan, R Durkan; Jack O’Malley. BLACKROCK COLLEGE: R Ffrench; D Noonan (R Dowling 84), J Luff, C Sheahan, H Weir; S Mooney, C O’Neill; C Hearty (J Gleeson Halpin 65), P Walsh, G Lavin; J Kelly (A Quinn 56). Referee: Jay Merriman.

Title: Blackrock Clinic Health Group given go-ahead for women’s health centre

Plans by the Blackrock Clinic Health Group to establish a women’s health centre in Dublin city have been approved. Dublin City Council granted permission to the Larry Goodman Trust-owned Blackrock UC, saying the proposed facility at 2-5 Warrington Place “would not have an adverse impact on the surrounding area”. A six-page planner’s report found “the medical use proposed does not raise any concerns in terms of potential impact within the wider surrounding area”. Blackrock UC has said 50 jobs will be created by the women’s health centre which is expected to cater for an estimated 340 attendees per day. The planning application seeks a change of use of an office development to a centre it says “will be a pivotal step forward in enhancing women’s health services in Ireland”. A planning report lodged with the application said the facility aligns with priorities outlined in the Department of Health’s Women’s Health Action Plan 2024-25, which includes improved access to diagnostic imaging, ambulatory care, and preventive health services such as mammograms and Dexa scans. The report by McGill Planning stated “facilities such as consultant suites, physiotherapy rooms, and procedure areas directly contribute to key initiatives in the Action Plan, including the development of specialised gynaecology clinics, pelvic floor health, and multidisciplinary care”. In the report, Ms Shauna Hewitt said the repurposing of the existing office building would minimise environmental impact and align with sustainable practices, “an implicit priority in many governmental health strategies”. She added that “by addressing national healthcare priorities and fostering a patient-centred design, this transformation into a Women’s Health Centre is justified as both a practical and strategic advancement in healthcare infrastructure”. “The proposed Women’s Health Centre is a valuable addition to Dublin’s healthcare infrastructure, promoting equity, sustainability, and patient-centered care while contributing to the urban regeneration of this prominent location.” The report also stated that the proposed centre would be strategically located to integrate into Dublin’s existing network of women’s healthcare facilities.

Title: Trillion-Dollar Fusion: AI And Crypto Rewiring Finance
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/03/12/trillion-dollar-fusion-ai-and-crypto-rewiring-finance/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T14:11:03Z

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan , Contributor. human hand taking bitcoin from robotic hand Your money never sleeps. Before the world wakes, artificial intelligence (AI) driven systems are already scanning markets, seizing opportunities, and securing profits. This isn’t the future—it’s happening now. AI and blockchain—the twin engines of autonomous finance—aren’t just digitizing money; they’re rewiring finance itself. Blockchain is the trust engine, enforcing transparency and enabling atomic settlement—no middlemen required. AI is the intelligence engine, continuously learning, predicting, and executing trades in real time through autonomous agents. These agents optimize capital flows with unmatched speed, but their rapid evolution introduces structural risks—algorithmic instability, security vulnerabilities, regulatory blind spots, and the potential for cascading failures if safeguards aren’t in place. Retail investors now tap into hedge-fund-grade strategies—but they’re also vulnerable to flash crashes that can erase savings in an instant. The result? A financial system that never stops learning, adapting, and executing—reacting to market shifts at speeds no human can match. Finance's power dynamics are shifting as Wall Street titans and nimble disruptors leverage these technologies to gain an edge. Institutional investors deploy algorithms that execute optimum trades, while tech-first banks dramatically cut operational costs. Traditional wealth managers accustomed to relationship-driven finance must now adapt to a world where algorithms make split-second decisions. Trillion-Dollar Upheaval The financial services market is staggering: $100 trillion in asset management, $240 trillion in global payments, $200 trillion in banking, and trillions trading in repo markets daily. AI is surging toward $1.8 trillion, crypto is cementing its $2 trillion foothold, and tokenization is set to unlock $16 trillion in liquid assets by 2030. At this scale, efficiency gains—such as instant settlements and the removal of intermediaries—don’t just cut costs. They create new profit centers for incumbents and unlock high-value opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs, reshaping the financial landscape. For centuries, financial power was concentrated in the hands of a few—banks with rigid hours, brokers with steep fees, and investment firms with high barriers to entry. That dominance is fading. AI and blockchain aren’t just making finance faster; they’re making it accessible. Hedge fund-grade strategies, real-time insights, and automated portfolio management are no longer reserved for institutions. From fraud detection to high-speed execution, intelligent systems eliminate inefficiencies and redefine financial participation. The gates are no longer locked—anyone with an internet connection can enter. Industry Giants Are Paying Attention Traditional finance (TradFI) sees the shift—AI and blockchain are no longer experimental; they’re becoming the backbone of financial infrastructure. But adoption isn't instant. Financial institutions, entrenched in compliance and legacy systems, must tread carefully—yet they aren't sitting idle. They recognize the potential and are actively integrating AI's paradigm-shifting capabilities in advanced analytics and dramatic operational efficiency gains while methodically exploring blockchain for settlement and tokenization. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley's tech titans—Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Nvidia—are unleashing powerful AI innovations, building the infrastructure they believe will underpin entire industries, finance included. With total investments approaching the trillion-dollar mark, these tech giants are betting big on AI's transformative potential across the entire economy. BlackRock, managing a jaw-dropping $10 trillion, sent shockwaves through Wall Street by launching its first tokenized fund on Ethereum. Suddenly, blockchain wasn't just for crypto diehards—it was institutional finance's next big move. Fidelity and Schwab are building institutional crypto custody and trading services. Meanwhile, crypto's early disruptors like Coinbase and Kraken have evolved into AI-powered financial powerhouses, integrating real-time fraud detection and high-speed execution that outpaces legacy markets. The Living Market: Finance's New Nervous System & Digital Workforce Together, AI and blockchain create an ecosystem where automation isn't just about speed but about trust, security, and predictive intelligence. A new financial nervous system is emerging—one that doesn't just automate but actively thinks, learns, and adapts. This evolving network integrates security, adaptability, and intelligence seamlessly. Blockchain serves as the backbone, while AI functions as the cognitive layer—transforming static rules into dynamic learning. This isn't just a faster version of today's financial systems; it's an entirely new species. Traditional finance relies on centralized controls and human intervention. This new ecosystem makes autonomous decisions, self-corrects vulnerabilities, and optimizes in real-time. The implications extend beyond efficiency—we're entering an era where capital moves with real-time intelligence, reacting instantly to opportunities and risks. This shift isn't about 24/7 markets—it's about superhuman markets. AI-driven trading reads millions of signals at once, hedges risks in milliseconds, and fine-tunes strategies faster than any human trader could dream of. Fintech world map The AI-Blockchain Nexus: Reshaping Financial Infrastructure The convergence of AI and blockchain isn’t just an incremental upgrade—it’s a fundamental shift in finance. At their intersection, these technologies unlock capabilities neither could achieve alone, reshaping trading, payments, security, and infrastructure. Trading & Investment PlatformsCoinbase and Kraken use machine learning to detect fraud in microseconds while analyzing complex market patterns beyond human capability. Fidelity is expanding institutional-grade custodial and trading services, while Charles Schwab’s blockchain-backed ETFs offer mainstream investors a gateway to digital assets. SoSoValue, an AI-powered trading platform, launched SSI on Base Chain, enabling users to hold algorithmically rebalanced crypto baskets, like on-chain ETFs. With 30M registered users and 1M DAUs in 2024, it hit $200M TVL within weeks of staking launch. Its top index tokens, MAG7.ssi and USSI (hedged MAG7.ssi for funding rate earning), rank among Uniswap Base’s top 5 liquidity pools. Payment & Settlement Systems AI-driven fraud detection and transaction optimization are transforming payments. PayPal’s AI systems have cut fraud rates by 30% while processing over $1.5 trillion annually—all without customers noticing. Stripe enhances payment routing with machine learning, reducing costs for merchants. Visa is piloting AI-powered cross-border settlements, while Ripple’s AI-enhanced payment systems analyze transactions in real-time, improving security and slashing settlement times. Security & Risk ManagementAave and Compound use AI-driven predictive models to dynamically adjust lending rates and mitigate liquidity risks. OKX integrates multi-party computation (MPC) wallets, reinforcing cryptographic security. Layer-2 networks like Polygon and Optimism are experimenting with AI-enhanced smart contract audits, minimizing vulnerabilities in decentralized applications. WhiteBIT is a thoroughly audited crypto exchange, with security certification (CCSS Level 3) and PCI DSS certification. Security measures include multi-user approval protocols, cold storage for 96% of funds, and advanced encryption for private keys. CER.live includes it among its top five exchanges for security. Through institutional partnerships and its Barcelona sponsorship, WhiteBIT continues advancing mainstream crypto adoption. Infrastructure & DevelopmentJPMorgan is deploying AI-driven analytics to optimize blockchain-based settlements, while Goldman Sachs is exploring AI applications in tokenized asset management.

ForU AI pioneers Real-World AI (RWAI), enabling users to create AI-DIDs and train autonomous AI Agents for on-chain economies. These agents, guided by goals, KPIs, and tokenized incentives, drive real economic activity while ensuring transparency and accountability. By merging AI with blockchain’s decentralized coordination, ForU AI is redefining automation—empowering communities to govern, build, and optimize shared financial and social ecosystems. The shift from human-managed finance to AI-powered financial ecosystems is no longer theoretical—it's already in motion. The future of finance isn’t just about speed—it’s about autonomy, adaptability, and continuous evolution. The AI-Blockchain Dilemma: Hype Meets Hard Reality AI and blockchain are rewriting finance, but they come with real risks. Regulators struggle to keep up with borderless AI-driven markets, where oversight gaps can allow hidden risks to pile up. Algorithmic volatility is another wild card—just look at the 2010 Flash Crash when high-frequency trading erased nearly $1 trillion in minutes. Regulators worldwide, from the SEC to the European Commission, are actively assessing how to oversee AI-driven markets, but no global framework yet exists. And while blockchain promises decentralization, AI’s massive computing demands could shift power to those with the biggest infrastructure, reinforcing financial gatekeeping instead of breaking it. The biggest unknown? Financial stability. Traditional markets have circuit breakers and central banks to stop crises from spiraling out of control—but in AI-powered, blockchain-driven finance, who steps in when things go wrong? These challenges aren’t theoretical—they’re already shaping global regulatory debates. The future of AI-driven finance depends on how we balance innovation and control. Your Place in the Financial Revolution Finance is at an inflection point, undergoing an infrastructure overhaul with profound, far-reaching effects. For centuries, financial expertise has been locked behind exclusive credentials and privileged access. AI and blockchain are dismantling these walls, making advanced financial tools available to everyone. Make no mistake: this isn't some distant future to contemplate—it's a financial tsunami already reshaping the shore. Finance is diverging: the old system, built for a slower, human-driven market, and the new frontier—optimized for instant, AI-powered decision-making. As you read this, billions are flowing through AI-driven systems—relentless, autonomous, and unstoppable. The tide is shifting. Ride the wave, or get left behind.

Title: Crypto Bull Run Isn’t Over—It’s Just Changing, Says Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a period marked by extraordinary polarization, market participants find themselves torn between two opposing camps: one steadfastly predicting that the current dip is merely a setup for an impending altcoin rally, and the other resolute that the broader crypto bull run has already reached its conclusion. In a post on X, Koroush Khaneghah, Founder of Zero Complexity Trading, stated, “Right now is the most divided timeline I’ve ever seen. Bulls believe this is the last dip before an Altseason. Bears think bull run is over.” According to Khaneghah, “It’s becoming more challenging to ‘predict’ cycle stages as crypto matures.” He highlights developments that did not appear in previous cycles, including a shift from a traditional altseason to a memecoin season, Ethereum (ETH) still not breaking its all-time highs, and Bitcoin (BTC) surpassing its ATH and moving beyond $100K+ (an outcome absent in earlier cycles) 1. This Cycle Is Different From Others Khaneghah points to growing institutional involvement—an element noticeably absent in earlier bull markets. He cites data suggesting that BlackRock is currently holding nearly $52 billion worth of BTC (via Arkham). In his view, this significantly boosts the long-term buy pressure for Bitcoin, leading to potentially shallower pullbacks since “institutions will keep buying.” Because of heightened institutional interest, Khaneghah expects BTC dominance to continue rising. This dynamic could change how capital rotates into altcoins: “In this cycle, altcoins have seen Capital Dispersion. Meaning, more assets are in the market and liquidity is spread across multiple sectors, stopping any ONE sector from pumping hard.” He contrasts the memecoin market with DeFi. In the previous cycle, the memecoin market was roughly half the size of DeFi. In this cycle, memecoin market capitalization has equaled that of DeFi. If this scenario holds, Khaneghah believes BTC will remain the focal point for major moves while altcoins experience more fragmented, micro bull runs. “This means previous bull run playbooks won’t apply and you simply have to trade rotations,” he notes. 2. The Bull Run Is Not Over Khaneghah observes that BTC has only run 1.6x above the previous cycle highs before pulling back, calling it “not what a normal blow-off top/bubble looks like.” From a historical standpoint, BTC has frequently retraced by 40-50% from its ATH prior to surging higher. In the current cycle, BTC has only retraced about 26% from its peak, suggesting the possibility of more upside if past patterns repeat. A common bull-run trigger, according to many analysts, is ETH surpassing its prior cycle high—something yet to occur, given that ETH has not yet breached $4,000. Khaneghah posits that this lag might indicate a delayed altseason and a much longer overall cycle than expected. For altcoins to regain momentum, Khaneghah sees the ETH/BTC pair as a critical indicator. A bottom in ETH/BTC, combined with a rotation of capital from memecoins into other utility sectors such as DeFi and RWA (Real World Assets), could reignite altcoin rallies. Khaneghah concludes that traders need not be fixated on either the bull or bear side: “If you’re a trader, you don’t have to marry a bias or commit to scenario 1 or 2. If BTC dominance continues, trade BTC by longing strength and shorting weakness. -If alts start to bottom, shift capital there and buy the strongest coins.” At press time, BTC traded at $81,786.

Northvolt, the electric vehicle battery maker founded by two former Tesla executives, has reached the end of the road after failing to secure additional funding. The Swedish company's board announced the bankruptcy on Wednesday, saying that it had "explored all available means to secure a viable financial and operational future." Northvolt said it faced multiple challenges in recent months that undermined its financial position, including growing capital costs and geopolitical instability, resulting in supply chain disruptions and fluctuating demand. Despite support from lenders and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November, the company failed to achieve the financial conditions required to continue operating. A Swedish court-appointed trustee is now set to oversee the sale of the business and its assets. "This is an incredibly difficult day for everyone at Northvolt," Northvolt's interim chair, Tom Johnstone, said in a statement. "We set out to build something groundbreaking — to drive real change in the battery, EV, and wider European industry and accelerate the transition to a green and sustainable future." Northvolt aimed to become Europe's main EV battery manufacturer and counter the dominance of Chinese rivals such as CATL and BYD. It was founded in 2016 by Peter Carlsson and Paolo Cerruti and had raised more than $15 billion from investors including Volkswagen, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Baillie Gifford, and Spotify cofounder Daniel Ek. Northvolt grappled with escalating debts, operational efficiencies, and a reliance on Chinese equipment that hindered its production capabilities. The bankruptcy affects Northvolt AB and its Swedish subsidiaries. Northvolt's German and North American businesses aren't filing for bankruptcy in their respective jurisdictions, though the court-appointed trustee and company lenders are set to determine their future. The collapse has come as European automakers struggle with weak demand for EVs and rising competition from Chinese rivals. Volkswagen, Europe's largest automaker, is considering closing factories in Germany for the first time and cutting tens of thousands of jobs because of weak EV demand and excess capacity. Last week, Mercedes-Benz announced staff buyouts and half-salary reductions to improve earnings following a decline in sales in 2024. Ford, meanwhile, said last November it would cut 4,000 jobs in Europe by the end of 2027. Jump to

Title: Trump administration halts $1 billion program that keeps aging affordable housing livable

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/12/2025 4:22:14 AM PDT by Oldeconomybuyer The Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing, threatening projects that keep tens of thousands of units livable for low-income Americans. Preserving these units gets less attention than ribbon-cuttings, but it’s a centerpiece of efforts to address the nation’s housing crisis. Hundreds of thousands of low-rent apartments, many of them aging and in need of urgent repair, are at risk of being yanked out from under poor Americans. On it’s face, the over $1 billion Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, passed by Congress in 2022, is intended for energy-efficiency improvements. It is distributed in grants and loans to owners of affordable housing in need of updating, including replacing or repairing heating and cooling systems, leaky roofs, aging insulation or windows, or undertaking floodproofing. This money “was essential in order for the project to come together,” said Mike Essian, vice president at American Community Developers, Inc., which received funding for several affordable housing projects. “Projects will fail and these are projects that are already difficult to finance.” he news has been a jolt to Al Hase and Joan Starr, tenants in an apartment building in Vancouver, Washington, full of other low-income seniors with few or no other options — most of whom live on less than $33,000 a year. The 170-unit Smith Tower Apartments, built in the 1960s, is in need of updates, including it’s first building-wide sprinkler system. The $10 million award was a financial kickstart for its nearly $100 million project, and is cited in applications for other investments. “In all honesty,” said Michelle Arevalos, Smith Tower’s administrator, “if this building were not here, a lot of our folks actually probably would be homeless.” (Excerpt) Read more at apnews.com ...

It’s like buying gas for your car at 40 cents a gallon. Later in the article they are complaining about not being able to replace a sprinkler system, but this has nothing to do with “energy efficiency”, so the article is AP propaganda BS. 17 posted on 03/12/2025 5:01:59 AM PDT by brookwood (If I confuse Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley does that mean I'm racist?)

Title: BlackRock/iShares Target Allocation 60/40 Model ETF Portfolio (Meant for Advisors)
URL: https://www.mymoneyblog.com/blackrock-ishares-target-allocation-model-etf-portfolio.html
Time Published: 2025-03-12T08:30:23Z
Full Content:
My Money Blog As a companion to my post on Fidelity Model ETF Portfolios, I also found Blackrock’s version of their 60/40 Model ETF portfolio. The was prompted by the fact that Blackrock recently announced that it was adding a 1-2% allocation to Bitcoin in their model ETF portfolios. The world’s biggest asset manager is finally allowing Bitcoin into its $150 billion model-portfolio universe. BlackRock Inc. is adding a 1% to 2% allocation to the $48 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT) in its target allocation portfolios that allow for alternatives, according to an investment outlook viewed by Bloomberg. Of course, this coincided with the fact that last year they finally launched their own Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT). That made me wonder, what exactly does Blackrock put into these model portfolio that are meant for advisors? The model portfolio below does not have the Bitcoin ETF added yet: As with the Fidelity model portfolio, and probably all model portfolios meant for advisors, there is the appearance of technical complexity, with a lot of tiny allocations to ETFs to bump the total number involved to 18 different ETFs and cash (and possibly the new Bitcoin ETF as well). 1% to the iShares US Infrastructure ETF? 1% to iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF? 1% to iShares Gold Trust? However, what surprised me the most was hidden in their performance stats at the bottom. With a relatively low net weighted expense ratio of 0.16%, their gross overall performance (before all fees) was pretty good and hugged the benchmark indexes very closely. However, they had to disclose that their NET historical performance (what clients actually got) was a lot lower… why was it so much lower? Because their managed portfolio apparently comes with a 3% annual fee, charged quarterly!!! Tucked deep at the bottom: Net composite returns reflect the deduction of an annual fee of 3.00% typically deducted quarterly. Due to the compounding effect of these fees, annual net composite returns may be lower than stated gross returns less stated annual fee. So you put your Managed Portfolio clients in a low-cost ETF portfolio, and then add a 3% annual fee on top. Wow, that’s… wow. I have trouble even believing it. I must be reading this wrong. Another interesting note is that Vanguard’s new CEO, Salim Ramji, was the former global head of iShares and index investments at BlackRock and thus very involved in their push into model ETF portfolios and probably had a big hand in designing them. Will he adjust Vanguard’s suggested portfolios in a similar manner? Hi Jonathan. So are AOA, AOR, and AOM also adding Bitcoin? I don’t think so; if they do they’d have to make a change to their prospectus. Got it. Thanks Jonathan! 3% charged quarterly. My oh my. I wonder what the cumulative effect of that is on the amount that someone needs to invest to reach a typical retirement balance (e.g., over the course of your 50 working years, you need to save $XX more to compensate for the fees taken by your advisor). I’m wondering if the 3% annual rate fee deducted quarterly is actually paid to the advisor, and this is essentially a “loaded” fund. If so, then Blackrock is just a conduit for the advisor’s compensation/commission. Loaded funds are a common way for advisors to be compensated in a manner that is not very visible to the client (A-shares, B-shares, etc.). Some people paying fees this way actually think that their advisor doesn’t charge them anything and provides their services for free. This fund is a prime example of the hocus-pocus that some advisors (typically the commission-based types) like to sell to clients — that complexity with all these 18 investment categories makes it better, and that’s why the client “needs” an advisor. This is the fake “value-add” that they are selling, along with the guise of “this is an exclusive/premium thing not available to people who don’t use an advisor.” It’s just smoke and mirrors with a high cost.

Title: Larry Fink: Expect Inflation Prior to AI and Robot Economy
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/03/12/larry-fink-technology-and-productivity-can-cut-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T08:11:17Z
Full Content:
BlackRock founder Larry Fink is warning President Donald Trump’s MAGA policies might cause some inflation before emerging technology allows American citizens to earn higher wages without inflation. The mega-investor on Wall Street told a March 10 conference hosted by S&P Global: When I go to Washington, when they talk about these [MAGA] policies, I ask “At what cost are you willing to tolerate [wage-driven inflation]? Yes, we may have opportunities to create better and more robust jobs, but then the offside of that will be, it will probably create a little more elevated inflation in the short run. The “little more” inflation from rising wages can be reversed by productivity gains from emerging technology, Fink said. The “big deflation because of the advancement of AI and robots … is going to reshape the economy,” Fink said. Foreign companies are already deploying the new technology that also shrinks inflation, he said: I was with an Asian CEO that builds phones and they’re now applying AI robots — robots that have much more tensile dexterity, that they believe over the course of the next two years, their workforce will be down 30 percent with the advent of more technology and more robotics. If you translate that across all the economies, we’re going to have shortage of [workers for] some things, like I said, in construction and electricians, and we’re going to have job [reductions] in many other industries that robots through AI are going to [cause]. China has invested heavily in robots and automation and leads the world in manufacturing output and in manufacturing technology. Fink described the balancing act that faces Trump and his deputies: With the whole idea that we’re going to have to use private capital to build up this economy, are we going to have enough workers? I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians as we build out AI data centers. Trump’s promise of low migration and Fink’s worries about shortages of agriculture workers, construction crews, and electricians are good news for Trump’s blue-collar voters and their teenage children. That is because labor shortages ensure U.S. workers and their families gain higher wages — and also ensure companies will buy high-tech machinery to help them get more work and wages each day. That result would be good news for GOP politicians because wage gains will likely prompt happy citizens to vote for Trump and GOP politicians in the 2026 midterm elections. Rising wages “are good for national politics if you’re a politician, for sure,” then-U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue told Breitbart News in 2020. “If you look the other side of your question: ‘Are decreasing wages good for national politics?’ Hell, no.” Many of these wage and productivity gains will be delivered by the foreign companies that are moving investment into the United States under Trump’s threat of tariffs. But those wage and productivity gains, however, will be sunk if Trump and GOP legislators agree to import more migrants or H-1B visa workers because of loud demands from employers, investors, donors, ethnic politicians, Democrats, and their chorus of pro-migrant establishment journalists. Fink manages $10 trillion of investments in many companies. His job requires him to balance his investors’ demands for maximum short-term profits and stock-price gains against other demands for the research and investment that create long-term innovation, productivity, and general prosperity. In April 2024, Fink suggested American politicians should grow wealth via investment instead of via President Joe Biden’s policy of extracting migrant consumers, renters, and wage-cutting workers from poor countries. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. But on Monday’s event in Houston, Fink focused on the near-term inflation expected as Trump rolls back Biden’s mass legal and illegal migration. Fink argued: I do believe deportations — and the speed at which it is happening — is going to have a severe impact on the agricultural sector [and] the construction sector. I’ve talked to CEOs in the ag sector, and they remind me that 70 percent of the men and women who work in agriculture were not born in the United States. Many are U.S. citizens. Now many of them have work permits and many of them don’t. Now 40 percent of the construction workers were not born in the United States. You add that up and what’s going on? I think … are we going to have enough workers to harvest the crops? Biden’s high-migration economy reduced wage-driven inflation by importing several million migrant workers. For example, wages rose by less than 1 percent from January 2024 to January 2025 under Biden’s policies. But Biden’s deputies forgot that migrants need housing, food, and autos — and those prices zoomed upwards as roughly 12 million migrants crowded into the United States. The resulting consumer-caused inflation caused massive political problems for Biden and his Democrats. Trump has ended Biden’s migration policy, so he faces no additional consumer-caused inflation. But he and his deputies are zig-zagging forward, by welcoming modest wage gains for Americans while hoping those wage gains do not drive up prices and inflation. So far, Trump’s deputies are deporting perhaps 2 million foreign criminals and migrants already ordered home by judges. Many other migrants are in hiding, some are being caught during workplace visits, and some are voluntarily going home — but there is no sign that Trump’s deputies are already targeting agriculture workers or construction crews. There are millions of unemployed American men and women who might replace deported migrants. At least 5 million demoralized or alienated men have fallen out of the labor force since 2000 and are not officially counted as unemployed. Many can be cajoled, shamed, enticed, or pushed back into the workforce once companies run out of cheap workers. The return of the sidelined workers will reduce pressure for further wage gains, and so reduce inflation. U.S. companies will also likely increase efforts to raise productivity via high-tech automation, just as they did in Trump’s first term. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Wednesday, 12 Mar 2025 KUALA LUMPUR: The High Court here has fixed July 31 to hear the injunction application by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and 10 other companies to prevent Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor (pic) from withdrawing or disposing of any of her assets totalling more than US$346mil (RM1.6bil). This is in relation to the suit filed against the wife of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak and another individual over the purchase of luxury items totalling that amount, allegedly obtained through the misappropriation of 1MDB funds. Lawyer Villasha Anbalagan, representing 1MDB and the 10 companies, said Justice Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya set the hearing date during online case management on Wednesday (March 12). ALSO READ: Rosmah agrees not to sell disputed luxury items "The application will be heard on July 31 at 10.30am via Zoom before Justice Wan Muhammad Amin," the lawyer said when contacted. Rosmah's counsel Datuk Seri Rajan Navaratnam said that on the same day, the court would also hear his client's application for further particulars regarding the plaintiffs' allegations in their statement of claim. The Mareva injunction application was filed by 1MDB and five subsidiaries – 1MDB Energy Holdings Limited, 1MDB Energy Limited, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Limited, Global Diversified Investment Company Limited and SRC International Sdn Bhd – as the first to sixth plaintiffs. The five other companies are Affinity Equity International Partners Limited; Alsen Chance Holdings Limited, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Limited, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Limited and Brightstone Jewellery Limited, as the seventh to 11th plaintiffs. They are seeking, among others, an injunction to prevent Rosmah from disposing of assets amounting to US$346mil, whether in the form of credit, company shares, real estate, or others. ALSO READ: Rosmah still faces multiple court cases A Mareva injunction is a temporary order that restrains the defendant from disposing of assets until a decision is reached in the case between the plaintiffs and the defendant. On May 9 last year, 1MDB and 10 other companies filed a lawsuit naming Rosmah and a woman named Shabnam Naraindas Daswani (also known as Natasha Mirpuri) as the first and second defendants. They are seeking a court order demanding that Rosmah pay US$346,010,489 or an amount deemed appropriate by the court. The plaintiffs are seeking declarations that the first to sixth plaintiffs hold rightful ownership of the luxury items, which are purportedly in Rosmah’s possession. – Bernama Thank you for your report!

Title: Rahul Jacob: Global alliances have changed and so have German policies

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Whether John Maynard Keynes said, “When the facts change, I change my mind" is often disputed, but the witticism has never seemed more apt. German chancellor-to-be Friedrich Merz, long a fiscal hawk as the leader of Germany’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), recently made an about-turn on the virtues of higher deficit spending after being briefed on the country’s dwindling growth prospects and witnessing geopolitical gyrations in the US, which seems keen to patch up with Russia, potentially leaving its European allies in the lurch. The irony is that Merz campaigned as a fiscal conservative ahead of last month’s German elections, which delivered a victory for the CDU and its allies. Merz is also a former executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. This month, it spent $23 billion buying ports from CK Hutchison, including two in Panama. Although Hutchison is Hong Kong-based, Trump had warned against “Chinese" ownership and said he wanted US ownership of the Panama Canal. Also Read: Will Germany under Friedrich Merz script the EU’s independence from America?Merz had long been committed to stronger ties between the US and Europe, but with security alliances like Nato and Aukus now looking akin to a Scrabble board overturned by an unruly child, all is change. Early this month, Merz announced that his government would break the debt ceiling imposed on all German administrations since the global financial crisis to raise defence and infrastructure budgets. This includes an infra fund of €500 billion that its alliance partner, the Social Democratic Party, had campaigned for. Cumulatively, this would dramatically widen Germany’s fiscal deficit, but with GDP growth flat for two years and major industries (such as automobiles) in crisis, this is a good time for a Keynesian stimulus. Germany’s fiscal deficit was 2.8% of GDP last year and its total government debt is well below that of other large European countries. In a rousing speech, Merz vowed a “whatever it takes" approach to defence in the face of “threats to freedom and peace" in Europe. It was a clear reaction to the new world disorder. The CDU and its allies are now expected to rush through a debt-ceiling tweak before the term of this parliament ends because they need a two-thirds majority to do so. Also Read: Germany’s economic crisis offers it an opportunity to break an old gridlockSignificantly, asset markets cheered. “The steepening German yield curve, rising stock prices, euro appreciation, and stable credit default swap prices collectively indicate that markets interpret Germany’s fiscal expansion as growth-enhancing rather than a reckless fiscal bet," according to a paper by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The contrast with the market’s punishment of former UK prime minister Liz Truss’s fiscal adventurism in September 2022 could not have been more vivid. Farzad Saidi, author of the Kiel paper, wittily titled it ‘In Merz we Truss.’ Higher defence and infra spending is expected to revive German manufacturing, which has been in the doldrums. Retooling is already underway. The Financial Times outlined some aspects of it: a car parts factory being used to produce military equipment and a state-owned maker of sensors and radars looking to hire “teams of software engineers from Continental and Bosch, two of Germany’s largest automotive suppliers, which together have announced over 10,000 job cuts in the past year." Also Read: America First: Trump’s trade aggression could trigger another eurozone crisisFiscal policy aside, Germany’s leap of faith from cars to tanks is a 180° pivot from policies pursued since the middle of the last century. Germany has indicated it is open to discussions on a nuclear shield with France. Think-tanks estimate that Europe might need “300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least €250 billion in the short term to deter Russian aggression." Across Europe, from Poland to Denmark, governments are raising defence budgets. As a response to the anarchy of announcements and tweets from the White House, this is simply sensible policy, given Washington’s apparent reversion to the Westphalian state system that arose from treaties at the end of the Thirty Years War in the 17th century. According to Oxford Reference, this means “a system of states… possessing the monopoly of force within their mutually recognized territories." If there is anything consistent in White House outbursts against Canada and Ukraine, it is this. European states, unsurprisingly, are forging closer ties in response.

For too long, India has been US-centric, apparent in the Indian rupee’s de facto peg to the US dollar on one hand and the slow track of negotiations with the EU for a free trade agreement (FTA) on the other. Talks on India’s EU FTA began in 2007, then stalled for several years, and are now on again. For our own sake, we must take the US challenge of lowering our unusually high average tariffs and make a genuine attempt to be part of global supply chains. Net foreign direct investment in India plunged to $1.2 billion in the first nine months of this fiscal year, from an already weak $7.8 billion over those three quarters last year. High levels of MNC disinvestment suggest a global mood change on India. The belief that India would be an automatic beneficiary of Western companies diversifying away from China needs to be reconsidered. As an economist remarked when I ran India’s startling FDI numbers past him, “So much for China plus one."

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart assessed that the delays were expected, and the odds of approval for altcoin ETFs this year are still relatively high. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate.

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the approval odds for these ETFs this year are still relatively high. Decisions on Grayscale’s filings for Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA) ETFs were delayed. The SEC also delayed decisions for XRP ETFs filed by Canary Capital, Bitwise, and 21shares. The regulator also postponed decisions on the Solana (SOL) ETFs filed by 21shares, Canary, and VanEck. Canary’s Litecoin filing was the last altcoin-related ETF delay. Other crypto ETF delays include in-kind creation and redemptions for BlackRock’s IBIT, as well as Fidelity’s FBTC and FETH. 21shares also saw a delay in the proposal to include staking in its Ethereum (ETH) ETF. Despite the delays, the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a Hedera (HBAR) ETF and Bitwise’s DOGE-related filing. Additionally, on March 11, Franklin Templeton filed an S-1 Form for an XRP ETF, joining a new altcoin exchange-traded product race. Seyffart assessed that the multiple delays were expected, as “this is standard procedure.” He added that Paul Atkins has not been confirmed as the new SEC chair, which is also a factor in the delays. The analyst also highlighted that the final deadlines for an SEC decision on all ETFs are due in October and that the odds of approval are still relatively high. In February, Seyffart and Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas published their approval odds for Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin ETFs. LTC leads the odds with a 90% probability of approval this year, with DOGE holding the second-largest percentage at 75%. SOL trails close behind with 70% chances, and XRP with a 65% chance of approval. The analysts highlighted that these odds were less than 5% before President Donald Trump’s November election, making the new numbers relatively high. Moreover, the odds for all ETFs listed by Balchunas and Seyffart could go up if regulatory conditions in the US improve even further.

James Seyffart highlighted that big financial institutions recommending crypto ETFs to high-net-worth clients will boost the adoption of these products. Reports pointed out that the regulator is comparing Ethereum and XRP to define whether Ripple's crypto is a commodity.

Title: Trump defends tariffs, meets corporate America as economic fears nip stocks

Time Published: 2025-03-11T22:58:58Z

World President Donald Trump speaks at the Business Roundtable quarterly meeting in Washington, Tuesday, March 11, 2025, as Business Roundtable Chair and Cisco Chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins listens at right. (Pool via AP) WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump defended his tariff policies on Tuesday (Mar 11) as he met the CEOs of America's biggest companies, including many whose market value has dipped in recent days as recession and inflation fears soured consumer and investor sentiment. The Republican president spoke to about 100 CEOs at a regular meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, an influential group of CEOs leading major US companies, which include Apple, JPMorgan Chase and Walmart. Trump met with technology company executives at the White House on Monday. Trump said his increased tariffs on many imports, which have rattled global markets and prompted stock selloffs, will have a tremendously positive impact over time. "The tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money for this country" and entice companies abroad to build plants in the United States, he said. Trump's economic policies so far have centered on a blitz of tariff announcements. Some of the levies have taken effect and others have been delayed or are set to kick in later. He said they will correct unbalanced trade relations, bring jobs back to the country and stop the flow of illegal narcotics from abroad. He ramped up a burgeoning trade war with Canada, vowing to double tariffs set to take effect within hours on all imported steel and aluminum products from America's northern neighbor to 50 per cent. The White House said later the tariff would remain at 25 per cent after Canadian officials agreed to talks. Markets have been spooked by the prospect that tariffs could raise prices for businesses, boosting inflation, and undermine consumer confidence in a blow to economic growth. US stocks on Tuesday extended last week's selloff that has dragged the benchmark S&P 500 down 3.6 per cent since Trump's election in November last year and 5.3 per cent so far in 2025. "Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down, but you know what? We have to rebuild our country," Trump told reporters earlier. "Some people are going to make great deals by buying stocks and bonds and all the things they're buying." Investors fear that Trump's trade policies could trigger an economic slowdown. Meanwhile, a survey of American households showed consumers growing more pessimistic about their prospects. Trump had already imposed an additional 20 per cent tariff on Chinese goods entering the United States, and 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, although he suspended most of the duties on US neighbours until Apr 2, when he plans to unveil a global regime of reciprocal tariffs on all trading partners. Trump said last month the policies could cause "short-term, some little pain" before delivering long-run benefits. In a Fox News interview aired over the weekend, he declined to predict whether his economic policies would cause a recession. "I don't see it at all," Trump said on Tuesday regarding a recession. Until recently, investors have been optimistic that Trump's policies would tip toward stimulating more growth, for instance through lower taxes, or easing inflationary pressures, for instance by loosening regulation on fossil fuel production. But tax cuts need congressional approval. And some economists see plans to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants increasing price pressures in the labor market, while cutting the federal workforce could raise unemployment. "I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic - and I'm not saying that's a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me - that it's going to have elevated inflation," said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, a Business Roundtable member, at an industry conference on Monday. Economists at Goldman Sachs Group have cut their 2025 US growth forecast and raised their inflation forecast, "both on the back of more adverse tariff assumptions". The forecast remains positive for the year. Last week, the business advocacy group called for making the Trump tax cuts permanent and pushing forward with regulatory reform in the energy, infrastructure and manufacturing sectors, areas of broad alignment with the Trump administration. But the group also urged "negotiators to redouble efforts to secure a path forward that swiftly removes the recently implemented tariffs. These tariffs, especially if they are long-lasting, run the risk of creating serious economic impact". The group said the White House and Congress should preserve the benefits of the North American free trade deal with Mexico and Canada signed during Trump's first term.
