BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund has distributed $100 million from Treasury yields, offering a real-world test of blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Cointelegraph in your social feed BlackRock’s first tokenized money market fund has paid out $100 million in cumulative dividends since its launch, highlighting the growing real-world use of tokenized securities amid rising institutional adoption. The milestone for the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) was announced Monday by Securitize, which serves as the fund’s issuer and tokenization partner, overseeing onchain issuance and investor onboarding. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL was initially issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The fund invests in short-term, US dollar–denominated assets, including US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and cash equivalents, offering institutional investors a blockchain-based vehicle to earn yield while maintaining liquidity. Investors purchase BUIDL tokens pegged to the US dollar and receive dividend distributions directly onchain, reflecting income generated from the underlying assets. Since its debut on Ethereum, BUIDL has expanded to additional blockchains, including Solana, Aptos, Avalanche and Optimism. The $100 million milestone is notable because it represents lifetime payouts derived from actual Treasury yields distributed to holders of onchain fund tokens. It demonstrates that tokenized securities can operate at scale while mirroring the core functions of traditional financial products. The development also underscores the operational efficiencies enabled by blockchain technology, including faster settlement, transparent ownership records and programmable distributions, features that are increasingly drawing interest from large asset managers and institutional investors exploring tokenized real-world assets. BUIDL, in particular, has seen strong adoption, with the value of the tokenized fund surpassing $2 billion earlier this year. Related: Fragmentation drains up to $1.3B a year from tokenized assets: Report Tokenized money market funds have quickly emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of the onchain RWA market, and for good reason. Their appeal lies in their ability to deliver money market–style returns with greater operational efficiency, a dynamic that has begun to draw attention from traditional financial institutions. Some market participants view these products as a potential counterweight to the anticipated growth of stablecoins. In July, JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho said tokenized money market funds preserve the longstanding appeal of “cash as an asset,” even as regulatory developments such as the approval of the GENIUS Act were expected to accelerate stablecoin adoption and potentially erode the role of cash-like instruments. Despite their rapid growth, tokenized money market funds have also attracted industry scrutiny. The Bank for International Settlements recently warned that such products could introduce operational and liquidity risks, particularly as they become an increasingly important source of collateral within the digital asset ecosystem.

Title: The dollar has been the weakest major currency in 2025. Here's what that means for everyday Americans.

Every time Jennifer publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's been a weak run for the buck. The US dollar has declined against all of its main global peers in 2025, and the Dollar Index — which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies — is down 10% this year. There have been multiple catalysts for the decrease, none more prevalent than the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates multiple times. Generally speaking, when a central bank lowers rates, holding a currency becomes less attractive. There's also the matter of President Trump's proposed tariff policies, which particularly roiled markets in the first half of 2025. Investors viewed his potential levies as negative for growth and a source of uncertainty, both of which were dollar-negative. But let's not get too doom-and-gloom about a weak dollar. There are positives too. Detailed below are the two pros and two cons of a depreciating currency: A weaker US currency offers other countries more purchasing power, which can boost exports and economic growth. It can also support US industries that depend heavily on exports, like manufacturing and agriculture. The US exported $125 billion more goods and services in the nine months leading up to September than it did the same period last year, the Census Bureau said this month, an increase of 5%. President Donald Trump pointed out the benefits of a weaker dollar when speaking to the press in July, suggesting that the US could "make a hell of a lot more money" when the greenback was weak. "When we have a strong dollar, one thing happens: It sounds good. But you don't do any tourism. You can't sell tractors, you can't sell trucks, you can't sell anything," he said at the White House. "Pushing down the dollar's value has been a policy priority for the administration as it sought in part to make exports more attractive," Joseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM, wrote in a note on Monday. There are also positive implications for the labor market. If export-heavy industries like manufacturing and agriculture are thriving, that can create more jobs. A boost to international sales is inherently good news for US firms that sell goods abroad. That applies to most of the S&P 500, where foreign sales are significant for at least half of the index's companies, Hogan said. "I would say the pros and cons for corporate America are more tailwinds than headwinds," he added. After the US dollar recorded its worst first half of the year in nearly half a century, Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, said the bank believed a weaker greenback was an underappreciated "tailwind" from an earnings perspective. "There's no doubt that a weaker dollar is part of the story for why revision factors have continued to move — even faster recovery than we had expected," he said, speaking to CNBC earlier in the year. A cheaper dollar could also be a boon for unhedged international equities, or shares of international stocks in local currencies, BlackRock said in a recent client note. That's partly because foreign firms are gaining purchasing power as their local currencies strengthen against the greenback. On the other hand, a weaker currency in the US can translate to higher prices for US consumers of imported goods, or goods with imported parts. That adds to inflationary pressures that already hang in the background with Trump's tariffs. Consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year in November — below what economists expected, but still above the Fed's long-run 2% inflation target. "For everyday Americans, the story is a bit opposite," Hogan said. "The buying power of your dollar goes down as the value of the dollar goes down against the basket of other currencies. So it does make it harder to keep up with higher cost of goods." Americans on vacation could also facing higher costs, as a weaker dollar has less purchasing power abroad, Hogan added. On the flip side, it also makes the US more attractive as a tourist destination for foreigners, who have gained purchasing power. "There's puts and takes," he said. "If you're planning that European vacation, it's going to cost you a bit more in that currency translation." Jump to

Title: Mirae Asset announces plans to acquire Korean crypto exchange Korbit
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/29/mirae-asset-announces-plans-acquire-korean-crypto-exchange-korbit/
Time Published: 2025-12-29T16:05:14Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 11:05 EST / DECEMBER 29 2025 by Kyt Dotson Seoul-based financial firm Mirae Asset Financial Group is considering buying Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit Inc., the Korea Times reported today. The Korean cryptocurrency market is dominated by Upbit and Bithumb, which represent over 95% of the exchange volume in the country. As the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange, Korbit serves as an entry point for Mirae into the cryptocurrency industry, which has traditionally focused on traditional finance since its founding in the late 1990s. Founded in 2013, Korbit, also known as 코빗 (Ko-bit) in Korean, began as Korea’s first cryptocurrency exchange, pioneering bitcoin trading in Korean won. Although it opened the market to the local population and paved the way for early trading infrastructure, it was quickly surpassed by the larger exchanges. Today, it still remains a key player in the market. Officials at Mirae said the company is in talks to acquire a 60.5% stake in Kobit from its parent company, NXC Corp., the exchange’s largest shareholder, and a 31.5% from SK Planet. NXC is the family holding group that owns a controlling stake in major South Korea-based global video game giant Nexon Co. Ltd., a developer and publisher known for games like MapleStory and Dungeon Fighter Online. The deal is estimated at up to 140 billion won, around $97.5 million total. The purchase would be led by Mirae Asset Consulting, the group’s real estate and consulting affiliate controlled by founder Park Hyeon-joo and his wife. Mirae offers asset management, wealth management, investment banking and insurance. Since its founding, it established itself as a prominent leader in traditional finance. An unnamed industry official quoted by the Korea Times noted that Park, now global strategy officer, previously emphasized exploring business opportunities that interconnect traditional finance to digital assets. “Korbit has historically had a limited presence, but Mirae Asset Financial Group’s decades of expertise could allow it to pursue a differentiated strategy,” he added. The purchase could shift the current nature of Korea’s cryptocurrency and digital asset landscape. Kobit maintains a large number of regulatory licenses in the country. The acquisition news follows increasing outreach throughout the global market by major financial firms, including MasterCard Inc., multinational investment management firm BlackRock Inc. and the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc.

Title: Could Bitcoin Replay Silver’s Rally… Backward? CEO Issues Warning

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Peter Schiff has warned that Bitcoin could suffer the opposite fate of silver after the metal posted a sudden, sharp rise. Based on reports, traders and analysts are debating whether the move in silver marks a broad shift back to real assets or a brief, crowded trade that may unwind quickly. According to trading data, silver jumped more than 10% in a single session and rose from about $78 to $79 in roughly ninety minutes. Spot silver climbed 18% last week to close at a record $79.31 on thin post-Christmas volume and its new status as a strategic metal. Reports have disclosed that this rally is being driven by a supply deficit and Washington’s decision to classify silver as a critical mineral, not by geopolitics or hopes for US rate cuts. A TradingView chart showed a near-vertical breakout, and a monthly RSI reading reached its highest level in 45 years, a sign of extreme momentum. What is happening with silver may soon be happening with Bitcoin, only in reverse. But since markets tend to melt down faster than they melt up, the time frame for the move should be condensed. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 27, 2025 Tokenized versions of metal assets have also gained ground. Based on reports, these crypto-linked commodity tokens are approaching a $4 billion overall valuation, reflecting growing investor curiosity. CompaniesMarketCap data showed silver’s market value closing the gap with NVIDIA, a comparison that highlights heavy institutional demand for metal exposure. Still, tokenized assets remain small compared with spot markets and big ETFs, which means the shift is visible but not yet broad-based. Bitcoin traded near $87,000 with little movement over the same period, according to CoinMarketCap snapshots, and some market charts show Bitcoin losing relative ground to silver since 2017. A silver-to-Bitcoin valuation model places Bitcoin’s trend value near $394,000, a figure that prompts debate among traders about where each market could go next. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s strong inflows in 2025 point to steady institutional accumulation in crypto, while other indicators suggest Bitcoin’s gains can stall without fresh catalysts. Spot silver’s strong weekly gain has left technicians and strategists split. Some say the move reflects a true supply-demand mismatch reinforced by the US critical mineral designation, which has encouraged long-term buying. Others point to the thin volume after the holidays as a factor that magnified price moves. A closing price reversal top pattern at record highs has been flagged by chart watchers, signaling that a correction could follow after such rapid ascent. These signs, combined with extreme RSI readings, raise questions about the sustainability of the current breakout. Market veterans emphasize that fast rallies can reverse quickly when liquidity dries up. Peter Schiff argued that declines often accelerate under pressure, and that idea matters because crowded positions can be unwound in a short span. At the same time, long-term flows into Bitcoin-related ETFs and institutional products should not be ignored; they can support higher prices over time. What traders watch next will be trade volumes, whether silver holds above current levels, and whether Bitcoin regains momentum in the face of metal strength.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: XRP ETFs blow past $1bn in inflows. Where will token price go in 2026?

About us Copy link XRP exchange-traded funds are charging head-on into 2026. ETFs backed by the fifth largest crypto have attracted over $1 billion in investment since launching in November, according to SoSoValue data. There has not been a single day of net outflow since their debut. That far outpaces comparable Solana ETFs, which have pulled in $387 million over the same period. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have seen $3.6 billion in selloffs in the same timeframe. Ethereum ETFs have also bled $1.2 billion, DefiLlama data shows. But the flood of capital into ETFs backed by XRP has not helped the token’s price after the crypto market’s October downturn that wiped out $1 trillion in value. XRP is trading at $1.88 at time of reporting, 49% below its all-time high of $3.65 set in July. “We expect the price pattern to broadly resemble what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum, though on a much smaller scale,” Jonathan Yark, quantitative trader at Acheron Trading, told DL News. “XRP has specific use cases around payments and treasury flows,” Yark said. “We’re in a genuine adoption phase for crypto ETFs, which means periods of rapid inflows followed by consolidation.” The relentless capital inflow into XRP ETFs comes as more and more institutions embrace crypto. Vanguard, the $11 trillion asset management heavyweight long associated with institutional restraint, reversed course and launched spot crypto ETF trading earlier in December. “Vanguard’s distribution reach is enormous, and opening access signals a shift from opposition to adoption. That alone will help pull more traditional investors into the asset class,” Yark said. Wall Street stalwarts including BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, all have rolled out crypto ETF offerings over the past two years. “Institutions, like Bank of America and Vanguard, are steadily opening access and that shift supports a sustained, long-term market rather than a short-lived boom,” Yark said. Other firms expected to launch their own XRP ETFs include 21Shares, ProShares, and CoinShares, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s website shows. “Flows will remain highly dependent on settlement, but the broader trajectory is clearly positive.” Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

Title: Ethereum’s record staking queue looks bullish, but one corporate giant is secretly distorting the real signal

Ethereum’s staking congestion signals institutional interest amidst regulatory progress, led by BitMine’s bold move. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. A single corporate treasury has effectively hijacked Ethereum’s validator mechanics, executing a billion-dollar maneuver that has flipped the network’s flow data from a steady exodus to a sudden traffic jam. For the first time in six months, the queue to stake ETH, locking up tokens to secure the blockchain in exchange for yield, significantly outstrips the line to exit. Data compiled by the Ethereum Validator Queue tracker shows approximately 734,299 ETH waiting for entry, implying a mandatory delay of nearly two weeks before these coins can begin earning rewards. By comparison, the exit queue holds roughly 343,179 ETH, with a delay of six days. On the surface, the data suggests a broad resurgence in investor sentiment, a bullish signal for a proof-of-stake network where participation is often read as a proxy for long-term confidence. However, a closer examination of the on-chain flows reveals a more concentrated reality. Nearly half of the entire entry backlog, 342,560 ETH, originates from a single entity: BitMine, the largest public ETH holding firm. The digital asset treasury firm’s aggressive entry over the past 48 hours has distorted the signal, masking what remains a cautious market environment. While the validator line is indeed moving up, the “crowd” is arguably a single whale creating a wake that retail and smaller institutional players are merely drafting behind. For traders and analysts, distinguishing between broad organic demand and idiosyncratic corporate treasury management has become the primary challenge of the holiday trading session. While BitMine dominates the immediate flows, its move is not occurring in a vacuum. It coincides with a pivotal shift in the regulatory environment that has fundamentally reduced the risk of staking for US institutions. In a landmark clarification earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated that liquid staking activities, specifically the receipt of tokens representing staked assets, do not constitute securities transactions, provided the provider exerts no managerial effort. This was followed in November by the IRS and Treasury Department issuing Revenue Procedure 2025-31. This guidance created a “safe harbor” for exchange-traded products (ETPs) and trusts, allowing them to stake digital assets without jeopardizing their tax status as grantor trusts. Asset manager Grayscale stated that these two policy changes have effectively greenlit a new era of product structure. In a recent note to clients, the firm's analysts argued that crypto ETPs' ability to stake will likely make them the default structure for holding investment positions in proof-of-stake tokens. Due to this, the firm predicts a bifurcated market in which custodial staking via ETPs captures the passive bid, exerting pressure on reward rates. In contrast, on-chain liquid staking retains the advantages of composability within DeFi. This regulatory clarity explains why capital is moving now. The “institutional pipeline” is no longer blocked by compliance ambiguity. As a result, the market has seen BlackRock advance its iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ticker: ETHB), and Grayscale has already enabled staking for its Ethereum Trust (ETHE). These regulated vehicles are now routing portions of their massive established holdings into the validator set, transforming static assets into productive ones. Meanwhile, this shift has forced a maturity upgrade across the crypto infrastructure stack. Staking represents a new form of yield on otherwise idle digital assets, but for institutions, the implications go far beyond simple returns. The primary driver is capital efficiency: the ability to convert static holdings into productive assets while maintaining on-chain exposure. However, this efficiency introduces new layers of operational complexity. Validator management, slashing risk, and reporting obligations demand a professional infrastructure that retail wallets cannot support. Furthermore, strict regulatory classification and audit requirements mean that staking must now align with fiduciary duties and jurisdictional standards. So, institutions that treat staking as a robust operational process, factoring in segregation, reporting, and compliance, are positioned to capture sustainable yield and strategic advantage. However, those that fail to professionalize risk falling behind in an increasingly competitive, yield-aware digital asset market. Nezhda Aliyeva, Head of Product at Platform, said, “Institutional staking is moving from experiment to expectation. Our clients want yield, but they want it delivered with the same rigour as any other financial operation – segregated, secure, and compliant.” Meanwhile, the current congestion is not solely due to new money; it is also a story of returning capital. The validator set is currently refilling after a period of intense technical and market-driven churn. First, the “Pectra” network upgrade was implemented. Among other changes, Pectra raised the maximum effective balance for validators from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. This improvement in staking user experience allowed large operators to consolidate thousands of small validators into fewer, larger ones. Ethereum's Pectra upgrade raises validator stake limits, yet security and standardization concerns surface. The upgrade made restaking easier for large balances, prompting a wave of operational shuffling that is only now stabilizing. Second, a security scare involving staking provider Kiln caused a mass exodus. Following an API exploit prevention protocol, Kiln initiated a precautionary unstaking of Ethereum validators to safeguard client funds. Kiln takes responsible steps to safeguard funds amid SwissBorg-related exploit, impacting Ethereum staking times. While no funds were lost on Ethereum, the move forced a significant percentage of the network’s stake to exit and wait out the safety period. Those coins are now rotating back in, contributing to the entry jam. Simultaneously, the DeFi sector underwent a painful deleveraging. According to DeFi analyst Ignas, a spike in borrow rates on Aave forced traders utilizing “looping” strategies, leveraging staked Ethereum (stETH) to borrow more ETH, to unwind their positions. This trend, which Ignas notes was kick-started by maneuvering from heavyweights like Justin Sun, flushed leverage out of the system. The result is visible in the broader data. Dune Analytics figures indicate that the total amount of ETH deposited by investors into protocols and contracts has remained relatively stable at around 36 million. The queue drama, therefore, is less about a massive injection of fresh cash and more about the network's “plumbing” resetting itself. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is the Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate and host of the SlateCast. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. The planned jump in capacity relies on a fragile shift to ZK-proof verification that could buckle under network stress. Exchange balances hit record lows and institutions control 11% of supply, but NFT sales cratered 87% and retail sits out. Is ETH becoming infrastructure without the culture?

Title: Real-world assets top DEXs to become 5th-largest category in DeFi by TVL

Time Published: 2025-12-29T11:22:54Z

RWA protocols have overtaken decentralized exchanges by total value locked, as tokenized Treasurys, private credit and commodities become core onchain building blocks. Cointelegraph in your social feed Real-world asset (RWA) protocols are one of decentralized finance’s (DeFi’s) winners in 2025, overtaking decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to become the fifth-largest category by total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama. RWAs now account for about $17 billion in TVL, up from $12 billion in Q4 2024, highlighting how quickly tokenized Treasurys, private credit and other real-world claims have moved from niche experiments to core DeFi plumbing. As DefiLlama noted, “At the start of this year, they weren’t even in the top 10 categories.” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph that RWA growth is being driven by “balance-sheet incentives rather than experimentation,” with higher-for-longer rates making tokenized Treasurys and private credit attractive as onchain, yield-bearing assets, amid improving regulatory clarity that is lowering friction for institutional allocators. Earlier this year, RWAs excluding stablecoins had grown to about $24 billion, with private credit and tokenized Treasurys identified as the main growth engines and Ethereum as the dominant public settlement layer for onchain debt and fund structures. Related: Emerging market economies to drive RWA tokenization in 2026: Crypto exec Through 2025, that market has remained concentrated around a small group of large issuers and vehicles on Ethereum, while RWA.xyz data shows a second tier of networks, including BNB Chain, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon and Arbitrum, each capturing low‑to-mid single‑digit percentage shares of public‑chain RWA value. In parallel, permissioned infrastructure like Canton Network has become a major institutional hub, with over 90% of the total market share, hosting large RWA programs in a privacy‑preserving, regulated environment that can plug into DeFi data and liquidity rails. Related: Canton token rallies 27% after DTCC outlines tokenized Treasury plans Tokenized US Treasurys remain the gateway product, with platforms like the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Circle’s USYC, Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, Ondo’s OUSG, and similar funds pushing the combined tokenized Treasury segment above the multi‑billion‑dollar mark by December. Liu said that “the constraint is no longer tokenization itself, but liquidity, and integration into TradFi,” adding that attention in 2026, “attention should shift from headline TVL to control and usage, who owns issuance, where RWAs are deployed as collateral, and which venues capture secondary market flow.” Rallies in gold and silver are adding a fresh leg to the RWA trade, pulling more capital into tokenized commodities. Recent data put tokenized commodities’ market cap near $4 billion, led by gold products such as Tether Gold and Paxos Gold, which have expanded alongside spot metals, pushing toward new highs. Liu said these moves are “elevating [tokenized commodities] from niche RWAs to macro-relevant assets with real demand for on-chain access and settlement in a 24/7 market,” helped by clearer pricing and custody standards that make them easier to plug into DeFi and institutional systems. Into 2026, he pointed to “behavioral validation” as gold and silver break highs, arguing that price strength attracts issuance, which attracts liquidity and reinforces adoption beyond pure yield narratives. He also highlighted interoperability as another key signal, and said that “real acceleration” will come when “tokenized commodities can move seamlessly across venues and chains, functioning as neutral collateral rather than isolated products.” FOLLOW US © Cointelegraph 2013 - 2025 COINTELEGRAPH NEWSLETTER MOBILE APPS Cointelegraph covers fintech, blockchain and Bitcoin bringing you the latest crypto news and analyses on the future of money.

Title: SGX seeks quality Chinese companies for listings

ST PHOTO: SHINTARO TAY Krist Boo Summary AI generated Published Dec 29, 2025, 04:00 PM Updated Dec 29, 2025, 06:27 PM SINGAPORE – Investors could see more familiar Chinese names on the local bourse in 2026 as the Singapore Exchange (SGX) makes a renewed push to draw Chinese companies for listings. Fresh from grant injections by the Government and recent regulatory nods from both sides, the exchange is gunning for tried-and-proven businesses like advanced manufacturing, as well as those in digital infrastructure, consumer technology, healthcare and sustainable energy. This time, compared with the 2000s, targets will be on businesses deemed to have long wicks rather than stars that light up the scene, just to fizzle out shortly after. The first pitch is to familiar brands here to put their primary, or first, listings here, said Ms Chia Caihan, SGX Group’s head of capital markets for Greater China. Speaking to The Straits Times at SGX Centre on Dec 17, she said at the top of this list are Chinese businesses that have moved their headquarters here and are eyeing growth in this region. With fund raising slowing in China, SGX’s second pitch is to companies already listed in China to come for a secondary listing. It will help raise their brand profile among investors here if they are eyeing expansion in South-east Asia, she said. A secondary listing also allows them to issue their Singapore employees shares, which cannot be done with their Chinese counters, known as A-shares – owing to foreign ownership restrictions and currency controls. Singapore offers these companies access to US and European investors, as well as regional investors who increasingly recognise Chinese brands and are willing to invest in them, Ms Chia said. “China’s governance disclosures are now almost at developed market standards. You look at the kind of disclosures that they require, it is almost compatible with developed jurisdictions.” The criteria for prospects are a clear strategic mindset for listing, with local presence and shareholder communication, she said. In the 2000s, a number of Chinese-listed companies – known as S-chips on SGX – were facing accusations over fraud, accounting irregularities and debt issues, and delistings and share suspensions followed. Ms Chia, who started in SGX in 2004 and took on her current portfolio in 2024, said that this time, it will be different. The companies that listed on the exchange then were narrow in their scope of businesses, she said. Some of those companies did well when they were approved for listing, but did not have the scope to pivot when the economic cycle changed. “Some of them took the extreme route of doing illegal stuff, falsifying accounts and all that. That sent a very bad message to the market, and it affected the confidence. We don’t want that to happen again,” she said. SGX’s push is bolstered by the $5 billion Equity Market Development Programme, launched by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in 2025. $5 billion Equity Market Development Programme The kitty channels funds via managers including BlackRock and Eastspring to provide cornerstone capital, or funds committed for a chunk of shares in new listings that helps shore up their credibility; market-making support; and research grants as part of its goal to revive tepid investor and listing activity on SGX in recent years. Regulatory support also came in December following a meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong, who is also Minister for Trade and Industry, and Chinese Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang, which resulted in bilateral support for Chinese companies to mount secondary listings on SGX. The exchange listed 614 companies on its mainboard and Catalist as at Dec 18, including about 100 of Chinese origin. Recent listings include shoe rubber adhesive maker Infinity Development on the Catalist and Yangzijiang Maritime Development, a spin-off of Yangzijiang Financial, which was itself carved out from Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, which listed in 2007. The first time Yangzijiang Shipbuilding spun off its financial arm, the original company more than doubled its value from $6 billion, said Ms Chia, illustrating the potential of the market. Against its competitor, the Hong Kong stock exchange, SGX touts Singapore’s edge in its Government’s support – even post-listing – with research and growth funding, Ms Chia said. Low liquidity, a frequent complaint about SGX, does not worry Chinese investors, with early help from the exchange on netting secondary investors after their listing, and market-making research. Companies valued under $5 billion would find the support especially helpful. “I think they are pretty comfortable with what we can offer because they don’t get this kind of support when they go to other markets. They are just too small,” she said. The Republic also has a diverse investor base: Asean players, family offices, European pension and hedge funds, Middle Eastern funds, as well as regional vehicles of US-based funds, which are mostly avoiding Chinese investments given geopolitical tensions. Asked about “Singapore-washing” concerns, where listings might superficially rebrand China-centric operations, Ms Chia said: “A listing does not make you a Singapore company overnight. “You need to work together with our SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). You need to see how to make use of our talent and resources.” Compared with the Chinese entrepreneurs who arrived two decades ago, and who sometimes imported entire supply chains without integration, today’s cohort is more aware of the need to reciprocate. “They recognise the benefits that Singapore is giving them, and a lot of them are giving it back to Singapore. It is just that, given their status – they may still be Chinese citizens – they cannot do it that openly. “But I would say that they have been doing more than what we expect because they really hope to blend into Singapore.” For local investors, participating in these companies’ corporate meetings and asking questions will keep the companies on their toes and help them communicate more. On why getting the listings matters, Ms Chia said: “Chinese companies are important because in the overall corporate world, they have become a very important piece.” The move also helps Singapore retain and grow its wealth, she said. “That is why I would think that everybody has a role to play in it.” Krist Boo is senior business correspondent at The Straits Times.

(Photo: AFP/Daniel de Carteret) PANAMA CITY: Near the entrance to the Panama Canal, a monument to China's contributions to the interoceanic waterway was torn down Saturday night (Dec 27) by order of local authorities. The move comes as US President Donald Trump has made threats in recent months to retake control of the canal, claiming Beijing has too much influence in its operations. In a surprising move that has been criticised by leaders in Panama and China, the mayor's office of the locality of Arraijan ordered the demolition of the monument built in 2004 to symbolise friendship between the countries. The mayor's office said in a statement that the monument, which overlooked the waterway spanning Bridge of the Americas, had structural damage that posed a "risk".

Bitcoin ETFs record sell-off but hold firm on institutional support. Bitcoin has faced intense selling pressure, with the asset down 32% from its high of $126,000 on the 6th of October. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remain a key channel for gauging Bitcoin market sentiment. This time, however, the behavior of investors behind these ETFs suggests deeper dynamics at play. U.S. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have remained on the bearish side of the market, recording significant outflows even as Bitcoin’s price attempts to stabilize. Bitcoin [BTC] Spot ETFs are facing renewed pressure as traditional investors pull back capital while still maintaining exposure to the asset. According to CryptoQuant, Cumulative Outflows from Bitcoin ETFs have reached $5.5 billion from their all-time high. As a result, total Assets Under Management (AUM) have dropped to $116.58 billion, down from a peak of $163.27 billion. Source: CoinGlass This trend confirms that traditional investors, operating through institutional ETFs, have scaled back capital inflows into the market. Such outflows are expected during periods of weak market sentiment, especially as Bitcoin continues to range between $85,000 and $90,000. Despite broader ETF outflows, traditional investors with exposure to BlackRock’s U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF continue to dominate market activity. Over the past twelve days, these investors have purchased more BTC than any other institutional group in the market. Data showed that within this period, the group recorded six separate BTC ETF inflows, with total net inflows amounting to 1.32 million Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1.16 billion. This trend remains a key indicator, particularly as BlackRock controls the largest share of BTC among institutional investors. Source: CryptoQuant As of press time, this group held $67.56 billion worth of Bitcoin, reinforcing a bullish undercurrent that continues to influence other ETF participants in the market. Notably, retail investors trading Bitcoin directly through centralized exchanges are also showing signs of renewed confidence. Since the start of December, this group has consistently accumulated BTC week after week. Last week alone, purchases totaled approximately $891.61 billion, according to Glassnode. While this reflects broader global retail investor behavior, it confirms sustained confidence in the asset class, marked by four consecutive weeks of consistent supply absorption. BlackRock may still expand its involvement with Bitcoin, as CEO Larry Fink has publicly shifted his stance on the cryptocurrency. Fink, who previously described Bitcoin as an “index for money laundering” and a tool for “thieves,” had a change in perspective during a recent interview at the DealBook Summit 2025. He noted that BTC now presents a “huge future use case,” signaling growing institutional openness. While the scope of these use cases remains unclear, the shift highlights a potential long-term opportunity for current investors.

Although asset managers had previously fought tooth and nail to offer products tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum’s spot price, many foresaw opportunities in 2025, as the regulatory environment started to shift with President Donald Trump’s return to power in January. As of Dec. 15, spot Bitcoin ETFs had generated $57.7 billion in net inflows since their historic debut in January 2024, according to Farside Investors. That represented a 59% increase compared to $36.2 billion at the start of this year. But inflows weren’t consistent. Investors poured $1.2 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs on Oct. 6, for example, as the asset approached an all-time high above $126,000, according to CoinGlass. As Bitcoin’s price slipped below the $90,000 mark on Nov. 11, a few weeks later, investors yanked $900 million from the funds. Still, that was only the second worst day for spot Bitcoin ETFs on record: As Bitcoin plunged in February on fears related to trade and inflation, the products posted $1 billion in outflows. Since their debut last July, spot Ethereum ETFs had generated $12.6 billion in net inflows, as of Dec. 15, according to CoinGlass. As the cryptocurrency surged toward an all-time high of nearly $4,950 in August, the products generated $1 billion in inflows on a single day. With signs of growing adoption among financial institutions, those products largely operated in the background, as onlookers focused on the prospect of more ETFs that could potentially boost digital asset prices, or expand access to new investors. Yet some are relatively focused on ETFs tracking multiple cryptocurrencies at once, as products ideal for institutions. When the SEC approved generic listing standards for commodity-based trusts in September, the regulator moved to address anticipation that had been building for months. The stack of applications for ETFs covering a wide range of digital assets had grown thick on its desk, with approvals hinging on an answer that the SEC’s previous leadership had danced around for years: When should a digital asset be treated a commodity? Instead of being forced to make case-by-case decisions about the eligibility of various cryptocurrencies, from Dogecoin to the president’s meme coin, the SEC instead outlined criteria for exchanges that made digital assets fit for commodity-based trusts. Among the most important factors, the standards require digital assets underlying ETFs to trade on surveilled markets, have a six-month history of futures trading, or already back an exchange-traded fund with significant exposure. That meant that at least a dozen cryptocurrencies were instantly “good to go,” Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt in September. From his perspective, he described the move as expected. The approval of generic listing standards is set to greatly expand the number of products that investors have access to, but asset managers are still waiting for answers on at least 126 ETFs, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Research Analyst James Seyffart recently said on X. Those applications focus on tokens from up-and-coming decentralized finance projects like the Hyperliquid, as well as relatively novel meme coins, including Mog. First there was Bitcoin, then there was Ethereum. Now, investors in the U.S. have access to ETFs tracking the spot price of XRP and Solana, among a handful of others. As the fifth- and seventh-largest digital assets by market capitalization, respectively, XRP and Solana both faced regulatory headwinds under the Biden administration, which dissipated on the road to becoming underlying assets for a number of products. Last year’s debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs unleashed a wave of demand that buoyed the asset’s price to new highs. While the same can’t be said for the smaller cryptocurrencies yet, products dedicated purely to XRP and Solana still generated notable activity. “I don’t think they’ve had the effect on the price that maybe people hoped for, but I do think, idiosyncratically, they have been huge successes and a validation of investor appetite beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. Leon said the debut of ETFs for Solana and XRP came in November at a “disadvantageous time,” with macroeconomic conditions driving digital-asset prices lower in recent months. Still, spot Solana ETFs have generated $92 million in net inflows since launch, as of Dec. 15, according to CoinGlass. Spot XRP ETFs, which debuted the same month, have generated roughly $883 million in net inflows since they began trading. The debut of Solana ETFs was notable for another reason: They were among the first ETFs to share a portion of their rewards from staking with investors, a development bolstered by new guidance last month from the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was among financial giants that have thus far passed up the opportunity to expand their set of crypto-focused products to additional assets, but Leon noted that XRP and Solana’s communities may not need them. “What we’ve seen with the ETF so far shows that these communities are much more engaged and stronger and larger than maybe many people thought,” he said. “And I think that bodes well for both ecosystems going into 2026.” Net inflows for spot Dogecoin ETFs stood at $2 million as of Dec. 15, according to SoSoValue. In 2025, individual investors and hedge funds were among the most likely groups to hold spot crypto ETFs, but that dynamic may start shifting materially soon, according to Gerry O’Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management. He told Decrypt that many advisors and professional investors are still in the process of due diligence for ETFs that track cryptocurrencies, but he has a sense that they could start thinking seriously about allocations to the asset class soon. Then again, Vanguard signaled earlier this month that it would let its 50 million customers trade some spot crypto ETFs on its brokerage platform. Bank of America, meanwhile, put its stamp of approval on modest crypto allocations for private wealth clients starting next year. “A year ago or so, there was a lot of regulatory uncertainty, and they weren't really ready to dip their toes into the space” he said. “And now the questions aren’t really whether or not they should get exposure. It's how they should get exposure.” In that sense, O’Shea believes ETFs that track an index of digital assets will become a bigger part of the conversation next year. Many professional investors appreciate how those funds’ holdings shift over time, giving them relative peace of mind, he said. “They can make an allocation to an index ETF and get broad exposure to the growth potential of the market without having to have all that sort of detailed knowledge,” O’Shea explained. “They don't need to know everything about every one of these individual assets.” In February, Hashdex was behind the first spot ETF tracking multiple digital assets in the U.S., with the debut of the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF. Modeled on the Nasdaq Crypto Index, it holds Cardano, Chainlink, and Stellar, as well as larger cryptocurrencies. Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, and CoinShares have debuted similar products, although some seek exposure to digital assets through derivatives. In total, the group of index ETFs offer exposure to 19 digital assets, per ETF Trends. Although some pension funds in the U.S. have purchased spot Bitcoin ETFs, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board liquidated $300 million in holdings around February. The move was revealed via 13F filings that large institutional investors release quarterly. Al Warda Investments disclosed a $500 million position in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF in November. The investment firm is tied to the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, a subsidiary of Mubadala Investment, which acts as a sovereign wealth fund in Abu Dhabi. Mubadala itself disclosed a position in BlackRock’s product in February, which was worth $567 million, as of its latest 13F filing. Around the same time, it was revealed that Harvard’s endowment held shares in the ETF worth $433 million. Brown University and Emory University also disclosed positions in spot Bitcoin ETFs this year, emerging as early adopters of the asset on an institutional level. Broadly, analysts have said the shift in investors could lead to less volatility for Bitcoin and shallower drawdowns. “It hasn't been dramatic, but it has been notable,” O’Shea said, in reference to a broadening investment base. “This shift from retail to institutional is very good for the long-term sustainability of the asset class, because you do have these folks with much longer-term time horizons.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Worried About Retirement? You're Not Alone: Nearly 50% of Americans in Peak Earning Years Worry About It Every Day

For many Americans, retirement is a constant worry. According to BlackRock, 47% of Americans between the ages of 45 to 54 worry about their retirement savings at least once a day. These financial moves will help to assuage some of those worries. "It’s common for Gen Xers to feel squeezed between saving for retirement and living a meaningful life now. The good news is that they are achieving peak incomes," said Preston Cherry, CFP and founder of Concurrent Wealth. Here's how Gen Xers can move into greater retirement savings and less worry. When it comes to retirement savings, young investors have an advantage because the money they invest has the advantage of growing with compound interest over several decades. Assuming average stock market returns of 6% to 7%, every dollar you invest now can triple or quadruple by the time you retire. People in their 40s and 50s have shorter time horizons, but investing 10 to 20 years out from retirement can still make a difference in their retirement savings. If you aren't already doing so, automate your retirement savings strategy. Put aside money with each paycheck or each month, even if it's only a small amount. These steady payments can help your retirement savings grow, and they can also help to calm some of the panic you may be feeling about retirement. You should also establish an emergency fund. Put three to six months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account, and only reach for it in times of an emergency. This will reduce the temptation to tap your retirement funds for surprise expenses, which can potentially incur hefty penalties. A 401(k) or similar tax-advantaged plan is a great way to build up your retirement savings, especially if it comes with a matching contribution from your employer. As a rule of thumb, investing 10% to 15% of each paycheck is a good goal. In 2025, you can contribute as much as $23,500 in a 401(k). This amount goes up to $70,000 when your contributions are combined with your employer's contributions. If you are in your 50s, you may invest in a catch-up contribution of $7,500 into your 401(k). Individual retirement accounts—like a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA—are other great ways to save for retirement. Both have contribution limits of $7,000 for 2025. Those age 50 older can make a catch-up contribution of $1,000. Cherry encourages Gen Xers to align their financial plans with their values, lifestyle needs, and long-term goals. "This is what I call lifestyle-aligned wealth planning. It’s not just about how much you save, but how intentionally you save," Cherry advises. "When you know your retirement rate—which is how much you need to fund [your retirement] annually—your retirement date, when you want to be work-optional, you’re no longer guessing. You’re designing your life with clarity and confidence." To get started, you'll need to be honest with yourself about the state of your retirement savings and where you would like to be headed. "The keys are being honest, giving yourself grace for where you are, being confident, and committing to where you want to go," Cherry said. For most people, the years between ages 45 and 54 are peak years for income, but many still worry about being able to afford retirement. The best way to beat these worries is through action. Start saving regularly, and contribute as much as you can to tax-advantaged retirement plans, like 401(k)s and IRA accounts. Taking charge of your investments and savings is the best way to ease your concerns about retirement.

Title: Should we ban social media for under-16s? Irish teens share their thoughts

Earlier this month Australia became the first country in the world to ban social media for children under the age of 16. It’s a move that’s being watched closely around the globe, not least by those aged under 16, wondering if this could become their reality too. Here, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said “there needs to be more debate on whether blanket bans are the way to go”, while Tánaiste Simon Harris said he is “very supportive of the idea of social media being restricted to people above a certain age”. But what do those likely to be affected if a similar ban was to happen in Ireland think? Sarah Davitt (15), from Blackrock, Co Dublin, recently returned from a trip to Brussels with the Webwise Youth Panel, which is focused on raising awareness of online safety. “I personally would be against it [the ban] being brought in to Ireland,” she says. “By banning something outright, less education is going to be put forward. If we’re trying to educate our youth on social media, we cannot do that unless we have the use of social media.” She says “restrictions and safety by design” are more appropriate. If a ban was to happen, however, she feels it should be geared towards 12- and 13-year-olds. She believes a ban will make social media “more attractive”. “Strict parents create sneaky children ... If you bring in the ban you’ll really see that being played out. “I don’t think people realise how easy it is to work a VPN,” Sarah says, referring to a virtual private network. “Changing the country’s location is so phenomenally easy ... I’ve seen my friends do it when their parents are really strict on social media ... Most people my age, even if they’re allowed or not allowed social media by their parents, have accounts.” She says there needs to be more education and “digital media literacy”. Strict parents create sneaky children ... If you bring in the ban you’ll really see that being played out “If we bring in this ban we’re just going to presume kids aren’t on social media, because they shouldn’t be there, which then just creates a worse social media space ... Without having social media companies held accountable for keeping online safe for kids, it’s not going to be created safe for anyone else.” She points also to the opportunities social media creates for people who are part of minority groups to connect. “Most people have seen harmful videos on the internet. I think most of my friends and I saw the video of when Charlie Kirk was shot ... Obviously the trad wife trend, that has been very prevalent on social media recently. I understand that the Government is trying to help us and trying to protect us. And I do agree that something has to be done, and done soon ... banning it at 16 is just not the solution.” Zach Moore (14), from Greenhills, Dublin, uses WhatsApp, Snapchat and YouTube mostly. Social media is important to him. He too is part of the Webwise Youth Panel. That Andrew Tate fella. I remember getting a load of his videos at one point for a while, and then they just stopped “If I’m bored, I’d probably go on social media. If I needed to know something, I’d look it up. And I talk to my friends as well,” Zach says. If he comes across misogynistic, racist or other unacceptable content he says he ignores it or reports it. “That Andrew Tate fella. I remember getting a load of his videos at one point for a while, and then they just stopped. He seems like a bit of an extremist,” Zach says. He can see how this material can target boys. “I can definitely why they’d want to ban it, but to be honest I don’t think a complete ban would solve anything ... I think they would have been better to have mandatory parental controls. Leave it up to the parents.” Zach worries he spends too much time on social media sometimes. But he thinks if a ban was introduced in Ireland young people might spend more time trying to get around the ban rather than doing other things. He thinks some adults understand how important social media is to young people. “But some think that it’s all bad,” he says. “I don’t think that it’s all bad, but there definitely are certain areas that are malicious, or there’s no good intent.” [ Could Ireland follow Australia and ban under-16s from social media?Opens in new window ] He’d like to see “stricter moderation on platforms” and more education and support provided to teenagers on how to navigate problematic content that they might come across. He thinks the youth voice is important. “It’s definitely good to hear from people who are going to be directly affected, or people who are at risk of coming under the ban.” He expects adults and younger people may hold polar opposite views. Zach doesn’t think adults necessarily know best on this. “Especially with social media because it’s only really gained this much traction over the past 15 years.” Eve Cullen, from Tipperary, is 15. She uses TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat. I go online and I’m able to find thousands of other people who also enjoy that hobby and I can talk to them about it She feels “in theory it’s a good idea to stop letting kids use social media” but argues that a cut-off age of 16 is too high. “Eleven or 12 would be perfect.” At 15, she says, “a lot of our lives revolve around social media and it’s important to have”. She believes people will easily find a way around any ban. “I feel like a lot of the people who brought in this ban might not have kids themselves. Parents might know more about how kids are going to get around it.” Many young people find their “community” online, Eve says. She uses Snapchat to call and text people she already knows. “It’s great to meet new people on TikTok.” Eve says most young people have their wits about them when it comes to the danger of being contacted by strangers who may not be who they claim to be. “I don’t think it’s as big a problem as a lot of people make it out to be.” Eve has seen some upsetting content online. “I figure a way to go around it and ignore it. It’s not a huge thing online for me.” She insists she’s not hugely influenced by political, health or wellness content she sees online, saying she’s more likely to try out a recipe. She believes there are lots of positives to social media. “I love doing knitting and crochet and stuff like that. And there’s not many people in Thurles, where I live, that would be into that as well. I go online and I’m able to find thousands of other people who also enjoy that hobby and I can talk to them about it. But if social media was banned then I’d be very lonely in that hobby.” At school, Eve uses Instagram for her transition year (TY) mini-company. “Everyone in TY in our school [uses Instagram] to promote and advertise our products,” she explains. Her social media “used to be controlled when I was younger. There was an app on my phone that would block screen time,” Eve explains. But she feels at this age she is able to “self-police”. She worries that if teenagers weren’t granted access to social media until the age of 16, they wouldn’t know what things they “should look out for. They might get scammed, even, because they’ve never been exposed to it,” she says. Holly Heneghan (16) lives in Westmeath. She says she would hate a ban. “With Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok, the main three for me, it’s entertainment. Snapchat is for communicating with my friends ... I call and text on Snapchat.” She has seen things on social media that she doesn’t feel are appropriate for 12- and 13-year-olds to see, but feels things have improved. “There is still a lot of body positive stuff on social media now. [More] than there was when I was 12.” She has come across problematic material but “not necessarily in the apps that have been banned”. Inappropriate material can show up in advertisements that crop up in games, she explains. “There are times I’ve spent too much time on social media,” Holly admits, “but I go on social media because it shows me things I’m interested in. It gives me a break from the world because it shows sides that I like.” She doesn’t believe teens will accept the ban. “I think they’ll try and figure out a way to keep their social media.” Holly thinks a ban would make those under 16 more secretive about their social media use. She feels adults don’t necessarily understand the huge support social media can offer, including academically. “On TikTok there is a Stem site. It can teach you maths, science and engineering.” She believes the positives of social media outweigh the negatives. [Social media] gives me a break from the world because it shows sides that I like Hannah Goff (16) from Dublin, thinks a social media ban “is a really good idea” for younger people, but feels 14 or 15 may be a more appropriate cut-off age. “I don’t think people under 16 actually need phones to function.” She thinks younger teens could organise meet-ups through parents. “I think it might be easier as well for parents to understand where their child is and what their child might be doing.” She feels not having a phone could lead to under-16s meeting up with their friends in person more frequently. “However, I do think in Ireland there’s a lack of things to do for people under 16.” Hannah has learned a lot about content awareness in school. “If you know how to use social media, you’re better off with it, but I think people a lot of the time were just handing their kids phones ... and then they’re not really prepared for what they come across. [ A grand social media experiment begins in Australia. Will it work?Opens in new window ] “During the elections in the US I did see a lot of propaganda for Trump and Kamala. But I would just scroll past that. I don’t think I’ve seen anything that has been particularly disturbing or upsetting. But also I’ve been very careful to avoid that.” “You do see a lot of people online who are very different to how they normally look. They’re edited.” She feels younger people could be vulnerable to this. “I’ve seen a lot of eight- to 10-year-olds now who are using all the internet make-up”. Hannah believes the under-16s “will definitely” try to get around any ban “considering when the Yondr pouch was brought in. Everyone’s gotten around it at this point. “Teenagers, you tell them something to do and they will do the opposite. You give them a barrier and they’re going to go under it, over it, through it,” she says. Dr Colman Noctor, child and adolescent psychotherapist, says delaying access until a young person is mature enough “is the right thing to do”. But, he adds, “the how you do that is more complex”. He feels the Australian strategy, “while well intended, may not work”. “Imposing bans will always meet resistance and so some form of alliance with young people is far more likely to be successful. However, the difficulty is that young people think adults don’t have a clue about social media, and adults don’t think young people have a clue about real life. And both are probably true, but meeting a consensus will take time. “While I’m not sure the ban is the answer, waiting around for another 15 years to gain consensus is not a workable solution either,” Noctor says. “The damage of social media is happening now. “For me the only way this will be resolved is if the social media companies take the lead and invest in meaningfully protecting children, but that does not fit with their financial models so we have to do what we can in the meantime.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: John Collison’s bats to D6 topping the property charts: 2025 in quotes and numbers

“My remit was always to lend. During the difficult period, it was like shooting fish in a barrel because not everybody was lending at the time and there was a really great opportunity. There were still really good businesses that needed to borrow.” Avant Money chief executive Niall Corbett as he pressed ahead with plans to turn the nonbank lender into a full Irish bank branch of its Spanish parent Bankinter. “Fashion made statements then. Now, it is just dictated by a couple of brands mostly in Italy and France and we follow on their coat tails, so it is an uneven field – to get recognised you either have to be 18 or a millionaire. Being a boring middle-class father of seven is not the most exciting prospect, which I am happy with, but maybe pride drives me on.” The late Irish fashion designer Paul Costelloe, in an interview with The Irish Times in January, recalls Katherine Hamnett’s famous anti-nuclear T-shirt worn to 10 Downing Street to meet Margaret Thatcher. “We worked out that there could be between five and seven different agencies involved in a data centre. You get over one hurdle, you have to deal with another. You get over this hurdle, you have to go to the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency]. You go to EPA, you can’t get a gas connection. That makes it difficult when you have other advanced jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, which has a department of digital infrastructure, or the UK, who are going to treat data as critical infrastructure.” In February, Garry Connolly of industry lobby group Digital Infrastructure Ireland said negativity here around data centres has resulted in multinationals bypassing the State for investment. “When you’re young you’ve nothing to lose. Ignorance is a great thing.” Padraic Rhatigan, who opened the Radisson Red hotel on the outskirts of Galway as one part of a major residential and commercial development, reflected in February on taking over the family business while still in his teens. “Thanks, guys.” Tesla chief executive Elon Musk to shareholders after they voted to approve his $1 trillion (€856 billion) compensation plan in November, awarding the world’s richest person what would be the largest corporate payout in history if he meets the goals necessary to receive it. “Two hundred and twenty eight homes were blocked in Killarney because they would interrupt the commute of a roost of horseshoe bats. Who signed up for this?” In October, Stripe cofounder John Collison looked at how the State can get out of the government-by-agency corner into which it has painted itself. “Within 15 to 25 years, I think it will be mandated that there will be autonomous vehicles. People will not be allowed to drive anything. Public transport systems in the future will become much more efficient. Buses will know what and where the demand is and will organise themselves accordingly.” Also in October, businessman Dermot Desmond called on the Government to scrap the long-awaited MetroLink project and instead plan for wide-scale autonomously-driven bus services. “Looking back, juggling these jobs and being a single parent with teenage kids, I genuinely don’t know how I did it. But I wanted to do it – to be a role model to my girls. Equally, having left school with only a few O-levels, I wanted to add something else to my CV.” BMW Ireland boss Helen Westby in February on working her way through various roles in BMW, looking after her daughters, and completing an MBA. “It’s almost becoming a sort of a two-tier [health service] where you hear clinicians and oncologists certainly talking about it, that they can prescribe a certain medicine to these patients, but the other patients can’t have it.” In an interview with The Irish Times, Samantha Humphreys, who leads pharma group MSD’s Irish business, spoke on how private health insurers have taken to approving payment for certain drugs that have been approved by the European Medicines Agency but are still working their way through the Irish system. “They’re going to hire some pudding whose particular talent will be not upsetting Fingal County Council or the morons in the Department of Transport.” Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary last month expressed faux confidence in airport operator DAA’s recruitment processes after a rift emerged between the board of the State company and its chief executive Kenny Jacobs. At the time of O’Leary’s quote, the two sides had agreed a settlement that would have seen Jacobs leave the business. “I guess a potential Fed chair is here too. I don’t know. Are we allowed to say that? Potential? He’s a respected person – that I can tell you. Thank you, Kevin.” US president Donald Trump keeps nobody guessing as to who he intends to appoint chairman of the Federal Reserve early next year as he introduces top White House economic official Kevin Hassett at an event. “It would be wrong not to confront the fact that we absolutely need gas for this transition. The overseas investors on which our economy depends will move in two or three years without reassurance that energy supplies here are secure.” Bord Gáis Energy chief executive Dave Kirwan last month made the argument that gas remains vital to the State, arguing that it will play a central role in aiding us to end fossil-fuel dependence. “We all know it’s only going one way, the demographics are going to double for over-65s in the next 10 years, over-85s as well. So, there’s a huge demand presently not to think about the future.” [ Bord Gáis Energy’s Dave Kirwan on Irish energy prices and the case for nuclear powerOpens in new window ] In April, Shane Jennings, the former rugby player and now chief executive of Dovida, Ireland’s largest homecare group, gave his take on the State’s preparations for dealing with an ageing population. “He was a nice fellah. He would go to the local pub for a pint in the evening and play some pool with the lads. I got to play a game with him in Fitzgerald’s of Avoca. He was good.” In October, Tesco Ireland boss Geoff Byrne recounted losing a game of pool to actor Colin Farrell while he was shooting the Ballykissangel drama series in Co Wicklow. “I had lunch with 14 European CEOs [at Davos] and the pessimism, you could cut it with a knife. It was so palpable – and it just was so obvious to me that the pessimism was overdone. But the pessimism was loud enough that I think finally the Europeans were waking up and saying, ‘we got to change’.” In April, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said European leaders should lighten up about the outlook for the continent despite a decade and a half of low growth and a perception that business is being over-regulated. [ King of Wall Street says European leaders ‘starting to focus on a growth agenda, not a control agenda’Opens in new window ] “It was hugely special. It couldn’t get any more special than under the lights in Croke Park. It was the first round of the league against the Dubs. To beat them and get front page of many newspapers ... it couldn’t have started any better. It was downhill after that. We didn’t do a whole lot of winning.” Ciaran Marron of Monaghan-based Activ8 Solar Energies spoke in May about the rough and tumble of business after the Monaghan senior football team walked out on to the pitch at Croke Park to play All Ireland champions Dublin wearing jerseys emblazoned with the Activ8 logo. “It’s the most popular Bill ever signed in the history of the country. What we’ve done is put everything into one Bill. We’ve never had anything like that before.” US president Donald Trump in July speaking to the media as his “big, beautiful Bill”, a sweeping spending package, is signed into law during a picnic at the White House. “I was in the wrong place at the wrong time in the family. The older kids were at university and the younger ones were behind me in school. I spent years dealing with the bank trying to pay down debt and get rid of things.” In the summer, serial dealmaker Cathal Friel, the seventh of 10 children, spoke about having to leave school at 16 to run indebted businesses when his father became ill. It left him with a lifelong aversion to debt and property investment. “The importance and benefit of international co-operation has been a key theme of my public life. I will soon be taking up the role of managing director and chief knowledge officer of the World Bank Group, based in Washington DC. I am therefore departing from public life in Ireland.” Then minister for finance Paschal Donohoe resigned his Dáil seat and left ministerial office to take up a role at the World Bank. “They stopped pretending. The mask is off. You’re getting fired if you speak out. Back in the day, [tech employees] used to be even asking questions [of their employer] in the comments on company chat boards.” In June, William Fitzgerald, the Waterford-born founder of The Worker Agency, spoke about the slavishness of tech barons to the Trump administration despite Silicon Valley’s previous outwardly liberal gloss. “I grew up on checkouts from a young age and it’s in my DNA. I grew up in that environment and it teaches you so much about efficiencies, waste and getting value for the customer. I was on the checkout from nine or 10 years of age right up to leaving university.” In September, Robert Ryan, the chief executive of Lidl’s Irish business, explained how he got a taste from retail from an early age while working in the family shop. The median price paid for a home in Dublin 6 in the third quarter, making it the most expensive Eircode in the State, according to property firm Geowox. The district, which includes Rathmines, Ranelagh and Rathgar, recorded the highest median sales price in the State, up 23 per cent year-on-year. The State’s jobless rate in July, hitting that mark for the first time since January 2022, according to revised figures from the Central Statistics Office. The amount paid by Scandinavian property companies Pandox and Eiendomsspar as they agreed to buy Ireland’s largest hotel group Dalata. Dalata, which operates 56 hotels under the four-star Maldron and Clayton brands, mainly in Ireland and Britain, had rejected an initial bid from Pandox and Eiendomsspar in early June that had valued the hotel operator at €1.3 billion. The proposed severance deal for airport operator DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs that was taken off the table after Minister for Transport Darragh O’Brien blocked the payment, raising yet more questions about the months-long standoff at the top of the airports group. [ Severance deal of near €1m for DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs off the tableOpens in new window ] O’Brien in November refused to approve the €960,000 payment to Mr Jacobs, which was agreed in September after mediation between the chief executive and the DAA board in talks chaired by industrial relations troubleshooter Kieran Mulvey. The cap on any future tariffs on pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports imposed by the United States on the European Union. The deal struck by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen with Trump saw European countries head off the US president’s threats of cripplingly high import taxes on products sold across the Atlantic. The number of weeks a bitter High Court civil trial involving three shareholders of tech conference giant Web Summit had been scheduled to last before it was struck out. The case was resolved after talks between the parties concluded with founder Paddy Cosgrave saying he was “delighted” two of his former friends would leave the company. Majority shareholder Cosgrave was suing David Kelly, who owned 12 per cent of the business, for alleged breaches of his fiduciary duties as a director of the company. Mr Cosgrave was, in turn, being sued by Kelly and another shareholder, Daire Hickey, who holds 7 per cent of the shares in Web Summit, for both alleged shareholder oppression and alleged breaches of a profit-sharing agreement. The salary advertised by the Government for its new housing tsar who will be charged with managing the crisis and increasing supply. The role was plunged into controversy when the expected appointee, Brendan McDonagh, the chief executive of the National Asset Management Agency, withdrew from consideration. That came after it emerged Fine Gael had not been consulted on the plan to hire McDonagh, who was expected to keep his existing €430,000 salary. The “colossal” bill the State could soon be facing for missing EU-agreed climate targets, equivalent to a full year of corporate tax receipts or the annual health budget. A report by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and Climate Change Advisory Council provided one of the starkest warnings yet of the potential costs involved in failing to adapt to the climate reality. It found that the Republic – on a per capita basis – had the highest emissions target gap of EU member states, meaning it was the least likely to meet its 2030 target of reducing emissions by 51 per cent on the basis of its current trajectory. The drop in the State’s corporate tax receipts in May compared to a year earlier as the exchequer collected €2.5 billion, which was €1.1 billion less that May 2024. Downplaying the decline, the Department of Finance attributed it to “once-off factors” which, it said, boosted receipts last year and distorted the year-on-year comparison. No panic though as €10 billion in corporation tax was received in November, a record for a single month. The top percentile of richest households in the Republic holding almost half the wealth, according to Central Bank of Ireland data. The total net wealth of households here rose to a record €1.25 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, up €6.3 billion on the previous quarter. The figures showed that the wealthiest 10 per cent of households held €645 billion or 48.6 per cent of the total. This was five times the wealth held by the bottom 50 per cent of households, which stood at €117.8 billion or 8.9 per cent of the national total. [ One in 10 Irish households have net wealth of more than €1mOpens in new window ] The insurance industry’s final bill for Storm Éowyn, which struck Ireland in January, making it the most expensive insurance event in Irish history. The storm was one of the most damaging Ireland has ever faced, bringing gusts of 184km/h, breaking a record that had stood since 1945. Some 815,000 properties on the island lost power, with 768,000 of these in the Republic. Many were without power for weeks, while hundreds of energy technicians were drafted in from abroad to help ESB Networks with repairs. A breakdown of the final toll from the event released to The Irish Times shows a total of 33,768 claims were lodged. The estimated worth of a payment halted by State-owned energy company Bord na Móna for its chief executive after officials said continuing the “unsanctioned” earnings risked undermining public pay policy. The payment, which covered benefit-in-kind taxes on Tom Donnellan’s health insurance and company car, has been dropped from a new contract signed by the chief executive in April, the company confirmed. The value of PTSB after it put itself up for sale. The 57 per cent State-owned bank surprised the stock market by the move, which sent its market value up 23.4 per cent in Dublin. [ Paschal Donohoe must use PTSB sale to find owner with vision – not just a red penOpens in new window ] A deal would mark the return of all three domestic banks that survived the 2008 financial crisis to private ownership – and complete the recovery of the €29.4 billion in total that was injected into them. PTSB, by far the smallest of the three, has been dogged by low profit returns since the crash. This is largely due to its small scale – even after increasing its balance sheet by about 50 per cent between 2022 and 2023 after acquiring €6.8 billion of Ulster Bank loans. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ukrainian negotiations drag on, by Thierry Meyssan
URL: https://www.voltairenet.org/article223442.html
Time Published: 2025-12-28T05:54:33Z
Full Content:
Peace negotiations in Ukraine are hampered by the Zelensky administration’s resistance. The administration is attempting to buy time, first through legal means, then through military means, and finally through political means. However, the contacts made suggest what this peace will look like. This article follows: 1 - “Straussians take control of the United Nations and NATO,” October 7, 2025. 2 - “Anti-Russian propaganda and preparations for war against Russia,” October 28, 2025. 3 - “The moment of truth: The West faces Russian military advances,” November 4, 2025. 4 - “The fall of the Zelensky regime and its allies,” November 25, 2025. 5 - “What lies behind the peace negotiations for Ukraine?” December 2, 2025. Peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are dragging on. Clearly, the Russian side, confident of victory, intends to liberate what remains of the Donbas as soon as possible, while the Ukrainian side refuses to concede anything. The Europeans of the EU and the UK are holding numerous meetings, almost one a day, with the sole obsession of continuing the war, with or without the United States. Two new events have changed the situation: Washington is considering leaving NATO, and the Ukrainians are accepting the idea of selling their country. On December 1st, a secret videoconference was held with the participation of: the French (Emmanuel Macron) and Finnish (Alexander Stubb) presidents, the German Chancellor (Friedrich Merz), the Polish (Donald Tusk), Italian (Giorgia Meloni), Danish (Mette Frederiksen), and Norwegian (Jonas Gahr Støre) prime ministers, the NATO Secretary General (Mark Rutte), the President of the European Commission (Ursula von der Leyen), and the President of the European Council (António Costa). According to Der Spiegel, which obtained a copy of the meeting’s minutes, the NATO Secretary General stated that he agreed with the Finnish president and that Europeans should be wary of the peace talks in Ukraine being negotiated by President Donald Trump’s special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. [1] This is the first time a sitting NATO Secretary General has dared to openly criticize a sitting US President. The National Security Strategy, published on December 4 by the White House, mentions NATO five times. However, it is no longer a crucial alliance for the United States, given that President Trump has declared the end of the "American Empire." Washington is too preoccupied with its $33 trillion debt to dedicate itself to the defense of Western Europe. The document therefore merely notes that the member states of the Atlantic Alliance will have to ensure their own security by allocating 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP), a far cry from their current spending. It also notes that the alliance is not expected to expand further [2]. On December 9, five days later, a Republican representative, Thomas Massie (Kentucky), introduced a bill (HR 6508) aimed at withdrawing the United States from NATO. This bill was referred to the Foreign Affairs Committee on December 12 [3]. This is the first time this subject will be addressed in Congress. It is too early to draw any conclusions, but we must already acknowledge that there is a current within the Trump administration opposed to the Atlantic alliance, and that European states are aware that they will not be able to simultaneously ensure their own national defense and attack the Russian Federation. Privately, President Trump’s associates maintain that he will withdraw from the alliance by mid-2027; a deadline that could be brought forward. The leaders of the European Union are well aware of this. The President of the European Council, António Costa, declared on December 8th before the Jacques Delors Institute: “If we want to protect ourselves, not only against our adversaries, but also against allies who challenge us, we must strengthen Europe. We need to work together to build a Europe that understands that the relationships between allies and the alliances formed after the Second World War have changed.” Certainly, but EU members simply don’t have the resources of the United States. They cannot ensure their own defense alone. Moreover, if they wished to, they would have to organize themselves around one of the three nuclear powers in their region: France, the United Kingdom, or… Russia. A month ago, on November 11, Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, gave the signal for “Operation Midas.” The main allies of the unelected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, fell, one by one. It is inconceivable that he is not one of the main beneficiaries of the embezzlement of funds from Ukraine and the extortion of Ukrainian businesses. Yet no one dares to arrest him. Clearly, he is trying to cling to power to secure his gains or transfer them abroad. He first rallied Ukraine’s supporters, holding numerous meetings in Athens, Paris, London, Brussels, Rome, and Berlin, while his special representative and the secretary general of his Defense Council, Rustem Umerov, was already in hiding. Power in Ukraine is therefore now a shadowy affair: the unelected president could fall at any moment, and his chief negotiator can no longer return to his homeland. In an interview with Politico on December 9 [4], President Trump made the following statement: — Dasha Burns: Is it time for Ukraine to hold an election, do you think? — Donald Trump: Yes. I think so. It’s been a long time. It’s, uh... it hasn’t gone particularly well. Yes, I believe it’s time. I think it’s an important moment to hold elections. They’re using the war not to hold an election, but, uh, I think the Ukrainian people should... should have that choice. And maybe Zelenskyy would win. I don’t know who would win. But they haven’t had an election in a long time. You know, they talk about a democracy, but it’s getting to the point where it’s no longer a democracy. The unelected president immediately replied: "I am ready for elections. I am now asking, I am stating this openly, the United States to help me, possibly with European colleagues, to ensure security for holding elections." It is important to know that the Ukrainian Constitution prohibits elections during periods of martial law. Martial law was first imposed in 2018 by President Petro Poroshenko during the presidential election campaign [5]. Then, a second time, in 2022, by President Volodymyr Zelensky during the Russian special military operation. Martial law institutes nine measures: • Restrictions on the constitutional rights and freedoms of civilians; • Introduction of a "work obligation," applicable to everyone, whether employed or not, and which may include service in the military; • Seizure of state-owned property, or "forcibly disposing of" communal and private property "for the needs of the state"; • Introduction of a curfew; • Introduction of military checkpoints and restrictions on "the freedom of movement of citizens, foreigners, and stateless persons, as well as the movement of vehicles"; • Verification of individuals’ documents and inspection of their locations; • Prohibition of peaceful demonstrations, gatherings, and mass events; • Prohibition or restrictions on the media; • Prohibition or restrictions on the transfer of information on social media. In both cases, the aim was clearly to establish an authoritarian regime. While Poroshenko only implemented it for thirty days, Zelensky has renewed it every three months since February 2022. According to the sixteenth presidential decree on the matter that he promulgated, it is extended until next February. According to the Constitution, Volodymyr Zelensky’s term expired in May 2025. Since then, the Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Ruslan Stefanchuk, should have been serving as interim president. Not only did he not request this position, but he accompanied the outgoing president on his initial trips to assert his legitimacy. If elections were held today, the electoral lists would be falsified, as hundreds of thousands of soldiers killed in action are still listed. Under these circumstances, it would be child’s play for the regime to rig the ballot boxes. The Russian side has repeatedly emphasized that it cannot sign a peace agreement with an illegitimate figure. It recalls that President Poroshenko declared the Minsk agreements, signed by his special envoy and predecessor, Leonid Kuchma, null and void overnight because this high-ranking official had not been validated by him or by the Verkhovna Rada. The announcement by the now unelected Ukrainian president that he would agree to hold elections is therefore likely just a way to buy time and further postpone peace. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) estimated the value of Ukraine’s rare earth elements at between $10 trillion and $12 trillion during a June 9, 2024 interview on "Face the Nation" (CBS News). President Trump had mentioned the possibility of transferring them to the United States a few months earlier to repay what the war cost them. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent traveled to Kyiv on February 12 to discuss the matter with President Zelensky. So, on December 10, the unelected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, convened a videoconference with Scott Bessent, Jared Kushner (not as a negotiator in Moscow, but as head of the Affinity Partners fund), and Larry Fink (head of the BlackRock fund and already owner of a large portion of the farmland) [6]. The purpose was clearly to assess what could be purchased in exchange for the rare earths. What was unthinkable ten months ago had suddenly become possible. A second meeting was held the following day, December 11. Zelensky brought together the main US negotiators and invited the NATO Secretary General. The aim was to review security guarantees, given that NATO is no longer a permanent entity.

Title: Just 1–2% – Here’s how retirement funds can change crypto forever

Time Published: 2025-12-27T20:00:05Z

Even tiny allocations force exchanges and funds to adopt stronger practices. Retirement funds are built to be boring. That isn’t a flaw, it’s the point. They move as slowly as their beneficiaries, avoid surprises, and make the future feel manageable. On the other hand, crypto was built for the exact opposite. Because of this, it is often seen as too immature for pension money. This framing assumes that stability comes before participation. But, what if it works the other way around? Pension funds manage calendars, rather than money in the abstract. Salaries stop, pensions don’t. Assets that can drop in the double-digits as fast as you can say “crypto!” are difficult to square with that responsibility. Bitcoin, for all its growing legitimacy, still moves too much. In 2025 alone, it slid from near $120k to around $80k. This is a decline large enough to be called a “cycle” in crypto terms. However, this is a big problem in pension math. Crypto maxis know that this isn’t an outlier. Similar drops have been seen in the past too. Source: TradingView Price, though, is only part of the discomfort. Regulation remains uneven and often political, changing with court rulings and administrations. Custody has improved, but the industry hasn’t yet forgotten its own history. Exchange failures, frozen withdrawals, and creative accounting are still fresh in the mind, and even the rulebook is still being written. And then, there’s fiduciary duty. Pension managers are paid to avoid permanent loss, rather than explain it. By that measure, crypto still fails various tests. History has a way of taming assets that begin as inconvenient, volatile, and deeply unserious. This usually happens once large pools of patient capital decide it’s time to stop watching. Equities were the first. In the early 1900s, stock markets were thin, chaotic, and lightly regulated. Then, supervision changed everything. Pensions, insurers, and mutual funds arrived with scale, long time horizons, and a no-nonsense attitude. Disclosure standards followed. Audits became normal. The markets, eventually, behaved. When asked about the possibilities for crypto, Neil Staunton, CEO and co-founder of Superset told AMBCrypto, “Stablecoins, MMFs, RWAs, and the general tokenization of assets will bring institutional risk management into crypto markets.” However, he noted that it is not without its kinks. “The real risk is the absence of institutional standards. BlackRock was among the first to fully understand that risk.” Staunton noted that once BlackRock could change the risk profile, it had “the confidence to create an institutional product.” With this, the institution helped exchanges stop manipulation, making the asset reflect the true market. “Having mitigated those risks, they sold a product that became the fastest-growing ETF in history. Institutional best practices, once adopted, mature the market.” The CFA Institute has since put numbers to the pattern. Higher institutional ownership tends to bring better governance and greater stability over time. As it turns out, order in finance is… well, contagious. Property had its own makeover. Before institutional capital, real estate investing was local, illiquid, and occasionally opaque. Then came REITs (now a roughly $2 trillion global market) designed to translate bricks and rent into something we could actually live with. Municipal bonds followed a similar path as well. The capital arrived before the credibility. Crypto, for better or worse, may just be earlier in that same cycle. There is a particular kind of money that has no interest in being right quickly. Pension money arrives with time, and time has a way of changing rooms. Money that isn’t rushed makes markets quieter. Leverage looks less clever. What’s left is the work. The liquidity changes as well. Pension balance sheets aren’t dependent on cheap funding that vanishes under stress. They move slowly, if at all. With crypto, the instability will always remain but the extremes become less sharp. Even when pensions participate, they would do so carefully. Even a 1-2% crypto allocation would be diversified across assets, strategies, and risk buckets. That spreads exposure and reduces the maddening effects of the violent inflow-outflow cycles. And then, there are expectations. Audits. Custody. Risk frameworks. Habits carried over from more mature markets. Over time, those habits become standards, and the standards rearrange incentives. …and crypto is starting to see that now. Through infrastructure and scale. Source: downing.house.gov In the United States, this becomes clear if you look at ETFs and retirement frameworks. Since President Trump’s re-election, Washington has moved towards a more permissive stance on digital assets. This includes an executive order aimed at better access to crypto and other alternatives inside retirement plans. Source: SoSoValue The result has been a surge in regulated exposure. Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum ETFs have pulled in roughly $30 billion in net inflows YTD at the time of writing, led by products like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Source: SoSoValue Remember, none of these are fringe instruments. This matters because ETFs drag regulation with them. Court rulings, SEC approvals, custody rules, disclosure standards… none of these arrived because crypto asked nicely. Industry groups have been explicit too. Demand is strong, and the regulatory environment is adapting to meet it. Once pension systems, sovereign funds, and retirement plans engage (even cautiously), crypto becomes too systemically relevant to remain vague. For many pension systems, especially underfunded ones, instability is an existential concern. In the U.S, large public pension plans are 86.3% funded as of November 2025, per data from Milliman. This is a sign of sustained improvement; stronger balance sheets, but not unlimited risk tolerance. Source: Milliman Funds in that position simply do not have the luxury of absorbing big losses, no matter how compelling the long-term story is. Political risk hasn’t vanished either. Crypto regulations remain uneven across jurisdictions and borders, vulnerable to election cycles, court challenges, and sudden policy reversals. Even within the same country, there could be conflict. A more crypto-friendly posture at the higher level doesn’t automatically translate into support at the state or municipal level. Case in point – Key stakeholders continue to oppose New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani over his skepticism of crypto. His non-acceptance comes even with U.S policy growing more supportive after President Trump’s re-election. Then, there are the unresolved weaknesses. Fraud has not disappeared. Governance failures still surface. Custody infrastructure, while improving, is not foolproof. Even regulators acknowledge that oversight standards across exchanges and intermediaries remain inconsistent. So, no. This is not an argument that crypto is suddenly prudent. It is still risky. The difference is that it is no longer uniquely risky. Global pensions and retirement assets now run into the tens of trillions of dollars, spread across public funds, private plans, and sovereign systems. Against that backdrop, a 1-2% allocation to crypto is a rounding decision. And yet, even that small slice would matter, because that would change who the market is built for. Long-term retirement capital needs structure and rules that last. When it shows up, markets adjust. So, the real question is not whether pensions should take the leap with crypto. It is whether crypto ever truly grows up without them. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Rescue workers extinguish a fire in a high-rise residential building in the Dniprovskyi district damaged by a Russian drone strike on December 27, 2025 in Kyiv, Ukraine. The attacks came as Trump and Zelenskyy are expected to discuss critical questions in a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, including its territorial sovereignty, NATO protections, and control over its natural resources. As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made his way to Florida for a pivotal set of talks this weekend with US President Donald Trump, Russia launched a barrage of drone and missile attacks on Kyiv early Saturday morning. At least two people were killed in the Ukrainian capital during the 10-hour attack, with 44 more—including two children—injured. Hundreds of thousands of residents are left to brave near-freezing temperatures without heat following the attack, which cut off power supplies. The attack came as Zelenskyy prepared to stop in Canada before meeting with Trump on Sunday to discuss a 20-point plan to end the nearly four-year war with Russia that has been the subject of weeks of negotiation between US and Ukrainian emissaries. Zelenskyy is seeking to maintain Ukraine's territorial sovereignty without having to surrender territory—namely, the eastern Donbass region that is largely occupied by Russian forces. He also hopes that any agreement to end the war will come with a long-term security guarantee reminiscent of NATO. On Friday, Zelenskyy told reporters that the peace deal was 90% complete. But Trump retorted that Zelenskyy "doesn't have anything until I approve it." Trump has expressed hostility toward Zelenskyy throughout his presidency. In February, before berating him in a now-infamous Oval Office meeting, Trump insisted falsely that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for starting the war in 2022. Zelenskyy's latest peace proposal was issued in response to Trump's proposal last month, which was heavily weighted in Russia's favor. It called for Ukraine to recognize Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and cede the entirety of the Donbass, about 2,500 square miles of territory, to Russia, including territory not yet captured. Trump's plan puts a cap of 600,000 personnel on Ukraine's military and calls for Ukraine to add a measure in its constitution banning it from ever joining NATO. Earlier this year, Trump demanded that Ukraine give up $500 billion worth of its mineral wealth in what he said was "repayment" for US military support during the war (even though that support has only totalled about $175 billion). In his latest proposal, Trump has pared down his demands to the creation of a "Ukraine Development Fund" that would include the "extraction of minerals and natural resources" as part of a joint US-Ukraine reconstruction effort. While those terms appear less exploitative, the reconstruction program is expected to be financed by US loans from firms like BlackRock, which have been heavily involved in the diplomatic process. "The infrastructure rebuilt with these loans—ports, rail lines, power grid—won’t be Ukrainian in any meaningful sense. It’ll be owned by international consortiums, operated for profit, with revenues flowing out to service the debt," wrote the Irish geopolitical commentator Deaglan O'Mulrooney on Tuesday. "In other words, Ukraine will be gutted." Despite the criticism, Zelenskyy has signaled support in principle for the US reconstruction proposal as an alternative to direct expropriation. The "red lines" for Zelenskyy heading into his talk with Trump are related to Ukraine's territorial integrity. He has said he will not recognize Russian control of the Donbass, or the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe, which Russia currently controls. He has also demanded that all terms of a peace agreement come up for a referendum among the Ukrainian people, which is strongly against territorial concessions. At the same time, however, he insisted Saturday that "Ukraine is willing to do whatever it takes to stop this war." As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made his way to Florida for a pivotal set of talks this weekend with US President Donald Trump, Russia launched a barrage of drone and missile attacks on Kyiv early Saturday morning.

Title: Big Bet On Ethereum: CEO Sees 10X TVL Growth In 2026

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to Sharplink co-CEO Joseph Chalom, Ethereum could see a major jump in total value locked (TVL) next year if certain onchain trends pick up. Chalom put a bold number on it: 10X TVL in 2026. That claim ties together rising stablecoin use, bigger tokenization of real-world assets, and increased interest from big financial groups. Based on reports, the total stablecoin market stands at about $308 billion now and could grow to $500 billion by the end of next year, a rise of roughly 62%. Over half of all stablecoin activity — about 54% — happens on Ethereum. That math matters: more stablecoin flows on Ethereum tends to lift the protocol’s TVL because many of those dollars sit in smart contracts for swaps, lending, and liquidity pools. Sharplink Gaming holds 797,704 Ether, worth roughly $2.30 billion at the time of publication, a signal that some public treasuries are already staking big bets on the network. Chalom also expects tokenized real-world assets to expand rapidly, forecasting a $300 billion market for RWAs in 2026 and saying tokenized assets will 10X in AUM next year as funds, stocks, and bonds get wrapped onchain. In 2026, I believe Ethereum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) will increase 10X. Why and how? 🧵 Views ≠ investment advice. — Joseph Chalom (@joechalom) December 26, 2025 He points to rising interest from mainstream firms like JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock. Reports note that sovereign wealth funds may increase their Ethereum exposure by five- to tenfold, which could bring large, patient capital into tokenization projects and protocol deposits. Ethereum was trading near $2,921 on December 25, 2025, giving the network a market value of about $352 billion, while 24-hour trading volume came in at roughly $11.47 billion. Over the course of 2025, ETH moved through a full market swing. It opened the year around $3,298, climbed to about $4,390 in August, and stayed below its record high of $4,942, before sliding back to the $2,921 area by year-end. Price swings were heavy, with annual volatility close to 140%. Technical readings show mixed momentum. The weekly RSI sits at 41.7, placing Ethereum in a neutral-to-bearish zone, while the daily MACD histogram remains negative at -0.15. Price action has also been boxed into a narrow band between $2,774 and $3,038. Futures data adds to the cautious tone. Total open interest stands near $37 billion, down 0.62% over the past 24 hours, pointing to reduced exposure from traders. Liquidation data shows more than $100 million in potential long liquidations clustered between $2,880 and $2,910, an area now seen as a key pressure point. Not everyone agrees that token flows will translate into quick price gains. According to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, Ether is unlikely to hit new highs next year given current Bitcoin conditions. That caution lines up with technicals that point to range-bound trading and with the fact that open interest has eased slightly. The liquidation cluster near $2,880–$2,910 shows where leveraged positions could be forced out, and that kind of stress can push price moves faster than fundamentals.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Asset management giant BlackRock says one powerhouse sector of the market is going strong heading into 2026. In a new report, BlackRock says the next year will be defined by artificial intelligence (AI), which the firm says is growing at an unprecedented rate and will help push the US stock market to heights it has never seen before. “We’ve long argued we’re in a world of structural transformation shaped by a few mega forces, including geopolitical fragmentation, the future of finance and the energy transition. But the most obvious now is AI, with a buildout of a potentially unprecedented speed and scale. This shift to capital-intensive growth from capital-light is profoundly changing the investment environment and pushing limits on multiple fronts – physical, financial and socio-political. A few big macro drivers implies a few big market drivers. Today’s market concentration reflects underlying economic concentration. That means investors can’t avoid making big calls, in our view. AI is the dominant mega force right now, helping propel U.S. stocks to all-time highs this year… We stay overweight U.S. stocks and the AI theme, supported by robust earnings expectations. The capex (capital expenditure) may pay off overall even if not for individual companies. The next phase may be more about energy and resolving bottlenecks.” However, BlackRock notes that AI does face challenges, such as its extremely high rate of energy consumption. “AI data centers could use 15-20% of current U.S. electricity demand by 2030 – a scale sure to test the limits of power grid, fossil and materials industries… Some estimates even suggest data centers could use a quarter of current electricity demand. Rising power demand collides with a backlog of projects waiting to connect with the electric grid and generally slow permitting in the West. Capex plans could be walked back if such limits bite, crimping ambition around the AI buildout.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Farrell and McCracken: colossal impact of Irish football legends still felt today

Full Content:
Early on in The Emerald Evertonian, a new book about the life and times of Peter Farrell, comes a remarkable detail revealing something of the status of soccer in 1930s Ireland. The young Farrell had just joined Cabinteely United, then run by an enthusiast called Christy Devlin. “The team’s ‘pavilion’,” writes author Rob Sawyer, “was a huge tree . . .” The tree was behind one goalmouth and under its branches, the players changed and deposited any valuables a 13 year-old from south Dublin might possess. Farrell saw the difference when he played Gaelic football “on much better grounds than our soccer one at Cabinteely”. He added: “We also had a well-equipped pavilion with showers at our school sports ground at Dún Laoghaire.” But Farrell was inspired, not dismayed. Even though Devlin earned little as a gravedigger, he and his wife would feed “several” boys before matches. Farrell took it all in. Early on in The Offside King, a new book about the life and times of Bill McCracken, comes his verdict on arriving at Newcastle train station at 3am, having just been transferred from Distillery. He was be met by three Newcastle United directors in “old-fashioned frock coats... I c...uldn’t help saying to myself ‘Begarra – they look more like undertakers’.” McCracken was dismayed, not inspired. But he endured his first unhappy months at St James’ Park and went on to become “a true legend of the game“, in the words of author Paul Joannou. Irish football, gravediggers and undertakers, there’s a joke in there. Farrell, from Dublin, and McCracken, from Belfast, were serious men, though. They were rich with connections great and small and these two books help build out our knowledge of who and what Irish football was and how we are where we are. This is social history as well as the charting of two fascinating football lives. Peter Farrell, for example, married Mabel Carney, whose aunt Winnie was the Winifred Carney alongside James Connolly at the GPO in 1916. The scent of independence may also have been in Farrell’s nostrils when he played in the first Ireland (FAI) international after the second World War. It was June, 1946, in Lisbon against Portugal and Farrell was made captain, even though it was his debut. That must have been some moment. Afterwards, back in Dublin at a ceremony at the Gresham hotel, he was presented with this first cap. Rather than hold on to it, maybe frame it, Farrell instead gave it to his guest at the Gresham – Christy Devlin. The big tree at Cabinteely had not been forgotten. Untold numbers of Irish soccer volunteers – and those who benefited – will recognise this reciprocal commitment and affection. In the 1910 FA Cup final replay, held at Goodison Park, McCracken was part of a Newcastle United side winning the trophy for the first time. McCracken was the penalty-taker and at 1-0 up, Newcastle were awarded one. But McCracken knew centre forward Albert Shepherd had been the subject of bribery gossip before the semi-final and was not selected. Shepherd was reinstated for the final and scored the opening goal. As McCracken passed him for the penalty, he said to Shepherd: “Fancy it? Go on, take it.” McCracken’s motivation was “to get him re-established”. Shepherd scored and entered the history books as the first player ever to score a penalty in an FA Cup final. Really, it should be McCracken. Thirty-nine years later there was another penalty in a 2-0 win at Goodison. It was England v Ireland (FAI) and Con Martin scored the spot-kick. Farrell scored the second as Ireland became the first “foreign” nation to beat England on English soil. Farrell was an Everton player by then, winning the 10th of 28 caps. He had passed through Shamrock Rovers, under the supervision of Jimmy Dunne, and won a tennis tournament in Blackrock. A dual international, he made the last of his seven Ireland (IFA) appearances six months earlier. McCracken played for Ireland (IFA), but only 16 times due to a row over pay. The blazers in Belfast barred him from selection for 11 years. Bureaucrats and Irish football. This was when McCracken was at his peak, but in asking for equal pay with English and Scottish internationals, he was deemed a troublemaker. The IFA ban extended to Irish League clubs and given there was no Border then, McCracken was effectively banned from setting foot on an a pitch anywhere in Ireland. Simultaneously, he was becoming the most talked-about footballer in England. Working in a Tyneside munitions factory during the first World War, McCracken was known for his prominent role in fundraising friendlies. It was a bit different from his reputation as a defender – ‘The Most Hated Man in Football’ was one headline. That attitude stemmed from his offside capabilities. McCracken was so efficient at offside that ‘McCrackenism’ became a term. In 1925, Law 6 of the game was changed from having three players between an attacker and goal to be onside, to two. The man from Nansen Street off the Falls Road changed the geometry of football forever. McCracken played 432 times for Newcastle United – Shay Given is one of only four players to have more appearances. Farrell played 452 times for Everton – only four men have made more league appearances for the club. Both went into management after playing, McCracken with Hull City, Gateshead, Millwall and Aldershot, Farrell with Tranmere Rovers, where his great friend and Evertonian Tommy Eglington played. Success, and failure, for both men is seen in context – neither were managing clubs with big budgets. McCracken returned to the Irish League as a Newcastle scout to sign George Eastham from Ards, then as a Watford scout to sign Pat Jennings from Newry Town. Farrell went briefly to the League of Ireland, playing three games for Sligo Rovers. It means he, Dixie Dean and Séamus Coleman, who writes the book’s foreword, are three men to have played for Everton and Sligo. Farrell went back to Britain – to Holyhead Town in Wales – then returned to Ireland for good. He managed Drogheda United briefly, then St Pat’s and TEK United. There he came to know another Devlin – Pat. Like all who came into contact with Farrell, Pat Devlin says he felt honoured to know the man. Lest anyone think this esteem is exaggerated, walk down Farrell Close in Kirkby in Liverpool, the street named after him. McCracken has less formal recognition, although his central role in changing a key law of the game will be reasserted by The Offside King, just as The Emerald Evertonian illustrates the significance of Peter Farrell. Two compelling men. Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Groq continues innovation after raisingÂ $750M (September 2025) at a $9B valuation. Nvidia solidifies dominance amid competition fromÂ Cerebras SystemsÂ andÂ Google TPUs. In a move that further solidifies its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, Nvidia has secured a non-exclusive licensing agreement with AI chip startup Groq, bringing aboard its founder, CEO Jonathan Ross, and key executives to bolster its inference technology capabilities. The deal, announced by Groq on Wednesday, Dec. 24, allows Nvidia to license Groq's proprietary AI inference technology while hiring Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other senior engineers. Groq will continue operating independently under new CEO Simon Edwards, with its cloud platform, GroqCloud, remaining unaffected. Groq, founded in 2016 by former Google engineers, specializes in AI inferenceâthe process of running trained AI models to generate predictions or responses, such as those seen in ChatGPT or image recognition systems. The company developed its customÂ Language Processing Unit (LPU), designed for high-speed, low-cost AI inference. "AI inference, in the context of artificial intelligence, refers to the process by which AI models draw conclusions or make predictions based on input data. This process is a fundamental aspect of AI, enabling machines to learn, reason and make decisions," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. AI inference can be categorized into two primary types: inductive and deductive inference. A third one, probabilistic inference, involves making decisions or drawing conclusions based on probabilities and statistical models. This type of inference is commonly used in Bayesian AI networks and Deep Learning models. Nvidia, already the leader in AI training chips, is now doubling down on inferenceâa critical next phase as AI shifts from development to real-world deployment. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, emphasized the strategic importance of the deal in an internal email obtained by CNBC: "We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A new trend: Talent-focused deals The agreement follows a growing Silicon Valley trend where tech giants acquire key talent rather than entire companiesâa strategy that avoids regulatory hurdles while securing top-tier expertise. Recent examples include: Microsoft'sÂ deal withÂ Inflection AI, bringing co-founder Mustafa Suleyman onboard. Google'sÂ $2.5 billion licensing agreement withÂ Character.AI, hiring only select employees. Meta'sÂ $14 billion investment inÂ Scale AI, absorbing its CEO to lead AI initiatives. Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive (a major Groq investor), confirmed to CNBC that Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assetsânot the entire companyâfor an estimatedÂ $20 billion, marking Nvidia's largest deal ever. Geopolitical implications: U.S. AI leadership The deal aligns with President Donald Trump'sÂ July executive orderÂ promoting the export of U.S. AI technology to maintain global dominance. Groq has been a key player in this initiative, powering AI infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies and overÂ 2 million developers worldwide. "Inference is defining this era of AI, and we're building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost," Ross stated in September. While Nvidia strengthens its AI ecosystem, Groq will continue innovating under new leadership. The startup had previously raisedÂ $750 million in September at a $6.9 billion valuation, with investors includingÂ BlackRock, Samsung and Donald Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital. As AI transitions from lab development to global deployment, Nvidia's latest move ensures it remains at the forefrontâboth in trainingÂ andÂ inference. With competitors likeÂ Cerebras SystemsÂ andÂ Google's TPUsÂ vying for market share, the AI chip wars are far from over. For now, Nvidia's strategic talent grab reinforces its position as the undisputed leader in the AI revolution.

A new trend: Talent-focused deals The agreement follows a growing Silicon Valley trend where tech giants acquire key talent rather than entire companiesâa strategy that avoids regulatory hurdles while securing top-tier expertise. Recent examples include: Microsoft'sÂ deal withÂ Inflection AI, bringing co-founder Mustafa Suleyman onboard. Google'sÂ $2.5 billion licensing agreement withÂ Character.AI, hiring only select employees. Meta'sÂ $14 billion investment inÂ Scale AI, absorbing its CEO to lead AI initiatives. Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive (a major Groq investor), confirmed to CNBC that Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assetsânot the entire companyâfor an estimatedÂ $20 billion, marking Nvidia's largest deal ever. Geopolitical implications: U.S. AI leadership The deal aligns with President Donald Trump'sÂ July executive orderÂ promoting the export of U.S. AI technology to maintain global dominance.

Title: Ethereum's TVL could skyrocket '10X' in 2026: Sharplink CEO

Time Published: 2025-12-26T23:46:28Z

A surge in stablecoins, tokenized RWAs and growing sovereign wealth fund interest could drive a major increase in Ethereum’s TVL in 2026, Sharplink’s co-CEO said. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) may surge ten-fold in 2026 as adoption expands across multiple use cases and institutional investors, according to Sharplink’s co-CEO Joseph Chalom. Sharplink Gaming is the second-largest public Ethereum treasury company, holding 797,704 ETH (ETH), worth roughly $2.33 billion at the time of publication, according to Ethereum Treasuries data. “The stablecoin market will hit $500B by the end of next year,” Chalom predicted in an X post on Friday, as the total stablecoin market capitalization currently sits at around $308.46 billion. A move to $500 billion would represent an increase of about 62%. With over half of the total stablecoin activity (54%) taking place on Ethereum, such a rise could potentially contribute to an increase in the network’s TVL. Chalom also expects tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) to see significant growth, forecasting the market will reach $300 billion in 2026. “Tokenized assets will 10X in AUM in 2026, going from tokenizing individual funds, stocks, and bonds to full fund complexes,” Chalom said. He pointed to rising interest over the past year from financial services companies including JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock as a major catalyst. An increasing TVL is often seen as a sign of growing interest in the network, which can bolster market sentiment and potentially influence the price of the asset. At the time of publication, Ethereum’s TVL is around $68.20 billion, according to DeFiLlama. However, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen said on Tuesday that Ether is unlikely to hit new highs in the coming year, given current conditions for Bitcoin. At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $2,924, down 3.12% over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap. Chalom anticipates Ethereum holdings and tokenization activity by sovereign wealth funds to grow five- to tenfold over the next year.

When no one was willing to touch crypto from this pool of allocators, it was safe to stay sidelined,” Chalom said. Chalom also predicted that onchain AI agents and prediction markets will “go mainstream,” which he said will drive more activity and value to the ecosystem.

Title: Etheruem’s tokenization role takes focus as Tom Lee outlines bullish outlook

Fundstrat’s head of research said institutional tokenization supports a $7,000–$9,000 Ether price in early 2026 and a longer-term case for $20,000. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ethereum’s growing role in institutional finance took center stage on CNBC’s Power Lunch this week, when Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said Ether could climb to $7,000–$9,000 by early 2026 as Wall Street accelerates efforts to tokenize assets and move financial activity onchain. Lee said Ether’s (ETH) investment case is increasingly tied to its use as financial infrastructure, as Wall Street experiments with onchain settlement and tokenized securities. “Wall Street wants to tokenize everything,” Lee said, pointing to initiatives at Robinhood and BlackRock. The shift, he said, could bring efficiencies to traditional finance while anchoring real-world use cases on Ether. He added that Ether could eventually reach $20,000 as adoption deepens. He was also bullish on Bitcoin (BTC), calling it a “genuine store of value” and saying a move to $200,000 next year “makes a lot of sense,” framing its recent underperformance versus gold as temporary. Lee is also chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies, the leading Ether-focused treasury company that has reported holdings of 4,066,062 ETH, according to CoinGecko data.

According to data from RWA.xyz, US Treasury debt is the largest tokenized asset class at around $8.5 billion, followed by commodities at about $3.4 billion. Ethereum currently accounts for the majority of tokenized RWA value across public blockchains. As of late December 2025, the network hosts more than $12 billion in tokenized assets, well ahead of alternatives such as BNB Chain, Solana and Arbitrum. Ethereum also leads stablecoin issuance, with roughly $170 billion in stablecoins issued on the network, reinforcing its role as the primary settlement layer for dollar-denominated activity onchain. Institutional interest in tokenized RWAs continued to build in December, when the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) said it plans to tokenize a portion of US Treasury securities held at its Depository Trust Company subsidiary on the Canton Network. DTCC operates post-trade infrastructure for US securities markets, with its subsidiaries processing about $3.7 quadrillion in securities transactions last year.

The recent surge in Bitcoin (BTC) volatility has led to significant liquidations, prompting renewed suspicions of market manipulation among experts. A detailed analysis by market expert NoLimit on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) reveals that, at the time of the stock market opening, BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) IBIT transferred hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin into Coinbase Prime wallets. This timing and location indicate a pattern that institutions often follow when selling their assets. As explained, these coins are not sent to Coinbase Prime merely to remain inactive; they are typically directed there for sale or liquidity management purposes. NoLimit asserts that when a major player like BlackRock needs to liquidate assets or meet redemption demands, the price of Bitcoin reacts rapidly. He suggests that this situation reflects a combination of factors: selling related to ETFs taking place during low liquidity, inventory management in anticipation of upcoming volatility, and risk reduction in light of a significant derivatives event. Compounding these concerns, technical analyst OxNobler highlighted further developments that contributed to the recent downturn, detailing significant sell-offs by various trading platforms. In a rapid succession of transactions, Binance reportedly sold 10,155 BTC, Wintermute let go of 5,354 BTC, Coinbase disposed of 10,113 BTC, BlackRock sold 4,945 BTC, and Kraken moved 4,630 BTC. Collectively, these actions amounted to over $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin sold within a mere 30 minutes, raising suspicions of coordinated market manipulation. According to analysts from Bull Theory, the situation has taken a dire turn, with Bitcoin plummeting by $2,300 and liquidating $66 million in long positions in just 45 minutes. Against this backdrop, $60 billion has been wiped from the crypto market without any negative news triggering such a drastic shift. This scenario has led them to assert that manipulation continues to be a significant concern within the broader crypto market. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $87,340, down slightly more than 30% from its all-time highs set earlier in October.

Instead, most of the biggest headlines attached to the financial services organization were irrelevant to trading screens, most notably the conclusion to its years-long battle with the SEC, major acquisitions to propel its future growth, and the launch of a billion-dollar stablecoin product—RLUSD. Below we’ll look back at the biggest highlights for XRP and Ripple in 2025. More than four years after it began, the legal dispute between Ripple Labs Inc. and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially came to a close in August. The landmark case, which investigated whether or not sales of XRP violated securities laws, extended back to December 2020. In 2023, a partial ruling favored Ripple Labs, but appeals and counter-appeals extended the saga into 2025. However, with the election of President Donald Trump and a crypto-friendlier regulatory administration, the pair opted to find a jointly negotiated resolution in early 2025. That negotiated resolution was later denied by a U.S. district judge, and then by the courts, so eventually the pair agreed to drop their respective appeals—ending the affair for good and cementing the 2023 ruling in Ripple’s favor as a precedent for future crypto classifications. Prior to 2025, XRP had last traded above $3.00 in 2018. Seven years later, and around a month before the conclusion to Ripple Labs’ yearslong legal battle with the SEC, the Ripple-linked XRP made a new all-time high of $3.65, according to data from CoinGecko, surging beyond its previous high mark of $3.40 from 2018. That made XRP the third-largest crypto asset by market capitalization at the time, trailing just Bitcoin and Ethereum. With regulatory scrutiny waning, analysts at the time told Decrypt that investors “believed in Ripple's vision for a regulatory-compliant blockchain for institutions.” Though its rapid rise placed the token in a range it had not seen since 2018, investment firms like Standard Chartered maintained even higher end-of-year price targets for XRP during the summer—expecting a move to $5.50 by the end of year. That mark seems unlikely now though, despite the acceleration of the tokenization trend that Standard Chartered highlighted as a potential catalyst for the price of XRP. XRP, now the fourth-largest asset by market capitalization, was changing hands at $1.90 as of December 15, around 48% off its July all-time high. After the approval and ensuing success of ETFs for crypto majors Bitcoin and Ethereum, both investors and fund issuers were eager to get altcoin ETFs—like those for XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin—to market. As a result, applications for altcoin ETFs flooded the SEC, and by June, expert opinions predicted the likelihood of their approvals as a “near lock” for 2025. Those opinions were further validated in September when the SEC cleared a path to approval for new ETFs by signing off on new generic listing standards. Around that time, Rex Shares and Osprey Funds got their joint XRP ETF to market—an Act 40 ETF that follows different listing standards than other crypto ETFs. Demand for the product was shown immediately, grabbing $38 million in day one volume, good enough to mark the year’s biggest debut up until that point. Shortly thereafter, though, more traditional spot ETF products from Canary Capital, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton hit the market. In December, leveraged products hit the market as well, allowing investors to double their exposure to XRP’s gains. Since their launch, the spot ETFs have generated nearly $1 billion in net inflows without a single day of outflows, according to data from CoinGlass, as of December 15. XRP eclipsed a major milestone in 2025, but so did Ripple Labs’ stablecoin, RLUSD. First launched in December 2024, the dollar-backed stablecoin frontran the growing trend of stablecoin products from other financial giants like Western Union and JP Morgan, and the passing of the GENIUS Act, which provided regulatory clarity on the issuance and trading of the fiat-backed tokens. In the year since its launch, functionality for RLUSD has expanded. In September it was added to Securitize’s tokenization platform, a BlackRock-backed platform that now allows users to exchange shares of tokenized money market funds for RLUSD. In December the firm earned approval to broaden payment services, including RLUSD, in Singapore as well. It's being used for credit card settlements too, thanks to a partnership with Mastercard and WebBank, the issuer of crypto exchange Gemini’s credit card products. While RLUSD is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, Ripple applied for a National Bank Charter in July, following the lead of USDC issuer Circle, as it aims to become the “benchmark for trust” in the stablecoin market. And it received conditional approval in December, alongside other stablecoin issuers. At the time of writing, the stablecoin has reached a $1.3 billion market cap, making it the 11th largest stablecoin in less than a year since its launch, according to data from DefiLlama. Though closely linked to XRP, Ripple is much larger and more expansive than a single crypto token, and its footprint grew considerably throughout 2025 thanks to major acquisitions. In April, the firm forked over $1.25 billion to acquire primer brokerage Hidden Road as it aimed to better serve institutional clients on a larger scale. It then spent another $1 billion to acquire treasury asset management firm GTreasury in October, in a play that will reduce friction and costs associated with legacy financial systems, according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse. It surrounded that acquisition with two others, paying $200 million to add Toronto-based stablecoin platform Rail, and an undisclosed amount on wallet-as-a-service provider Palisade. All told, Ripple's acquisitions in 2025 maintain a similar theme, improving payment efficiencies while expanding its financial services offerings. Those moves helped the firm notch a $500 million investment in November, valuing it at $40 billion and cementing its place among the current and future leaders of the crypto industry. "This investment isn’t just validation of Ripple’s growth strategy and business built on the foundation of XRP, but also a clear bet on what the future of crypto will look like," Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse wrote on X. "I’m very proud of what we’ve built, and all that’s to come."

Nvidia gains key talent from Google's TPU project to bolster its own chip development. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. In a move that reshapes the battlefield of artificial intelligence hardware, chip giant Nvidia has strategically deployed a massive $20 billion to secure the technology and brains behind a key startup, Groq. This deal, structured as a licensing agreement and talent acquisition, represents Nvidia's largest such transaction ever and is a direct response to rising competition, particularly from Google's custom tensor processing units (TPUs). For those watching the high-stakes race for AI inference supremacy, this is a clear signal that the arms race is accelerating, with Nvidia pulling out its checkbook to maintain its edge. The agreement, announced just before the Christmas holiday, sees Nvidia licensing Groq's AI inference technology and hiring away its founder and CEO, Jonathan Ross, along with President Sunny Madra and other senior leaders. Ross is a pivotal figure, having previously helped launch Google's TPU project. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outlined the rationale in an internal email, stating, "We plan to integrate Groqâs low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A deal structured for scrutiny While publicly framed as a "non-exclusive licensing agreement," multiple reports confirm the total value approaches $20 billion in cash for Groq's assets. This complex structure is widely seen as a tactic to navigate intense antitrust scrutiny. Groq will continue to operate independently, at least in name, with its finance chief Simon Edwards becoming the new CEO. Its cloud service, GroqCloud, will also continue operating. As Huang noted, "While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groqâs IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company." This "acqui-hire plus licensing" model has become a common playbook for Big Tech. Similar deals have been executed by Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia itself earlier this year. The approach allows giants to rapidly absorb innovative technology and top-tier talent without triggering the same level of regulatory review as a traditional acquisition. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon observed, "Antitrust would seem to be be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive." The Google factor and inference wars The strategic impetus for this massive expenditure is clear. Nvidia, while dominant in chips for training AI models, faces a growing challenge in the inference market, where trained models deliver answers to user queries. Google's custom TPUs have gained significant momentum here, offering an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Groq's specialty is its "language processing unit" chips, designed specifically for fast, efficient inference. By bringing Groq's technology and TPU-savvy leadership in-house, Nvidia is buying a shortcut to compete more directly with Google's in-house advances. This is a defensive and offensive move, ensuring its hardware remains the go-to choice as the AI industry's focus increasingly shifts from training models to deploying them at scale. The deal came together rapidly, reportedly just months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation in September. It is crucial to distinguish Groq from "Grok," the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's xAI. The similar names are a coincidence, but this deal is purely about the underlying silicon that powers such AI applications. For investors who backed Groq's recent funding round, including firms like BlackRock and a fund where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner, the payoff is staggering: a tripling of their investment in roughly three months. This highlights the immense financial firepower Nvidia has accumulated, with more than $60 billion in cash on hand, and its willingness to spend it to consolidate power. The conclusion is unmistakable. In the relentless march of AI progress, control over the foundational hardware is paramount. Nvidia's historic $20 billion deal is not just a purchase of technology; it is an investment in maintaining sovereignty over the future of computation itself. As custom chips from tech giants and well-funded startups emerge, this move proves that even the market leader cannot afford to simply innovate; it must also strategically assimilate.

Nvidia's historic $20 billion deal is not just a purchase of technology; it is an investment in maintaining sovereignty over the future of computation itself. As custom chips from tech giants and well-funded startups emerge, this move proves that even the market leader cannot afford to simply innovate; it must also strategically assimilate. Sources for this article include: ZeroHedge.com WSJ.com Reuters.com CNBC.com The agreement, announced just before the Christmas holiday, sees Nvidia licensing Groq's AI inference technology and hiring away its founder and CEO, Jonathan Ross, along with President Sunny Madra and other senior leaders. Ross is a pivotal figure, having previously helped launch Google's TPU project. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outlined the rationale in an internal email, stating, "We plan to integrate Groqâs low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A deal structured for scrutiny While publicly framed as a "non-exclusive licensing agreement," multiple reports confirm the total value approaches $20 billion in cash for Groq's assets. This complex structure is widely seen as a tactic to navigate intense antitrust scrutiny. Groq will continue to operate independently, at least in name, with its finance chief Simon Edwards becoming the new CEO. Its cloud service, GroqCloud, will also continue operating. As Huang noted, "While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groqâs IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company." This "acqui-hire plus licensing" model has become a common playbook for Big Tech. Similar deals have been executed by Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia itself earlier this year. The approach allows giants to rapidly absorb innovative technology and top-tier talent without triggering the same level of regulatory review as a traditional acquisition. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon observed, "Antitrust would seem to be be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive." The Google factor and inference wars The strategic impetus for this massive expenditure is clear. Nvidia, while dominant in chips for training AI models, faces a growing challenge in the inference market, where trained models deliver answers to user queries. Google's custom TPUs have gained significant momentum here, offering an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Groq's specialty is its "language processing unit" chips, designed specifically for fast, efficient inference. By bringing Groq's technology and TPU-savvy leadership in-house, Nvidia is buying a shortcut to compete more directly with Google's in-house advances. This is a defensive and offensive move, ensuring its hardware remains the go-to choice as the AI industry's focus increasingly shifts from training models to deploying them at scale. The deal came together rapidly, reportedly just months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation in September. It is crucial to distinguish Groq from "Grok," the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's xAI. The similar names are a coincidence, but this deal is purely about the underlying silicon that powers such AI applications. For investors who backed Groq's recent funding round, including firms like BlackRock and a fund where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner, the payoff is staggering: a tripling of their investment in roughly three months.

Title: Bitcoin whales move $230mln to exchanges, yet BTC holds range – Why?

Big wallets moved Bitcoin to exchanges, but price hesitation left traders questioning the next move. Bitcoin’s muted price action, paired with renewed whale activity, unsettled market sentiment on the 25th of December. On that day, a long-dormant Bitcoin whale and asset manager BlackRock transferred large BTC amounts to exchanges, according to Onchain Lens. Onchain Lens reported that BlackRock deposited 2,292 Bitcoin [BTC], worth $199.8 million, into Coinbase. Separately, a whale wallet dormant for eight years deposited 400 BTC, valued at $34.92 million, into OKX. Large holders often shape short-term sentiment, as traders monitor such transfers for potential sell-side pressure. That dynamic left market participants cautious, even without immediate confirmation of spot selling. On top of that, U.S. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds extended their losing streak. SoSoValue data showed Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded five consecutive days of net outflows. Source: SoSoValue That pattern suggested institutional demand remained fragile despite Bitcoin holding above key technical support. Together, ETF outflows and exchange deposits reinforced a defensive market tone. At press time, Bitcoin traded near $87,700, down roughly 0.35% on the day. During the same period, Open Interest fell 0.99% to $57.42 billion, reflecting reduced leverage exposure. That decline signaled traders unwound risk rather than positioning aggressively for a breakout. Even so, intraday positioning hinted at localized bullish conviction. Source: CoinGlass According to CoinGlass’ Liquidation Map, major leverage clusters sat near $85,966 below price and $88,636 above. At these levels, intraday traders have built $646.17 million worth of long-leveraged positions and $422.42 million worth of short-leveraged positions. This suggests that traders were tilted toward the bullish side and strongly believe that BTC’s price will not fall below the $85,966 level. AMBCrypto’s technical analysis on the weekly chart revealed that BTC has been in a tight consolidation zone between the $86,000 and $93,500 levels since the 17th of November. Historically, consolidation breakouts or breakdowns lead to major rallies or declines, and as BTC’s price approaches the lower boundary, it has sparked fear of a potential breakdown below this range. Source: TradingView Based on the price action, if sentiment remains unchanged and BTC breaks below the key support at $86,000 with a daily candle close beneath it, it could open the door to a massive downside move. However, the bearish outlook would only be invalidated if BTC breaks out above the upper boundary at the $93,500 level.

Since the start of January, the overall U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin supply has increased by more than $100 billion, to $314 billion total. But that doesn’t mean all boats have risen at the same rate. To measure stablecoin performance, Decrypt calculated velocity using historical data from crypto price aggregator CoinGecko from January through December 15. Velocity divides total volume by average supply, resulting in a calculation of how many times each coin has, on average, changed hands. As former Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Chairman Timothy Massad explained to Decrypt, measuring velocity beats rankings that rely only on total supply. “Stablecoins can be very useful without there being a large market cap,” he said. “In other words, it's really the velocity, the transaction use, and they can circulate very quickly even if the amount outstanding is not that great.” Tether tops the list with a velocity of 166 because it’s long been a workhorse for global crypto trading. It can’t claim the crown as the first-ever stablecoin—that belongs to BitUSD. But it launched the same year, in 2014, and became the first widely used one. Tether boasts a market capitalization of $186 billion after increasing 35% since the start of the year, according to CoinGecko data. The bulk of Tether tokens get traded on Ethereum (46.3%) and Tron (41.4%), according to DeFi Llama data. Tether began the year by relocating to Bitcoin-friendly El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele declared BTC legal tender in 2021. There have been a few bumps, though. In March, Binance said it would delist USDT for European Union users to stay compliant with MiCA regulations, which require stablecoin issuers to be licensed. But that’s not stopped the company from turning a hefty profit. So far in 2025, Tether has seen $10 billion in profit in the first three quarters of the year, the company said in October. Ripple Labs’ stablecoin, RLUSD, swiped the second spot with a velocity of 71. That means, on average, every RLUSD token has changed hands 71 times since the start of the year. In most stablecoin lineups, Circle’s USDC would hold this spot because its $78 billion market capitalization trumps that of RLUSD’s $1.3 billion. But as Massad pointed out, stablecoin performance has more to do with being able to move money efficiently than its total supply. Ripple was provisionally approved for a national banking charter by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, in December. “This is a massive step forward—first for RLUSD— setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal (OCC) & state (NYDFS) oversight,” Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse wrote on X. HUGE news! @Ripple just received conditional approval from the @USOCC to charter Ripple National Trust Bank. This is a massive step forward - first for $RLUSD, setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal (OCC) & state (NYDFS) oversight. To the… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 12, 2025 Ripple Senior Vice President of Stablecoins Jack McDonald has often pointed out that RLUSD was specifically designed for institutional use. At the start of December, Ripple got the green light from the Singapore Monetary Authority, or MAS, to expand XRP and RLUSD payments in Singapore. And earlier this year, RLUSD was integrated into Securitize's tokenization platform. That means it’s one of the assets investors can swap for tokenized money market funds. USDC saw its velocity reach 56 in 2025, while its market capitalization climbed 78% to $78.4 billion by December 15. Perhaps more than any of its competitors, Circle benefitted massively from the passage of the GENIUS Act. Its operating model already resembled the federally regulated framework that’s now become U.S. law. That’s given Circle a head start on compliance and investor confidence—and investors took note. CRCL was so popular with investors on its debut that the NYSE halted trading three times. Since then, Circle has reported $740 million in Q3 revenue, marking a 66% year-over-year increase. Circle has also rolled out the testnet for Arc, its layer-1 blockchain, which counts BlackRock, Visa, and Amazon Web Services as early participants. Circle was also one of several stablecoin issuers—including Ripple, Paxos and BitGo—which got a provisional approval for its national banking charter and will be looking to expand into broader financial services. USD1 is an outlier because it launched in April, and therefore doesn’t have nearly a full year’s worth of data. But that didn’t stop it from landing right next to the podium with a velocity of 39. Issued by World Liberty Financial—the crypto-focused firm co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. and partners—USD1 was designed from the outset to be a highly liquid transactional stablecoin. The token reached a $1 billion market cap in April, less than a month after its launch, according to data from CoinGecko. There have been some very bullish predictions about its growth. Blockstreet’s Kyle Klemmer told Decrypt he believes USD1 will be the world’s dominant stablecoin, beating USDT and USDC, before President Donald Trump’s second term ends in 2029. The project has leaned heavily on retail distribution and promotional partnerships, including integrations with several U.S.-based crypto exchanges, like Coinbase and FalconX, and it’s making a bid to become “Solana’s go-to stablecoin” by teaming up with meme coin platform Bonk and decentralized exchange Raydium. PayPal USD’s velocity of 18 lands it in fifth place on this list. Its 2023 debut made big waves because it was the first time an established payments platform made a bid at issuing a stablecoin—years before there was a regulatory framework in the U.S.. For most of this year, growth for PYUSD moved at a modest pace. Its market capitalization peaked above $1 billion in June and then established a foothold in September. Since then, it’s nearly tripled to $3.8 billion as of December 15. PayPal has teamed with LayerZero to expand the token’s presence to nine new blockchains, including Tron, Abstract, Aptos, and Avalanche. But there’s also been some controversy. In October, observers noted that PYUSD issuer Paxos minted and then immediately burned $300 trillion worth of tokens. It’s an impossibly large number of tokens, given it represents more than twice the world’s GDP. At 3:12 PM EST, Paxos mistakenly minted excess PYUSD as part of an internal transfer. Paxos immediately identified the error and burned the excess PYUSD. This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach. Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root… — Paxos (@Paxos) October 15, 2025 "This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach,” the firm wrote on X. “Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root cause." Ethena Labs’ USDe demonstrated a velocity of 11 in 2025, with its market capitalization showing a modest gain of 11% from $5.8 billion in January to $6.5 billion by December 15. But that trajectory leaves out the fact that its market cap soared to nearly $15 billion before the early October flash crash. USDe is the only stablecoin on this list that isn’t backed by fiat currency: It’s backed by a delta-neutral strategy involving staked Ethereum and perpetual futures hedges. But its reliance on derivatives means that times of high volatility and shifts in sentiment can cause big swings in market capitalization. Even with a less straightforward structure, the token’s advocates include billionaire Arthur Hayes. But not all regulators are convinced. Ethena Labs pulled out of the German market in April over growing scrutiny over its “serious deficiencies” in compliance. Sky’s USDS showed extremely low velocity of 1 in 2025—and that’s by design. To avoid confusion: Sky is a rebrand of DeFi OG MakerDAO and USDS is a rebrand of its DAI stablecoin. Unlike USDT or USDC, which function as transactional stablecoins, most USDS tokens sit locked in Maker vaults or savings contracts as collateral for DeFi loans rather than circulating. Its role in DeFi is closer to a yield-bearing savings instrument than digital cash, so it naturally turns over far less often. For example, the Sky Protocol currently offers a 4% rewards rate (paid in SKY tokens) to users who hold USDS. As of 2025, USDS has seen its market capitalization grow from $5.2 billion at the start of the year to $9.8 billion, marking an 85% increase in just under 12 months.

Title: Why Are Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Crashing Again?

Full Content:
The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are crashing again, with the crypto market failing to record a ‘Santa rally’ like other major assets. This comes as BTC and ETH continue to face significant selling pressure from the crypto ETFs, which are facing sustained outflows. The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down again amid selling pressure from the BTC and ETH ETFs. According to Arkham data, BlackRock deposited 2,292 BTC ($200 million) and 9,976 ETH ($29 million) into Coinbase yesterday, likely to sell these coins. This marked the second time this week that the world’s largest asset manager had sent BTC and ETH to Coinbase in a bid to offload these coins. Further data from Arkham shows that BlackRock deposited 2,838.78 Bitcoin ($255 million) and 29,928 Ethereum ($91.29 million) into Coinbase on December 22. These sell-offs come as the crypto ETFs continue to record significant outflows. The BTC ETFs have seen a total net outflow of $330 million this week, while the ETH ETFs have a weekly net outflow of $11 million. This indicates that the institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum is fading at the moment, which provides a bearish outlook for the largest crypto assets by market cap. A CoinShares report released earlier this week revealed that Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of $460 million last week, while Ethereum ETPs saw outflows of $555 million. From a macro perspective, the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have also continued to decline as the Fed looks unlikely to cut interest rates at the January FOMC meeting. The recent U.S. GDP and jobless claims reports have sparked a surge in the odds that the Fed will hold rates steady next month. A CryptoQuant analysis revealed that the bear market risk is becoming more relevant based on the Bitcoin Combined Market Index (BCMI). The BCMI is said to be below equilibrium at the moment but well above historical bottom zones. This suggests that there is still more room for the BTC price to drop to the downside. The CryptoQuant analysis stated that from a data-driven perspective, this opens the possibility that Bitcoin is transitioning into a bear phase and not just experiencing a pullback. If history repeats itself, BTC is expected to form a more durable bottom if the BCMI revisits the 2019 to 2023 levels. The analysis added that this is a scenario worth considering, as at this stage, the market appears to be in a downward transition rather than a completed reset.

Title: Crypto sentiment is trapped in extreme fear because the industry’s biggest structural wins are failing to move prices

Investors won the policy battles, the regulatory clarity, and the institutional access they wanted. Bitcoin still dropped 30% and looks to finish the year negative. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto sentiment gauges have spent the past two months deep in the red. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has spent more than 30% of 2025 in fear or extreme fear territory, and alternative trackers put the market in a 10-25 range out of 100 since mid-November. Bitcoin is on track for its worst fourth quarter since 2018, many large altcoins are down up to 90% from their highs, and gold, silver, and major stock indices pushed to new highs in the same period. The mood is poisonous. Investors got all of the macro, the policy, the structural wins they'd been lobbying for since 2021, and the reward was a market that faded every rally and underperformed every competing asset class. That's not how cycles are supposed to end. It's how trust collapses, and narratives break. Understanding why sentiment cratered requires unpacking five overlapping drivers: performance versus expectations, thinning liquidity, brutal leverage washouts, confusing macro conditions, and narrative fatigue that turned bullish milestones into sell-the-news traps. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $126,000 in October, with a setup that looked clean: spot ETFs drew record inflows, the US government shutdown sparked a safe-haven narrative, and a third rate cut was set. Yet, instead of the parabolic fourth quarter many anticipated, Bitcoin dropped 30% and is finishing the year down single digits, marking its worst fourth quarter since 2018. Bitcoin faces record institutional demand and macroeconomic uncertainty, key drivers converging to push it to new highs. Altcoins fared worse, down up to 90% from their highs, wiped out by thin liquidity and the realization that most tokens launched between 2024 and 2025 had no product-market fit beyond speculation. The divergence with traditional assets only compounded the pain. Gold gained 70%, silver rallied 143%, and the S&P 500 pushed to new highs. Crypto investors watched their portfolios bleed while every other “debasement hedge” printed gains. That divergence creates a specific kind of sentiment poison: the feeling that you got the thesis right but chose the wrong instrument, or worse, that the asset class is broken. When performance lags expectations by that margin, and the setup looks perfect, sentiment doesn't soften; it collapses. On-chain data shows Bitcoin transaction volumes and active addresses trending down since November, with daily volume down sharply and activity falling by double digits. VanEck's mid-December chain report flagged weak fees, stagnant new addresses, and soft hash-rate growth. Derivatives and futures volumes have been sliding since late August, and multiple trading desks describe “weak buying pressure” around the $87,000-$90,000 band. When prices chop lower on declining volume, it signals that buyers have stepped away. Bitcoin tested support repeatedly, failed to reclaim higher levels, and each failed bounce reinforced the perception that the market had no conviction. With 2025 marking drastic valuation drop-offs, token launch strategies face scrutiny for prioritizing unicorn dreams over practical fundamentals. Thinning liquidity also amplifies downside volatility. Without deep bids, small sell orders gap the market lower, triggering stop-losses and liquidations that feed the fear gauges. The decline in active addresses suggests retail is exiting. Institutions provide capital but not the speculative energy that drives crypto's upside volatility. When retail leaves, the market becomes a battle between levered traders and long-term holders, with neither willing to chase prices higher. That produces the grinding, low-volume selloff that defined the fourth quarter. The November crash combined profit-taking above $100,000, ETF outflows, and an estimated $20 billion leverage flush in October. Long-dormant “OG” wallets moved and sold hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin into strength, which many read as “smart money top-ticking the cycle.” The leverage flush was mechanical: Bitcoin rallied above $120,000, open interest hit records, funding rates spiked, and the market overheated. When Bitcoin failed to break higher and started selling off, liquidations cascaded. Longs turned into forced sellers, stop-losses triggered, and the structure unwound in days. That kind of forced selling doesn't just move prices; it breaks sentiment. The long-term holder distribution added psychological damage. When wallets that haven't moved in years suddenly activate and sell, the market interprets it as insiders exiting. That perception may not be accurate, but it matters more than reality when forming sentiment. If the market believes “smart money” sold the top, everyone else assumes they're holding the bag. That belief becomes self-fulfilling: remaining holders sell to avoid being last out, which drives prices lower, reinforcing fear and driving more selling. Recent US inflation prints and Fed communications increased the odds of 2026 rate cuts, but not enough to give a clear “lower for longer” signal. Crypto mirrored every wobble in risk assets rather than trading like a haven, reinforcing the perception that Bitcoin is a high-beta tech exposure rather than a store of value. When the dollar weakened, Bitcoin rallied briefly. When risk appetite faded, Bitcoin sold off harder than equities. That pattern destroyed the “digital gold” narrative, at least for now. Additionally, regulatory progress has been messy. Europe is implementing MiCA, forcing exchanges and stablecoin issuers to comply or exit. The US GENIUS Act is turning into concrete stablecoin rules, but it won't be finalized until 2027. The CLARITY Act stalled after a long government shutdown. A January markup is the start of the sausage-making process, not the finish line Sacks claims. The industry also faces a wave of private lawsuits as SEC enforcement recedes, keeping legal risk at the forefront. None of that screams “clean runway.” The confusion matters because crypto's 2025 thesis rested on clarity: spot ETFs would bring institutional capital, a crypto-friendly administration would remove regulatory overhang, and macro conditions would favor hard assets. All three happened, but the payoff didn't materialize. That gap between thesis and outcome drives sentiment from optimism to confusion to fear. 2025 delivered a “crypto president,” spot ETFs, big-name IPOs like Circle's, and tokenization headlines from BlackRock, but prices dropped after every event. Trump's election was supposed to be bullish, but Bitcoin sold off. Spot ETF inflows hit records, but Bitcoin chopped sideways then dropped. Circle's IPO was supposed to validate the sector, but it came and went with no sustained price reaction. Each milestone became a sell-the-news trap. Altcoins underperformed badly while gold and silver stole the “hard asset” spotlight. When a sector gets most of the structural wins it's been lobbying for and still underperforms, retail's default mood shifts from euphoria to disappointment. The crypto market just nuked, with the largest ever liquidation event in 24 hours and a bloodbath for altcoins triggering traders' PTSD. The industry won policy battles, regulatory clarity, institutional access, and political support, but none of it translated into sustained price appreciation. Instead, the wins became exhaustion points: smart money sold the announcements, retail bought the hype, and prices ended up lower. Narrative fatigue means investors stop believing in the next catalyst. When every bullish event has been a selling opportunity, why would the next one be different? The market becomes a trap: good news doesn't move prices, bad news accelerates selling. That's the environment that produces extreme fear and keeps it pinned for months. The extreme fear readings capture a market that feels betrayed by its own thesis. Investors believed in the halving cycle, the ETF narrative, the regulatory clarity story, and the macro setup. All of those things happened, and the market still sold off. That's not just disappointing for traders chasing profits, it's disorienting for everyone with stakes in the market. Extreme fear can be a contrarian signal. Historically, some of the best entry points come when sentiment is at its worst. ETF flows hit $941 million in two months, but real adoption hinges on Ripple's ODL volumes, on-chain payments, and RLUSD growth on XRPL. However, that only works if underlying conditions improve. Right now, the conditions that drove fear, such as thinning liquidity, leverage overhang, macro confusion, and narrative fatigue, haven't resolved. They've settled into a new equilibrium where prices chop lower, volume declines, and nobody wants to call a bottom. Until one or more of those conditions break, sentiment will stay depressed. The question for 2026 is whether the market can find a catalyst strong enough to reverse that trend, or whether this cycle ends not with a bang but with a slow, grinding capitulation that leaves the entire narrative in ruins.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From Tilak’s Substack In the aftermath of the UN’s COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, several commentators have claimed that the age of climate alarmism may finally be fraying at the edges. The Wall Street Journal concluded that Europe’s green energy policies slashed emissions but at the cost of crippling the economy. PJ Media’s Rick Moran argues that “the religion of climate alarmism is in decline”. He finds that President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda and the high-profile defection from the climate alarmist priesthood by Bill Gates has begun to alter the debate over climate change. Peter Savodnik of the Free Press wrote last week that those who questioned the calamity of climate change were treated like pariahs for years but now, “their day of vindication has come”. He cites Bjorn Lomborg, who opined that “I believe we are witnessing a broader, more balanced reassessment of climate change”. The evidence against climate alarmism is no longer relegated to alternative media. It is visible in electricity bills that have exploded precisely in those countries and states – Germany, Great Britain, California – most exposed to wind and solar absolutism. It became apparent in the great Iberian Peninsula blackout in April, which lasted for hours and led to the deaths of 11 people, a systemwide failure due to insufficient fossil fuels-based synchronous generation and an excessive reliance on inverter-based solar power. It is evident in Europe’s industrial heartlands, hollowed out by irrational energy policies sold as moral imperatives but delivered as economic self-sabotage. Yet another reminder of Western Europe’s on-going deindustrialisation emerged two days ago, as the Financial Times reported that Volkswagen will stop manufacturing vehicles at its site in Dresden, marking the first time in the carmaker’s 88-year history that it will close production at a site in Germany. Even in the EU, the epicentre of green utopianism, policymakers have come under pressure from powerful business lobbies to weaken proposed ‘sustainability’ rules as part of a drive to reduce burdens on domestic enterprises. AP reported yesterday that European officials moved to ease their ban on sales of cars with internal combustion engines by 2035, responding to pressure from governments and automakers who argued that the industry needed more flexibility to help achieve EU climate goals. Climate as Theology Yet, belief in imminent climate catastrophe remains remarkably resilient among Western elites. Optimism in rationality prevailing may be premature. The Church of Climate, with its high priests and devoted flock, has proven remarkably resilient over decades, weathering empirical assaults and expert rebuttals with the tenacity of a faith unmoored from facts. The question worth asking is no longer whether the alarmists are right — they are not — but why the creed survives so unscathed by evidence, falsification and repeated policy failure. This durability is not rational. It is moral, ideological and ultimately theological. For many years now, serious scientists and scholars with unimpeachable credentials — William Happer, John Clauser, Judith Curry and many others — have demolished the claim that the climate system is threatened with an imminent apocalypse caused by fossil fuel-based emissions. Steve Koonin’s careful exposition of the data made this plain to any reader willing to separate evidence from rhetoric. And yet these arguments yield no value to the priesthood of climate alarm. The reason is simple: the dispute is not about data. It is about virtue and the seductive promise of meaningfulness. Climate alarmism long ago ceased to be a scientific hypothesis and became instead a moral identity. Its adherents see themselves as uniquely compassionate, enlightened and willing to ‘care for the planet’ in contrast to the supposedly venal, backward or morally defective climate change deniers. These ‘deniers’, as the inquisitors label them, are not fringe figures but guardians of scientific integrity against a modern Lysenkoism where dissent is heresy. Climate alarmism serves another powerful purpose. It is the modern expression of what Friedrich Hayek called the “fatal conceit“: the belief that a self-appointed elite, armed with models and moral certainty, can out-think the dispersed intelligence of markets, societies and freely choosing individuals. This conceit is reinforced by what might be called the ‘noble lie‘. Many within the climate establishment openly or tacitly believe that exaggeration is justified — indeed necessary — if it nudges the masses toward ‘correct’ behaviour. If climate change must be overstated, so be it. If uncertainty must be suppressed, that too is a price worth paying. The end — planetary salvation — justifies the means. Layered into the climate alarmist narrative is yet another dimension of political calculus that aids social-democrat governments in power throughout the West with the significant exception of Trump’s America. The ever-imminent climate catastrophe handily provides politicians with the perfect hobgoblin that elicits among their constituents’ clamorous calls for being led to safety, as H. L. Mencken reminded us in his maxim on practical politics. Given these potent advantages of having a theology of climate, empirical refutation becomes irrelevant. Data that contradicts the narrative are not debated but delegitimised. Critics are not engaged; they are denounced. Expertise is not weighed; it is moralised. Hence the curious phenomenon of genuine Nobel-calibre physicists being dismissed as ‘deniers’, while political activists and failed politicians – the Bill McKibbens, Al Gores and Michael Manns of the world – are elevated to the status of scientific authorities and prophetic sages. The Package Deal But climate alarmism does not travel alone. It is part of a broader ideological package deal — an interlocking set of beliefs that reinforce one another psychologically and politically. The same individual who believes that capitalism is a form of exploitation will tend also to believe that Western industrial society is uniquely destructive. That same person is also likely to believe that markets cannot be trusted to allocate resources and that ‘crises’ — climate, Covid, inequality — require emergency powers of an overweening state. Unsurprisingly, this worldview also aligns neatly with support for Net Zero, ESG, DEI, gender ideology, industrial policy, public health lockdowns and the ever-expanding administrative state. This ideological coherence is not accidental. It reflects the long influence of identity-based cultural Marxism, which taught generations of Western intellectuals to interpret social and economic phenomena primarily through the lens of power, domination and historical white guilt. In this worldview, the legacy of Western development — from the Age of Exploration onward — is not human flourishing but original sin. Climate change thus becomes the ultimate indictment of modernity itself: proof that prosperity, growth and technological progress were mistakes. Gad Saad’s notion of suicidal empathy yields insights into the intellectual power of the climatistas among Western intelligentsia. Suicidal empathy refers to a pattern where an individual’s deep compassion for others becomes so extreme that it leads to self-harm, burnout or the undermining of the people they are trying to help. In Saad’s words, it refers to “the inability to implement optimal decisions when our emotional system is tricked into an orgiastic, hyperactive form of empathy, deployed on the wrong targets”. The empathy for ‘people and planet’ that forms the backbone of the climate narrative had led Western policymakers to prioritise abstract moral posturing over concrete human outcomes. It is this mindset that allows Western elites to congratulate themselves on decarbonisation targets while energy poverty rises, industries flee and living standards stagnate. The victims of these policies — the coal miners, factory workers and rural households — are dismissed as collateral damage or, worse, as morally suspect ‘deplorables’. The logic of climate alarmism encompasses the familiar phenomenon of Bootleggers and Baptists: the high priests of climate virtue including the juggernaut of lavishly funded environmental NGOs provide the moral cover, while a well-connected cohort of crony capitalists harvest subsidies, mandates and guaranteed returns. Wind and solar developers, ESG financiers and asset-management behemoths such as BlackRock have every incentive to keep the crisis narrative alive. The rhetoric of sacrifice is always for others; the rents are very much for themselves. Climate policy, with its fixation on targets detached from engineering and economics, fits this pattern all too well. This is why Trump’s challenge to climate orthodoxy was so destabilising. It was not merely a policy shift; it was a moral counter-revolution. By insisting on energy abundance, national interest and economic realism, Trump and his A-team in the energy and environmental patch – Energy Secretary Chris Wright, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum – have punctured the sanctimony of the climate elite. Executive orders can be reversed, but ideas are harder to kill — and that is precisely why the backlash has been so ferocious. No Time for Complacency Yet complacency would be a grave mistake. The perceived moral high ground remains firmly occupied by the Church of Climate, and it confers enormous political power. Should Trump’s movement falter — if the midterms deliver a repudiation rather than reinforcement, and if the next Presidential elections are lost by the MAGA movement — the entire edifice of Net Zero dogma could snap back with renewed vengeance. Democrats, buoyed by mainstream media amplification and deep-state entrenchment, would reinstate green mandates, reversing Trump’s gains. The administrative state, the ESG complex and the transnational climate bureaucracy have not gone away. They are waiting in the wings. The lesson of the past decade is sobering. Empirical truth, by itself, is not enough. Ideas matter, but so do moral narratives, institutional incentives and cultural coherence. Climate alarmism has proven resilient precisely because it is not a theory but a worldview — one that flatters its adherents, rewards its enforcers and immunises itself against doubt. If there is to be a genuine reckoning, it will require more than cheaper gas or failed wind farms. It will require reclaiming the moral language of human flourishing, exposing the hubris of central planning, and reasserting the primacy of evidence over piety. Until then, the climate apocalypse will remain postponed — but endlessly proclaimed.

Type your email… Subscribe wow the most comprehensive summary I have seen – but take heart – Trump is also bankrupting the climate NGOs as well so their noise will subside but as a former head of the UNIPCC stated- the real goal of the climate movement is the destruction of capitalism- so it will never go away as long as there are communist in charge of governments bankrupting the climate NGOs What was built once can always be rebuilt. True, except that the Church of Climate is losing adherents. And for the most part, they aren’t coming back. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. “There’s an old saying in Tennessee—I know it’s in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once, shame on—shame on you. Fool me—you can’t get fooled again.” I really liked GWB, it’s a shame his personality didn’t translate well to the job. Are they really? The true adherents are loyal and will remain loyal, since loyalty was the only thing they ever had — loyalty to the propagandists. The adherents weren’t smart enough to do their homework, research the facts, listen to the debates. They still don’t know jack about climatology, or the Ice Ages, or electricity, or anything technical. They only know being part of the herd. They will never abandon their caste. And their leaders will ride them over the cliff. It’s a Jim Jones cult. Sort of like “from the river to the sea” without being able to identify either. overall great article, but the claim that Trump is running a moral counter-revolution is absurd. The dude wants to absorb Greenland for no other reason that it’s easy and has never tried to take the moral view on anything. he could on some topics, but it seems he regards himself as a dirty exploitative manipulator. So, the dire predictions about the green comeback in the US will probably become reality. I hope the solution will come from a change in EU. He wanted to buy Greenland, not adsorb it, whatever that it in your mind. The US considered many times during many different administrations, beginning in 1867, to make this purchase. President Trump wanted to do this to improve the defense of the US from Russia and for other reasons. Don’t look at a map to see the defense issue, look at a globe. It may then be clear to you, or perhaps not. TDS? And how. But this is what we face: a large percentage of the populace that knows nothing about anything. They don’t think for themselves. They are easily swayed by propagandists. They are sheeple with a variety of insecurities, many induced by fear p*rn merchants. We can only hope that with patience and tough love that someday some of them will catch a clue. Brainwashed sheeple. Greenland, Iceland, and the Seward Peninsula are the increasingly important strategic zones of commerce/military choke-points. Russia is opening military ports on it’s northern coastal areas. the Greenland Sea is the main channel of Northwest Passage shipping traffic. China has already tried to buy military access to Greenland. With only 60k residents, and some of the poorest people on Earth, this is easily bought. Perhaps you want to place the country which jails people for Wrong-Think in charge of global commerce, or perhaps rethink that option. Adding Greenland would be the coolest maneuver in my lifetime. I want to take back all the trillions spent defending Europe, invading the Middle East and molding Hillary’s hairdo’s and use it to buy Greenland instead. You are one sick puppy! The US is vulnerable to attacks over the North Pole. Best you put away your illogical, mentallly-corrupt TDS and look at reality. “the claim that Trump is running a moral counter-revolution is absurd.” Your complete disconnect from reality is the only thing that is absurd here. Trump is systematically dismantling globalist subjugation of nation states. He was elected in a landslide to eliminate government mandated woke indoctrination and bring common sense and merit back as the governing principles for human development. It might be the most significant counter revolution in American history policy wise. Well Trump is a counter-revolution to the crazies and their jester puppet who they flicked for the word salad woman when the gaslighting so obviously couldn’t continue. A return to normalcy when the crazies had lost the plot completely even working out how many human genders there are (Hint: it’s the same number if you want to try and change genders Dr Mengele) The only morality involved was exposing the lie you couldn’t stop villains pouring across the southern border plus MSM lying complicity and ferretting out the worst of the slushfunding and snouts in the taxpayer trough. With hindsight what was so hard about that except the crazies squealing like stuck pigs their slops weren’t so forthcoming anymore. “the claim that Trump is running a moral counter-revolution is absurd” There is a certain validity to that comment. I do not believe Trump is motivated to a moral counter-revolution. Trump is a business man, not a politician, and reasonably adept at making deals. Most people do not bother to consider that his words and actions are tactical. What the future brings, is unknown, in planetary energy systems, national/world politics, none of it. Beer and popcorn time. I agree. People are putting far too much faith in the Trumpster. He only has a few more years left in office and the opposition are going to wait him out. Then it’s business as usual. Personally, i don’t think the Trumpster can change the course of america in 3 years. I could be wrong. Let’s hope so. From the article: “The administrative state, the ESG complex and the transnational climate bureaucracy have not gone away. They are waiting in the wings.” That’s right. In the U.S., Republicans need to keep the majority in the U.S. House, otherwise, the Democrats will be in a position to hold up a lot of progress on Trump’s agenda. I think soon it will be obvious to even the most dense that the U.S. economy is booming and prices are coming down and will continue to come down. Gasoline prices are down to $2 a gallon in many places. Reducing the cost of gasoline by $0.80 per gallon adds about one percent to U.S. GDP growth. It also puts more money in consumers pockets as they spend less for gasoline, they can use that money to spend in another area of the economy, thus stimulating that area. Things are looking real good in the U.S, as the economy is growing at a 4.3 percent annual rate. It took Trump less than a year to turn things around and get the U.S. back on the right track. None of this would be happening if a Democrat had been elected president. The U.S. would probably be in an economic recession right now, had that happened. But, the Good Lord smiled on us. 🙂 Unfortunately, the Marxist do-gooders are always doing everything they can to shield their herded masses from any improvements in prosperity since they require “victims” to justify their actions (thus the insistence on programs and policies that hurt the poorest the most), and instead of being the vigilant exposers of corruption, the news media are divided into camps of apologists for their chosen champions. Add to that the fickle, changing with the wind “moderate center”. It is they who will decide where the power resides in the next year. Donald Trump remains his own worst enemy in that regard, since one ill-considered stumble at a critical moment can turn that inconstant element against him. Such is the nature of the identity politics morass in which we are mired. Echo chamber disconnects from reality define the left. If Republicans don’t maintain control of congress we are screwed. They have zero understanding about how things work in the real world. Virtue signalling and hate are all they have. The Republicans are not helping the cause. Too many are reverting into RINOs, probably because the inducements from lobbyists are too sweet to pass up. Our political class is a mess. We need new leaders with integrity and common sense. I think Republicans will probably hold the majority in the U.S. Senate after 2026. If the U.S. House goes Democrat, it will cause a lot of problems for Trump, but it won’t stop the economy from booming, and it won’t stop Trump’s agenda, although it may slow it down. I think the U.S. economy is going to be booming during this next year and things will look a lot better between now and then, as far as prices and other Democrat talking points are concerned. The Republican Congress should codify as much of Trump’s MAGA agenda into law as possible before the 2026 elections roll around. Just in case. 🙂 The U.S. Senate can pass Trump’s MAGA agenda under the reconciliation rules, where they don’t need 60 votes to pass the bill, just a majority. It is my understanding that they can do reconciliation votes two more times before the 2026 elections. I hope the US continues in the right direction and succeeds in recovering in energy. Most western nations are adamantly headed for the cliff. The leaders of the Western Democracies can’t tell the difference between speculation and established facts. If they could tell the difference, they would see that all this demonization of CO2 is just speculation and would not be bankrupting their nations over a Climate Crisis that has not been scientifically established as fact. “heading for the cliff” A verifiable tipping point. I agree indicators are good. News does not want to report that things are getting better so have to focus on 20-year old scandals. Can they hide it another 3 years? Just hoping no big places decide it’s a good time to invade any little places and that no bankers collapse. “Can they hide it another 3 years?” No doubt they will try. 🙂 And yes, there are still a lot of challenges ahead, but at least we have someone with common sense leading the U.S now. We need a problem solver and Trump is a problem solver. He’s trying to fix the accumulated problems of the last 50 years. And they need fixing. The media points to grasshoppers to keep reads clicking. The next biggie is what? Wait for it…. The problem is that the blue states are not seeing much improvement in economics and living conditions due to state Democrat policies. It is up to the GOP to hammer home that the red states are doing well but the Democrat miasmas are still stagnant due to Democrat policy. I agree. Some of that kind of reporting is starting. I saw several reports on Fox News comparing costs in Red States verses costs in Blue States. The Red State costs were lower. The Trump administration needs to make a big, public relations effort to refute the Democrat propaganda. And I think they intend to do so. Trump has already given two public speeches in an effort to refute the talking points of the Democrats. I saw a great chart of inflation since the first Trump administration. The inflation rate for Trump 2016 was colored red and was around 3 percent, then the portion of the chart representing Biden’s term was colored blue and showed inflation shooting up like a rocket, and then Trump’s second term shows red again, and the inflation rate is back down to around three percent (2.7 percent as of the last reading). Looking at the chart, it is obvious that the price of things skyrocketed during the Biden years. And of course, the lying Democrats want to blame Trump for the high prices. It is SO disingenuous, but that’s the Democrats for you. They have no problem lying when the truth is obviously different. They depend on the Leftwing Propaganda Media to prop their lies up. EU did not “slash” any emissions, stop repeating their lies. But they did wreck their economies in the attempt! Are destroying, not did. The Wall Street Journal reported…. That shows how reliable that media, erm, propaganda organization is. Well written article, inciteful, and so true! 2026 should be very interesting as rival factions clash. Popcorn please! I wouldn’t call what is about to happen “interesting; I’d call it frightening. If the left continues with their obstructionist behavior, we will approach the possibility of civil war. Those who don’t want to see our country moved to the extreme left and threatened by increasing lawless acts of terrorism are rapidly growing weary, even exhausted, by those threats. It seems to be escalating and simply can’t go on, as is, much longer. We are already engaged in a civil war. We are a nation divided. If you do not agree with the position and recite the rhetoric verbatim you are a denier, the enemy. No middle ground. No dispassionate, mature debate allowed. Those wishing an open debate are silenced. Every issue has valid points on both sides, but only one side is allowed a voice. Popcorn, but do not forget the beer. We need MORE CO2. Very good article. Just have to comment on the photo – seems ER is in serious decline when they have to resort to dressing up dudes in Handmaiden costumes. Perhaps fitting that their protests now feature clowns. Can anyone still take them seriously? It should be rather embarrassing for a man to be dressed in that manner. “dudes in Handmaiden costumes” I took note of that myself. I said to myself: That’s not a gal there, he has a beard. I wondered why he was there dressed like that. I suppose he could be trans, Odd. Such a different world we live in now. I pity the children trying to make sense out of all this. It’s a lot tougher now. But it can be done. You can’t take people like this seriously. I can’t imagine the thought processes going on in those heads. Dazed and Confused, comes to mind. Sadly the children are not allowed to try to make sense of this. Rather, they are being told what to believe and not taught how to think. That applies not only to the children, but to the general population. We are all being inundated with Leftwing Propaganda 24 hours a day. Best article I’ve read on the Church of Climate, with its manipulative – corrupt Priesthood and useful idiot zealot followers. This line perfectly summed up their dogma; “ In this worldview, the legacy of Western development — from the Age of Exploration onward — is not human flourishing but original sin.” The Church of Climate will have people. They shall be known as Climengelicals. And I thought they were Climinupyourassholes. Quite often Ridicule is the best weapon… Sometimes you simply have to point and laugh!!! I add my kudos to the author of this essay on a very well written piece. Net Zero, renewables and their benefactor, the Church of Climate Alarmism, all benefit from the fact that the alarmist narrative is not a formally organized or recognized religion or church in the usual sense of the words. Thus, they are able to escape the separation of church and state mandated in the U.S. Constitution. This benefit helps them receive financial support at taxpayer expense with too little objection from the latter, although Trump now appears to be a threat to that financial support. The trolls here at WUWT ignore the problems with wind and solar energy involving physics, toxic waste, and other matters. Thus, they provide the evidence of the religious and cult-like nature of so-called renewable energy. The same goes for the climate narrative itself—the disconfirming science that shoots down the scare doesn’t matter anymore. Anyone promoting the disconfirmation is guilty of heresy and Orwellian thought-crime. It is fortunate heretics aren’t burnt at the stake anymore. And anyone familiar with the novel knows what happened to Winston Smith in Orwell’s 1984. The excessive amounts that electricity that users in the UK, Germany, California and elsewhere must pay on their bills can be viewed as tithes to this church. These tithes are the punishment for the sins of all of us against Holy Mother Earth and her climatic and environmental systems. Never mind that the Earth is getting greener. The decisions of the High Priests are final. I too worry that that climate alarmism will make a roaring comeback if the Democrats retake the U.S. Congress in 2026 and/or the White House in 2028. As much as I would prefer not to say this, never underestimate the ability of the U.S. voter to make bad decisions. The alarmists are like a predator just waiting in the wings to pounce on its prey when the opportunity presents itself. This is what could potentially happen when too little or no effort is made to educate the masses on the problems with renewables and the climate scare. Most of them probably don’t care enough to look into the issues themselves anyway. We will just have to wait and see what happens. Underlying all of this is an excessively high level of arrogance, egotism and misallocated self-righteousness found in the High Priests and believers that are probably nothing new in human history. MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL. Trump was a putz first term for not allowing Happer to do the red team/blue team debate about climate. If people knew the facts ideological zealots would be relegated as laughing stocks to be shamed for their idiocy. I have to wonder. With all the different life forms on this planet, can Mother Earth be considered a virgin? Excellent ! I’ve linked it on my https://cosy.com/DailyBlog.html with rare 4 * , and key quote : ” the seductive promise of meaningfulness “ Great article! Shame is the only way I can see the ideological disconnects from reality being broken. Their egoistic belief in the nobility and superiority of their position is impossible to influence because ideology has replaced reason. Why reason doesn’t work on them. The sheer idiocy of their beliefs needs to be called out at every opportunity. Climate denier shaming keeps them in their lane so maybe calling them climate idiots could get their egos to wake up. Shame augmented with ridicule. I caught this typo (corrected here) in the last sentence of the first paragraph under the sub-heading “Climate as Theology” in the above article: “. . . This durability is not rational. It is moral amoral, ideological and ultimately theological.” Otherwise, a great article! The Package Deal I’ve been noticing this for ages. Any “progressives” that don’t sign on to the “whole package” are committing sacrilege, risking excommunication from “the movement”. Very nice Tilak. This is what I have been saying though not nearly as eloquent as you. We don’t have a climate problem, we don’t have a science problem we do have a government problem. Government at all levels need to be called out for lying and cheating. As I have said before take away the strong arm of government and the problem goes away. It is that simple. The fanatics pushing CAGW are completely powerless and meaningless without the force of government. Take away the strong arm of government and these guys would be forced to defend their fanatic declarations with actual science and the observations to prove it. They have nothing and no one knows that better than them. On one level, this climate thing has a religious flavour. Have you noticed how religions use logic when it suits them, and dogma when it doesn’t. You can have a logical discussion with a believer up to a point, but you can never take it past that point. It would be good if the same did not occur in science, but as Max Planck and others have pointed out, it has gone on for centuries. It used to be called gatekeeping, but climate scientists have used the opaqueness of models to take it to a whole new dimension. In science, at least the facts can get through in the end, albeit often decades late. That is why, as others have pointed out, Net Zero is being separated from climate science. Both are crumbling, but in different ways. If connected, when one falls they both fall. By separating them, the blob (for want of a better word) hope they can save at least one. There is still a lot of hard work ahead – the honest people now have to fight on two fronts. There have always been fashions in thought, just as in everything else, including clothing, architecture, and building and automotive design. It is never rational, but the adherents follow it nonetheless, no matter how ridiculous it makes them look. The now-collapsing thinking regarding so-called “climate change” and the degree to which it is apocalyptic is just another example of this human weakness. There are many champagne socialists among the climate alarmists; in fact, few people would be surprised to find that they dominate the movement. They have little to lose by espousing the CAGW theory and many stand to profit from it either through career advancement and/or financially. So as long as their beliefs are being questioned or being abandoned completely, they will fight like tigers to keep propping them up because the stakes are too high not to do so. You can understand a lot of liberalism by recognizing liberals’ deep need to feel superior — intellectually, but also morally. Maybe there is medical hope for them after all. story tip Why some people keep making the same bad decisions | ScienceDaily “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.
