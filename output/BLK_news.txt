Bored drinking the same wine every Christmas? We tend to revert to the same few staples every year: Chablis, Mâcon, Rioja Reserva, Bordeaux and one or two other tried-and-trusted favourites. However, there are plenty of other options, wines that might provoke a little conversation around the table. Smooth-textured white wines go nicely with turkey as well as seafood starters. Instead of a chardonnay, this week I suggest a delicious Spanish white made from the godello grape. I tried the Château Thieuley with some smoked salmon I had in the fridge and the two went very well. It might be a bit light for turkey or red meats, though. But you could also try a viognier or an albariño from Spain. I tend to go for lighter red wines with my turkey, usually a Burgundy, a syrah from the Northern Rhône, or a gamay, but I think the Dāo would also do very nicely. If you prefer fuller-bodied wines I would suggest a southern Rhône, Languedoc or Australian grenache-based red that will be low in tannins and therefore great with turkey. If you are catering for a large gang of people, the featured Lidl Grenache would be ideal. I would also recommend the excellent Château Cazal-Viel Saint Chinian from Dunnes Stores, a steal at €10 and perfect with turkey. Rich soft strawberry fruits with a long rounded finish. Perfect with turkey and all the trimmings. From Lidl Rich textured fruit, a touch of toasted hazelnuts and a lively refreshing acidity. This would be good with shellfish or roast root vegetables. From Winesdirect.ie A gorgeous wine with floral aromas elegant ripe red fruits, and soft tannins on the finish. Enjoy with turkey, goose or mushroom dishes.

Title: ‘I remember Past Ross thinking, you need to stort being nicer to Future Ross. He’s a genuinely good bloke’

Listen on Sorcha says she knows me. She knows me inside-out. But I tell her that the Rossmeister General still has one or two surprises in his locker. Yeah, no, we’re staying with Sorcha’s old pair in Stoneybosher while the fire damage to our gaff is being fixed and they’ve told us we can decorate their gaff for Christmas. So we’re off to buy a tree and then we’re going to swing into Killiney to collect our baubles and various other bits? Which is actually what we’re orguing about. Sorcha says I’m going to be spending the entire weekend disentangling the lights, but I’m making the point that I didn’t just fock them all into the same box after Christmas last year. Yeah, no, I separated them, then I stretched them out and wrapped each set individually around pieces of, like, cordboard. Sorcha laughs. I’m there, “What’s funny?” She goes, “I remember you saying that you were going to do that? As a matter of fact, you say it every year. But then when it comes to it, you can never be bothered and you end up just throwing them all into the same box for Future Ross to sort out.” “But last Christmas,” I go, “I remember Past Ross thinking, ‘You need to stort being nicer to Future Ross. He’s a genuinely good bloke. Do the dude a solid for once in your life.’ I remember saying that out loud, Sorcha – very clearly.” There’s a “Christmas Trees for Sale” sign on a lamp-post as we’re approaching the junction with Ailesbury Road. Sorcha’s like, “Will we stop here?” But I’m there, “What, Michael’s? I wouldn’t have a Michael’s tree in the house, Sorcha. Even though I’d consider James Ryan a very good friend and obviously Dan Leavy and the Byrne brothers.” She goes, “You see? This is why I’m so dubious about you wrapping the lights. Because you always, always insist on making things hord for yourself.” “That’s not true.” “It’s one hundred per cent true.” “Sorcha, I actually remember very pacifically thinking – and it was the mention of Ross and Harry Byrne there that reminded me – when you’re a ten and you score a try, you have the option of either putting the ball down in the corner, so you can show off your kicking skills with the conversion, or putting it down underneath the posts, just to make it easier on yourself. And I remember thinking, as I was wrapping the lights, ‘You’re basically putting the ball down beneath the posts here, Rossmeister.’” “You’ve suddenly remembered that?” It’s, like, every single year you used to say that you were going to give up drink after Christmas, do twelve hours per week in the gym and make a comeback to rugby “Yeah, no, I’m like Celine Dion here – it’s all coming back to me now. And then I actually texted Ross Byrne – or I might have sent him a voice note – to tell him what I was doing. Because I’m always saying to him that once you’re a kicker, you never, ever stop thinking like a kicker – and that’s for life. And he came back to me with either a thumbs-up or a smiley face emoji.” “Will we stop at Blackrock College for a tree?” “Not a focking chance. Wouldn’t give them the pleasure.” She’s like, “So where did the cordboard come from?” I’m there, “Excuse me?” “The cordboard. That you supposedly wrapped the lights in.” “I think you’ll find the word is supposably?” “It’s not, Ross.” “Isn’t it? Well, whatever. It would have been cordboard that we had just lying around.” “So you don’t remember where it came from?” “I think it might have been a Corn Flakes box, or – yeah, no, I’m remembering now – it was a Rice Krispies box. Because you know the way I always love a bowl of Rice Krispies on Christmas morning.” “Ross, I really think this is all wishful thinking on your port.” “Excuse me?” “You constantly do this. You tell yourself that you’re going to do something, and you manage to persuade yourself that you’ve done it – even though you haven’t?” “Don’t suppose you’ve any examples of this, Sorcha?” “Yeah, I do. It’s, like, every single year you used to say that you were going to give up drink after Christmas, do twelve hours per week in the gym and make a comeback to rugby.” “Jesus.” “What?” “You had that one in the chamber, ready to fire, didn’t you?” “And then in January, February, Morch, I would hear you tell people that you were off the booze and absolutely crushing it in the gym. Even though you weren’t.” “So you’re calling me a liar?” “I never thought you were lying. I always thought you’d convinced yourself that it was actually true. I think your enthusiasm sometimes gets the better of your sense of reality.” “Well, brace yourself, Sorcha, because you’re about to be shocked.” We drive the rest of the way in silence. Eventually, we pull into Honalee. There’s, like, five or six workmen out the front of the gaff, having their tea break. Sorcha goes, “My husband is just going to pop up to the attic to get the Christmas lights if that’s okay?” “Don’t mention Christmas lights,” one of the dudes goes. “I spent the whole of last weekend try to untangle the things.” Sorcha’s there, “Well, Ross is convinced that he wrapped them all individually after last Christmas.” The dude actually laughs. He goes, “I always tell myself I’m going to do that. That’s me. Every year.” I decide to block out the voices of the doubters and the naysayers. I tip upstairs, open the attic, clamber up the ladder, switch on the light and find the box. I stare at the lid of it for a good, like, thirty seconds, listening to my own breathing as I prepare to open it. Then I grab the two flaps, tear it open and look inside. Sixty seconds later, I’m carrying the box down the stairs and out to the cor. All of the workmen are standing around waiting to find out whether I actually did wrap the lights or not. “Well?” one of them even goes. I’m there, “Get on with the work, will you? We want to be back in the house before Christmas 2025.” I throw the box on the back seat and Sorcha storts the cor. She doesn’t say anything for a good, like, five minutes, then she goes, “I’ll tell you what, let’s treat ourselves to new Christmas lights this year.” I’m like, “Yeah, no, good idea,” and then I go, “Past Ross is a total dick, by the way.” Ross O’Carroll-Kelly was captain of the Castlerock College team that won the Leinster Schools Senior Cup in 1999.

Title: ‘Dave played such a big role’ – Leo Cullen pays tribute to late Leinster S&C stalwart Dave Fagan

Jordie Barrett and head coach Leo Cullen during a Leinster training session at UCD this week. Photo by David Fitzgerald/Sportsfile Sam Prendergast Dave Fagan had a profound influence on the Leinster match-day 23 that arrived in Bristol this morning, and Leo Cullen admitted the death of the club stalwart after an illness had hit the organisation for six. The strength and conditioning coach’s name regularly cropped up in discussions with young Leinster players whose journey as professionals began working with him at the club’s centre of excellence in Donnybrook, where he’d help turn the boys into men. He was as much part of the Leinster furniture as head coach Cullen who yesterday recalled working with the former shot put coach when he was transitioning from Blackrock College into senior rugby in the late 1990s. “It gives me goosebumps just thinking about him,” Cullen said yesterday. “We just trained in Energia Park in memory of Dave. When players leave school or club, they go into the Ken Wall Centre of Excellence and it’s like the school of hard knocks down there. “Dave is there since I came out of school. I was explaining to Rabah Slimani on the pitch today about how in the olden days when Mike Ruddock was the head coach and I went in as a 19-year-old, it was a prefab building where the Old Wesley gym is now . . . that’s where we all would have done our training. “Everyone was learning about professionalism and Dave has been involved in Leinster since those days. He was around my whole career and it seems like a long time ago since I played rugby. “He was a great character to have around, a great sounding board for me about young players coming through. He had so much knowledge, he’d seen so much and he could spot them a mile away – the good and bad ones – and it’s such a great skill. “You go into the gym down there and there’s this picture on the wall, Dave takes great pride in the players that step into the senior team. That’s where they all came through, in terms of our home-based players, he was such a big role in that. “It was an unbelievably sad day yesterday here, we try to move on. It won’t be easy, but our thoughts at the moment are with his family.” There are no plans to formally mark Fagan’s passing at Ashton Gate tomorrow, but you sense the squad will feel the need to deliver a performance for the coach. The big news at yesterday’s team announcement was Cullen’s decision to select Sam Prendergast at out-half. There had been plenty of speculation about whether the Kildare youngster would be put in cold storage after starting back-to-back Tests for Ireland, but the head coach conceded his performances in November had moved the dial on selection. “It’s never straightforward. Sam is a young player, he’s very talented. Not just him, you have to make sure the transition is smooth,” he said. “You have to be open-minded . . . listen, we’ve four 10s that can do a really good job for us. They’re all internationals now. Sam wasn’t an international four weeks ago, now he is. “That’s a different conversation in terms of his level of experience and exposure he’s been through, which is fantastic because . . . we could talk about him, but Gus [McCarthy] and Thomas Clarkson as well, we’ve three young players and now they are internationals and that’s great for them to go through because they grow in terms of their confidence. “Hopefully, that’s a positive thing for us as a group. I thought Ross [Byrne] did a great job for the team on Friday night [against Ulster], but we’ve got to be respectful that we’ve a guy who started the last two Tests for Ireland. “We have, when we’re talking about selection, it’s this week. It’s not a call that was made six weeks ago. We can have conversations, but it’s ifs, buts and maybes until we’re sitting down together as a group of coaches saying this is how it’s played out. The three lads coming back, it’s fantastic to have and obviously Sam is one of them.” McCarthy and Clarkson are on a stacked bench that includes Andrew Porter, RG Snyman and Jordie Barrett, who will make his club debut against an in-form Bristol side. Cullen confirmed Hugo Keenan (wrist) and James Lowe (calf) are facing spells on the sidelines, while he said Tadhg Furlong was also a number of weeks away from returning. Pat Lam and his Bristol Bears represent a formidable opening test but Leinster have a cause and they should be too strong. Verdict: Leinster Bristol Bears: R Lane; J Bates, BJ van Rensburg, K Ravouvu, G Ibitoye; AJ MacGinty, H Randall; E Genge, H Thacker, M Lahiff; J Dun, J Owen; S Grondona, F Harding (capt), B Mata.

Title: SEC, fund managers should quit pushing NetZero — it hurts shareholders
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/opinion/sec-asset-funds-should-quit-pushing-netzero-it-hurts-shareholders/
Time Published: 2024-12-06T23:05:06Z
Full Content:
As a new administration soon takes charge, what will become of climate policy? That’s a question worth asking, since it was nearly invisible this past election. A recent Gallup poll on the importance of various issues showed that “the economy” was first out of 22 issues; “climate change” was 21st. Incoming President Donald Trump has declared the United States will not be a party to the Paris Climate Agreement or the United Nations’ NetZero 2050 plan, which requires countries to achieve net C02 emissions by 2050. Yet some large fund managers, including BlackRock, State Street and Wellington, have other ideas. They are members of consortiums whose members pledge to push the firms they invest in to abide by NetZero 2050. But fund managers are fiduciaries who are supposed to work in the best interest of their investors. This means aiming for the best possible financial return. Pushing firms to comply with the Paris Agreement’s costly mandate is inconsistent with this. Consider an investor who voted for Trump. She has invested her retirement savings with a fund manager who is a consortium member. Like most people, she is unaware that the consortiums exist. Unbeknownst to her, the fund manager is using her investments to pursue a policy she probably doesn’t support and will likely leave her worse off. How is the fund manager fulfilling its fiduciary obligation? The consortiums are powerful. Investors increasingly own shares indirectly through investment funds, which means the fund managers do the corporate voting. The consortiums collectively control enough shares to influence corporate policies and determine who sits on corporate boards. Climate Action 100+ has over 700 investors with $68 trillion in assets. The NetZero Assets Managers Initiative includes 325 fund managers with over $57 trillion in assets. BlackRock, State Street and JP Morgan recently made news when they left Climate Action 100+, after it began requiring some consortium members to engage with policymakers and publish details about NetZero 2050 discussions with the companies they invest in. Yet all three remain in the NetZero Assets Managers Initiative, which does not have these requirements. Some asset-manager-consortium members have encouraged the Securities and Exchange Commission to take measures to further their climate-change agenda. In March 2024, the SEC adopted its controversial climate-change rule, which requires firms to discuss climate change in their annual reports and registration statements. Before that rule, a firm had to report any risk material to its business. If a firm saw climate change as a major cost or benefit, it was supposed to say so. But if a firm does not see climate change as a major issue, why should it be required to discuss it in its annual report? The new rule says it must. The SEC is not an environmental regulator. It is supposed to ensure that firms provide accurate disclosures so investors can make informed decisions. It is not supposed to tell thousands of firms what types of risk each faces, climate or otherwise. As for climate risks, firms typically don’t provide financial forecasts 75 years into the future. A report by President Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers examined 12 peer-reviewed studies on the costs of climate change. The consensus estimate was less than 2% of GDP with warming 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit relative to preindustrial levels, about what the United Nations predicts by 2100 under plausible emissions scenarios. If that is right, the economic effect of climate change will not be that large in our lifetimes and won’t even be noticeable for a long time. Meanwhile, the cost of climate-mitigation policies could be significant. Great Britain made NetZero 2050 its official policy. It now has the highest electricity costs in the developed world, five times higher than in the United States. Higher energy costs lead to higher prices and slower economic growth. American voters seem uninterested in this expensive tradeoff. Hopefully, fund managers will return to strict adherence to fiduciary duty. Such an approach would reinforce the specialization of labor, which Adam Smith explained so well. Accountants do your taxes. Dentists clean your teeth. The SEC regulates issues concerned with finance and accounting. And fund managers should try to get you the best possible financial return. R. David McLean is the author of “The Case for Shareholder Capitalism: How the Pursuit of Profit Benefits All,” recently published by the Cato Institute.

The crypto industry is excited about a second Trump presidency. by Ellen Ioanes and Nicole Narea The price of bitcoin surged past $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, continuing a post-election run buoyed by the pro-crypto promise of the incoming Trump administration. On Election Day, bitcoin — one of the most popular decentralized digital assets available — was worth $69,374, according to the cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase. Within a month, it had spiked more than 44 percent. Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and XRP also shot up during that period. Cryptocurrencies’ sudden increase in value is a sign of investor optimism about President-elect Donald Trump’s policies and those of his picks to head several key regulatory agencies, some of whom have explicitly promised deregulation of the crypto industry. “That bitcoin hit the $100,000 mark reflects the expectation of both political support and regulatory latitude under the incoming administration,” said Ramaa Vasudevan, an economics professor at Colorado State University who has been critical of crypto. “The nomination of crypto-enthusiasts for administrative posts is a clear signal of the embrace of bitcoin and crypto triggering the flood of money into these markets.” Bitcoin’s rally is also a product of its increased legitimacy. Trump’s election may have sparked its rally, but the financial establishment’s embrace of the asset in recent months provided the tinder. While bitcoin was once a niche curiosity, it is now a mainstream digital currency that everyday Americans can now buy through reputable retail investment accounts. Even if bitcoin ultimately turns out to be a bubble, as many economists have argued it may, these investment vehicles have assured it some staying power. Trump has been an ardent cryptocurrency supporter throughout his most recent presidential campaign, and his choices to lead key government agencies related to its regulation reflect that enthusiasm. Bitcoin hit its highest valuation ever following the nomination of Paul Atkins on Wednesday to head the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is in charge of regulating tradable securities like stocks. Atkins was previously an SEC commissioner for six years during former President George W. Bush’s administration. Atkins is “not necessarily the sort of burn-it-all-down type of nominee that Trump has decided upon for other positions,” Molly White, a cryptocurrency researcher and critic, told Vox. “He’s fairly establishment; he has the SEC background, but he also was a very strong advocate for deregulation when he was in the SEC and certainly since then.” Atkins is also a co-chair of the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance, an industry lobbying group that advocates for lax regulation of cryptocurrencies. Perianne Boring, the CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, is rumored to be one of Trump’s top picks for another key position: head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which makes rules around the trading of futures and commodities. Currently, cryptocurrency is under the purview of the SEC, but the Trump administration is reportedly weighing regulating it as a commodity instead. If that change is made, cryptocurrency would come under the purview of the CFTC, which is often seen to be more hands-off in its approach to regulation. Billionaire crypto enthusiast David Sacks, whom Trump named Thursday as his crypto and AI czar, will be tasked with helping formulate crypto and AI policy from the White House. In that role, Trump said in a post on Truth Social, Sacks will work closely with both the SEC and CTFC to develop a legal framework to regulate crypto. Trump himself is also connected to cryptocurrency via his family’s cryptocurrency and trading venture World Liberty Financial. Pro-cryptocurrency groups spent $245 million in this year’s elections, more than any other industry, to support candidates across the country seen as friendlier to crypto. All of that likely means that the regulatory landscape under a Trump administration will be much friendlier for crypto following heavier regulations and a slew of lawsuits against crypto companies during current SEC chair Gary Gensler’s tenure. “The recent wave of investment in the crypto space is largely driven by the growing belief that years of regulatory uncertainty and lawfare may finally be giving way to clarity,” said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab. Gensler’s SEC cracked down on trading platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken, arguing that the buying and selling of cryptocurrency should have the same oversight as something like a stock or bond, and that investors should have access to the same kinds of information about crypto companies as they would have about a company that they are buying stock in. Crypto trading platforms and associated companies, however, argue that crypto tokens aren’t the same as stocks and therefore shouldn’t have the same regulations applied. The SEC has brought lawsuits against several major crypto platforms, including Coinbase, which are ongoing. But they could be dropped under the Trump administration, and regulation around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is likely to change significantly under Trump. Under a Trump regulatory regime, cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase could operate with less threat of litigation, making it easier for people to trade on their platforms. Enthusiasts say this will spur innovation in the industry, but it could also mean that individual traders using such platforms are more exposed to fraud, theft, and the volatile nature of the currency. Over the past five years, and particularly following the downfall of crypto trading platform FTX in 2022, the narrative around cryptocurrency’s utility has changed. Now, it’s being touted more as an investment instrument rather than a form of currency that can be used like cash, White said. And that pivot is also helping its valuation. In January, the SEC gave the green light to the first bitcoin exchange-traded funds (or ETFs) in the US. ETFs are baskets of financial instruments (such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or in this case, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum) that are bought and sold on a regulated stock exchange. ETFs offer anyone indirect access to cryptocurrency, if they choose to invest. Put simply, if the value of bitcoin increases, so does the value of these ETFs — but because of the bundled nature of ETFs and their presence on a regulated exchange, investors are more insulated from loss if bitcoin’s value declines. Firms including BlackRock, Invesco, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Ark Invest have rolled out bitcoin funds, which offer new investors, especially those who might be more risk-averse, easy ways to purchase or gain exposure to cryptocurrency. Previously, investors had limited options for trading bitcoin. They could go on a cryptocurrency exchange to directly buy bitcoin, but then would have to figure out how to safely and conveniently store it long-term. (Cryptocurrency held on an exchange can be vulnerable to theft, while crypto stored offline is safer but difficult to trade.) They could also invest in risky bitcoin futures, agreeing to buy or sell the currency at a later date at a certain price. Now, ETFs offer an establishment-backed option. “While no one can predict the exact inflection point or when the price will stabilize, the long-term driver of bitcoin’s rise is its evolution — not just as digital gold, but as a foundational layer of global financial infrastructure,” Catalini said. However, Vasudevan said that there is still reason to believe that crypto’s climb won’t last forever. Bitcoin has surged before, only to crash precipitously. In November 2022, bitcoin’s value dropped 20 percent, to below $16,000, in a matter of days after the spectacular downfall of the crypto exchange FTX. The concern remains that the price of crypto is based purely on speculation, rather than any inherent value. “This has all the makings of another bubble, one that is being stoked by the prospect of a more favorable regulatory environment and the possibilities it is opening for new products and funds that can draw in more and more people into these markets,” Vasudevan said.

Ad spending in 2024 received a significant boost from recurring events such as the US election and the Olympics, and experts believe that these spending patterns are likely to add billions to the market. Media agency Magna increased its US ad spending forecast for the year, expecting revenue growth of 11.4% to $377 billion, per the news shared with Marketing Dive. The company expects non-cyclical ad spending to grow by 8.9%, reflecting a rise from 8.2% in previous forecasts. This marks one of the best performances for the category in 20 years.

PwC believes that it is expected to grow at a 6.7% CAGR through 2028. With advertising expected to make up ~55% of total E&M industry growth over the upcoming 5 years, PwC believes that it will become a more important part of companies’ business models. For strategic reasons, all participants in the E&M industry are required to be more skillful at selling ads. According to PwC, the changes to the way businesses approach the ad business are expected to be seen in 3 key areas.

Title: Why Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is the Best Fuel Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Fuel Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) stands against other best fuel stocks to buy now. Fuel stocks, often referred to as energy stocks, represent shares of companies involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, as well as those specializing in drilling for these resources. Additionally, companies that refine crude oil into usable products, such as gasoline and diesel, also fall under this category. In an interview with Bloomberg on December 5, Amrita Sen, Founder and Director of Research at Energy Aspects, discussed the current state of the oil market and the upcoming OPEC+ meeting. Sen noted that OPEC+ members are unlikely to increase production, given the traditional maintenance season in Q1 and Q2, which typically leads to crude stock builds. Instead, she expects the group to delay the planned output to effectively get rid of the seasonal builds and reassess the market in the second half of the year. Sen highlighted that the current state of global inventories is incredibly low and that in the US, inventories are expected to end the year below 420 million barrels, which is at their lowest since 2007. Despite this, oil prices have been stuck at a low price, as analysts and industries are expecting a bearish 2025 and are discounting their current inventories When asked about the risk of a serious breakdown in OPEC+ members, Sen said that it is unlikely to happen as the members are committed to maintain a stable price, rather than engaging in a price war. She recalled the price war in April 2020, which led to a decline in prices, and said that OPEC ministers want to avoid a repeat of that scenario. While they do want prices to be higher, they also realize that if there is a breakdown and the market is not managed properly, prices can also go lower.

Sen agreed that the recent commencement of Canadian oil shipments to international markets via the Trans Mountain pipeline represents a significant development in the industry and has enabled Canadian producers to benefit from increased access to global markets. Sen notes that China has a strong preference for Canadian heavy oil, primarily due to its consistent quality, which is well-suited to the requirements of modern Chinese refineries. Sen also said that all the new refineries coming online in China, India, and other South Asian countries are primarily designed to process medium or heavy sour crude oil, and its demand is projected to reach a net 800,000 barrels per day. Sen pointed out that the refining capacity in regions such as Europe, North America, and other OECD countries is expected to decline, with a projected loss of 1 million barrels per day during the next year, comprising 400,000 barrels in Europe and an additional 400,000 in the United States, due to environmental concerns. Looking ahead to 2025, Sen expects the average oil price to average around $80 for Brent, but there are risks skewed to the upside due to the possible tightening of sanctions on Iran, Venezuela, and Russia under the Trump administration. Energy plays a crucial role in the global economy, as it provides the essential resources needed to power industries, transportation, and homes. The oil and gas industry continues to play a pivotal role in meeting the world’s energy needs, even as the push for cleaner alternatives gains momentum. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 8 best fuel stocks to buy now. To compile our list of the 8 best fuel stocks to buy now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 25 largest companies in the oil and gas sectors. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 8 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company maintains a significant presence in the U.S., the Middle East, and Latin America, serving as a key supplier of crude oil to refineries and industrial sectors. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is focusing on utilizing its existing infrastructure in the Delaware basin acreage to develop secondary benches inside the existing wells by leveraging technology. By doing so, the company aims to replace reserves at a low cost. Additionally, the company is reducing costs through infill development and has been able to add considerable reserves through extensions and discoveries. As a result, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is replacing reserves while investing less than its current depreciation and depletion costs.

Overall, OXY ranks 2nd on our list of best fuel stocks to buy now.

Title: Republican AGs sue BlackRock, other investment firms over ‘woke’ climate action efforts

The Lawrence Energy Center in Kansas burns coal for electric power. A federal lawsuit filed by 11 Republican attorneys general claims institutional investors BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street committed antitrust violations to lower supply and increase the cost of coal. (Photo by Jill Hummels/Kansas Reflector) Major institutional investors have artificially lowered coal production and raised energy costs for consumers in an effort to lower global carbon emissions, a federal lawsuit claims. Republican attorneys general in 11 states filed a joint lawsuit last month against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, claiming the organizations’ efforts to pressure coal companies to lower carbon emissions and respond to climate change amount to anti-competitive business practices. All three companies, the lawsuit says, have acquired significant shares in the largest publicly-traded coal companies to coerce their management. “For the past four years, America’s coal producers have been responding not to the price signals of the free market, but to the commands of Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chairman and CEO, and his fellow asset managers,” the lawsuit says. BlackRock is the world’s largest financial asset manager. The case was in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on behalf of the states of Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming. The case asks the court to find that the companies have violated federal antitrust laws and prohibit them from using their stock holdings in coal companies to limit output. In a statement, State Street called the lawsuit “baseless.” “State Street acts in the long-term financial interests of investors with a focus on enhancing shareholder value,” the company said. “As long-term capital providers, we have a mutual interest in the long-term success of our portfolio companies.” In 2020, Fink wrote in a letter to CEOs that “climate risk is investment risk” and announced efforts to “place sustainability at the center of our investment approach.” He said companies and investors had a meaningful role to play in the transition from fossil fuels and coal to clean energy. The following year, BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, acknowledging an “urgent need to accelerate the transition towards global net zero emissions” and committing to work to reduce carbon emissions. Black Rock and State Street also signed onto Climate Action 100+, a similar initiative where investors work with companies “on improving climate change governance, cutting emissions and strengthening climate-related financial disclosures. Burning coal produces carbon dioxide, the most prevalent greenhouse gas and a significant drive of climate change, scientists say. It also produces sulfur dioxide, particulates and other emissions that can be harmful to human health. Coal made up 19% of energy-related carbon emissions in 2022 and more than half of emissions from electric power companies, according to the Energy Information Administration.

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE. by Allison Kite, Oklahoma Voice December 6, 2024 by Allison Kite, Oklahoma Voice December 6, 2024 Major institutional investors have artificially lowered coal production and raised energy costs for consumers in an effort to lower global carbon emissions, a federal lawsuit claims. Republican attorneys general in 11 states filed a joint lawsuit last month against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, claiming the organizations’ efforts to pressure coal companies to lower carbon emissions and respond to climate change amount to anti-competitive business practices. All three companies, the lawsuit says, have acquired significant shares in the largest publicly-traded coal companies to coerce their management. “For the past four years, America’s coal producers have been responding not to the price signals of the free market, but to the commands of Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chairman and CEO, and his fellow asset managers,” the lawsuit says. BlackRock is the world’s largest financial asset manager. The case was in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on behalf of the states of Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming. The case asks the court to find that the companies have violated federal antitrust laws and prohibit them from using their stock holdings in coal companies to limit output. In a statement, State Street called the lawsuit “baseless.” “State Street acts in the long-term financial interests of investors with a focus on enhancing shareholder value,” the company said. “As long-term capital providers, we have a mutual interest in the long-term success of our portfolio companies.” In 2020, Fink wrote in a letter to CEOs that “climate risk is investment risk” and announced efforts to “place sustainability at the center of our investment approach.” He said companies and investors had a meaningful role to play in the transition from fossil fuels and coal to clean energy. The following year, BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, acknowledging an “urgent need to accelerate the transition towards global net zero emissions” and committing to work to reduce carbon emissions. Black Rock and State Street also signed onto Climate Action 100+, a similar initiative where investors work with companies “on improving climate change governance, cutting emissions and strengthening climate-related financial disclosures. Burning coal produces carbon dioxide, the most prevalent greenhouse gas and a significant drive of climate change, scientists say. It also produces sulfur dioxide, particulates and other emissions that can be harmful to human health. Coal made up 19% of energy-related carbon emissions in 2022 and more than half of emissions from electric power companies, according to the Energy Information Administration. In a press release, Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers’ office accused the three companies of weaponizing their shares of the coal market. “Whether it comes from state or federal governments or the private sector,” Hilgers said, “the radical climate agenda harms Nebraskans.” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey vowed to “not stand idly by while these companies hamper energy production and raise prices for Missouri consumers.” Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office said in a press release that he was “taking further action to stop work corporatists and their left-leaning allies in government from driving up energy costs for hardworking Hoosiers.” “Coal has been the backbone of Indiana’s economic success for decades,” Rokita said. “The demand for electricity has gone up and these (environmental, social and governance) titans are reaping the benefits of these skyrocketed prices by keeping their thumb on production.” And Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said she would keep “fighting until we take down every cog of the woke machine and protect hardworking families and farmers.” “While Woke Wall Street lines its own pockets,” Bird said, “families and farmers are forced to pay the price.” GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.

Title: U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Satoshi Nakamoto’s Stack, Now Holding ‘Mind-Blowing’ 1.1 Million BTC

After months of accumulating billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, the successful BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched earlier this year collectively hold more of the alpha crypto than its mysterious, pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. A chart posted on X (aka Twitter) on Dec. 6 by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shows that the 11 spot Bitcoin funds now trading on U.S. stock exchanges hold as much as 1,103,965 BTC as of Dec. 5. Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator (or creators) mined the first Bitcoin back in 2009 under the moniker Satoshi Nakamoto, and their true identity has remained a mystery. Satoshi is believed to have mined roughly 22,000 of the first blocks, which, when multiplied by the 50 BTC block reward at the time, gives 1.1 million BTC. “The US spot ETFs have just passed Satoshi in total Bitcoin held, now hold more than 1.1 million, more than anyone in the world, and they’re not even a year old yet, literally babies still. Mind-blowing,” Balchunas quipped. KING OF THE HILL: The US spot ETFs have just passed Satoshi in total bitcoin held, now hold more than 1.1m, more than anyone in the world, and they're not even a year old yet, literally babies still. Mind blowing. h/t @EdmondsonShaun for the data pic.twitter.com/FQBIGGz5ei The 11 ETFs’ unprecedented accumulation signals significant investor interest in Bitcoin exposure via highly regulated investment products, despite these red-hot vehicles only going live in the US market in January. The most prominent BTC ETF is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management. The IBIT recently topped 500,000 BTC (or over $50 billion) in AUM just as the price of the maiden cryptocurrency hit the $100,000 milestone for the first time on Wednesday. Notably, BlackRock boss Larry Fink conceded earlier this year that he was wrong about crypto and has changed his stance over the last five years. Spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT have played a huge role in bringing traditional institutional and retail investors into the crypto market. The data cited by Balchunas indicates that the cumulative ETF holdings now exceed those of crypto giant Binance by 41%. In addition, the ETFs hold roughly 62% more BTC than is held by software firm MicroStrategy — the world’s largest Bitcoin corporate holder. All in all, it is unlikely that Satoshi will ever move their 1.1 million BTC. As ZyCrypto previously reported, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently contended that the enigmatic Bitcoin originator is no longer alive.

Title: From Berkshire Hathaway to Blackstone, here's what Wall Street spends to keep CEOs safe

Wall Street firms spend a pretty penny on executive salaries and compensation, especially for those at the helm. In addition to pay packages often totaling tens of millions of dollars, most CEOs in the financial sector receive other benefits. Given the high-profile nature of their jobs, security details and systems, as well as private cars and planes, are often costs that major firms are willing to incur to keep executives safe. Here’s what some Wall Street giants are shelling out for their CEOs’ safety. Read more: Here’s how much Big Tech spends guarding its wealthiest CEOs JPMorgan Chase (JPM) paid around half a million dollars — $523,271 — on CEO Jamie Dimon’s security in 2023, including $362,226 for personal use of the company plane, $30,400 to use corporate cars, and $150,645 for the cost of residential, personal travel, and related security, according to the company’s 2024 proxy statement. The veteran CEO received $36 million in total compensation last year. Security expenses for BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink reached $780,350 last year. That included $216,837 for security personnel and $563,513 to upgrade his home security system, the company disclosed in regulatory filings. BlackRock said the added security measures were recommended by an independent, third-party study and supported by the board of directors. This was increased from 2022 amid growing backlash about the company’s diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) practices. Fink received $26.9 million in total compensation in 2023. Goldman Sachs (GS) paid $77,231 for personal car use and $29,990 for “personal security” for its CEO, David Solomon, totaling $107,221 in 2023. Solomon is expected to use the investment bank’s corporate aircraft, including for personal travel, for security reasons, Goldman said in its most recent proxy statement. He received $31 million in total compensation last year. In 2023, Blackstone (BX) spent $4,579,444 related to security services for CEO Stephen Schwarzman and members of his family, the company disclosed in its annual report. The firm said the sum was for its own benefit, and did not personally benefit Schwarzman. The CEO received $119.8 million in total compensation last year. A 2022 security assessment conducted by an independent security consultant found that Wells Fargo (WFC) CEO Charles Scharf “should avoid traveling by commercial ground transport or aircraft” for security purposes, the company said in its 2024 proxy statement. As a result, Wells paid $100,212 for Scharf’s personal use of the company aircraft and $3,454 for commuting using the company car in 2023. Additionally, the bank spent $81,264 on assessing and implementing residential physical and cyber security improvements and ongoing maintenance, of which $66,465 covered installation expenses, Wells disclosed. That added up to $251,395. Scharf received a $29 million pay package last year. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) provides personal and home security services for its CEO Warren Buffett. Last year, the cost for these services was $313,595. “Berkshire’s Board of Directors believe that in light of Mr. Buffett’s critical role as Berkshire’s CEO and given that Mr. Buffett spends a significant amount of his time while at home on Berkshire business matters that such costs represent bona fide business expenses,” the company said in its 2024 proxy statement. Unlike most other CEOs, Buffett does not rely on Berkshire-owned jets for personal use. Instead, he is a fractional NetJets owner, paying standard rates to access private jets for personal travel. He uses Berkshire aircraft for business purposes only, the Omaha-based conglomerate said. The 94-year-old received $413,595 in total compensation last year, which includes his longstanding annual salary of $100,000. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Reddit. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to Reddit. On December 4, Jay Jacobs, US Head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at BlackRock appeared on CNBC and discussed the significant growth potential for ETFs as we approach 2025, particularly in the context of the accelerating AI infrastructure phase. He noted that while AI adoption is still in its early stages, substantial investments, amounting to around $250 billion annually from major tech companies, are being made to enhance data centers and develop advanced chips. This investment is crucial for making AI more integrated into everyday life and business applications. Jacobs emphasized that the opportunity in AI extends beyond just mega-cap tech stocks; it encompasses a broader value chain that includes semiconductor and software companies. He mentioned specific ETFs like ARTY (an index-based artificial intelligence fund) and BAI (an actively managed fund) that aim to capture this growth. Additionally, he highlighted the increasing importance of cybersecurity as data becomes more valuable, suggesting that companies will invest more in protecting their data assets. This trend is reflected in ETFs such as IHAK, which focuses on cybersecurity firms benefiting from this heightened demand. Dave Nadig, an ETF expert and Financial Futurist, added insights on how AI will shape ETF investing by pointing to the infrastructure needs that arise from increased energy consumption driven by AI technologies and electric vehicles. He noted that companies involved in power generation and utilities are becoming increasingly relevant as they adapt to rising electricity demands. Both experts agreed on the critical role of physical infrastructure in supporting technological advancements, emphasizing that real-world resources like energy and materials are essential for the ongoing development of AI technologies. Dan Ives, Global Head of Technology Research at Wedbush Securities, also believes the tech market is set for significant growth driven by advancements in AI. He expects AI software companies to play a key role in this expansion, as he mentioned in a CNBC interview on November 25. We discussed this in our article about the 12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks To Invest In Under $10, here’s an excerpt from it: “…Ives believes that the consumption model in enterprise AI, driven by advancements from major chipmakers, will lead to underestimated growth rates of 15% to 20% for these software companies. We first sifted through Reddit threads to compile a list of the top AI stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A young adult family using a Camera to record moments of their daily life. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is a technology company known for popular products like Snapchat, Spectacles, and Bitmoji. Snapchat, in particular, uses AI to enhance user experiences. The company is also investing in GenAI to empower developers to create more sophisticated AR experiences. For instance, the introduction of AI-powered tools in Lens Studio enables developers to easily generate full 3D characters and animations. Additionally, its AI-powered chatbot, My AI, provides personalized responses and assistance to users, leading to increased user engagement, which is evident by the tripling of Snaps sent to My AI in Q3. The company had strong Q3 2024 financial results, with revenue improving by 15.28% year-over-year to $1.37 billion. This growth was primarily driven by a 16% increase in direct response advertising revenue, which also uses AI for ad targeting and optimization. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is enhancing user experience, and unlocking new opportunities for advertising and revenue generation through AI. RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: “Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP): SNAP was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting fourth quarter results generally in line with or better than expectations. Revenue growth of 5% was roughly in line with investor estimates and at the high end of guidance, and EBITDA of $159 million was $49 million better than estimates. Daily Active Users (DAUs) were also ahead of investor expectations, ending the quarter at 414 million (about 2 million better), driven by continued innovation in Snap’s offerings. Revenue guidance for 1Q24 was also roughly in line with investor estimates, but EBITDA guidance of negative $55-95 million was well below estimates. The company pointed to increased infrastructure costs and a US focused marketing campaign for the lower-than-expected margin guidance. Overall, SNAP ranks 3rd on our list of best AI stocks to buy according to Reddit. As we acknowledge the growth potential of SNAP, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNAP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 2024 saw crypto markets dramatically mature

2024 was a landmark year for the cryptocurrency market. It was a year when the market matured, barriers to the institutional investing world came down, and international regulations started to pave the way for digital currencies to enter the mainstream global financial system. With a President-elect keen on making the US a global crypto hub, the market experienced significant growth. As crypto adoption rose, more users turned to crypto platforms and ETFs to invest. 2024 was a transformative experience for the crypto market and the blockchain technology that powers it. The general public, buoyed by positive sentiment and rising crypto prices, has flocked to DeFi platforms to download their first wallet. Many of those new users have found their way to the highly trusted crypto brand Binance. It takes a leader to help an industry continue to mature and Binance CEO Richard Teng has taken on that role throughout 2024’s massive growth. Teng commented on his leadership and the future, “we have served in the best interests of our users since day one, leading the industry’s standard and continue building the future of the industry responsibly.” Binance accounts for approximately 50% of all trading volume globally. This number has only increased from Jan-Nov 2024. During the 2024 US Presidential election week, Binance captured $7.7 billion out of the $20 billion total inflows across all exchanges. Combine that with the leading crypto exchange reaching a new milestone surpassing 200 million users and safeguarding over $130 billion in user assets. So, these are exciting times for the crypto industry that come off the back of a lot of hard work in 2024. The highlights of the year included: In 2024, BlackRock launched its spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT, before bringing options to the table on November 19th 2024, and broke all the records on day one with 354,000 contracts traded and $1.9 billion in notional value. This was a landmark moment for the crypto industry, but it came at the end of a year of institutional investment. Pension funds, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds have worked hard into crypto this year as they try to take advantage of the growth potential and protect against problems with fiat currency. They follow on the heels of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Fidelity Investments, who all offer Bitcoin as part of their Wealth Management services. Institutional investment has curbed market volatility, and this year, Bitcoin emerged as one possible protection against inflation. New clarity with the regulations, improved custody solutions, and advanced risk management frameworks all gave the institutions the confidence to jump into crypto feet first in 2024. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is changing the world we live in and providing a real alternative to traditional banking. The world’s unbanked poor and privacy-obsessed High Net Worth Individuals alike have discovered the delights of downloading a crypto wallet and sending money with low fees and no questions. According to one recent study, the global DeFi market should be worth almost $440 Billion in 2030, up from just over $20 billion in 2023. We can now tokenize any asset, from real estate and fine art to cars and stocks, to create more liquidity without the help of a traditional bank. This is opening up new methods of borrowing, saving, lending, and earning interest that put the power in the hands of the people. Unbanked individuals around the world can have access to basic financial services, including sending and receiving money from friends or families, without huge fees. We are also seeing an ecosystem of liquidity pools and borrowing facilities open up that can change the world of finance. In the background, the Web3 technology that underpins the crypto market has found a home with DeFi platforms, as well as retail and e-commerce. Blockchain technology is now the foundation of supply chain management, healthcare providers, and numerous company processes. If the blockchain continues to take over corporate and public life, then the tokenized crypto ecosystem has to go with it. Retailers are increasingly relying on the blockchain, with Starbucks using it to trace their coffee from the farm to the cup and Nike tokenizing each pair of sneakers on its Swoosh platform for authenticity and traceability. In October 2023, Ferrari started accepting crypto payments for its high-end sportscars, joining the likes of Tesla, PayPal, Shopify, and Microsoft. This is a slow process, but crypto has slowly acquired the social proof it requires to break through with mainstream retailers. The blockchain that forms its foundations and is becoming such a mainstream hit was an unexpected bonus. Fragmented regulations that change from country to country are terrible for the crypto industry, and 2024 was the year it finally got its house in order. The Financial Stability Board, International Monetary Fund, and World Economic Forum helped guide disparate countries towards one set of standard practices for crypto taxation, Anti Money Laundering compliance, and consumer protection. A simple foundation of regulations that works across borders could work wonders for the industry. We’re not there yet, but we are getting closer. It isn’t just the political landscape that had to change to give the crypto market a shot at mass adoption. Real technical issues with the early blockchain systems kept them as a niche interest rather than an everyday occurrence. Blockchain congestion, slow transactions, high energy consumption, and scalability were all real issues. Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 solutions mean that Ethereum, the most ubiquitous blockchain by far when it comes to dApps and Web3 technology, is now much more scalable, with lower fees and less blockchain congestion. Solana and alternative blockchains like BNB Smart Chain also offer alternative solutions, with blockchain bridges seamlessly connecting the networks. AI integration has already changed the world of trading, analytics, risk management, and supply chain management. Artificial Intelligence has unlocked another level of performance from Web3 technology and automated complex processes that can streamline almost any company. These factors have all combined to create a market that is ready, willing, and waiting for mass adoption. Institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, cultural acceptance, and technical improvements have all helped the cryptocurrency industry go from a sideshow to a central player in 2024. We have not seen anything yet, and next year could be the biggest yet.

As spot Bitcoin ETFs surpassed Satoshi Nakamoto’s holdings Thursday, they were proven right. As of Thursday’s market close, spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively held 1,105,690 Bitcoin worth $110 billion, according to CoinGlass data. Issued by 10 asset managers in the U.S., the clutch of products began trading January 11, all except for Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust. As Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator (or creators), Nakamoto’s name looms largest in crypto circles. With an estimated 1.1 million Bitcoin held in wallets widely believed to be tied to the Bitcoin inventor(s), the milestone represented an eye-popping stat for ETF watchers, as much as it signaled the market’s maturation past crypto’s long-absent godfather. KING OF THE HILL: The US spot ETFs have just passed Satoshi in total bitcoin held, now hold more than 1.1m, more than anyone in the world, and they're not even a year old yet, literally babies still. Mind blowing. h/t @EdmondsonShaun for the data pic.twitter.com/FQBIGGz5ei — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 6, 2024 Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas described the development as “mind-blowing” on X (formerly known as Twitter), noting the products are “literal babies.” Indeed, the products’ holdings stampeded past that of Bitcoin’s creator, or creators, in less than a year. In a recent interview with Decrypt, Balchunas had estimated that the Wall Street products could overtake Nakamoto’s estimated holdings by Christmas. However, spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in $2.4 billion since Monday in concert with Bitcoin’s historic climb past $100,000 on Wednesday—perhaps an early gift to the BTC faithful. “It’d be a fitting cap on a storybook launch,” Balchunas told Decrypt Wednesday. “There has never been a launch like this [among ETFs], and there will never be another one.” Thursday’s development came more than 15 years following Bitcoin’s creation. And regardless of whether Nakamoto’s pseudonym corresponds to an individual or group, it has been established that Bitcoin’s namesake mined as many as 1.1 million Bitcoin in the project's first seven months. Nakamoto, who vanished from the public eye in 2011, billed Bitcoin as electronic cash that could flow without the need for financial intermediaries. In that sense, it is somewhat ironic that Wall Street’s most prestigious brands were central to Thursday’s milestone, and that they’ve apparently had such an impact on Bitcoin’s rising value all year long. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has dominated the nascent market for products making Bitcoin investments as frictionless as getting exposure to the S&P 500. On its own, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holds 521,000 Bitcoin worth $50 billion, according to CoinGlass. With Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator overtaken as of Thursday, spot Bitcoin ETFs are writing a new chapter in the asset’s history. From esoteric to enmeshed in mainstream finance, Bitcoin’s embrace on Wall Street is meanwhile just beginning.

Title: Mayor Eric Johnson Plays the Hits

Time Published: 2024-12-06T16:54:13Z

The annual State of the City addresses rarely make news. They’re mandated by the city charter, an opportunity for mayors to tout their achievements and highlight progress in the city. Mayor Eric Johnson’s address on Thursday didn’t go off script. He cruised through his favorite municipal talking points: parks growth, a four-year decline in violent crime, the property tax reduction in the unanimously approved budget, and all the infrastructure funding from this year’s bond package. The core of his speech was nearly identical to what he said one year ago; although this one was delivered from the horseshoe at City Hall, not broadcast over conservative radio station WBAP. The only news he delivered was his announcement of a “first-ever comprehensive public safety policy,” overseen by Councilmember Cara Mendelsohn and whoever winds up becoming the next police chief. Mendelsohn is the chair of the Public Safety Committee, but Johnson didn’t elaborate further other than saying it will “guide our next decade of decision-making with regard to public safety.” “I’m thrilled to share with all of you that the state of our city is stronger than ever,” he said. But that doesn’t mean Dallas doesn’t have some tricky matters to attend to. The few interesting parts of his speech dealt with the uncertainties Dallas presently faces, even if he didn’t present them as such. Two of the most important jobs in the city are vacant: city manager and police chief (interim leaders currently fill the spots). And then there’s the outcome of the recent election, in which voters approved changes to the city’s governing document. Now the city must waive its governmental immunity should residents file a lawsuit alleging its employees or elected officials aren’t following the charter or other laws. The other major change to the governing document requires Dallas to hire 900 police officers and retain a total of 4,000, which past mayors and police chiefs have said is an impossible task. The last four budgets have allocated enough money to hire another 250 officers per year, but the total remains stagnant because of attrition. “Dallas voters sent a resounding message to City Hall. Our residents told us loud and clear that they want more police officers on their streets and a city government that is more responsive, more accountable, and more transparent,” Mayor Johnson said. Moments later, he declared: “City Hall must listen.” He didn’t mention that Moody’s Investor Service had revised its outlook on the city’s debt service from “stable” to “negative” following the election (because hiring that many cops will wreak havoc on the budget). And while he praised the $520 million in bond dollars for streets, missing was the reality that borrowing huge amounts of money through bonds is really the only way we can afford to maintain our aging infrastructure. City staff has said we have $17 billion in “unmet needs” that will only get worse as our asphalt and concrete continue to degrade. That should dictate how we build and which developments we prioritize. Infrastructure liabilities are hardly unique to Dallas, but, as Johnson said, “well-kept streets are essential to a flourishing city.” Perhaps hope comes from the tax boost created by the financial service organizations moving to Dallas, such as Goldman Sachs and the BlackRock- and Citadel-backed Texas Stock Exchange. The real question is closer to the ground: reforming the parking code to be more friendly to small businesses, encouraging more types of housing near transit and in empty, old shopping centers, continuing to fix the yearslong permitting backlog (which did get a shout-out from Johnson and has improved). Much of the speech highlighted the city’s park building, from the high-dollar investments like the Halperin (deck) Park over Interstate 35 in Oak Cliff and the Harold Simmons Park abutting the Trinity River levees to the smaller-scale investments by the nonprofit Trust for Public Land. Now three-quarters of Dallas residents live within a 10-minute walk from a park. That’s up from 60 percent in 2017, when former Mayor Mike Rawlings signed a pledge promising to deliver greenspace a short walk from every person living in the city of Dallas. TPL is making good on its promise. And, yes, violent crime has dropped for the fourth year in a row, which lines up with former Police Chief Eddie García’s targeted violent crime plan and the surrounding public investments championed by Johnson aimed at eliminating blight. Dallas is at a critical juncture. The City Council needs to get the top cop and city manager hires right. (Interim City Manager Kim Tolbert is a finalist for the permanent job.) Council this year passed a land use plan that establishes a vision for the city that includes adding housing to push costs down; remember, the city’s population has essentially remained stagnant since at least 2018. The City Plan Commission is weighing reforming our parking code, which sounds dull but could be a catalyst for more small businesses to open all across the city. Parks and public safety are important components for livability, but so are housing prices, a healthy tax base, and the quiet, thankless, complicated policy matters that shape the Dallas we’ll have in the future. That work is still ongoing, beneath the surface of Johnson’s big-picture boosterism.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, has surged past the $4,000 mark, a level it last reached in March 2024, driven by strong demand for Ethereum ETFs. This rally represents a 65% increase in Ethereum’s price over the past month, following Donald Trump’s win as the 47th President of the US, and marks a sharp recovery after months of underperformance compared to Bitcoin. Institutional interest in Ethereum has been a key driver of this surge. Ethereum ETFs saw a record daily inflow of $428 million on Thursday. In the past seven days, Ethereum ETFs have accumulated over $1 billion in inflows, with $788 million coming from BlackRock alone, according to Farside Investors data. This wave of investment has propelled Ethereum’s market value to over $485 billion. The price movement triggered significant market activity, with $8 million in liquidations in a single hour and $11 million over four hours, CoinGlass data shows. This price action reflects the market’s optimism following Trump’s appointments this week of Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair and David Sacks as the crypto czar, both known as pro-crypto advocates.

Ethereum ETF inflows reached a new high while ETH struggled near $4k. Ethereum [ETH] ETFs have showcased commendable performance over the past few days. In fact, its netflows have once again reached a new high, reflecting high adoption and investors’ trust. Despite this, ETH has been struggling to cross the $4k barrier. Lookonchain’s recent tweet pointed out that in the past month, nine Ethereum ETFs have accelerated their holdings of ETH, totaling 362,474 ETH, which were worth over $1.42 billion. This marked a 4,363% increase compared to the previous month, during which only 8,121 ETH, worth over $31.8 million, were added. The better news was that the ETH ETFs inflows reached a high. As per Coinglass data, ETH ETF netflows have been on the rise for the past few weeks. On the 5th of December, netflows hit a whopping $428.5 million, setting a new record. Source: Coinglass Mentioning the market share, Grayscale ETF had the largest market share of 47%, as per Dune Analytics’ data. Grayscale was followed by Grayscale Mini and BlackRock, which had 13% and 12%, respectively. While Grayscale’s holdings touched $5.8 billion, BlackRock’s holdings stood at $2.9 billion. While Ethereum ETFs set a new record, ETH was getting rejected on multiple occasions near the $4k resistance. At press time, the king of altcoins was trading at $3,912.25 with a modest 1.3% price rise in the past 24 hours. Though the token was struggling to breach a barrier, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart suggested investors remain patient. As per the chart, ETH price was in the HOLD zone, meaning that the chances of the token marching upward in the coming days are high. Source: Coincodex In fact, a few other data sets also hinted at a similar possibility. According to Glassnode’s data, Ethereum’s NVT ratio registered a sharp decline. Whenever the metric drops, it means that an asset is undervalued, indicating that the chances of a price increase are high. The technical indicator Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved northward. This meant that buying activity was rising. A hike in buying pressure often results in price upticks. Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Notably, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar increasing trend. If ETH once again approaches the $4k resistance and is backed by strong buying pressure, then it won’t be ambitious to expect the token flipping the $4k resistance into its new support in the coming days.

Title: SolarZero collapse: What next for the industry?
URL: https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/solarzero-collapse-what-next-for-the-industry/K6Q22I55C5G3BOTAQCWKTY63XM/

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Insiders say the solar industry was already doing it tough and will face a backlash from the SolarZero collapse. But they add that, ironically, some of the factors that led to the collapse of the BlackRock-owned firm actually bode well for the sector. SolarZero’s November 27 liquidation continued a knock-back year for rooftop solar. In July, Vector said it would terminate its long-running “SunGenie” virtual power plant pilot, involving 243 Auckland households, after its Californian technology partner Sunverge went into liquidation. The lines company offered to take the solar panels, batteries and inverters, with participants also given options to buy the gear. SolarZero had about 15,500 customers - representing about 40% of NZ’s rooftop solar market - liquidators Russell Moore and Stephen Keen (both of Grant Thornton) said in their first report. Another sizable player, Lightforce Solar - which has carried out about 7000 commercial and residential rooftop solar installs, according to its owner and executive director John Harman - has also reduced its workforce. “We’ve got 90 staff. We had 120, we’ve removed 25% of our workforce over the last couple of years,” Harman told the Herald. Despite the belt-tightening, Harman said his firm was well-positioned to keep growing. Mike Casey, chief executive of pro-solar group Rewiring Aotearoa, said: “The best analogy I can make is that Kodak going bankrupt didn’t define the camera. SolarZero had a business model that had reached the end of its life”. He said the economics had become compelling as the price of the technology fell. A family home could now get a 5000 kilowatt system for about $5000. Casey said his Cromwell cherry orchard - which features all-electric machinery and vehicles - was generating rooftop solar at 12 cents per kilowatt hour next to 34 to 36c from the grid. His orchard would have its first full crop of about 90 tonnes this year, Casey said. He anticipated it would be profitable. “SolarZero was a finance company,” Harman said. “We’re vertically integrated.” Lightforce solar buys its panels and batteries from China. Customers own them after the install. “The price of solar panels has come down 25% per year for each of the past three years,” Harman said. The price of batteries had held up, but customers now got a lot more bang for their buck. The price crash - which the Financial Times recently pinned partly on tech gains, and a lot on Chinese over-production - had made it more attractive to buy your own kit rather than take on a 25-year SolarZero subscription, he said. SolarZero wasn’t tenable but rooftop solar is very tenable, said Harman, a breast and general surgeon who went into property development before founding Lightforce. Earlier this year, Lightforce Solar installed 957 panels on the roof of produce logistics firm Poulter Group’s Wiri ripening facility. “That’s a couple of huge cool stores that had a million-dollar a year power bill, and we’re taking $250,000 off that. They’ll have a four-year payback and then they’ll have free power for the next 20 years,” Harman told the Herald. Director Steve Poulter said his firm was still in the process of establishing how much it would save, but it would probably end up being 25%. The switch to solar had also been a pull for new customers. Regardless of his bullishness about commercial rooftop solar, Harman described the industry overall as “barely profitable” and soon after SolarZero’s collapse he took to LinkedIn to post: “The regulatory environment does not favour competition, does not support disruption of the energy market, does not support a favourable outside investor in the renewable sector NZ. “Politicians favour drilling or importing coal and gas. Individuals who invest in the green economy are at a disadvantage. “We urgently need... change.” What reform does he want? Harman later told the Herald he wasn’t interested in Australian-style subsidies (across the Tasman, the focus has recently switched from solar panels - which are now pervasive - to interest-free loans for batteries to store their output to be used during downtimes). Harman said in New Zealand it took about two months for a lines company to sign off on an install and facilitate a meter upgrade. “In Australia, it takes two days”. He wants red tape cut. SolarZero’s collapse could make the industry an easy target for some politicians - and on the subsidy side, Finance Minister Nicola Willis is at loggerheads with NZGIF - New Zealand Green Investment Finance - or at least still pressing the ‘green bank’ set up by the previous Government for better answers (more on which below). But Energy Minister Simeon Brown responded with specifics when the Herald put Harman’s call for regulatory change and red-tape cutting to him. Brown was not immediately able to provide a timeline for any of the below measures, which form something of a wish-list for home solar installers. “Reducing regulatory barriers and cutting through red tape to deliver affordable and secure electricity is a key part of our plan to rebuild the economy and double New Zealand’s supply of renewable electricity,” Brown said. The Government is delivering a number of changes to support greater uptake of solar, Brown said, including: Additionally, the energy competition task force led by the Electricity Authority and Commerce Commission is also investigating a further two actions to support the uptake of household solar panels and batteries, Brown said. The latter two moves could address a sore point for the solar industry: Buy-back rates, or what power companies will pay for rooftop solar owner’s surplus power. Buyback rates vary widely, depending on demand and other factors, but Casey said: “The wholesale market over the last five years has been close to 15 cents a kilowatt hour, and you still have a number of retailers gentailers paying south of 10 cents a kilowatt hour”. The Electricity Authority-funded Powerswitch tracks solar buybacks here. Overall, buyback rates are well below the level they were at before the wave of partial privatisations under John Key’s Government. “Solar energy will play a key role in New Zealand’s future energy system and support the transition to a low emissions economy, and these changes together will help make it cheaper and easier to install solar including rooftop solar installations,” Brown said. SolarZero’s model saw a household pay no money up front for a solar system, instead paying a monthly subscription - $177 per month was quoted for 12 to 14 panels for a household of four over a 25-year term that included one free battery upgrade. If a household’s solar was not enough, it could buy electricity from the grid via SolarZero’s partner, Genesis-owned Ecotricity. Veteran startup advisor and CFO Centre principal Ralph Shale speculates that if a SolarZero system with $20,000 was installed, the lenders would fund 70% or $14,000 with SolarZero funding the remaining $6000. SolarZero then sold the solar gear, and the monthly contracts - for a still-to-be-established sum - as securitised debt to one of two special-purpose vehicles, SPV1 or SPV2. SPV1 and SPV2 received the cashflow from the customer contracts. SPV2 split its revenues, with monthly customer fees going to the Customer Series and ancillary revenues to the Battery Series, the liquidators said. NZGIF was the primary beneficiary of the Battery Series. “NZGIF Solar Investments has oversight over the SPVs, as programme manager,” the liquidators’ report said. NZGIF Solar Investments was the vehicle for NZGIF’s $145m credit line ($115m of which was drawn down at the time of the liquidation), plus $90m (in 2023) and $130m (in 2024) from offshore investors. The liquidators are still establishing the full details and shape of the structure. Notably, Moore and Keen said they and their solicitors “intend to further investigate the companies entry into the securitisation”. But they have already established that it was busting at the seams. “The liquidators understand that SolarZero had underwritten certain aspects of the securitisation, resulting in unsustainable regular payments to the SPVs,” Moore and Keen wrote. After buying SolarZero for $110m in mid-2022 - from owners who included its founder (and a former Greenpeace director) Andrew Booth, Pencarrow and Sir Stephen Tindall’s K1W1), BlackRock tipped in additional capital of $147.5m, the liquidators say. (BlackRock has not released any figures.) “Of the $150m invested by Blackrock, maybe $53m is a cash investment in the special purpose vehicles,” says Shale told the Herald. “The rest must have covered two years of operating costs.” The BlackRock top-ups were required because SolarZero was losing money (the amount has yet to be specified). The liquidation came after the US owner turned off the tap. Shale adds, “If you look at the assets of SolarZero, the major ones are its $29.5m equity in the SPV and $59m in subordinate debt - they say this is non-cash”. He notes the unsecured claims include $24m in intercompany payables, which he guesses is to the SPV. A Thursday morning fact-finding meeting between NZGIF chairwoman Cecilia Tarrant and Finance Minister Nicola Willis and Climate Change Minister Simon Watts only threw up more questions. Shortly after the meeting, Willis said she still needed to know more about: “The failure of SolarZero raised questions about taxpayers’ money being used in this way and those are questions ministers will be giving consideration to,” Willis said. Willis had sought assurances about NZGIF’s other investments. These include solar farm start-up Lodestone Energy, to which it provided a $15m working capital facility in FY24. “This facility remains current,” a spokesman told the Herald. A full list of its investments has been posted online here. While its various SolarZero debt facilities have been easily the largest bits of business for the self-styled “green bank” (it is not a registered bank), NZGIF has also extended chunky credit lines to EV fleet leasing firm Carbn ($42.4m), United Kingdom firm Zenobe ($20m), which is doing work on electrification of businesses in NZ, solar farm firms Far North Solar Farm ($78m) and Lodestone Energy ($15m). And although a lot of NZGIF’s dealings have been with startups, it has also done business with established players including a $1.2m debit facility for Genesis Energy (“to help industry switch from fossil fuels”), a $10m mezzanine debt facility to NZ Post to co-finance $10m spent on electric vans and a $15m “green credit facility” to CentrePort for “accelerating projects to decarbonise Wellington’s port”. As she emerged from her meeting with Willis and Watts, Tarrant initially refused to comment, then said to Newstalk ZB’s Jason Walls: “We do feel very bad, as we all do, about the people who have lost their jobs, but we did not lend to SolarZero the company and we are not responsible for what the company has done”. Tarrant said: “Let’s step back a minute and understand that we did not lend to SolarZero itself. We lent on the receivables; the panels and batteries that were installed on people’s houses and those contracts. “Those customers are fine. They are now being serviced by Verofi as the standby servicer who has stepped in to take over from SolarZero.” The NZGIF debt was securitised and held by two special-purpose vehicles, both of which were taken over by the Public Trust shortly before the liquidation. The special purpose vehicles are not in liquidation. The first liquidators report says: “The Liquidators understand that SZL [SolarZero Limited] had underwritten certain aspects of the securitisation, resulting in unsustainable regular payments to the SPVs”. Later on Thursday, Tarrant added in a statement: “Our Shareholding Ministers rightly have questions about how this all happened, and so do we. The change in stance from SolarZero’s owner BlackRock came as a surprise to NZGIF and other lenders, and indeed appears to have caught SolarZero’s CEO off guard given recent public comments. “We are extremely frustrated by this outcome. NZGIF and other international lenders worked to support the growth of this business. BlackRock has not explained its sudden change in stance toward this company, which has severely impacted its staff, suppliers, contractors and partners. “Prior to early November we had no indication from the SolarZero board or BlackRock that the company did not have the support of its owner, which had been funding the ongoing operation of the group. “NZGIF takes an active role in monitoring and engaging with investee and client companies and it is fair to say we, along with staff, suppliers and customers, have been shocked by BlackRock’s decision to place the company in liquidation,” Tarrant said. An NZGIF spokesman said earlier that it had less than a day’s notice of BlackRock’s intent to liquidate. BlackRock had no comment on Tarrant’s remarks. The liquidators say they’ve “received expressions of interest from parties seeking to buy all or part of the SolarZero business. We are keeping an interested parties register and we are working to develop options for a possible sale with all other stakeholders”. Shale said the true level of interest could only be gauged once the liquidators opened the books for due diligence, with all of the costs that came with that. He said it was also possible that some of SolarZero’s intellectual property - such as the “virtual power plant” platform it developed to pour electricity back into the grid from multiple solar rooftops during the March 10 cold snap - could draw buyer interest.

Title: As BlackRock storms into the private credit arena, longtime players aren't worried about the space getting too crowded

Tens of billions poured into private credit funds in the third quarter — and then the world's largest asset manager joined the party. BlackRock's $12 billion announced acquisition of the private-credit pioneer HPS Investment Partners adds an 800-pound gorilla to a sector already full of similarly aggressive primates. The $11.5 trillion asset manager has not been shy about its ambitions in the private markets, and there are worries about too many dollars chasing too few deals. Other finance giants are trying to get in on the private-credit action, State Street is shopping around for a private-credit firm, and Citi has linked up with Apollo for a $25 billion credit fund. The Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek is forming a $7.5 billion private-credit platform. Many smaller asset managers and hedge funds have also launched funds in recent years. Despite everyone looking to get a part of Wall Street's hottest market, longtime private-credit players are not feeling crowded. Managers are focusing on how private credit is servicing certain parts of the market that are set to grow, such as mergers and acquisitions, or differentiating themselves from peers. "The market is proving that private credit has a reason to exist," Nicola Falcinelli, the deputy head of European private credit at Carlyle, said Thursday at Edelman Smithfield's annual investor summit in London. With M&A activity expected to tick up thanks to the reelection of Donald Trump, private-credit providers will be in demand to finance deals, executives said. "Private credit has done a really nice job of filling cracks in" the deal-financing market, Matthew Theodorakis, a cohead of European direct lending for Ares Management, said at the Edelman event. Falcinelli pointed to the "long-term trend of banks retrenching from financing M&A" as validation for the expansion of his sector. "There's healthy competition between capital markets and private credit" across different markets, he said. From some points of view, this competition has given a lifeline to companies that may not deserve it. April LaRusse of London's Insight Investment, which manages $665 billion across different vehicles, said the number of companies defaulting on their debt held steady in recent years despite interest rates rising. Typically, an interest-rate increase would squeeze troubled companies to the point that they're unable to pay their creditors. Instead, LaRusse said, there's plenty of capital willing to extend a lifeline. "High-yield companies have had money thrown at them by private-debt and -equity companies," she said. With the expansion of players in the lending space, there's more of a focus on putting money to work in the right opportunities, not just owning a broad swath of the market, said Putri Pascualy, a client-portfolio manager for private credit within Man Group's Varagon, a $11.8 billion private-credit firm the asset manager purchased last year. Managers will "differentiate through alpha, through credit selection," she said at an event at Man Group's London headquarters. For her, she said, "cash is king" when it comes to judging the quality of borrowers — she wants to see a decent amount of liquidity on companies' balance sheets. Additionally, despite the industry still being a very human-run space of finance, Pascualy said Man was setting itself apart with its artificial-intelligence tools. Blackstone similarly has used its AI tools to pitch insurers looking for private-credit options. Man uses these tools to scan credit documents and weed out human error, Pascualy said, adding that the firm was just at the beginning of seeing which parts of the process it could make more efficient. No matter what, though, she said, the firm and others will expand in the space. "The private-credit universe globally will continue to grow," she said. Jump to

Title: Goldman Sachs Quits Global Climate Coalition for Banks

Goldman Sachs said it has quit a sector coalition aimed at aligning bank lending and investment activities with global efforts to fight climate change, marking the latest high-profile departure of a U.S. financial firm from the group. The U.S. investment bank’s decision comes against a backdrop of pressure from some Republican politicians who have suggested that membership of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) could breach anti-trust rules. Goldman Sachs gave no explicit reason for its departure, but focused on its strategy for the future and a growing push by regulators to make sustainability efforts mandatory. “We have the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients. Goldman Sachs is also very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world,” it said in a statement on Friday. Banks joining the voluntary NZBA agree to align with the world’s aim of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, set targets to help get them there and publish progress on their efforts each year, something Goldman Sachs said it would continue to do. “We have made significant progress in recent years on the firm’s net zero goals and we look forward to making further progress, including by expanding to additional sectors in the coming months,” it said. “Our priorities remain to help our clients achieve their sustainability goals and to measure and report on our progress.” Earlier this year, a number of U.S. investors, including the fund management arm of Goldman Sachs, left a global coalition pushing companies to rein in climate-damaging emissions. Investors including BlackRock are currently being sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states over alleged violations of anti-trust law.

Title: Bitcoin hits record high—how much a $1,000 investment would be worth

Bitcoin hit a big milestone: On Wednesday night, the digital currency's price crossed the six-figure threshold for the first time. As of Friday morning, that number hovered around $99,000 according to CoinMetrics. Throughout the day on Thursday, though, the value rose as high as $103,844. Here's how much a $1,000 investment in bitcoin made one, five or 10 years ago would be worth based on the digital currency's Dec. 5 midmorning price of $101,564, according to CNBC calculations. Here's how that compares with the S&P 500 index, which is often viewed as a benchmark of the overall stock market. One potential reason behind the surge may be some of Wall Street's key institutions' embrace of bitcoin. Several large investment firms including Invesco, BlackRock and Fidelity Investments launched the first spot bitcoin exchange traded funds in January. Since an ETF tracks the price of an underlying asset or index, bitcoin ETFs provide a way to invest, and benefit from potential price movements, without owning the cryptocurrency itself. With the availability of bitcoin ETFs, a larger number of investors can gain access to bitcoin. And as demand rises, so does the price, Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council, told CNBC Make It on January 5. Bitcoin's value has fluctuated wildly over the past few years. The virtual currency hit an all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021, only to lose around 75% of its value following the collapse of FTX, the largest crypto exchange at the time, in November 2022. Since then, though, it has made a steady recovery and is up around 125% year over year, per CoinMetrics. While bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, all crypto isn't bitcoin. Experts warn against attempting to predict how other cryptocurrencies or meme coins may behave based on bitcoin's price movements. Cryptocurrencies are considered speculative assets and are prone to unexpected surges and drops in value. Unlike stocks, which represent partial ownership in a company, cryptocurrencies aren't backed by an underlying asset. That's why experts often warn against investing more than you're willing to lose. If you want to "try your luck" with crypto investing, consider opting for buying a bitcoin ETF through your brokerage account, James Royal, Bankrate's principal investing and wealth management analyst, told CNBC Make It in May. "The annual fees are reasonable, cheaper in most cases than actually buying the crypto yourself, and you're buying a coin that has the interest of institutional investors, so demand may remain robust," he said. If you feel you must have crypto in your portfolio, make it a small portion of your investments, Brian Vendig, president of MJP Wealth Advisors in Westport, Connecticut, told CNBC Make It in January. "I'd say 1% on the more conservative side, and no more than 5% of your total portfolio if you're a growth-focused investor," Vendig said. Want to make extra money outside of your day job?

WILMINGTON, DE - Investment giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Inc. has increased its holdings in Animalcare Group PLC, surpassing the 5% threshold that necessitates a regulatory notification. This move, as reported on December 5, 2024, brings BlackRock's total voting rights in the veterinary pharmaceuticals company to 8.29%. The notification, following the standard TR-1 format, was triggered by the acquisition of shares after a Secondary Public Offering (SPO) by Animalcare Group. As a result, BlackRock now directly holds 7.22% of the voting rights attached to shares, with an additional 1.07% obtained through financial instruments, specifically Contracts for Difference (CFDs). This totals 5,722,795 voting rights within the company. BlackRock's acquisition positions it as a significant shareholder in Animalcare Group, with the investment firm's voting power in the company now standing at a substantial 8.29%. The detailed breakdown of the holdings was completed on December 6, 2024, at BlackRock's regulatory office in London. The direct holdings are tied to shares identified by the ISIN code GB0032350695, while the financial instruments, which are cash-settled, provide BlackRock with the potential to acquire additional voting rights. Animalcare Group, headquartered in the UK, operates in the animal health market, providing veterinary pharmaceuticals and related services. BlackRock's increased stake in the company reflects a strategic investment decision, though the specific intentions behind the acquisition have not been disclosed. This notification is in compliance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules Chapter 5 (DTR5) of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

Manage your account By Simon Jessop and Virginia Furness LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it has quit a sector coalition aimed at aligning bank lending and investment activities with global efforts to fight climate change, becoming the most high-profile member to leave the group. The U.S. investment bank's decision comes against a backdrop of pressure from some Republican politicians who have suggested that membership of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) could breach anti-trust rules.

Goldman Sachs is also very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world," it said in a statement on Friday. While it remains unclear what will happen to U.S. rules around climate-related company disclosures under President-elect Donald Trump, many large U.S. firms including Goldman Sachs will have to disclose under European Union rules. Banks joining the voluntary NZBA agree to align with the world's aim of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, set targets to help get them there and publish progress on their efforts each year, something Goldman Sachs said it would continue to do. "We have made significant progress in recent years on the firm's net zero goals and we look forward to making further progress, including by expanding to additional sectors in the coming months," it said. "Our priorities remain to help our clients achieve their sustainability goals and to measure and report on our progress." A spokesperson for the NZBA declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The bank said in 2019 it would deliver $750 billion of sustainable financing by 2030, and noted it had reached about 75% of this target in its 2023 sustainability report. CEO David Solomon reiterated Goldman's commitment to the energy sector in this report, saying the bank will continue to finance and advise clients in the sector, as well as invest in decarbonisation technologies. "We need to do both. It’s not an or, it’s an and," he wrote. The bank said it would align its financing activities to support a net zero target by 2050 and has set interim targets to help clients reduce carbon emissions in the energy, power and automotive sectors.

Here's why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) should be on your short list of AI stocks. Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) has witnessed a tremendous increase in its market value in 2024 thanks to a remarkable surge of 313% in the company's stock price so far this year. The 20 analysts covering Palantir have a 12-month median price target of $38, which would be a 46% drop from current levels. If that does indeed happen, its valuation could drop big time in the coming year. The AI software stock's gains have outpaced those of Nvidia and Broadcom over the past two years. For many people, a Florida retirement sounds like the dream and the sunniest forecast possible for your hard-earned retirement savings. It allows them to escape the cold and snow they put up with for... Three million dollars sounds like the kind of money that lets you spend retirement sitting on the dock of your own boat, sipping mai tais (or coffee, if that's more of your thing). But a $3 million... Retiring early raises a series of questions around both income and spending. You will need to manage your portfolio for longer-term drawdowns, an early end to new earnings, and a long wait for Social Security to kick in. You will need to manage your spending around new needs, particularly health insurance, long-term care insurance and […] The post I'm 55 With a $2 Million Net Worth and $6k in Monthly Expenses. Can I Retire Now? appeared first on SmartReads by SmartAsset. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) has become one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street. For either of these two stocks to make you a millionaire by itself would require significant growth (although SoundHound would be more feasible). If Palantir did that, it would be worth $15.9 trillion. The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) has led many companies to urgently reassess their energy strategies. Last year, several countries endorsed the Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy to address these growing energy demands, pledging to increase their nuclear energy capacity by three times by 2050. With the global demand for nuclear power expected to grow long-term, here are three stocks to keep an eye on in this evolving landscape. Investors have been counting on a deregulatory surge in the health insurance business, but it might not be so simple in the wake of the fatal shooting of a UnitedHealth Group executive.

The ailing chipmaker issued a press release before markets opened on Monday saying that CEO Pat Gelsinger, who had run the company for nearly four years, retired effective Dec. 1, giving up both his full-time position and his board seat. The company appointed CFO David Zinsner and CEO of Intel Products Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs while it searches for a permanent replacement. Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) has made a name for itself in the increasingly crowded electric vehicle (EV) field with its limited vehicle lineup. Rivian's R1T is one of just a few electric pickup truck offerings. At 1:55 p.m. ET, Rivian shares still held on to a gain of 4.5%. Looking at history, there are some dominant companies today that have compounded shareholder capital in a remarkable fashion. In fact, here are three stocks that have turned a $1,000 initial investment into $1 million (or more). Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is first on this list. If you're trying to secure a stream of passive income to support your retirement dreams, there's more than one way to make it happen. Buying rental properties is an easy-to-understand option you're probably already familiar with. Unfortunately, owning rental properties comes with day-to-day responsibilities that most retirees would rather avoid.

Title: BTC ETF Options Launched: Markets Saw Record Activity
URL: https://zycrypto.com/btc-etf-options-launched-markets-saw-record-activity/
Time Published: 2024-12-06T10:07:44Z

The introduction of Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) options marked a milestone for cryptocurrency markets. These new instruments set records in trading volumes, drawing significant interest. Binance CEO Richard Teng, leader of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, explained the effects of options trading on crypto markets, “Options trading is poised to enhance liquidity in the crypto ecosystem by providing additional tools for hedging and speculation. Institutional players, who often seek sophisticated risk-management instruments, may find options particularly appealing. By offering new mechanisms to manage exposure, options trading could attract long-term capital, increasing market stability and broadening participation.” Bitcoin ETF options are derivative contracts linked to Bitcoin ETFs, allowing users to speculate on price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. For example, if you believe Bitcoin’s price will rise, you can buy a call option. That gives you the right to purchase the ETF at a set price within a specific period. Conversely, put options enable you to profit if the price falls. This approach furthers crypto as a mainstream option. BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust launched its ETF options on Nasdaq, with more than $2 billion in notional exposure recorded on the first day. This massive volume showcases the appeal of cryptocurrency options for traders. The ETF saw $4 billion in volume, outperforming many more traditional instruments. For context, a comparable product, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), only achieved $363 million in first-day trading when it launched in 2021. The IBIT’s performance signals increasing market confidence in Bitcoin-based assets and highlights the unique role of ETFs in providing diversified exposure. Bitcoin ETF options are a significant event for several reasons: While a retail holder might be somewhat hesitant to hold Bitcoin directly, they can now infuse indirectly using an ETF and manage their risk through options. Despite the successful launch, the market faces regulatory constraints. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) imposed a 25,000-contract limit on Bitcoin ETF options. This could impact liquidity and scalability for institutions. Other instruments enjoy more lenient rules. Such discrepancies could hinder the market’s evolution compared to more established assets like gold ETFs, which operate without similar restrictions. IBITs remarkable start points to significant potential for Bitcoin ETF options in the future. Many are drawn to the ETF’s blend of crypto exposure and traditional safeguards. The continued loosening of regulatory limits could unlock greater liquidity, making this market segment even more appealing. Even with the limits, Eric Balchunas, Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst, posted, “$1.9b is unheard of for Day one” on X. While IBIT options haven’t yet reached the scale of top ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), he expects this gap to narrow as trading activity accelerates. Crypto adherents considering Bitcoin ETF options will benefit from versatility: For example, a cautious trader can purchase a put option as insurance against sudden Bitcoin price drops, mitigating potential losses. Yet, options allow users to capture the upside to Bitcoin growth without holding cryptocurrency directly. The launch of Bitcoin ETF options is a big step in crypto’s journey toward mainstream acceptance. With record-breaking activity and growing institutional participation, these instruments offer a blend of accessibility and security wrapped in a familiar type of vehicle. Bitcoin ETFs demonstrate how the crypto market is changing and support increasingly complex tactics that institutional players want. As Bitcoin continues to evolve and become a part of diversified portfolios, products like IBIT options are playing an increasing role in shaping the future of markets.

Title: Singapore's Temasek forms $7.5 billion private debt platform

Time Published: 2024-12-06T08:54:00Z

SINGAPORE — Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings Pte has set up a private credit platform with an initial portfolio of about S$10 billion (US$7.5 billion) in a bid to seize more opportunities in the burgeoning asset class. The portfolio will consist of direct investments and credit funds, Temasek said in a statement Friday. The wholly owned platform will be managed by a team of around 15 in New York, London and Singapore transferred from Temasek's Credit & Hybrid Solutions team. Temasek joins other major investors that have piled into the roughly $2 trillion sector, despite growing voices of concern about risks due to interest-rate cuts and overcrowding. BlackRock Inc, the world's biggest asset manager, this month agreed to buy private credit firm HPS Investment Partners for about $12 billion. Temasek's total portfolio was valued at S$389 billion as of end-March, with just over half being in private assets. A spokesperson said that the new platform’s portfolio will be drawn from its existing investments in private equity and credit funds and other private companies — two categories that make up 55% of its S$202 billion in unlisted assets. The firm does not provide an exact breakdown of its exposure to private credit. The platform will be led by Nicolas Debetencourt, who has been Temasek's head of credit and hybrid solutions since 2016. It will be separate from Temasek-owned Seviora Group, which includes SeaTown Holdings International. The latter said in August it raised $1.3 billion for its second private credit fund, bringing its assets under management to over $2.5 billion.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) stands against other best affordable stocks to buy. There has been a growing debate regarding whether the economy of the United States will have a soft landing. A recent report by Vanguard titled “Beyond Landing” released on November 25 discusses the economic outlook for the year ahead. The report highlighted that global inflation has significantly decreased over the past two years, nearing the target of 2%. However, this decline has been inconsistent across different regions, with many developed markets experiencing slowdowns due to monetary policy adjustments. The United States stands out as an exception, showcasing robust economic growth and full employment despite restrictive monetary policies. READ ALSO: 10 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready To Explode and 10 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Now. The report raised critical questions about whether the US has achieved a "soft landing" or if high interest rates will eventually lead to a "hard landing." The narrative has largely focused on the Federal Reserve's ability to time rate cuts effectively to facilitate painless disinflation. Vanguard suggests that the strong growth and falling inflation in the US may be better explained by supply-side dynamics, such as increased labor productivity and a surge in available labor, rather than solely by Federal Reserve policies. Regarding the 2025 outlook, the firm anticipates that US real GDP growth may decline from around 3% to closer to 2%, influenced by potential policy risks like trade tariffs and stricter immigration regulations. Core inflation is expected to remain above 2.5% for most of 2025. The firm also predicts that interest rates will stabilize at levels higher than those seen during the 2010s, fostering better returns in cash and fixed-income markets over the next decade. However, they express caution regarding equity markets due to elevated valuations. The report highlights a tension between momentum and valuation in risk assets, suggesting that while some stocks may continue to perform well, their high valuations could pose risks if economic conditions change unexpectedly. A line of cable boxes and modern televisions, representing the company's video services. To compile the list of the 12 best affordable stocks to buy right now, we used the Finviz stock screener, Yahoo Finance, and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we shortlisted stocks trading below a Forward P/E of 15, as of December 4, and that are expected to experience earnings growth this year. Next, we sorted our initial list by market capitalization and cross-checked the Forward P/E of each stock from Seeking Alpha and earnings growth from Yahoo Finance. Lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as per Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Forward P/E Ratio: 11.72 Earnings Growth This Year: 12.98% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61 Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) is a major telecommunications company in the United States that provides a variety of communication services, primarily under its Spectrum brand. These services include high-speed internet, television cable services, mobile services, and voice services for both commercial and residential usage. While the company serves more than 37.1 million customers in 41 states around the United States, it has been facing difficulty in retaining cable TV customers. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company lost around 9.5% of its video customers as compared to the year before. Two major factors have been affecting its customer base; the first being the general trend towards rising streaming services leading customers to let go of their wired cable providers. Secondly, the ending of FCC’s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) in the second quarter resulted in around 110,000 customers leaving the company. Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) has been working towards fighting this challenge. It announced to provide its TV Select Video customers with streaming subscriptions of up to $80 per month along with the launch of a “seamless entertainment” program, which will include Disney+, Peacock, Max, ESPN+, Paramount+, BET+, ViX, AMC+, Discovery+, and Tennis Channel Plus. During the third quarter, Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) increased its revenue by 1.6% year-over-year, driven by an addition of 545,000 total mobile lines. It is also working with the local and state governments to bring Spectrum Internet to underserved communities and activated around 114,000 subsidized rural passes during the quarter. It is one of the 12 best affordable stocks to buy right now. Weitz Large Cap Equity Fund stated the following regarding Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We trimmed the Fund’s positions in Meta Platforms, S&P Global, and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) after significant runs in the stocks. Charter posted better-than-feared quarterly results, and the stock rebounded sharply from what we viewed as deeply oversold levels. A good start, but they still have much work to do. As always, our goal with trims is to re-calibrate position sizes to better reflect the Fund’s current opportunity set.” Overall, CHTR ranks 12th on our list of best affordable stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of CHTR to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CHTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

They are Irish hospitality royalty, the third generation of the Fitzpatrick family to own and run the well-known 113-bedroom property, even if they don’t have the surname. The four-star hotel was opened by their grandparents Paddy and Eithne Fitzpatrick in 1971, and then run by their mother, Eithne Fitzpatrick Scott-Lennon, from 2002 until she sold the business in February to her sons, both of whom are in their 30s. Mark has been general manager of the Killiney property for the past 10 years, while Joseph cut his teeth in the industry abroad, including stints in New York, Dubai and the Caribbean. Their uncle John Fitzpatrick operates two high-profile four-star hotels in prime locations in Manhattan, New York, under the family name. “Mum wanted to retire and spend more time with Dad,” says Mark of the generational shift. “She’d been through a couple of recessions, Covid and had to weather various other storms. She’s enjoying her retirement. Joseph had come back [in late 2021] having travelled for a number of years and we were all in the business. It just felt like the right time.” On the announcement of their takeover of the business, the brothers outlined plans for a €10 million investment programme over five years under the umbrella of the newly branded Fitzpatrick Hotel Collection, to include acquisitions. In August they unveiled their first deal with the purchase of the Woodenbridge Hotel & Lodge near Arklow in Co Wicklow. The property overlooks Woodenbridge Golf Club and Aughrim river, has 69 bedrooms, a large private function room, a separate dining area that holds 50 guests and a bistro bar that can cater for 150 customers. The price wasn’t disclosed but it was a single-digit million figure, as part of the €10 million investment plan. Why did they choose Woodenbridge as their first acquisition? “The heritage of it being the oldest hotel in Ireland, family run and it had a good reputation in its community,” says Mark. “It felt right and the proximity to here in terms of shared services, travelling between the two hotels [55 minutes by car] and not wasting too much time.” Woodenbridge is a three-star property - “something we might look at in the future to bring it to four-star”. [ New generation takes the reins at Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel in KillineyOpens in new window ] It was financed with funding from Relm, a nonbank lender, and an equity investor who prefers to remain under the radar. “We will be investing in the aesthetics of it,” says Joe. “There’s planning permission for 40 rooms for the next three years. Whether we execute on that, we’re not sure. “The town of Arklow is expanding massively. A new waste-water plant means there will be planning for thousands of new houses so the catchment area becomes much larger. There’s also a greenway [from Arklow to Shillegagh] to go through the property that will bring significant tourism.” At Killiney, there have been some subtle tweaks to the business model. Padel courts (a racket sport with Mexican origins that has become hugely popular in Ireland) have been built on the grounds at a cost of €75,000 per court, while an outdoor terrace has also been added opposite the main entrance. “The padel courts are a nice new addition,” says Mark. The brothers are aiming for “comfortable elegance” at Killiney Castle, a popular venue in south Co Dublin for weddings and family celebrations, as well as corporate functions. “We pride ourselves as being a home away from home. We don’t see ourselves as being a slick, downtown hotel with not a lot of repeat visitors. It’s a huge special-occasions hotel and we’ve all manner of guests from corporates down to people staying for a couple nights a week. We try and make people feel at home and allow the staff to show their personality.” Killiney Castle has 165 employees, many of them with long service. Some 3-4 per cent of turnover every year is spent on refreshing the property, parts of which date from 1740. It also has meeting room and function facilities, a 20m swimming pool, sauna, steam room and gym. The fitness centre has 1,500 local members, providing some diversification to the hotel’s traditional income streams. Annual turnover in Killiney is €9 million-€10 million a year, with profits of €1.2 million-€1.4 million. So who’s the boss in this sibling partnership? “Ha ha, it’s a pretty flexible partnership,” says Joe. “We have different strengths. Mark is really strong on financial and I’m probably more operational. With the two properties, we work on those two together and are always on the phone to each other.” Formally, Mark is managing director of Fitzpatrick Castle while Joe has the same title in Woodenbridge. In reality they work across both sites. The brothers are tall, trim and neatly dressed. They carry the air of people who have worked in hotel management for years: softly spoken, friendly and patient with tricky guests. A new government has yet to to be formed following last week’s election but it will have a familiar look, with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael set to return. Both made promises to cut costs for SMEs and the hospitality sector in their election manifestos, with Fine Gael pledging to cut the industry’s VAT rate to 11 per cent from the current 13.5 per cent. A reduction would be welcomed by the brothers. “We are the second- or third-highest rate of VAT for tourism in Europe,” says Mark. “With rising costs, it’s harder to make a profit than in recent years, as it’s coming at you from every angle. It would be a nice pressure release valve.” If you charge €400 for someone to come stay here, they are immediately pissed off coming in the door. We want the return guest He rattles off some of the fixed costs that have to be paid before a euro is earned from a guest: the minimum wage increase will cost €105,000 in additional payroll costs; its annual rates bill is a similar figure; it pays €160,000 in insurance; spends €450,000 a year on refurbishment; and €180,000 on utilities. “These are huge costs and it’s why a coffee in the lobby is €4.20. We’d love to do better but it’s difficult.” Before the VAT rate returned to 13.5 per cent last year from the special rate of 9 per cent, the hotel sector had faced accusations of price gouging from some politicians, particularly at peak times, when dynamic pricing was employed to price rooms for events such as Taylor Swift concerts. According to the brothers, a standard double room at Fitzpatrick Castle will usually cost about €169 per night, with breakfast. It might drop to €129 on certain quiet nights. Tour groups would generally getter better rates. “For a standard room, the highest we charge would be about €280,” says Mark. “We made a decision coming out of Covid that we wanted to be in the middle of the market on pricing. If you charge €400 for someone to come stay here, they are immediately pissed off coming in the door. We want the return guest.” Of course, the Killiney hotel is about 18km from the city centre, so it’s not an obvious place for lodgings if attending a concert in Croke Park, the 3Arena or the Aviva. That said, Mark notes that the industry isn’t alone in applying dynamic pricing, where peak nights attract a higher cost compared with quieter times of the year. “Hotels get a bad shake, to be honest. There are no articles about what Ryanair is charging for the Rome Six Nations game [on St Patrick’s holiday weekend] in March.” They would also like to see the Dublin Airport passenger cap scrapped by the new Coalition. “Why are we capping the number of visitors coming to the country? It doesn’t make sense to me,” says Mark. [ Closure orders: Rodent droppings and grime found in kitchens at Fitzpatrick’s Castle Hotel, KillineyOpens in new window ] While the brothers have had a busy year, with largely positive trading, Fitzpatrick Castle made the headlines for all the wrong reasons in May, when it emerged that the Food Safety Authority had issued it with a closure order on April 15th for three kitchens at the venue after rodent droppings, grime and stagnant water were noted by inspectors. The closure applied for 36 hours and rocked the family. “It was really horrible,” says Mark. “We’ve talked about all the pride in our grandad, our mum and our uncle. You feel like you’ve massively let that down. It was an oversight; there wasn’t enough record keeping. We have put our hands up and say we were under pressure in the kitchen and didn’t keep the required records.” “You have to tackle it head on,” says Joe, noting that a “huge amount” of staff training has since taken place, and an external food safety company was hired to conduct kitchen audits. The brothers say they received a huge volume of supportive messages from people who had used the venue over many years. But there was also a significant financial impact from cancelled bookings. They “conservatively” estimate that it cost the business €250,000 in lost income. “You can understand that, particularly in the days afterwards,” says Joe. “People who had booked large dinners wanted to support us but if you have five people [in the group] who are unhappy or a committee that’s unhappy, it’s out of their control. You have to take that ... it’s human nature.” “All you can do is try and restore people’s faith in you and hopefully we have enough credit in the bank with 53 years in business that we are able to lean on that,” says Mark. Are they confident something like this will never happen again? “Yes,” says Mark, firmly. “There are learning lessons in going around with the health inspector and seeing the errors that were there. To live through those couple of days and feel the disappointment personally and the embarrassment for our family is something that you don’t forget quickly. It won’t happen again.” On the outlook, Mark says prospects for next year are “good” although the rate of growth has softened following the strong post-Covid rebound to a “more natural level, which will likely continue”. “We hope to grow our occupancy next year [from the current 72 per cent level]. All the indicators are positive at the moment,” he says. We looked at Kilkenny ... we’ll be pretty open-minded. We’d look at management contracts Back to this month and they have the busy Christmas period to navigate, with no room left at the inn for December 25th itself, with mostly Irish people happy for someone else to do the cooking and washing up. “The bedrooms will be full and we’ll have 160-170 for lunch,” says Mark. “We have a waiting list for Christmas lunch. Last year we had two or three tables that were American families, who decided they wanted to be in Ireland because of their heritage.” Regular room packages cost €550-€600, including breakfast and lunch. Just lunch is priced at €170 per person. Santa comes for breakfast and there’s a Champagne reception in the lobby before lunch with sandwiches in the evening. “It’s a day when everyone has a smile on their face,” says Joe. Ultimately, the brothers would like to have five properties in their collection, each with its own individual personality. “Nothing too stuffy. We don’t want five hotels with 100 rooms and a pool that are all the same,” says Joe. For now, the focus is on the Greater Dublin Area but that might change, Joe adds. “We looked at Kilkenny ... we’ll be pretty open-minded. We’d look at management contracts. We are young and ambitious but not stupid enough to pigeonhole ourselves. It has to excite. “Our grandad was a great inspiration for us. He had a group with five hotels. We want to emulate that, own multiple properties and leave a mark in Irish hospitality. It will be an exciting journey.” Job Managing director, Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel Age 37 Lives Blackrock, Dublin Something we might expect Did a master’s in hospitality at DIT Cathal Brugha Street from 2011 to 2013.

The Canadian government utterly despises the Canadian people. According to a report out at Fox News today, Justin Trudeau’s government just took dictatorial action to outlaw hundreds of firearms, adding them to the growing list of what the Canadian people are not allowed to have, despite a God-given right to self defense. And, in what should be a shockingly paradoxical turn of events: Leaders in Canada also said that they are working with the government of Ukraine to see how the guns can be donated to support the fight against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. For Trudeau and his progressive parliament sees it, the fight in Ukraine is all about defeating tyranny—and they arrived at the logical conclusion that defeating tyranny means arming the resisters. Conservatives would agree, surviving tyrants equates to personal gun ownership; like John Rich said, “The ability to have armed resistance to an oppressor is a prerequisite for liberty.” As you might recall, hard-left Democrat mouthpiece George Takei once unwittingly made one of the greatest arguments for the Second Amendment, or a people’s right to keep and bear arms: Crazy thought, but those 20 million AR-15s now in this country could sure arm a lot of Ukrainians. — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) June 7, 2022 Yet, they fail to recognize the unbelievable irony. Some might argue that the weapons would go to the Ukrainian military…but who fills the ranks? From NPR last month: Ukraine’s military desperately needs more boots on the ground. Draft eligibility for men spans age 25 to 60. There are reports of raids on bars and restaurants trying to catch draft dodgers. And now the government has announced plans to conscript more than 160,000 Ukrainians. Many Ukrainian citizens who started the war in the military are either injured or dead, which is why Volodomyr Zelenskyy is conscripting men as young as 25 and as old as 60, to “replenish [a] huge troop shortfall”. Trudeau is disarming his own tyrannized Canadian civilians… to arm Ukrainian civilians to fight “tyranny” — but who’s the real tyrant of this historical conflict? I’m not claiming that ex-KGB agent Vladimir Putin is some champion of freedom and God-given rights, I’m just saying that between the two sides and I had to pick? I’d definitely opt for the aggressive nationalist with zero tolerance for pedophiles and jihadism over the guy that’s selling his country to BlackRock, staunchly supports the progressive LGBTQ++ and abortion agendas, and sends young men to get devoured in the battlefield meat grinder all so he can maintain a flow of cash from Washington D.C. If they’re both bad guys, one is certainly worse—and he’s got a friend in Canada’s Trudeau. Image: DonkeyHotey, CC BY 2.0, via Flickr, unaltered.

Title: Why Is The Clorox Company (CLX) Among the Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Invest In Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) stands against the other dividend stocks. Stocks that pay dividends, especially those backed by strong financial health and attractive yields, offer investors a reliable income stream, protection during market declines, and the potential for steady investment growth. This year, investors have faced a dilemma: stick with their current strategies or shift focus toward the leading technology stocks driving much of the market's gains. At the same time, many are considering how best to prepare their portfolios for a potential economic slowdown, given uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's ability to achieve a soft landing. Analysts recommend incorporating dividend stocks into portfolios to better navigate these conditions. Also read: 8 Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Now Savita Subramanian, an equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Corp., also advised investors to load up on dividend stocks. Here is what the analyst said: “You want to be in safe dividends — and I know this is the most boring call of all time, but sometimes boring is good. We believe that we are now in a total return world in which the contribution of dividends to total market returns could be significantly higher than it was in the last decade, a period marked by falling cash yields and lofty price returns. We advise investors to seek out companies with above-market and secure (not stretched) dividend yields.” Investors have shown growing interest in companies that consistently increase their dividends. This has pushed many firms to prioritize maintaining and growing dividends, even during economic challenges. Such efforts have paid off, as companies with a history of dividend growth have delivered strong long-term returns. A report by Cohen & Steers highlighted this trend, noting that between 2000 and 2010, dividend-paying companies outperformed non-payers by an annual margin of 620 basis points while exhibiting significantly lower risk, as measured by standard deviation. Over a 30-year span ending in 2011, the benefits of dividend-paying firms were even more evident. Among these, companies that initiated or raised dividends within the prior year consistently outperformed both other dividend payers and non-payers, achieving higher returns with reduced volatility. In addition to offering strong returns, stocks with consistent dividend payouts have become a vital source of personal income. Research from S&P Dow Jones Indices revealed that dividends have steadily grown as a share of personal income over the last four decades. Since Q4 1980, the contribution of dividends to personal income has risen from 2.68% to 7.88% in Q2 2024, while income from interest has declined from 14.58% to 7.61% during the same period. The report also highlighted the impressive growth of dividends among companies in the U.S. Dividend Growers Index. Over the past 15 years, these companies have achieved an average annual dividend growth rate of 13.71%, significantly outpacing the 2.21% average annual growth rate of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the same period. Dividend stocks are bound to regain their prominence, even though the tech sector has been dominating the spotlight lately. In view of this, we will discuss some of the best consistent dividend stocks to buy. Our Methodology: We compiled this list by examining Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database and identifying companies that have consistently increased their dividends for a minimum of 15 consecutive years. From this pool, we specifically chose stocks with dividend yields of at least 1% as of December 4. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A team of professionals prepping for a training seminar, using professional cleaning products produced by the company. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41 The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) is a California-based company that manufactures a wide range of consumer and professional products. The company has faced significant challenges in recent years. The pandemic initially boosted sales as demand for cleaning products surged, but it overestimated the long-term shift in consumer behavior toward heightened hygiene. This miscalculation left Clorox overcommitted once pandemic restrictions eased. Adding to its troubles, the company suffered a cyberattack in 2023. Despite these setbacks, it has reported that its supply chain is now fully restored, along with most of the market share lost during the disruption. Since the start of 2024, the stock has surged by nearly 3%. In fiscal Q1 2025, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) reported a 27% YoY growth in its revenue at $1.76 billion. The company marked its eighth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, driven by solid cost-saving measures, and remains on track to fully restore its gross margin by fiscal year 2025. It also finalized the divestiture of its Better Health VMS business, building on the earlier sale of its Argentina operations. These actions align with the company's strategy to streamline its portfolio, reduce volatility, accelerate sales growth, and enhance its structural margin performance. In the first nine months of its fiscal year, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) reported an operating cash flow of $221 million, which showed a 1,005% growth from the same period last year. The company's quarterly dividend currently comes in at $1.22 per share for a dividend yield of 2.92%, as of December 3. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) grew to 41 in Q3 2024, from 38 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $1.66 billion. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall CLX ranks 9th on our list of the best consistent dividend stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of CLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. During an appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box Europe, Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, discussed the outlook for the artificial intelligence industry and regulation in the United States with Donald Trump set to become president. When asked if there is a bit of a gold rush regarding AI, Calkins agreed. He said that AI comes with significant concerns, particularly among CEOs. This is because AI has the potential to embarrass organizations or compromise sensitive data, which creates hesitation. “We are all looking for a safe way to take the first step with AI,” he said. READ NOW: 15 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines Regarding whether companies are panicking about using AI profitably, Calkins observed a cautious approach from most businesses, while large tech firms have been investing aggressively. “It’s a calculated risk, and they should be doing it,” he said, contrasting this with the restraint shown by smaller companies. Talking about regulation, Calkins revealed that the bottom line is that AI can be somewhat dangerous if misused, which underscores the importance of regulatory frameworks. He referenced the European AI Act as an example, explaining that regulation could focus on restricting how AI is used or limiting the types of data it can access. With the Trump administration coming in, Calkins predicted a strong focus on competing with China in the tech space. He also mentioned Elon Musk’s influence on Trump, stating that Musk’s influence on the Trump administration is positive because he knows deeply about artificial intelligence.
