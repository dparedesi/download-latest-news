Most people imagine Wall Street careers beginning in familiar ways: internships at major banks, economics coursework, and early exposure to markets. But some of the young professionals on Business Insider's 2025 Rising Stars of Wall Street list started out somewhere entirely different, long before entering finance. One hoped to be a professional football player. Another was a collegiate golf champion with a goal of playing on all seven continents. A third conducted anthropology fieldwork in Sierra Leone. And another began in a chemistry lab before deciding research wasn't the right fit. We're looking back at this year's cohort, focusing on those whose formative professional years were spent far from trading floors and deal teams. Today, this group has gone on to find success across a spectrum of industry niches from investment banking and private equity to hedge funds and quantitative investing. Below, we're showcasing seven Rising Stars who switched careers, and how those beginnings helped steer their professional climb at firms like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and more. Their backgrounds are organized alphabetically by their last name. Lamar Cardinez, Blue Owl Before he ever worked in finance, Cardinez thought he'd play professional football. When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy. He thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance. After earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams. Cardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves. Catherine Kress, BlackRock Kress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making. Kress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a "dream job." She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute. But she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the "culmination" of her career, offering "unparalleled exposure" to global policymakers and business leaders. Jack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase Levendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron. In that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions. Josef Menasche, Goldman Sachs Menasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries. Today, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' private capital and liquidity solutions group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions. Aman Mittal, Moelis Mittal began his career studying electronics and communications engineering in India before joining Bain & Company as an analyst in its technology, media, and telecom practice. He later moved into digital-infrastructure advisory work and, at Moelis, has worked on more than 15 data-center-related transactions totaling more than $25 billion in value. His recent mandates include Apollo's acquisition of Stream Data Centers. And he helped Prime Data Centers, another platform in the space, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake to the institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen. Nikunj Jain, Bridgewater Jain studied machine learning, taught undergraduate math, interned at Apple in machine learning engineering, and worked for the Department of Defense before joining Bridgewater, where he's now head of Asia research. After graduating from UC Berkeley in two and a half years, he pursued quantitative finance after a friend suggested it. He said he found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked" — a description he's shaken off by running a 15- to 20-person team synthesizing regional activity into trading signals at the giant hedge fund. Jackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley Before joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she told Business Insider. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas." So she made the pivot to Wall Street. After holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks. Golf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents. Jump to

Title: Who are the frontrunners for the top Fed job?
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g907zekllo
Time Published: 2025-12-23T06:01:14Z
Full Content:
The high-stakes search for a new leader of the US central bank is drawing to a close. US President Donald Trump is expected to name someone in the coming weeks to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as Federal Reserve chairman will end in May. That person will step into the role at a tricky moment. The bank is contending with both political pressure and internal disagreement about how it should set interest rates in the months ahead. Credibility concerns could make the job even harder. Trump has made clear he wants lower borrowing costs and put unusual pressure on the Fed, raising questions about whether whoever wins the post will act independently. Trump's nominee would then go to the Senate for confirmation. Here's what to know about the frontrunners. Kevin Hassett, a long-time conservative economist and key Trump economic adviser, is seen as a top contender to succeed Powell. A Trump loyalist, Hassett, 63, served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Trump's first term and now leads the National Economic Council. His odds of clinching the role have dropped since early December, but Wall Street traders still deem him the most likely choice. Hassett has been a stalwart defender of Trump's economic policies, downplaying data showing signs of weakness in the US economy and repeating allegations of bias at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. His allegiance to the president has drawn questions from analysts about whether he would act independently at the Fed and how much sway he would have with other members of the board. In a research note, Deutsche Bank economists wrote that Hassett might struggle, at least initially, to convince other policymakers to put aside concerns about inflation and cut rates meaningfully. "Other officials might be sceptical of forward-looking arguments that rely heavily on the administration's policies bringing inflation closer to target," they wrote. Even some within the Trump administration have reportedly questioned whether Hassett has the skills needed to effectively take the helm of the central bank. Hassett addressed those questions in a CNBC interview this month, saying that the Fed's independence was "really, really important", while reiterating that interest rates still had room to fall. "The way you've got to drive interest-rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data," he said. Kevin Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, has re-emerged in recent weeks as another potential pick. The 55 year-old economist, a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution who serves on the board of UPS, had also been considered for Fed chair during Trump's first term. He briefly overtook Hassett in prediction markets this month before falling back to second place. "I think the two Kevins are great," Trump told the Wall Street Journal this month. Warsh has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet. He has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job this year, calling for "regime change". Warsh had a relatively "hawkish" reputation as Fed governor, meaning that he tended to favour higher interest rates and focused on concerns about inflation. But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued that the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned that logic. "He thinks you have to lower interest rates," Trump told the Journal. "And so does everybody else that I've talked to." Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a longtime Trump donor and ally. Christopher Waller, a current Fed governor, recently met with Trump for an interview, boosting his chances for the job in prediction markets. He was nominated to the Fed's board by Trump in 2020 and has recently stressed that the Fed has room to lower interest rates even further. Waller, 66, lacks the personal ties that could help propel Hassett and Warsh to the top of Trump's list. Wall Street, however, has looked favourably upon his relative distance from the White House. Trump, when asked about Waller following their meeting, called him "great", adding that "he's a man who's been there a long time". While the two Kevins remain the favourites, Waller is emerging as "the more sensible choice", said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital. He noted that choosing Waller could open up two spots on the Fed board for Trump to fill next year, since Fed governor Stephen Miran's term is set to end. It remains to be seen who will satisfy the president. Other names floated include BlackRock executive Rick Reider and even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. In the end, no matter who emerges the winner from this contest, it may be Wall Street that serves as final judge of their success. The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents. The largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the justice department included some notable messages and several mentions of Trump. Why the Catholic Church and Donald Trump’s government are at odds over immigration policy. The US president has long denied any wrongdoing in relation to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. "Last week I was diagnosed with metastasized, stage-four pancreatic cancer, and am gonna die," wrote Ben Sasse. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: BlackRock pins Bitcoin ETF as major theme alongside T-bills, tech stocks

Time Published: 2025-12-23T03:00:42Z

BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF has featured on the $13.5 trillion asset manager's homepage, representing one of three major investment themes as the market heads into 2026. BlackRock says its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was one of its three biggest investment themes in 2025, putting it alongside Treasury bills and the largest US tech stocks. The asset manager named its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) alongside its ETF tracking Treasury bills and another tied to the “Magnificent 7” tech stocks of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla. IBIT has attracted more than $25 billion in net inflows this year, ranking sixth among all ETFs and trailing broad index funds, despite the fund delivering a negative return so far for 2025. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said on Monday that BlackRock's naming IBIT signals the firm isn’t fazed by Bitcoin’s (BTC) 30% fall from its high set in October. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed a similar sentiment on Friday, saying if the ETF “can do $25 billion in a bad year, imagine the flow potential in a good year.” The $25 billion in inflows adds to the roughly $37 billion that IBIT brought in over 2024, bringing its total inflows since launch to $62.5 billion, Farside Investors data shows. IBIT’s flow tally is more than five times that of its nearest competitor, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). Related: Recent Bitcoin miner capitulation may signal bottom is near: VanEck BlackRock filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF in September. The product seeks to sell covered call options on Bitcoin futures, collecting premiums to generate yield. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has exceeded expectations too, attracting over $9.1 billion worth of inflows this year, bringing its total tally to nearly $12.7 billion. It also filed to register an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF in November to complement ETHA. BlackRock initially opted not to incorporate staking in ETHA. However, a more crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission has loosened its ETF standards, allowing asset managers to experiment with new product ideas. BlackRock hasn’t participated in the altcoin ETF craze that other asset managers have taken part in, which has so far seen the likes of Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) products launch in recent months.

Title: Canada's Prime Minister Carney names financier Mark Wiseman as the next ambassador to Washington

Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced that financier Mark Wiseman will be Canada's next ambassador to the U.S. Wiseman will assume the role on February 15 and will be involved in negotiations regarding the review of their free trade agreement TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced on Monday that financier Mark Wiseman will serve as the country's next ambassador to the United States, an appointment that comes at a critical time in relations between the two major trading partners. Wiseman will assume the role on Feb. 15 and will be involved in negotiations with the U.S. regarding the review of their free trade agreement. “Mark Wiseman brings immense experience, contacts, and deep commitment at this crucial time of transformation of our relationship with the United States,” Carney said in a statement. “As a core member of our negotiating team, he will help advance the interests of Canadian workers, businesses, and institutions.” Wiseman replaces Kirsten Hillman, who announced her resignation earlier this month. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact, or USMCA, is up for review in 2026. U.S. President Donald Trump negotiated the deal during his first term in office and included a clause to possibly renegotiate it in 2026. Wiseman, 55, ran the investment fund of the Canada Pension Plan and also managed equity funds at the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. He is a friend of Carney, who ran the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020. In 2016 Wiseman became the senior managing director and global head of active equities at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Wiseman was once touted as a possible successor to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, though his tenure at the company was cut short in 2019 when he departed after he failed to disclose a consensual relationship with a colleague. He has since chaired the Alberta Investment Management Corp. “Mark Wiseman is a business type with Wall Street connections whose profile is in sync with the current focus on trade and economic investment of both the Carney government and the Trump administration. Yet, Wiseman has no prior diplomatic experience," said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. In October, Trump cut off tariff negotiations with Carney after the Ontario provincial government ran an antitariff advertisement in the U.S. It followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over Trump’s insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, as are 85% of U.S. electricity imports. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: James Dyson reworks $21 billion family office empire with fund transfers to Singapore firm

ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG Published Dec 23, 2025, 07:40 AM Updated Dec 23, 2025, 07:36 PM LONDON – Sir James Dyson is reshaping how he manages Britain’s biggest fortune, streamlining his sprawling business empire across three continents after new leaders took the reins of his family holding company. Weybourne, the Dyson family’s investment firm, has transferred funds totalling at least £624 million (S$1.08 billion) from a major UK entity in 2025 to its Singapore holding company, reducing the British unit’s share capital to £1, according to an analysis of registry filings by Bloomberg. It has also finalised earlier plans to close two British firms overseeing property investments and transferred part of their share capital to another entity in Singapore, where Mr Dyson’s eponymous vacuum maker has its global headquarters. Meanwhile, Weybourne has posted job openings in recent weeks for a “new team” in Singapore to support a multi-asset investment portfolio and has scaled back its US footprint after spending almost US$200 million (S$257 million) on New York real estate. A representative for the 78-year-old – Britain’s richest person with a net worth of about US$16.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index – declined to comment. The changes are likely “part of a multi-year succession road map”, said Mr Martin Roll, a global family business strategist and senior adviser at McKinsey & Co. It is “long-term planning”. The moves signal that Weybourne’s new leadership is leaving its mark on Mr Dyson’s fortune, taking steps to reduce the complexity of a business empire that has rapidly expanded in recent years, after he extracted large sums from his namesake technology company to diversify his wealth. Mr Martin Bowen, a legal veteran from Dyson Group, became Weybourne’s chief executive in February following the retirement of former army officer James Bucknall, who held the role for more than a decade. Mr Martin Bowen Weybourne also promoted senior money manager Jane Simpson to chief investment officer for its financial assets in a London-based role in 2024, when former BlackRock executive Alastair Peters became chief financial officer (CFO) in a previously unreported move. Weybourne’s new team in Singapore will work with the CFO unit led by Mr Peters, who turns 43 in December and forms part of a younger set of executives at the family investment firm. Mr Bowen, a former chief legal officer at Dyson’s technology firm who is 57 in December, is a decade younger than the former CEO Mr Bucknall, highlighting how longstanding money managers of the super-rich need to hone succession plans for their own leadership as well as for their employers. At least a fifth of the world’s 500 richest people now have a family office, helping preserve fortunes totalling more than US$5 trillion, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. “People forget that family offices are another family business,” said Ms Christina Wing, co-founder of Wingspan Legacy Partners, which advises billionaire dynasties. “They also need to change.” Like many family offices, Weybourne reflects its founder’s roots, bearing the name of a coastal village in the part of England where Mr Dyson grew up. The month after Mr Bowen became its CEO in February, the firm’s main British entity, Weybourne Limited, returned £24.2 million in share capital to its Singapore parent company, filings show. It withdrew a further £600 million in December, reversing a transaction between the entities four years ago that a Dyson representative previously told Bloomberg helped improve governance structures. Separately, under plans disclosed publicly in late 2024, a Weybourne property firm based in Britain closed in December after transferring ownership of its real estate investments to a Singapore entity in a £26.4 million transaction. Another property firm in Britain named after Mr Dyson’s Gloucestershire estate, Dodington Park, closed in 2025 after similarly transferring its real estate investments to the billionaire’s namesake farming business. That inflow for Dyson Farming achieved “operational efficiencies”, Weybourne Limited said in its 2024 accounts filed in October, underscoring the benefits of corporate housekeeping across the British billionaire’s empire. Mr Dyson is lining up a further diversification of his fortune, which remains mostly tied up in his technology company, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. In 2025, his vacuum maker committed to boosting its annual dividends to the billionaire’s Singapore-based Weybourne Holdings to £225 million, reversing a recent trend of declining payouts. It previously paid a £200 million dividend for 2024, its lowest total in at least seven years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While there has been a global boom over the past two decades in the number of family investment firms catering to the needs of the world’s ultra-rich, few are as large as Weybourne. Created in 2013, it now has more than 70 employees across teams in London and Singapore, where it set up an insurance unit three years ago to help protect Dyson’s financial affairs and has recently sought to hire staff. Weybourne last publicly disclosed net assets in the UK of £4.5 billion in 2019, when the technology firm Mr Dyson founded more than two decades ago said it was relocating its headquarters to Singapore. Its other recent job openings include a UK position on its human resources team, a rare feature among investment firms of the ultra-wealthy. “It keeps a lot in-house that peers outsource,” said Mr Marc Debois, founder of FO-Next, an advisory firm for family offices. “Weybourne needs the bodies.” BLOOMBERG E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, has appointed financier and former BlackRock executive Mark Wiseman as Canada's ambassador to the US, ahead of major trade talks with the Trump administration. Wiseman, an experienced investment manager, takes on the task as Canada works to reset its strained relations with the US while preparing for a tense review of the current free trade deal. His appointment follows current ambassador Kirsten Hillman's announcement that she would be ending her tenure in Washington. Carney said Wiseman "brings immense experience, extensive contacts and deep commitment" to the post at a "crucial time of transformation" for Canada and the US. "As a core member of our negotiating team, he will help advance the interests of Canadian workers, businesses, and institutions, while building opportunities for both Canada and the United States," the prime minister said in a statement on Monday. The new ambassador is set to take on the role in mid-February, Carney added. Wiseman, 55, reportedly a close friend of Carney's, is currently a senior advisor and chairman of Canada at Lazard, a financial services company, and a senior advisor at Boston Consulting Group, a consultancy firm. In March, Carney added him as a member of the prime minister's council on Canada-US relations, a group formed to navigate the currently turbulent bilateral relationship. The Yale alumni also previously worked in both New York and Paris as a lawyer with law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. He is one of the co-founders of the Century Initiative, a charitable organisation that has lobbied for increased immigration levels in Canada, with the goal reaching 100 million people in the country by 2100 to support economic growth. The role with Century Initiative stirred up criticism ahead of his appointment. Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre has accused Wiseman of being "someone who proposed a policy that inflates the cost of living, takes away jobs and puts pressure on our health care system". "Why does the Prime Minister want to appoint him as ambassador to Washington?" Beyond domestic politics, Wiseman will face the currently thorny relationship between the US and Canada while in Washington. Trump halted trade talks with Canada in late October in anger over an anti-tariff advertisement commissioned by the province of Ontario and aired in the US. Trump has imposed sector-specific tariffs on Canadian metals, lumber and automotives. He has also imposed a sweeping tariff rate of 35% on all goods, though most have been exempt under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) - known at the USMCA in the US - trade pact. A scheduled review of CUSMA is now underway, starting with public hearings and stakeholder consultations, after which Canada, the US and Mexico could agree to renew it, or let it expire. An emergency meeting of the UN Security Council was called to discuss the US seizure of two tankers. Five people are still unaccounted for but crews have rescued multiple people from the partially collapsed building, officials say. The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents. The largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the justice department included some notable messages and several mentions of Trump. Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, says a "witch hunt" is taking place. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Terms of North American free trade deal set to be renegotiated in 2026 under shadow of US tariff policies. By News Agencies Share Save Canada has named former BlackRock executive Mark Wiseman as the new ambassador to the United States, with upcoming trade and tariff negotiations likely to dominate his tenure. In a statement on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Wiseman would help manage Canada’s relationship with the US, which has grown stormy under tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. “Mr Wiseman will be a key contributor to the government’s efforts to advance Canada-US priorities, including secure borders [and] a strengthened trade and investment relationship,” Carney said in a statement. Relations between the countries have somewhat settled after the US launched a trade war targeting Canadian goods, prompting anger at what was widely viewed as an act of economic hostility against a longtime ally. The Trump administration has targeted Canada with several rounds of tariffs, including a blanket 25 percent tariff for allegedly failing to stem migration and fentanyl flows from Canada. That came despite data showing only a tiny fraction of fentanyl smuggled into the US crosses the US-Canada border. The US subsequently imposed sweeping tariffs on automobiles, steel and aluminium imports, all of which disproportionately affected Canada. In August, Trump and Carney, who was elected on a promise to take a tough stance in the face of US threats, reached agreements to roll back some of the measures. A more comprehensive deal has remained elusive. Trump has also stirred anger by repeatedly saying that Canada should become the 51st US state, which Carney has firmly rejected. Those tensions could re-emerge in the coming months as officials set out to renegotiate the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, also known as the USMCA. Canadian officials are set to begin discussions with US counterparts in mid-January on the USMCA, which currently exempts many key products that would otherwise be tariffed under Trump’s policies. Canada is the top export destination for 36 US states, with nearly $2.7bn worth of goods and services crossing the border each day. Carney has hedged his expectations for the future of trade relations with the US, saying that Canada will defend its economic interests but that US policy is beyond its control.

Title: Trump Loses GOP Support on China Policy

Donald Trump is wrecking so much with his blend of impulsivity and personal graft and vanity that it is sometimes hard to distinguish the consequential from the incidental. Far more important than his plastering his name everywhere is Trump’s incoherent China policy, where he keeps raising and lowering tariffs to no strategic purpose while at the same time giving away crown jewels or finding a way to sell them. More from Robert Kuttner Earlier this month, there was widespread outrage in the defense community when Trump reversed policy and allowed Nvidia to sell the H200 in China, its second most advanced artificial intelligence chip. Seven Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick a letter warning that “the President’s dangerous decision to give away crucial national security controls represents a significant departure from longstanding bipartisan efforts to ensure that U.S. technology does not turbocharge China’s military and technological capabilities.” The decision to allow the sale followed months of courtship and flattery of Trump by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Nvidia used a brand-new tech conference in D.C. to lavish praise on Trump, and Huang gave generously to Trump’s ballroom project and has claimed that Trump is ushering in a new Industrial Revolution (his words) with AI. The H200 decision came right after an Oval Office meeting between Huang and Trump. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. In line with Trump’s habit of asking private companies to pay tribute, Nvidia will kick back 25 percent “revenue share” of the value of its China sales to the U.S. government. This doesn’t go directly into Trump’s pocket. But in the great favor bank, Trump will find ways to cash in this favor to Huang for his personal enrichment. Now, however, Congress has pushed back big-time. In the annual defense authorization bill that Trump has just signed into law, a broad bipartisan coalition inserted provisions codifying a 2023 Biden executive order requiring national-security screening of outbound U.S. capital investment in China. In past years, U.S. venture capital firms have supplied a lot of the funds for AI development in China. Funds managed by Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity have major investments in China’s marquee tech company, Alibaba. The authorization bill does not reverse the Nvidia chip approval, but it sends a shot across Trump’s bow and signals more willingness of Republicans to defect from automatic support for Trump. In supporting the new restrictions, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas warned, “Every dollar invested in China by a United States investor into a Chinese company is a dollar that’s going toward the potential production of weapons and technology that one day may be used to kill Americans.” Congress needs to go further and ban sweetheart deals like the Nvidia waiver. Meanwhile, Trump is pulling back on technologies where China increasingly dominates, such as EVs and renewable energy. His treatment of the Caribbean as an American lake and Ukraine as part of greater Russia is a virtual invitation for China to invade Taiwan. While Trump is obsessed with Venezuela as a national-security threat and imposes vanity tariffs on friendly nations like Canada that fall short of his standards of genuflection, militarily and commercially he is letting China clean America’s clock.

BlackRock named its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) one of the top three investment themes for 2025, a striking move given bitcoin’s BTC$87,136.57 slide this year. The firm placed IBIT alongside two more traditional offerings: the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT). Bitcoin has dropped more than 4% year-to-date, the first decline in three years, and IBIT has mirrored that performance. Even so, the ETF has seen strong investor interest. IBIT ranks sixth among all ETFs by 2025 inflows, pulling in over $25 billion since January. “It's easy to frame this as BlackRock simply promoting its highest-revenue product,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. “But I see it more as the firm doubling down on its conviction that bitcoin belongs in diversified portfolios.” Geraci noted that BlackRock has other ETFs, like the gold-focused IAU, that are outperforming IBIT and charge higher fees. Yet the firm is spotlighting a product that underperformed in 2025, a rare move in an industry that typically pushes its top-performing funds. “If the objective were purely revenue generation, BlackRock has no shortage of ETFs with significantly higher fees that it could emphasize instead,” he said. “Asset managers aren’t typically in the business of spotlighting underperforming products, particularly when they have a deep bench of outperforming alternatives they could highlight.” The inclusion of IBIT as a top 2025 theme signals a long-term bet on the crypto asset by the world’s largest asset manager. For investors who still see crypto as speculative or fringe, BlackRock’s positioning of bitcoin alongside cash and stocks may shift that perception.

Title: Real Estate ETF Poised For Breakout As Treasury Yields Drop And Cap Rates Compress

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLRE) has spent 2025 in the penalty box and looks poised to close the year… exactly where it started. That underperformance may be setting up a contrarian opportunity that makes 2026 explosive. The fund tracks real estate investment trusts as the sector transitions from defensive survival mode to offensive expansion. The biggest macro factor for XLRE in 2026 is the Federal Reserve’s interest rate trajectory. According to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)’s iShares outlook, the most likely path brings rates down as the Fed continues its monetary policy adjustments. That matters because real estate operates on spreads. When Treasury yields decline while REIT dividends hold steady or grow, real estate becomes more attractive on a relative basis. The mechanism is cap rate compression. As borrowing costs decline, property valuations rise because the same income stream gets divided by a lower discount rate. Industry data shows cap rates already declining in late 2025, with further drops expected in 2026 as financial pressures ease. This is the mathematical reality of how real estate gets priced. Investors should monitor the Federal Reserve’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections and monthly Treasury yield movements. When Treasury yields decline, that signals XLRE’s relative attractiveness is improving. XLRE’s micro story is its exposure to secular growth infrastructure. The fund holds positions in data center and cell tower REITs, including Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) and Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR). Equinix is among the top holdings showing positive earnings growth, while its peers saw earnings compress. Analysts project significant upside for Equinix and the most bullish outlook among major XLRE components. This matters because AI infrastructure spending isn’t slowing. Data centers and cell towers generate contractual income with built-in escalators, making them more predictable than traditional real estate. As interest rates decline, these high-quality assets should see valuation expansion first. Check XLRE’s monthly holdings updates on the State Street website to track shifts in data center exposure. Quarterly earnings from Equinix and Digital Realty, typically released in February, May, August, and November, provide early signals on demand trends. The Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHH) offers similar real estate exposure with a slightly lower expense ratio and broader diversification across smaller REITs. It provides comparable income with less concentration risk in the top 10 holdings. For 2026, watch the Fed’s rate path and XLRE’s data center holdings. Those two factors will determine whether this year’s underperformance becomes next year’s breakout. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: 2026 Looks Like An Inflection Point For Schwab’s US REIT To Launch Higher | SCHH

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © VideoFlow / Shutterstock.com The Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHH) has spent the last year treading water, down roughly 2% while investors waited for interest rates to cooperate. With the 10-year Treasury hovering around 4.2% in mid-December and the Federal Reserve signaling a gradual path toward lower rates in 2026, SCHH sits at the inflection point where real estate transforms from defensive survival mode to offensive expansion. The single biggest macro force shaping SCHH’s 2026 trajectory is the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield. Real estate investment trusts compete directly with risk-free government bonds for income-seeking capital. When Treasuries yield 4% or more, a REIT paying 3.5% looks unattractive. But if rates drift toward the 3.0% to 3.5% range that BlackRock and other forecasters expect by late 2026, that same REIT dividend becomes compelling. Lower long-term rates trigger cap rate compression. Property values move inversely to interest rates because the discount rate used to value future cash flows declines. A warehouse generating steady rental income becomes worth more when buyers can finance acquisitions at 4% instead of 6%. For SCHH, which holds industrial REITs like Prologis (NYSE:PLD) at nearly 9% of the portfolio, this valuation lift flows directly through to net asset value. The commercial real estate maturity wall is equally critical. Roughly $162 billion in CRE loans mature in 2026, up 56% from 2025’s $104 billion. Much of this debt was originated at 3% to 4% rates and needs refinancing. If rates stay elevated near 6%, refinancing becomes punishing and dividends get cut. If rates fall toward 4%, the crisis becomes manageable. SCHH’s fate hinges on this refinancing environment because its holdings must either roll over debt or tap equity markets at reasonable costs. Beyond macro rates, SCHH’s micro story centers on sector allocation within its 165 holdings. The fund’s largest position, Welltower (NYSE:WELL) at 9.84%, has surged over 50% year-to-date, demonstrating that healthcare REITs can thrive even in tough rate environments due to demographic tailwinds. But data center REITs like Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR), representing 4.1% of SCHH, have fallen 14% this year as AI infrastructure euphoria faded and financing costs bit harder. This divergence matters because SCHH’s 2026 performance depends on which subsectors catch momentum. Infrastructure REITs including cell towers and data centers comprise roughly 18% of the portfolio. Industrial and logistics properties add another 15%. Residential REITs account for 12%. The Fidelity MSCI Real Estate Index ETF (NYSEARCA:FREL) offers a similar portfolio at an expense ratio of 0.084% versus SCHH’s 0.07%. FREL holds $1.1 billion in assets with nearly identical top holdings including Welltower, Prologis, and American Tower. The key difference is FREL includes real estate services companies like CBRE Group (NYSE:CBRE) at 3.26% and CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) at 1.98%, which aren’t REITs but benefit from real estate transaction volumes. If the rate environment improves and property sales accelerate in 2026, FREL captures that upside through its services exposure while SCHH remains pure-play property ownership. The most important signal for SCHH over the next 12 months is whether the 10-year Treasury yield breaks below 4% and stays there, combined with whether the fund’s industrial and healthcare REIT holdings maintain occupancy and rental growth despite the refinancing wave.

Title: Monthly Pay ETFs Go Mainstream And Retirees LOVE Them

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St I opened the conversation by admitting something most investors eventually confront. There are products in the market that sound intriguing, but you are not entirely sure how they work. Monthly pay ETFs fall squarely into that category for many people. Lee stepped in to explain why they have quietly become one of the most useful income tools available today. Lee started with the basics. Exchange traded funds trade intraday, unlike traditional open-end mutual funds that settle at the end of the day. What surprised many income investors over the past decade is that while most ETFs originally paid dividends quarterly, a growing group now pays monthly. For retirees, boomers, and older Gen X investors, that distinction matters far more than it sounds. Lee pointed to JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) Equity Premium Income ETF, symbol JEPI, as the most widely recognized example. With roughly $30 billion in assets, JEPI pays a monthly yield north of 8%. While it does experience some volatility during broader market drawdowns, Lee noted that income-focused investors continue to support it because consistent cash flow is the primary objective. We also discussed more specialized options. One that stood out was the Gabelli Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust (NYSE: GGN). Managed by Mario Gabelli’s firm, it holds a mix of gold and energy stocks, effectively pairing two sectors that often perform well during inflationary or volatile environments. GGN pays a monthly dividend above 8%, making it attractive for investors who want sector exposure alongside income. Another higher-yield option Lee mentioned was BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II (NYSE: BSTZ), a technology-oriented income fund paying monthly distributions exceeding 11%. These types of funds are not designed for ultra-conservative investors, but for those willing to accept some volatility, the income potential can be compelling. Lee emphasized that monthly pay ETFs are particularly well suited for boomers and Gen X investors nearing retirement. They are not replacements for Treasury bonds or insured products, but they serve as powerful income complements. Even investors who do not currently need the income can reinvest monthly dividends, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging. When prices dip, reinvested dividends buy more shares, enhancing long-term income potential. We agreed that monthly pay ETFs are one of the most practical innovations in income investing over the past decade. They combine liquidity, yield, and flexibility in a way traditional dividend stocks and mutual funds often cannot. Whether used to fund living expenses or to compound income over time, they give investors another way to turn portfolios into cash-flow engines. [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there’s something out that I don’t even know how it works, but you do. It’s monthly pay ETFs. Tell me about them, I’m not familiar. [00:00:13] Lee Jackson: Well, everybody is probably pretty familiar with the exchange traded fund now and the way they vary from the old opened end mutual fund, exchange traded funds, trade on the major exchanges and they’re, you can buy and sell ’em anytime during the day when you want, at any price. [00:00:31] It doesn’t matter. Whereas when you wanna sell your Vanguard, open-end mutual fund, you may have to call Vanguard and sell and you’ll get the end of the day price. Yeah. But, one of the things that we found out and I was intrigued by, ’cause I’ve written about dividend and dividend paying stocks at, 24/7 for almost 15 years, is that most of these ETFs paid like mutual funds. [00:00:55] They pay quarterly. But in the last 10, 8, 10 years, they started to have ETFs that paid monthly. And think of that if you’re a boomer, an older, gen X person getting, what Better to supplement your passive income. And remember, passive income is income. that the IRS views, it’s anything from your job. [00:01:19] So if you have stocks or bonds or real estate or things like that that generate income, that’s passive income. Well, some of the really good ones that we like, and one of the biggest ones is it’s got $30 billion in it, is run by JP Morgan and it’s the, symbol on it is JEPI. It pays about an eight 15% yield monthly. [00:01:43] Wow. Monthly and you know it ha has it gone up and down a little bit? Did it go down a little bit, when we had the draw down in late October and November? Yeah, but then it came right back. ’cause who doesn’t want an eight 40 or eight 50, whatever it is, dividend monthly with, I mean, is there risk? Sure, because it is, it’s not a treasury bond yielding 3.8%. [00:02:07] It’s yielding 8.3% or whatever it is. That’s a good one. Another one we like and this is especially interesting if it’s people that are wanting a sector play, is, the Gabelli Gamco trust, symbol. GGN. Yeah. All, it holds is gold stocks. And energy stocks, so that’s almost your perfect Paris trade in one. [00:02:33] You’ve got the red hot gold stocks, which Goldman Sachs thinks exceed 4,900 next year, and then it has all of the quality energy stocks, but it pays monthly. The dividend on GGN is in the eight plus percent range. It’s run by Mario Gabelli’s company. He’s been on wall team for 50 years. So that’s a good shot to take. [00:02:57] Another good one that we like it’s, the symbol is BSTZ and it’s sort of a income related technology play, but the, again, the dividends monthly, it’s about 11.2%. And again, these aren’t for people that are very, very, very conservative. All the JP Morgan one you could go with, it’s, that’s pretty good. Very conservative, really all, and they all use big, they write covered calls on their positions. The stocks go up, they get called away, they replace it with another stock or buy the stock again. But I think for boomers, gen X people that are steering towards retirement, these are the perfect adjuncts to social security, pension funds, IRA distributions, anything like that. every bill that you have to pay for the most part comes monthly. Your car payment or your mortgage payment doesn’t come every quarter, comes every single month. [00:04:01] And what better way to augment income with passive income? And these are good, good ideas and we constantly write about this. So if you keep checking on, 24/7 Wall Street, you’ll see our ideas, I mean, we have so many good writers covering this now, [00:04:18] we probably have 10 guys and gals that are covering the exchange traded fund, income stocks. So they’re a good way to generate money. And, again, if you don’t need the income, if you don’t need the income, you can reinvest your dividends. [00:04:33] Just go to your broker and say, I wanna reinvest these every month. So if, it goes up a little bit and you’re reinvesting, you won’t buy as much. But if it does go down, like the draw down we had in October and November, you’ll buy more shares. So either way, just remember it. It’s like the dream investment for boomers, the monthly pay etf.

‘Tis the season for “biggest story of the year” articles and, when it comes to crypto, the choice in 2025 was not hard. The obvious pick is Wall Street’s full-on embrace of crypto, which saw banks and big companies tripping over each other to show they are down with stablecoins and tokenized assets. But look a little closer and you’ll see 2025 featured another major, but more subtle, trend: the ongoing expansion of DeFi and decentralized technology. This has been reflected in the huge growth of DeFi platforms like Hyperliquid, and in Coinbase’s decision last week to add Jupiter, a leading aggregator for decentralized Solana trading, to its app. Such developments have helped decentralized exchanges nab a bigger share of overall crypto trading volume, with degens now accounting for a double digital share of the spot trading market. The CEO of Maple Finance, one of the leading players in the decentralized space, this week went so far as to claim “DeFi is dead”—implying that on-chain trading has become so big that it is poised to swallow conventional systems altogether. I wouldn’t go that far (at least not for a few years), but you get the point. The CEO’s remark also highlights how, in coming years, we are likely to face confusion over what exactly the term decentralized means. For longtime blockchain enthusiasts, the term implies using blockchain technology to build more democratic alternatives to powerful institutions—including big banks, but also the likes of Google and Facebook. But if this is the promise of crypto, what should we make of JPMorgan and BlackRock launching new on-chain money market funds available to those with $5 million or more to trade?It’s a win, of course, that blockchain technology has proved so good that the most respected names in traditional finance are using it. Still, it’s hard to get excited about giant corporations using blockchains to sling commercial paper when the original goal was to democratize large sections of society and the economy. The situation is reminiscent of the quip: “They promised us flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” Jeff John Roberts jeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts Coinbase offers stock trading: The company says its move into equities will let it be a bridge to the era of tokenization. Coinbase also launched prediction markets in a tie-up with Kalshi, intensifying its head-to-head competition with Robinhood. (Fortune) Here come the big banks: The country’s eight largest banks are putting tens of millions into a new non-profit that will “tell the banking industry’s story”—a clear response to crypto firms’ mass lobbying efforts, and one that could complicate the push for new blockchain legislation. (Axios) North Korea’s record haul: The Hermit Kingdom’s notorious military-backed hackers out did themselves in 2025, stealing a record $2 billion in crypto—the lion’s share of the estimated $3.4 billion stolen overall. (Fortune) PayPal’s hard path: The fintech giant’s CEO told Fortune his company is facing a “very classic innovator’s dilemma” as it doubles down on crypto and stablecoins to try to keep pace with competitors. (Fortune) Bitcoin OGs still selling: Longtime Bitcoin holders keep off-loading their positions, which helps explain ongoing pressure on prices. The move may not signal a loss of confidence, but rather a sign of the market maturing as one-time HODLers take advantage of new liquidity supplied by ETFs and institutional funds. (Bloomberg) Caroline Ellison is back in the news after the former CEO of Sam Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund was released from federal prison. Her onetime boyfriend, meanwhile, still faces decades of hard time. The feds arrested a Brooklyn man for impersonating a Coinbase staffer in order to steal $16 million from around 100 traders. The suspect’s “lolimfeelingevil” alias probably won’t help at his sentencing hearing.

Share this article BlackRock sent 2,019 Bitcoin worth approximately $182 million and 29,928 Ethereum worth around $91 million to Coinbase Prime on Monday, according to blockchain data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. Markets tend to pay close attention to the firm’s on-chain movements, which frequently are followed by large flows later in the day or in subsequent sessions. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs saw over $240 million in net outflows last week, while its Ethereum funds shed roughly $558 million without a single day of positive flows, per Farside Investors. Crypto investment products lost $952 million in capital last week. The downturn ended a four-week streak of inflows, largely due to $555 million exiting Ethereum funds and $460 million from Bitcoin funds. After dipping below $85,000 late last week, Bitcoin rebounded past $90,000 ahead of today’s US market open. The recovery boosted sentiment across the board, lifting the total crypto market cap by 1.5% to $3.1 trillion in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Crypto Exec Warns Tokenization Is Moving Faster Than Expected

According to a post shared on X by Keith Grossman, president of crypto payments firm MoonPay, finance is heading toward an onchain future that could unfold over several years. The view comes as large banks and asset managers begin product tokenization, a move that once seemed extreme but is now being treated as a practical step by major institutions. Based on reports cited by Grossman, progress has accelerated because rules are becoming clearer. Legislative efforts, regulatory guidance, bank involvement and accounting standards are starting to line up. That combination reduces uncertainty, which is often what slows large pools of capital. BlackRock has already launched tokenized funds, while Franklin Templeton is running tokenized money market funds on public blockchains. Those actions suggest that tokenization is no longer confined to pilot labs or internal trials. It is being used with real assets and real clients. Bank of America recently said that banks are heading toward a multi-year, onchain future. A few years ago, that would have sounded radical. Today, it sounds inevitable. 20+ years ago, I began my career in media and saw firsthand what happens when an analog industry collides with… — Keith A. Grossman (@KeithGrossman) December 21, 2025 Banks are also taking part. Citi, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have all been linked to onchain settlement tests, tokenized deposits and near real-time asset transfers. These projects focus on reducing friction in back-end processes that have existed for decades. Settlement that once took days could be shortened to minutes if shared ledgers are used. That change alone alters how risk, liquidity and cost are managed across markets. Grossman framed the moment as similar to earlier shifts in other industries. He pointed to how legacy media struggled when distribution moved online more than 20 years ago. At the time, many firms tried to protect old revenue streams instead of adapting. Some survived by changing early. Others lost influence as new platforms took control. In finance, the pressure point sits in areas such as reconciliation, clearing, settlement and custody. These roles have long supported steady margins, partly because they depend on complex and slow systems. Reports have disclosed that software and shared protocols can now handle much of that work. As a result, some services may become cheaper and less profitable over time. That does not mean banks disappear. According to Grossman’s view, they remain central players, much like they did after ATMs reduced teller roles or when voice-over-internet systems cut long-distance call costs for telecom firms. The institutions stayed, but their shape changed. The same pattern is expected here. Banks may rely more on software, fewer manual steps and new forms of infrastructure control. Tokenization is moving faster than expected, according to MoonPay president Keith Grossman. Banks and asset managers are testing tokenized funds and onchain settlement, signaling that what was once experimental is now becoming practical. The lenders and other big players are among the firms pushing the shift, showing the trend is already under way.

Title: Ripple’s RLUSD Breaks Into Top 5 Stablecoins As It Marks Its One-Year Anniversary
URL: https://zycrypto.com/ripples-rlusd-breaks-into-top-5-stablecoins-as-it-marks-its-one-year-anniversary/
Time Published: 2025-12-22T08:34:55Z
Full Content:
Ripple’s RLUSD has marked its first anniversary, rising to the top five stablecoins and securing regulatory approvals across the globe. In the coming years, the team has its sights set on challenging the dominance of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, capitalizing on a streak of regulatory wins. RLUSD, a US dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Ripple, has marked its first anniversary, notching impressive numbers in under 12 months. Launched on December 17, 2024, the RLUSD has inched its way into conversations for leading stablecoins. According to Standard Custody CEO Jack McDonald, Ripple has joined the top five stablecoins, reaching the milestone in “record time.” While not expressly stated, McDonald’s comments in an X post refer to the category of US-regulated stablecoins, specifically those with OCC and NYDFS licenses. Under this subset, Ripple’s RLUSD ranks in third place behind Circle’s USDC and PayPal’s PYUSD with market capitalizations of $78 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. One year after launch, Ripple’s market capitalization sits at $1.3 billion, making it “one of the fastest climbs in the regulated stablecoin space.” “I’m excited to celebrate the one-year anniversary of RLUSD,” said McDonald. “We’ve gone from 0 to a top 5 USD stablecoin in record time.” However, CoinMarketCap data ranks RLUSD eighth by market capitalization, including both US-regulated and offshore stablecoins. Apart from its frenetic surge over one year, RLUSD racked up impressive milestones along the way. Right off the bat, the OCC’s conditional approval of Ripple’s National Trust Bank charter puts RLUSD in pole position for regulatory compliance. To cement its place in the enterprise market, Ripple tapped BNY Global to custody RLUSD reserves and enlisted Deloitte for attestations as an added layer of credibility. Outside the US, RLUSD has received regulatory approvals in key jurisdictions such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi. All year long, RLUSD has been cementing its place as a major bridge for real-world assets (RWA). The stablecoin offers BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenised funds with a 24/7 off-ramp, extending its institutional use case. Meanwhile, plans for multichain expansion are underway with Ripple pursuing interoperability on Optimism, Base, Ink, and Unichain. “It was undeniably the year of the stablecoin, and I can’t wait to see what 2026 has in store,” said McDonald.

When it comes to highlighting shocking customer care in Ireland and the myriad ways readers have been let down, this page is rarely found wanting. But with it being the season of goodwill and all, we thought we might suspend our giving out for one day and instead celebrate all the soundness we’ve come across in recent times. Here are just some of the stories people have shared with us across social media platforms and via email since the start of this month. One thing that strikes us (and not for the first time) is how little it costs – in financial terms – to go above and beyond and how potentially great the returns are for businesses and people who do right by their customers. One reader, Elva, got in touch to sing the praises of All Seasons Flowers in Lucan Shopping Centre, Co Dublin. “At the beginning of November I placed an online order for a fresh door wreath and a Christmas table arrangement, with collection scheduled for Saturday, December 6th,” she said. “When I arrived, the team realised there had been a mix-up and they had prepared two wreaths instead of the wreath and the table arrangement. “They apologised profusely and immediately refunded the cost of the table arrangement.” She is undergoing cancer treatment and had been driven quite a distance to the shop by her partner as she had recently had surgery, which meant returning another day was not really an option. “I accepted the refund without any issue. However, the following day, Sunday 7th, I received a genuinely thoughtful email from the owner Emily Gaynor, apologising for the oversight and explaining it fell short of the standard they aim for, especially for orders placed well in advance for Christmas. “As a gesture of goodwill, she insisted on creating the table arrangement free of charge and arranging delivery to my home. It arrived today and it’s beautiful. “For a small business to go to such lengths after having already refunded me speaks volumes about their integrity and commitment to their customers. “In a time when good service can often feel rare, All Seasons Flowers in Lucan really stood out.” Niamh contacted us to praise the Christmas-tree sellers outside the Tesco in Newbridge, Co Kildare. “My 75-year-old mum couldn’t make the Christmas tree stand on her own, so they went up and put up the tree for her as well free of charge. I thought that was really sweet.” [ ‘Regift the bejaysus out of it’: 21 tips for a cheaper Christmas, from readers and from us ] Gina, meanwhile, had kind words for Clarkes Bakery in Cabra, Dublin, although it is more of a story of kindness on the double, really. “My husband was recently in the Mater recovering after a heart bypass,” she says. “He heard one of the nurses was celebrating a big birthday, but had to work over the next few days and wasn’t going to get out to celebrate,” she said. So Gina’s husband called Clarkes. “He ordered a large birthday cake and had planned for a taxi to collect it and deliver it to the hospital – on the phone with the bakery when everything was ordered they told him that they are a cash-only business. “But they took the order and delivered the cake on the basis that when he was out he would call in and pay for it. Of course, he couldn’t drive for weeks and when I called in to pay it was ... no big fuss. “Such a lovely kind thing and amazing customer service. They deserve a big shout-out.” Fiona had two stories to share: one from times past and another from recent days. When she was a student about 17 years ago she was getting the Bus Éireann service to Limerick from Galway to visit an aunt. “I lost my ticket and needed to get on the bus. I was really flustered and nervous. I was too broke to get a new ticket and the bus driver saw me looking anxious. When he came over to me, my face was so flushed and I explained that I lost my ticket,” she said. “He must have felt sorry for me and told me he saw me buying a ticket, which I doubted because he had just got off another bus. He said it was OK, took my bag, put it in the luggage area and told me to go on to the bus. “I was so embarrassed and grateful that I welled up when I sat down. I couldn’t believe his kindness.” Fast forward to 2025 and she has another transport story to share, this time involving Aer Lingus. “I was on an Aer Lingus flight and the woman in front of me looked so stressed. She was flying on her own with a baby and a toddler. When the flight took off, the baby kept crying and mother looked increasingly flustered,” Fiona wrote. “Later, she was trying to hold the crying baby with one hand and unzip her bag to get something for the toddler with the other hand. “The air hostess came over with a broad smile and asked if she could take the baby for a while. “She picked up the baby, kept her close to her chest, started rocking her and cooing her for about half an hour. The baby stopped crying and the mother looked so relieved and grateful. “It was lovely witnessing an act of kindness that meant so much to someone in a state of stress and anxiety. “I always find Aer Lingus have brilliant customer service and it’s not the first time I’ve witnessed an act of kindness from their staff.” Margaret, meanwhile, recently had to email Spotlight Oral Care as her toothbrush of less than a year old gave up. “I got an email requesting some details and short video of the toothbrush,” she writes. “I sent the requested info and the next email was to confirm replacement on way. It was so efficient and all within a matter of a few days. Excellent customer service.” We are big fans of the Saw Doctors on this page, so were delighted when the band – or at least someone acting on their behalf – got a shout out. “My wife and I recently brought our 14-year-old son to his first music gig – the Saw Doctors in the Olympia,” Shane wrote. “Our son hadn’t been in the theatre before so when we got in, we brought him down to the front of the standing area so he could look up and back at all the levels and boxes and see how fantastic a venue it is.” As it happens, there was a section cordoned off at the very front where they restrict numbers standing close to the stage. “As we went to make our way back into the general standing area, the floor manager (we think) came over to us and gave us wristbands so we could stand in the priority area at the front, where it would be less crowded and more suitable for our son,” Shane says. “As if that wasn’t enough, the floor manager then sought us out and came over to present our son with one of the handwritten set lists from the band to keep as a memento of his first gig. “I believe his name was Tommy K (apparently a coincidence that it was one of the Saw Doctors songs on the night) – he certainly deserves a shout-out for going above and beyond unprompted on the night.” Grainne from Galway recently needed some ties for her outdoor Christmas lights, so called to O’Higgins in Shantalla. She told the sales assistance what she needed “and he could not have been nicer. He brought me out to a big stockroom at the back of the shop. He went through all the options and said, ‘While these may not be what you are looking for, they will work’. I decided on tile clips, which did the job. “I just want to call out the time, the interest and how helpful this gentleman was. The sale came to €5, so it wasn’t as if I was a big customer with a large order, but he still gave me the time and showed interest.” She also praises Blackthorn Candles and Blazer Candles, two Galway candle companies. “I ordered candles from both above candlemakers in Galway to shop local. The candles from both places were really good quality and well made with a lovely scent. To my surprise both gentlemen arrived at my front door and delivered them personally. “Great service, great candles, great to support local companies.” Staying with fragrances, Paddy wrote in about “a small business called Handsome Scent on Stephen Street in Dublin. They do home-produced fragrances (with “inspiration-from”) some of the higher-priced shop ones. “I bought a set of three fragrances and one of them had leaked in the post. I sent a message on Instagram and they posted a new one that day and I had it the next day. “No messing, quibbles, just really good service.” [ 100 Irish websites for all your Christmas presents, from Claddagh Guinness socks to cheese ] Ciara Kelly – the one on the radio – also got in touch to highlight how a cold Christmas was once averted by the soundness of Ultima Oil in Kilpedder, Co Wicklow. She ran out of home heating oil on Christmas Eve and tells us she “left a message on Ultima Oil’s answering machine (they were finished up for Christmas) asking if we could get a delivery as soon as they reopened. “We went out for lunch and came home to a full tank they had delivered on Christmas Eve afternoon so we wouldn’t be cold. They said we could pay after Christmas. It was unbelievably kind,” Ciara said. She actually has a second story of goodwill. “Another Christmas, it was a week to go and Greystones butcher Des Doyle rang me to say I hadn’t ordered a turkey and no problem if I’d ordered elsewhere, but just in case I’d forgotten he was checking as it was the last chance to get one. I hadn’t ordered elsewhere and Des Doyle saved Christmas.” Last January reader PJ bought an air fryer from Harvey Norman in Rathfarnham, Dublin. “A couple of weeks ago it started to switch off halfway through the cycle. It was still under warranty, so they asked me to bring it in so they could have a look at it,” he says. “The unit was taken away and five minutes later the sales assistant returned with a replacement. The paperwork was sorted in minutes and she put it on a trolley and followed me out to the car. That’s what I call customer service.” Another reader, Richard, says: “There’s the best of small bookshops in Blackrock in Dublin called Raven Books. Louisa runs it and she’s an absolute gem. Helpful, knowledgeable, affable, dedicated, hard working. She’s just brilliant. “But best of all, and although some time ago now, she delivered books on her bicycle to my three kids to the door during Covid, when things were closed. They were utterly delighted by it. “I haven’t bought a book anywhere else since. She more than deserves a mention.” We also heard from a reader called Doreen, who got in touch to praise Global Windows. “The attention to detail, professionalism, courtesy and reliability is way beyond any other company/contractor who worked on our house refurbishment,” she says. “Every single contact I had from the initial sales person to the guys actually fitting the windows were a pleasure to deal with.” [ Beware the ghost of “Buy Now Pay Later” and have a savvy Christmas ] Next up is Ciara, who says she had “some niggly adult-life stuff happen recently and it always really helps when a) people are sound and b) people do what they say they are going to do”. Ciara has three good news stories to share. “During the summer, a large and heavily filled plate drawer under the hob of our fitted kitchen (new house, only three years old) locked while pulled out and refused to close,” she says. “I was away at the time and messaged the original kitchen fitter and supplier, Stuart Malcolm from Onovo. I got a quick text back from him and he confirmed he was out my way and could have a quick look. “He not only fixed the drawer, he confirmed it wasn’t overloaded by weight/amount of plates/bowls etc and continued his way around all the units adjusting the bin drawer and larder press. “Just good workmanship and he refused to take any payment. He was just sound.” That was not the only issue she had with her three-year-old kitchen. Her oven died and she went to Worrells/Expert in Malahide, Co Dublin, where she got “loads of advice and patience from Paul while we considered reconfiguring our oven(s) set-up – amending cabinetry. We didn’t in the end. “After admiring the workings of our brand new oven, I noticed the above fitted microwave door wasn’t closing properly and while he hadn’t moved it during the installation process the same guy came back to tweak the microwave for me free of charge.” And finally she tells us about “an absolute head-the-ball teenager [who] came in the exit gate of my local Dart station on a e-scooter with a girlfriend on the back, dressed in black and with no lights doing at least 30/40kph. “He screamed abuse so loud at me for bumping over his scooter, with such loud cursing that my husband left the platform and saw him leave the scene again, at speed on his scooter all at 7.30am in the dark while my car went into limp mode with sensors beeping and €1,300 worth of damage to the wheel arch, front bumper etc.” The car was repaired by “the lovely lads at Trimtech Santry who said this was a regular occurrence (and interestingly, a lot of parents were paying cash for the damage done by their unlit, uninsured and unregistered e-scooting teenagers – that’s a whole other article). “Picked up car, repaired and fully washed and fully internally valeted – so sound.” To finish, we have some shorter stories shared by users of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Meadbh had a “recent interaction with Virgin Media for TV and broadband. Admitted to the billing error straight up and rectified the situation straight away. People I spoke with were absolutely sound also.” Julie says: “I think Tesco Mobile deserve the recognition for their excellent customer service. I’m with them several years and any issues I’ve ever had were sorted nearly immediately with the utmost professionalism. Their customer service is fantastic.” David applied to renew his passport on a Thursday morning “and it arrived next morning”. You can’t beat that. Denise had praise for Bloomfield Garage on Dublin’s South Circular Road. “I rang them in a panic about warning light on the dashboard of an imported hybrid. My husband was just admitted to hospice, so I was already very emotional. The owner, Paul, said, ‘Right, come in and we’ll have a look’. It was only battery in key fob, but his kindness made my day.” Our weekly personal finance newsletter will give you the insight you need to save money and make smart spending decisions © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: SEC to Open Floodgates for Dual Share Classes

The agency granted approval to dozens of providers last week but reserved the right to bring future hearings. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com The Securities and Exchange Commission finally brought dual share classes to the masses … some of them, anyway. The SEC announced last week that it will allow dozens of issuers to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds and vice versa, so long as the SEC doesn’t order hearings against the applications. The move is the agency’s first announcement on the topic since November, when it approved Dimensional Fund Advisors’s proposal. Despite being largely expected, experts said the decision underscores the ongoing ETF boom and the expectation that ETF adoption by traditional money managers will increase. “Managers who were traditionally not in the ETF space, are now very much so in the ETF space,” said Rich Lee, head of program trading and execution strategy at Baird. “Approval for the share class [is] really going to be a huge igniter … It helps these managers get access to a channel that maybe they’ve not traditionally been in.” The primary benefits of a dual-share-class structure include tax efficiency and liquidity, as the benefits of an ETF wrapper are brought to mutual fund structures, and potentially to retirement accounts. But it won’t all be smooth sailing from here, Lee said, since many logistical and operational hurdles remain for traditional managers who haven’t had to learn the ins and outs of ETFs before. “[Some managers] may not be as familiar, or may not have direct firsthand experience with in-kind custom baskets,” he said, referring to how issuers can create baskets of securities and transfer them directly to whoever is redeeming shares, thus reducing taxes. “That’s going to be something managers are going to have to get comfortable with. It’s a new tool in their arsenal.” While larger managers likely have existing products or the resources in-house, smaller money managers may have to rely on the expertise of others to get their funds off the ground, he added. According to the SEC’s notice: Solid, Gas, Liquidity. Liquidity will be something to watch, Lee said, since many of these funds need to hold more cash or other liquid assets, which could cause an increase in underlying fees. “There’s more listed tickers for ETFs out there in the marketplace than there are actual single stock tickers,” he said. “It will be interesting to see what the impact of this influx of active managers doing custom in-kind baskets … has for balance sheets.” Allocations will go toward companies that exhibit favorable future estimates of cash flow, earnings per share, price targets and sales. Its two diversified bond ETFs can’t match the private-credit allocations of less-liquid vehicles, but they are beating 92% of peers. Avantis Investors reached the asset milestone during a big year of growth and a legal proceeding over naming rights. There are 11 ETFs with over 5% of assets allocated to the stock. But most assets are held in gigantic funds with small exposures. Unit investment trust no more, Invesco’s massive ETF will see revenue directed away from marketing — something the company has long wanted. With the average cost of health care regularly outpacing inflation, Americans are struggling to afford it. The fund is State Street’s way of tapping the retail market, but it might be the last new dominant S&P 500 entrant. A new legal standing for marijuana could help change how ETFs track and invest in the cannabis industry. The company is planning to add 10 target-maturity ETFs. Vanguard and State Street have also moved to fill out their bond-ladder lines. With more than $1.4 trillion in flows and more than 1,000 product launches, it’s safe to say the industry is booming. A new proposed ETF would hold bitcoin only after markets close. Wanna bet? ETFs aren’t for gambling, but a rise in risk-on products could prove irresistible to a population obsessed with sports betting. © 2025 The Daily Upside

PHOTO: CK HUTCHISON HOLDINGS LIMITED Published Dec 22, 2025, 09:03 AM Updated Dec 22, 2025, 08:28 PM HONG KONG - Mr Li Ka-shing and his family set in motion a series of deals in 2025 that stand to completely transform his business empire. a series of deals in 2025 The Hong Kong billionaire’s flagship conglomerate, CK Hutchison Holdings, is pursuing three major moves: an initial public offering of its retail arm to raise at least US$2 billion (S$2.6 billion) for its largest revenue contributor; a potential listing or partial sale of its global telecommunications operations; and talks to sell 43 port assets – representing the bulk of its global portfolio for more than US$19 billion in cash. The Li family, which controls about 30 per cent of CK Hutchison, believes selling and spinning off these businesses can unlock far greater value than the market currently assigns to them under the existing structure, a person familiar with the plans said. By separating the assets, the family hopes to fetch higher prices and narrow the steep discount at which the company trades relative to its net asset value. If CK Hutchison completes all these deals, it would have shed or spun off most of its core operating businesses, handing Mr Li’s elder son Victor Li – who now chairs the group – a fresh war chest to reshape the company in an era defined by trade tensions and technological disruption, including the rise of artificial intelligence. “The Li family has accumulated massive wealth over the past decades,” said Mr Vincent Lam, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based VL Asset Management. “The most important thing for the family now is to make sure that the wealth is monetised and safeguarded.” The moves mark a generational shift for one of Hong Kong’s most storied business empires. Mr Li Ka-shing built CK Hutchison into the world’s leading port operator and a major player in European telecommunications, leveraging political connections and riding on global expansion. Mr Victor Li, who took over in 2018, faces the challenge of steering the group through a far more volatile environment, where geopolitical sensitivities and regulatory hurdles loom large. In his heyday, Mr Li Ka-shing’s wealth ballooned as Hong Kong grew into an international financial hub, capitalising on China’s opening to a world that embraced collaboration and deepening trade ties. His uncanny sense of timing led to the nickname “Superman”. He expanded aggressively abroad – buying ports in Panama, building mobile networks in Britain and operating oil plants in Canada. By the early 2000s, he had built his group into the world’s largest port operator and the biggest Asian investor in European telecommunications. But the landscape has changed since Chinese President Xi Jinping assumed power, tightening the state’s grip on the private sector and keeping once-powerful tycoons at arm’s length. In Hong Kong, Mr Li Ka-shing and his peers are viewed with growing scepticism by Beijing, while abroad, his perceived ties with China have raised suspicions and created political hurdles for his operations – many of which sit in highly regulated industries. The Li family has lately found itself on the wrong side of the politics. The 97-year-old billionaire, who once rubbed shoulders with China’s top leaders, has fallen out of favour with President Xi. Over the past decade, state media has criticised him for selling assets in China and for remarks seen as sympathetic to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy youth. Beijing’s anger over CK Hutchison’s planned ports sale was so intense that state-owned firms were instructed to pause dealings with the Li family. “Li’s empire was built on intricate political connections he developed in the past,” said Mr Lam. “That’s not easy for Victor to inherit, because the world’s and China’s political environments have changed drastically.” According to people familiar with the family’s thinking, geopolitics was not a factor in the decision to pursue these deals. The Lis believe that restructuring the portfolio is the most effective way to bolster value. But regardless of the family’s motivations, US-China rivalry may now be the biggest obstacle to realising their plans. Talks over the ports sale have slowed amid regulatory hurdles and uncertainty surrounding the buying consortium’s structure, particularly after CK Hutchison invited China Cosco Shipping into negotiations to appease Beijing’s sensitivities over the involvement of US investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison invited China Cosco Shipping into negotiations Meanwhile, deliberations on the potential listing of retail arm A.S. Watson Group have been on-again, off-again since 2013, hampered by market volatility, while telecoms mergers frequently encounter intense antitrust scrutiny. CK Hutchison has been advised to move more cautiously with deals due to the delicate geopolitical environment, and to notify Chinese regulators on the potential retail listing because it involves operations in the country, a source said. Still, the potential deals have helped reverse depressed market sentiment, narrowing steep trading discounts to net asset value and driving a 32 per cent stock surge in 2025 – outperforming the benchmark Hang Seng Index. While the Li family is divesting CK Hutchison, it has been increasing its holdings in property arm CK Asset Holdings, now owning a stake of about 49 per cent. The bulk of CK Asset’s projects are located in Hong Kong and mainland China. It also operates British brewer and pub chain Greene King. “The Li family is bold in selling assets when the price is right,” said Natixis senior economist Gary Ng. “The series of moves can be a build-up of cash for acquisitions, leading to a sector shift in the company.” CK Hutchison is not alone in rethinking strategy. With Hong Kong’s global status diminished amid China’s growing influence and rising trade barriers, other storied business groups are also reshaping themselves. Jardine Matheson Holdings, a British-rooted conglomerate in Hong Kong, has been taking measures to modernise its management and accelerate divestments. Controlled for generations by the Keswick family, the 193-year-old group in recent years dismantled its long-criticised cross-shareholding structure and appointed several executives with private equity backgrounds to its top management. Its property unit, Hongkong Land Holdings, aims to raise US$10 billion over the next decade through asset disposals and spin-offs. The company is transitioning from being an owner-operator to a long-term, engaged investor, Jardine’s executive chairman Ben Keswick said in a statement for the group’s 2024 earnings report. Quiddity Advisors analyst David Blennerhassett said: “Both Jardine and CK operate conglomerates with various listed subsidiaries – and arguably they both are being proactive in extracting value.” BLOOMBERG E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Title: Bessent pressures companies, wealthy Americans to help bankroll ‘Trump accounts’ as favor to the prez

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is encouraging America’s wealthy and large corporations to finance the administration’s Trump Account investment program. “The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said Wednesday during a press conference on the initiative. “Given the amazing level of interest and the generous donations we have seen so far, I am confident we will see many more pouring in.” Trump accounts aim to give American citizens born from Jan. 1, 2025, through Dec. 31, 2028, an initial $1,000 in a tax-deferred investment account. That money is intended to give newborns a starter fund by the time they turn 18. It was a key provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, now known as the Working Families Tax Cut Act, that the president signed into law in July. Parents and guardians are permitted to donate up to $5,000 a year, and employees up to $2,500, until children become 18. With a limited long-term federal funding for Trump accounts, Bessent is urging large companies and America’s wealthy to step in and top off the nest egg before the program formally launches next summer. Earlier this month, Michael and Susan Dell committed to donating a massive $6.25 billion to the initiative, ensuring children aged 10 and under who were born before 2025 will get up to $250 in their accounts. Last week, hedge fund manager Ray Dalio announced he will donate $75 million to Trump accounts for children in his home state of Connecticut. Companies such as BlackRock, Charter Communications, Visa, Mastercard and Uber have similarly committed to making donations of their own. Bessent isn’t alone in seeking to nudge the private sector to step up. Earlier this month, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) inked a letter to the CEOs of every Fortune 1000 company pressing them to pony up. “By matching contributions for employees’ families, investing in the communities where you operate, or integrating these accounts into your philanthropic strategy, you can significantly enhance the impact of this historic initiative,” they wrote in the letter. Booker has long proposed setting up an investment account system for America’s youth, similar to Trump’s eponymous initiative. Meanwhile, Bessent is encouraging states to step up as well. “The administration has been working closely with a number of governors to determine the best way states can work with the federal government to expand access to Trump accounts,” Bessent revealed last week. “Thus far, 20 states are considering topping-up the accounts.” Advertisement

Title: Tokenization will disrupt finance faster than digital disrupted media: Crypto exec

Putting real-world assets onchain opens up new markets, increases capital velocity and democratizes access to finance, advocates say. Tokenization will transform the financial industry faster than digital technology disrupted legacy media, such as print newspapers, physical copies of music and other analog formats, according to Keith Grossman, president of crypto payments company MoonPay. “While many feared digitization would destroy media, what it actually did was force its evolution,” Grossman said, adding that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, the process of representing traditional assets onchain, will force traditional institutions to adapt. He added: Financial incumbents like Citi, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and others will continue to exist in a different form, Grossman said, much like media companies continued to exist after the shift to digital distribution in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which disrupted business models that worked for decades. Ultimately, the survivors and winners of the ongoing shift toward tokenized finance will be those companies that get ahead of the change and not those that attempt to stop the inevitable shift to a global financial system powered through blockchain rails, he said. Related: Wall Street’s $4 quadrillion backbone to roll out tokenized US Treasurys Tokenizing real-world assets carries several benefits, including enabling 24/7 access to markets, making asset classes global in scale, cheaper transaction costs through disintermediation, and lowering settlement times to minutes, instead of days. In September, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a joint statement on creating a regulatory framework to enable 24/7 capital markets. The financial system shifting to 24/7 trading represents a major departure from how traditional markets, which close on nights, weekends and holidays, currently operate. In December, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a settlement and clearing company that processed about $3.7 quadrillion in settlement volume in 2024, received approval from the SEC to start offering tokenized financial instruments. The DTCC plans to roll out tokenized assets in the second half of 2026, starting with US Treasuries and stock indexes.

With Netflix and Paramount both vying to buy Warner Bros Discovery, the suits of the entertainment industry are on manoeuvres in Washington, seeking a kindly nod from US president Donald Trump for their billion-dollar proposals. An Irish person is involved. Gail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the antitrust division of the all-powerful US Department of Justice is, conveniently for this column, from Dalkey, south Co Dublin. The UCD law graduate retains dual citizenship and is generating increased attention in the US as she wrestles with a slate of high-profile mergers. It’s a mixed picture for corporate bigwigs under Trump 2: some of the tough love dispensed by Joe Biden’s then-32-year-old anti-monopoly watchdog Lina Khan has dissipated and companies have resumed eating each other in pursuit of economies of scale. But that’s not necessarily popular among the meat-and-potatoes Maga masses. Slater is married to a former chief of staff to a Republican congressman from Idaho and worked as an adviser on big tech in the first Trump White House. She cuts a relatively hardline figure and has made clear that she believes in “America First antitrust”, which means standing up for “Main Street not Wall Street”, as Trump has put it in the past. The job is made harder, as the New York Times has pointed out, by the fact that Trump himself keeps taking positions on matters before the court, including saying he would be “involved” in the decision on the proposed Netflix-Warner merger. “I think a big challenge for Gail is, how impulsive will the president be?” William Kovacic, a former mergers watchdog, told Politico in a profile of Slater. “You can’t say, ‘My God, shut up,’ because then you’re fired. So you cross your fingers and hope you’re not a target.” Another person making waves abroad is author Stephen Rea – not the actor, though equally from Belfast – who has just published Ozzy & Me, a memoir of his relationship with Ozzy Osbourne. Rea grew up during the height of the Troubles and amid the chaos, including an incident during which his house was shot at by gunmen, he found refuge in music. Controversial Irish-language electro-rap troupes had not yet been invented at that stage, so he turned to the next best thing: heavy metal. Aged 15, he noticed a music magazine write-up of Rock in Rio, a giant metal festival featuring Ozzy, AC/DC and Queen set to take place in Brazil. His father, in the most magnanimous decision ever made by the father of a teenager, said they should go. Perplexed as to how to go about this, his mother wrote to Osbourne’s secretary, who promptly responded with VIP passes. Rea went, met Osbourne and struck up a 40-year friendship with the family. Rea, whose demonstrable ability to take a leap of faith has most recently taken him to New Orleans, secured a foreword from Jack Osbourne, who watchers of early 2000s MTV reality show The Osbournes will remember as Ozzy’s son, though watchers of a more recent reality TV show, I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, might know him better from that. Through decades of the metal hero’s career, Rea is in the room where it happens. At one point, in 1980s Glasgow, he recounts: “By 4am we were down to Randy [Rhoads, the bombastic lead guitarist], Geezer [Butler, bassist for both Black Sabbath and Ozzy’s solo material] , Ozzy, and me,” with “Randy throwing glasses against the wall and Geezer belting out Irish Catholic rebel tunes, Ozzy joining in though he didn’t know them.” Ozzy promises to write one for Rea. “That would have gone down well with my Protestant friends and family,” he muses. Good news for the groups of English men who often descend on Dublin to drink pints and shout at each other: JD Wetherspoon has cut a deal to supply Guinness to its Irish outlets. The divisive UK pub group, which trades on its low prices and impressive locations, has served the black stuff in Britain for a long time alongside its various curry deals and halves of Old Peculier (correct). But early in its foray into the Irish market in 2014, it decided that St James’s Gate was charging too much for its stout and struck it from the menu at the Three Tun Tavern in Blackrock, south Dublin. Almost 12 years later, the deal has finally been done for its six outlets. Overheard rarely seeks refreshment at such establishments. But Guinness has been on a dramatic upsurge in popularity at home and abroad in recent years, with the Guardian even recently predicting that it will soon lose its cool in the UK – a sure sign it’s on a high. It must be surprising to stag party attendees and lost locals, therefore, to show up to Wetherspoons establishments only to be told they can’t have it, mere miles from its birthplace. A press release promises it’ll be on the menu imminently – although, of course, there are 6,000 other places you could get it all along. One tourist to Dublin this week was Greta Thunberg, the globally famous Swedish climate-and-Gaza activist who visited Áras an Uachtaráin and got up to various other activities related to her Palestinian solidarity activities. Thunberg has had a busy year, having sailed on a flotilla towards Gaza, near which she was intercepted and detained by Israel, alleging harsh treatment. A broad smile and a warm welcome from the President, therefore, given their similar interests. Overheard’s eye was caught by a striking battle scene in a painting behind Catherine Connolly and her activist visitor at Áras an Uachtaráin as they posed together. It depicts the Battle of Ballinahinch, an engagement in the 1798 rebellion. Painted by Thomas Robinson, its original title is Combat Between the King’s Troops and the Peasantry at Ballinahinch, and it is a contemporary depiction of the engagement, which saw the Presbyterian-led Co Down rebels take on the crown. Some 4,000 United Irishmen under Henry Munro lost the battle (and ultimately the war). Robinson – an English painter of Irish subjects who wowed the critics in Belfast and Dublin before dying in Jervis Street in 1810 – painted it up and it was raffled off. The Marquess of Hertford won it, but ultimately it came to the Office of Public Works (OPW) – and to the Áras, where the Lord Lieutentant Marquess Cornwallis might have mulled his troop movements many years ago. Still, despite early defeats the rebels, like President Connolly after her knockback in the Galway Labour Party, claimed victory in the end to some degree. Thunberg, aged just 22, has time yet. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Letters: State funding for penniless artists is always money well spent

Comedians can now apply for . Photo: Getty Madam — I write in response to Aidan Harte’s letter (‘Sinn Féin goes beyond satire by embracing subsidised comedy’, December 14). I have followed efforts by the members of the Irish comedy community, particularly Ailish McCarthy, to have comedy recognised as an art form. Mr Harte referred to “new spending”, but there is as yet no indication of this. What has changed is comedians can now apply for grants, along with playwrights, dancers, sculptors and painters. Until now, they were simply dismissed, because the legislation hadn’t included the word “comedy”. Incidentally, Mr Harte expressed a preference for right-wing comedy. I would encourage him to write a few right-wing zingers and pop along to an open mic and give them a go. The public will let him know if they’re funny. In terms of public funding, it’s true that not every piece of art is going to be a masterpiece, but the fact that the Arts Council supports the attempt is a good inclination towards the society I want to live in. Besides, the most successful music, art, film, video games and so on are built on the backs of fringe, often penniless, artists trying something that might inspire people. The penniless part is important there. The Basic Income for the Arts is a much-needed lifeline for the few individuals who have so far benefited from it. It was not “pushed through with little scrutiny” as Mr Harte suggested; it was trialled over an extended period, with success. There is an organisation called Minding Creative Minds that has data on just how high the rates of depression and suicide are in the arts, and it is staggering. If Basic Income for the Arts will not fix that altogether, but if it lifts the pressure and darkness off a handful of individuals and gives them the space to pay their rent and put food in their bellies and pursue the art that the very heart of them demands they do, then I think it’s an incredibly worthwhile investment. Why make it any harder for the people who just want to paint for you, or dance for you, or make you laugh? Aidan O’Sullivan, Dublin Madam — I am aghast at Ciara Kelly’s column (‘Ceasefire in Gaza may be imperfect, but to what end do we boycott and sanction Israel after the peace plan has been brokered?’, Life, December 14). I am incredulous that anyone believes now is the time to ease pressure on Benjamin Netanya­hu’s regime, simply because there’s a faux ceasefire in place that Israel violates every day. The point of sanctioning and boycotting this regime isn’t about “punishing them” for the last two years. It’s beyond belief that any observer or comment­ator on the Middle East would suggest this. The so-called ceasefire and peace plan are designed to do nothing more than encourage journalists like Ciara to write articles like the one published last week, to encourage people to move on: nothing to see here any more. We can’t move on, because that’s what the Israeli regime wants us to do. We can’t move on because the genocide, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, human rights violations, breaches of international law, building of settlements, terrorism by sett­lers, land grabbing, abuse and torture of hostages (described by our media as “detainees”, including children), controlled starvation of Gazans continues. Sanctions allied with econo­mic, social, cultural and sporting boycotts of this disgusting regime are not just the only way to bring pressure on Netanyahu’s genocidal regime and bring about change in Israel; they are also the only morally respon­sible thing to do. Brendan Farrell, Kildare Madam — Hours after reading Michael Jordan’s egregious letter (December 14), the news came through of the Islamist killings at a Jewish gathering on Bondi Beach in Sydney, celebrating Hanukkah. Michael Jordan has a problem with Jews living in Israel, their biblical homeland, where, in spite of historical expulsions and dispersions, there remained throughout history a Jewish presence. It is not possible to be anti- Zionist, anti-Israel and not be anti-Jewish. Israel, with a 77pc Jewish population, is not “an ethno­cracy”, unless the Republic of Ireland with a non-immigrant population of 78pc can be classed as such. On the contrary, both are democratic states. Ena Keye, Rathfarnham, Dublin Madam — Last Sunday, I read a letter to the editor by Michael Jordan, denying Jews the right to a homeland of their own, followed by learning of another example of “globalising the intifada” on Bondi Beach. It is sad to see the lack of historical knowledge and empathy about why Jews had to establish their own state. Frank Devine, Kenilworth, Warwickshire Madam — While the late justice minister Paddy Cooney was a great “law and order” man during the 1970s (‘Fine Gael TD and Justice Minister renowned for hard line on IRA during Troubles’, December 14), he was also liberal. The prevailing Adoption Act, a relic of 1952 as amended, in effect prevented childless couples in “mixed marriages” where one spouse was Catholic and the other of any other or no religion from adopting a child. It was the product of a very Catholic Ireland and was self-­evidently ­unconstitutional, because the State may not discriminate on grounds of ­religion. As one of a mixed marriage, albeit with our own children, I was conscious of the wounds that would befall couples in childless, mixed marriages who were not permitted to adopt. So, as a newbie to politics, I moved a proposal at the Fine Gael annual conference in Cork in June, 1972, calling for reform of the Adoption Act. It was approved. Two years later, in 1974, Mr Cooney successfully introduced the reforming legislation. Today, the civil act of adopting a child is free of religious impediment. John F Colgan, Leixlip, Co Kildare Madam — I was told in my local pharmacy last week that doses of the flu vaccine were in short supply, due to demand. So why are the HSE and the Medical Council not doing more to advocate the use of face masks and more vigorous hand-sanitising? One of the most effective ways of containing flu or any other infective virus this Christmas is to wear a mask, especial­ly in crowded places or on public transport. Often the most effective solutions are the simplest. Brian Lube, Co Meath Madam — While having sympathy for people who have gender dysphoria, a solely ­activist-led approach to care would be no way to run any medical programme, which should be based on scientific evidence (‘I bear the scars of a healthcare system that fails trans people’, December 7). As the Cass Report noted, social transition is “not a neutral act”. Children do not have the capacity to consent to puberty blockers and opposite sex hormones that will affect their fertility and health for life. Trans activists may claim to want bodily autonomy, and may be supported by “progressive” politicians, but I do not think our poorly resourced health service should be removing breasts and mutilating the genitals of healthy adults, just because someone requests it. Medicine and medical treatments should always be evidence-based and doctors should “do no harm”. Helen Robinson, Blackrock, Dublin Madam — While “peace and goodwill to all men” is the order of the day at Christmas, let us not forget our little feathered friends seeking shelter from the cold wintry winds, severe frost, foggy nights and heavy rain in our garden hedgerows. Looking out at our bird-feeder one day recently and discovering it was empty, I immediately topped it up. Almost instantly, the birds emerged from their many hiding places and descended at speed to gobble up the food. As I sat at a discreet distance, observing them as they ate heartily, a cock robin perched close by, observing the feeding frenzy, master of all he surveyed. So, as the robin adorns our greetings cards at Christmas, let us not forget our little feathered friends who come to stay with us each year, and provide them all with a generous helping of goodies each day. Tom Towey, Cloonacool, Co Sligo Madam — I agree with Sarah Breen that Australia has the right idea with its social media ban for under-16s (‘Let’s follow Australia on social media’, Dec­ember 14). As a clinician for more than 25 years, I have seen that the number of young people att­ending counselling has exponentially risen as a result of the use of phones. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Madam — Has the role of the RTÉ Guide been usurped by the Sunday Independent? Four articles over three pages (including the front page) in last Sundays paper — are people really interested in the employment arrangements of those highly paid individuals in Montrose? Harry Mulhern, Dublin 13 Madam — It’s impressive for any institution to last 120 years, but for a newspaper it borders on heroic (‘120 years of Sundays — and some things stay the same’, December 14). The Sunday Independent has survived revolutions, censorship, political fury and commercial pressure. That alone deserves congratulations. As a child at Tullysaran Chapel, I remember the papers laid out for sale on a Sunday morning: the Sunday Independent and the Sunday Press, two confident piles. No imported English scandal sheets shouting for attention, just Irish voices arguing loudly with one another. It felt like a small but important civic ritual. Over its 120 years, the Sunday Independent has informed, irritated and occasionally infuriated its readers. I read pieces that make me want to spit. That is the point. Democracy is not meant to be soothing, and freedom of speech rarely is. At a time when governments dodge scrutiny and tech olig­archs would prefer not to be accountable at all, it is journalists, in the Sunday Independent and elsewhere, who continue to ask the awkward questions. They do so under pressure, often under attack, and with diminishing resources. They deserve more credit than they get. Long may the Sunday Independent endure, and long may there be a free, unfettered press that refuses to behave itself. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran, Co Armagh Madam — In the vein of former Sunday Independent editor and fellow Kerryman Aengus Fanning’s diktat of “tell it as it is, no matter what the cost”, outlined in Liam Collins’s lively reflection of over a century of publication, I’d like to add my own tuppence worth. A few months ago, an acquaintance asked was I the McElligott that “writes” in the Sunday Indepen­dent. I replied bashfully that I have been known to fire off the odd missive. Wishing all your readers and my fellow wordsmiths a very happy Christmas. Tom McElligott, Tournageehy, Co Kerry Madam — Eoin O’Malley’s column (‘When politicians have to plead with judges, democracy is in danger’, December 14) frames the debate about the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) as a “fight” between elected politicians and an “ideologically committed” judiciary. The contention that judiciary activism is at fault for the curr­ent deadlock is to understate the political disagreements between the 46 members of the Council of Europe. A meeting is planned for next for May to discuss the application of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Normally, there would be behind-the-door diplomacy and compromise before the summit. These negotiations would form the basis of a political declaration, which the conference would ratify. The recent politic­al declaration by 26 countries, including Ireland, was high-stakes diplomacy. It is an expli­cit acknowledgment that there is significant discord. It was not a plea to the judges. It was a public power play for the May meeting. It was significant that countries such as France, Germany and Spain did not sign it. The COE statute requires “important matters”, such as political declarations, to be unanimous. A “decision” on the interpretation of the convention by the ECtHR requires a two-thirds majority, or 31 members. Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Madam — Bernie Linnane refers to “the compassionate, accepting and kind Irish public who decided to trust women (regarding abortion) to make their own decision about their own bodies” (Letters, December 14). I wonder how these people view the shocking fact that more than 50,000 abortions have taken place here since the 2018 referendum, despite assur­ances by the Yes side that they would be “rare”. Mary Stewart, Ardeskin, Donegal town Madam — The picture of a seated Donald Trump shaking hands with Zohran Mamdanmi accompanying Declan Lynch’s column (‘To stand up to Trump, all we need is a backbone’, December 14) raises two protocol issues. One should not remain seated while shaking hands, nor should one place one’s free hand on top of the one involved in the “shake”. Mind you, I doubt if Donald would even consider holding up his hands and admitting his gaffe. In summary, a whole lot of shaking going wrong. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont Dublin 9 Madam — Like Gerry Hickey (Letters, December 14), I have had my fill of filler phrases like “you know”. But it’s the ubiquitous “in relation to” that comes out tops with me, often occurring multiple times in the same media utterance by seasoned communicators. Tony O’Neill, Bishopstown, Co Cork Madam — I find it bemusing that politicians, chief execut­ives and others of that ilk always seem to find it necessary to start an answer with the phrase: “Let me be quite clear.” I have never heard any interviewer finish a question by stating: “I want total lack of clarity in your response.” So let’s have no more “Let me be quite clear” and just be clear.

Title: Analyzing Ethereum’s price rebound as BlackRock shifts $109M in ETH

Large ETH transfers surfaced after the rally, but conviction across markets stayed thin. Ethereum’s recent rebound attracted institutional and whale attention, with several large holders moving ETH to exchanges after the rally. The activity followed ETH’s sharp move higher after the Bank of Japan’s 25 basis point rate hike. That behavior raised questions over whether large players expected near-term downside or were simply rotating capital after gains. Crypto transaction tracker Onchain Lens reported on X that BlackRock deposited 36,579 ETH, worth about $108.4 million, into Coinbase over the past 24 hours. The post also showed that BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes sent 680 ETH, valued near $2.03 million, to Binance, a move often associated with potential selling. Whale activity often draws attention because large transfers can influence short-term price direction. Traders frequently track these wallets for clues around sentiment shifts or liquidity needs. At press time, Ethereum [ETH] traded near $2,980, up about 0.85% over 24 hours. Spot market participation, however, weakened during the same period. Trading volume fell 52% to roughly $18.47 billion, suggesting limited conviction behind the move. That slowdown contrasted with derivatives positioning. Even so, Open Interest rose 2.46% to $38.51 billion, indicating traders added leveraged positions despite muted spot activity. That divergence suggested positioning rather than organic demand drove recent price stability. AMBCrypto’s technical analysis on the daily chart revealed that ETH was consolidating in a tight range between $2,790 and $3,000. Meanwhile, the broader market structure remains in a downward trend. Source: TradingView Based on the price action, a major rally in ETH would likely be possible only if it breaks out of this tight consolidation range. If the broader trend continues and the price breaches and closes a daily candle below the $2,790 level, it could trigger strong downside momentum. Conversely, if the trend shifts and the altcoin closes a daily candle above the $3,000 level, it could signal an end to the prolonged downward momentum. Besides these key levels, the momentum strength indicator Average Directional Index (ADX) has reached 30.39, above the key threshold of 25, indicating a strong directional trend in the asset. Meanwhile, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has further reinforced the bearish outlook, as its value dropped to -0.05, signaling rising selling pressure and capital outflows from the asset.

Title: Brazil’s Largest Asset Manager Recommends Investors Put Up to 3% of their Money in Bitcoin to Hedge Against FX, Market Shocks
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/brazils-largest-asset-manager-recommends-investors-put-up-to-3-of-their-money-in-bitcoin-to-hedge-against-fx-market-shocks/
Time Published: 2025-12-20T17:00:00Z

The recommendation is in line with other global asset managers like BlackRock and Bank of America suggesting small portfolio allocations to the largest cryptocurrency. Brazil’s largest privately-owned asset manager, Itáu Asset Management, has recommended investors allocate 1% to 3% of their portfolios to bitcoin. In a year-end note, Renato Eid, head of beta strategies and responsible investment for Itaú Asset Management, argued that bitcoin’s lack of correlation with traditional local assets makes it a useful diversification tool. The note echoes the bitcoin allocations recommended by other major asset managers. Earlier this month, Bank of America greenlit wealth advisors to recommend a BTC allocation of up to 4%, while BlackRock has pointed to 2%. Eid emphasized a measured approach, not turning crypto into the centerpiece of a portfolio but using it as a complementary asset that can help absorb shocks from currency depreciation and global volatility. “The idea is not to make cryptoassets the core of the portfolio but to include them as a complementary component — sized appropriately to the investor’s risk profile,” Eid wrote. This year, bitcoin surged to a record near $125,000 before falling back to around $90,000. For local investors, the ride was even bumpier due to currency fluctuations. Products like BITI11, a bitcoin ETF traded in Brazil, saw their performance in reais affected by the weakening fiat currency. But in periods of stress, such as late 2024, the global nature of BTC provided some insulation. Eid warned against trying to time the market and suggested a disciplined, long-term mindset. A small, steady exposure to bitcoin, he says, can act as a partial hedge and offer access to global returns, especially as traditional asset correlations become less reliable. “It calls for moderation and discipline: set a strategic slice (for example, 1%–3% of the total portfolio), keep a long-term horizon and resist the temptation to react to short-term noise,” Eid wrote.
