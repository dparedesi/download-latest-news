Title: Bitcoin At $1 Million? CEO Says It’s The Price To Beat Gold

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to CNBC’s Power Lunch, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz thinks Bitcoin could climb all the way to $1 million per coin if big institutions keep piling in. The cryptocurrency hit a weekly peak of $110,290 on Tuesday. It slipped 4.5% to $104,300 by Thursday, but it’s still climbed 1.75% over the past seven days. Novogratz says this isn’t just hype. He points to firms moving cash from dollars and gold into crypto. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) went live in January 2024 after SEC approval. Based on reports, that fund now gives big investors a straightforward path to own Bitcoin without buying coins directly. BlackRock manages about $11.6 trillion in assets. When a player that size steps in, others notice. Novogratz says wealth managers and pension funds have started treating Bitcoin like a macro asset, on par with gold and the S&P 500. Treasury companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to follow suit. Retail investors keep buying, too, thanks to easier trading apps and ETFs like IBIT. A handful of public companies have raised millions to buy Bitcoin outright. According to filings, Metaplanet, the Blockchain Group, GameStop, and US President Donald Trump’s Media arm all announced major purchases this year. Their moves chip away at the 21 million-coin supply, making each remaining Bitcoin scarcer. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is hard-wired into its code. Gold, by comparison, has a market worth north of $12 trillion and sees about 1–2% new supply each year through mining. Novogratz argues that younger investors will choose a capped digital asset over a metal bar. That switch isn’t guaranteed, but once people see Bitcoin as a store of value, its appeal could grow. At today’s $2 trillion market cap, Bitcoin has room to expand many times over if it ever rivals gold. Regulators remain a wildcard. The SEC green-lit IBIT, but future rules on taxes or derivatives could slow things down. Bitcoin’s price swings make it riskier than bonds or gold. Institutions often chase stable returns, and Bitcoin pays no dividends or interest. Finally, moving another $10 trillion into crypto would need a massive shift in asset allocations. That kind of inflow isn’t impossible, but it won’t happen overnight. Based on reports, Novogratz sees Bitcoin’s march toward gold’s market cap as a “ball rolling down a hill.” He predicts that, over time, Bitcoin will match gold and then outpace it.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Gold, long considered a safe haven, beckoned investors seeking safety from the escalating Middle East conflict. Bitcoin, often touted as digital gold, instead joined the exodus of risk assets. "The traditional buyers of gold are not in the crypto market yet,” Stephen Wundke, director of strategy and revenue at quantitative digital asset investment firm Algoz, told Decrypt. He added that gold buyers are “risk-off investors who will return to the safe haven that is gold, as they see it, whenever there is potential conflict." Though gold is up over 2% on the day, Wundke thinks this is "hardly a rush to cover," adding that Bitcoin, for one, had been falling "well before there was any news of the strike on Iran." Data from CoinGecko show that the price of Bitcoin plunged 3.6% to $103,900 Friday morning as initial reports that Israel launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities came in. At the same time, gold leapt to $3,427.90 per ounce, showing how the two assets diverge during a geopolitical crisis. It is up 7% in the past month and more than 46% year-to-date, data from Trading Economics indicate. "Bitcoin is sometimes seen as a safe haven, but in reality, it often moves in line with tech stocks rather than gold," Jay Jo, senior research analyst at Tiger Research, told Decrypt. "Because of this coupling, Bitcoin and gold can show opposite price trends during geopolitical crises." While the smoke hasn't settled, altcoins including Ethereum, XRP, and Solana tapped over $1 billion in liquidations, most of which are in long positions. Meanwhile, traditional safe havens, including gold, the U.S. dollar, and government bonds, attracted flight-to-safety flows as investors dumped risk assets. "Fundamentals are more at play with BTC than problems in the Middle East, at the moment," Wundke noted, adding that June is "traditionally a quiet month for BTC" and that the market appears to be "in a consolidation phase." Still, Wundke argued that if "any significant escalation in the Middle East" occurs, it might affect Bitcoin and send it breaking below $100,000. Sentiment has slipped over the past day; although the Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently sits at 61, indicating greed, it's down 10 points on the day—and over 81% of predictors on Myriad expect it to hold below 64 through the end of the week. (Disclaimer: decentralized on-chain prediction market Myriad was launched by Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN) Bitcoin's younger, more leverage-prone investor base might have contributed to the selloff intensity, with some noting that a shift is underway. "The bull case becomes [that] over time, young people care about it more than old people," Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz claimed in a CNBC interview Friday. Gold "slowly gets replaced by Bitcoin" as the alpha crypto has increasingly become an institutionalized "macro asset," he added. Citing weighted demand from financial institutions such as BlackRock, Novogratz said that interest in Bitcoin as a macro-asset could be likened to "a ball rolling downhill."

Title: Bitcoin To Replace Gold As Store Of Value And Hit $1 Million, Predicts Mike Novogratz

Former Goldman Sachs partner and Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz remains one of the most prominent Bitcoin bulls in finance. Novogratz has now joined the $1 million per Bitcoin (BTC) bandwagon, suggesting that the OG cryptocurrency could 10X and break that milestone if it continues to grow in popularity and surpass gold. Appearing on CNBC’s Power Lunch on Thursday, Mike Novogratz said he foresees a seven-figure moonshot for the premier cryptocurrency. Novogratz’s main rationale for anticipating Bitcoin’s potential 1,000% growth is based on the crypto’s increasing institutional adoption as a macro asset. “Now we’ve got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we’ve got sovereign wealth buying Bitcoin, we’ve got retail investors buying Bitcoin, there’s easier ways to get it,” he quipped. “So the adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset, as an asset to save money in, I think that’s now a ball rolling down hill.” BlackRock is perhaps the most notable example of institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset. The $11 trillion asset manager’s spot BTC exchange-traded fund has amassed approximately 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply for its clients since going live in January 2024. The iShares Bitcoin Trust currently holds more than $70 billion in assets under management. Novogratz further suggested that the increasing adoption will ensure Bitcoin catches up with gold. According to the pundit, younger investors would buy Bitcoin over gold, with the supply-capped digital asset replacing the yellow metal over time: “If you look at gold’s market cap and Bitcoin’s market cap, Bitcoin has a long way to go, 10x, and so that’s [$1 million] Bitcoin just to be where gold is.” Novogratz is not the first Bitcoin bull to predict that Bitcoin will appreciate significantly in value over the long term. In April, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest raised its bull-case Bitcoin price projection to $2.4 million by 2030, up from a previous projection of $1.5 million. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said last month that BTC could break $1 million by 2028, thanks to strong tailwinds including a likely outflow of foreign investment and devaluation of the huge stock of the US Treasury. Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has also, on multiple occasions, shared his thoughts on how high he thinks the price of Bitcoin could rocket to.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. From their Manhattan headquarters on Thursday, top BlackRock leaders—including Chief Executive Larry Fink, who had just flown back to New York after a trip to the Middle East—lined up to discuss their business with investors and analysts over five hours of presentations. The goal: to show why they think BlackRock is a stock worth owning. They were gathered for the company’s investor day, complete with 147 slides packed with fresh five-year financial targets for fund-raising, revenue, and more. The firm’s last investor day was in 2023. BlackRock has ambitious goals. Over the next five years, the company aims to roughly double its operating income to $15 billion, double its market capitalization to $280 billion, and increase revenue, which in 2024 totaled $20 billion, by 75% to $35 billion. It’s targeting organic base fee growth of at least 5%, and an operating margin of at least 45%, “through the market cycle." Private markets will be a big part of BlackRock’s growth. The world’s largest money manager, with $11.6 trillion of assets, is now targeting $400 billion of private markets fund-raising by 2030 as it aims for technology and private markets businesses to contribute at least 30% of overall revenue by that year. That’s up from a 15% slice in 2024. “Bold, but doable ambitions," said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr. BlackRock’s fresh targets sets new stakes for the performance expected from the $28 billion of private markets acquisitions it’s carried out in the past year. They paint a picture of an asset manager betting its future on private markets after making its name in the public markets with fixed income and exchange-traded funds. “We’re not reliant on any one strategy or asset class," said Martin Small, BlackRock’s chief financial officer and head of corporate strategy, in prepared remarks. “All of our businesses have delivered organic base fee growth over the last five years. That said, the BlackRock of the next five years, to 2030, is different than the past." Trading at 24 times earnings, investors assign BlackRock’s stock a lower multiple than shares of pure private markets players Blackstone and KKR, which trade at 42 times and 54 times earnings, respectively. Investors could start to view BlackRock’s stock as a play for exposure to assets such as private credit and infrastructure, not just its best-known products in the public markets like exchange-traded funds. “Are we in direct competition with Blackstone? I would say, in their two core businesses, no. But in other areas of private [assets], where we have deemed we have an incredible opportunity, [yes]," Fink said in an interview with Barron’s in March. He added at the time: “I have no intention of going into private equity" with any large-scale acquisition. “I have no intention of being huge in real estate." For now, investors seemed underwhelmed by what they heard Thursday. Shares of BlackRock fell 0.4% while the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. That slide is typical of the firm’s investor days. In 2018, 2021, and 2023—the past three such events held by the firm—the stock fell 1.1%, 0.4%, and 0.5% before recovering those losses the following session, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Title: This AI platform is drastically changing how major financial firms do business: ‘Like having a really capable intern’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/06/13/business/hebbias-founder-is-helping-blackrock-kkr-and-the-air-force-embrace-ai/
Time Published: 2025-06-13T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
George Sivulka — the 27-year-old founder and CEO of AI platform Hebbia — is supplying artificial intelligence to those with more information than time, and millions, if not billions, on the line. Since starting the company in 2020, his client list has grown to include BlackRock, KKR, the U.S. Air Force, Centerview Partners, MetLife, Gunderson Dettmer, Oak Hill and TowerBrook, among others. “The CEOs that get to the [top of these firms] know that innovation could either [elevate] their companies to even bigger levels or completely disrupt their market position,” Sivulka told NYNext. “And so, we’re partnering at the board level for massive transformational projects … really help[ing] them think through how they’re going to [embrace] change.” While popular AI applications such as ChatGPT are largely transactional — a user issues a prompt, the model responds and then the conversation ends — Hebbia’s models are tailor-made, persistent, process-oriented and evolve through repeated use. Agents — autonomous AI programs trained to mirror how a firm works — can execute customized workflows, asynchronously, non-stop. An analyst at a private equity firm could instruct their agent to analyze a target company’s filings, build comps, generate a valuation model in Excel and prepare a draft investor memo — all within a single query loop. But the analyst isn’t being replaced, they’re being freed up from repetitive work so they can “focus on more interesting, investigative or curious tasks,” Sivulka told NYNext. “It’s almost like having a really capable intern.” Sivulka initially planned to pursue a career in academia, not business. He spent nearly a decade at Stanford, earning his undergraduate and master’s degrees before enrolling in a fully funded PhD program. Over the years, he saw innumerable peers leave for white-collar jobs and come back disillusioned. They had secured high-paying, high-powered gigs, yet they spent their days copying data into slides or skimming dense filings for small insights. “Some of the smartest people in the world were doing some of the stupidest tasks,” Sivulka said. So he dropped out, moved into a closet in East Palo Alto, and started working on what would become Hebbia. Each morning he would wake up, code for 16 hours and cold-call prospective clients. This was back before the world had heard of ChatGPT, when AI was still a murky and misunderstood term. Most investors didn’t bite at his ideas for intelligence tools, but eventually, a few did: Peter Thiel, Mike Volpi at Index, and later, Andreessen Horowitz growth partner Alex Immerman. Sivulka ultimately decided to base Hebbia in New York City’s SoHo neighborhood to get away from the pervasive “groupthink” of the Bay Area. He relishes being near to those he and his growing team are making tools for. “We’re in New York [because] there’s nothing like actually being able to understand user pain, to be on the floor with our customers,” he said. Just as Zoom made offices location-agnostic, Sivulka thinks AI will make companies compositionally agnostic. The new normal won’t just be in-person or remote, “You’ll have hybrid teams of AI agents and humans.” This story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC’s power players (and those who aspire to be). He notes that in recent decades, despite software services and cloud platforms, productivity per employee hasn’t changed much. He believes AI has the power to finally move the needle, dramatically changing how companies work. “AI is actually delivering hours and hours of time savings,” he said. “We’re seeing tangible results.” Send NYNext a tip: nynextlydia@nypost.com Advertisement

Title: Private equity wants in on your 401(k). What you need to know before investing | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/business/private-equity-401k-investing-explained
Time Published: 2025-06-13T09:30:03Z
Full Content:
Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Chances are very good that your 401(k) does not currently offer you access to private equity investments, which, as the name implies, are investments in companies that are not publicly traded. The question is, will that change in the next few years? And, if it does, is it worth it for you to invest? Large company pension plans and university endowments — both of which have very long time horizons — have invested for years in private equity and private debt funds. But 401(k)s typically haven’t offered those options to plan participants. In November 2024, only 2.4% of 401(k) sponsors said they added a private equity investment option to their plan, according to a weekly poll question from the Plan Sponsor Council of America. That may be because employers are afraid of potential lawsuits if they include those options, which typically charge investors more than investment funds in public companies. And under the Employment Retirement Security Act (ERISA), employers have a fiduciary duty to ensure that investment options in your 401(k) are prudent and have reasonable fees, said Jerry Schlichter, founding partner of Schlichter Bogard, who pioneered lawsuits against plan sponsors for charging excess 401(k) fees. It also may be because private assets are riskier to invest in and information about them is opaque, since they’re private. So there is less of a requirement to be transparent with investors about how a fund is doing on a regular basis. In addition, private capital options are considered illiquid investments because you can’t take your money out whenever you want. And that may prove too constraining for retirement plan participants, who may need access to their 401(k) money for any number of reasons — including changing or losing a job, Schlichter said. There has been an increasing push to provide more private capital investment opportunities for retail investors and participants in workplace retirement plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s. On the regulatory front, according to Jaret Seiberg, a financial services policy analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, the Trump administration is likely to make it easier to access so-called alternative investments, which include private equity, private real estate and hedge funds. That could result in an executive order from the president requiring government agencies to expand access to such investments as well as rulemaking or guidance from the Department of Labor — which enforces ERISA — “to expand the ability of individuals to invest in 401(k) and IRA accounts in alternative investments,” Seiberg said in a daily research note. There are far fewer public companies today than there were 30 years ago, as more companies remain private. For that reason, some say, if investors want to own the whole market and have a truly diversified portfolio, where some asset classes move up when others move down, they should have access both to public and private companies. In a recent conversation with Morningstar, BlackRock chief operating officer Robert Goldstein noted that the performances of publicly traded stocks and bonds have become more correlated than they used to be, and “many of the less correlated assets are only accessible through the private markets.” That may be. Or not. For average retail investors, it could be hard to tell because there currently isn’t a centralized way to track the performance and underlying investments of private capital funds and directly compare them to that of the stock and bond funds and indexes they’re used to. That’s just one reason why other market watchers and investor advocates worry about expanding access to private capital for average retirement savers. Among those squarely in the camp of those who say employee and retiree nest eggs won’t be helped — and could be harmed — by having exposure to private capital is Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, a nonprofit seeking to promote the public interest in financial markets. “Why is there a push to open up the private markets to 401(k)s now? It’s not because workers want less liquid and harder-to-value assets in their 401(k)s. And it’s not motivated by plan sponsors, who have long worried that exposing 401(k) plan participants to private market assets would violate their fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the investors,” Schiffrin said in a statement. “It’s because private market firms are finding it harder now to raise money. Their traditional sources of funding — institutional investors such as pensions and endowments — have evaporated.” Indeed, for plan sponsors, including private equity among their plan’s investment options will require a lot more due diligence from them in terms of investigating the underlying investments in a given fund and examining the fee structure, Schlichter said. “This is fraught with danger. A company that puts private equity in its 401(k) is undertaking a serious risk of breaching its fiduciary duty.” Credit ratings agency Moody’s this week put out an analysis, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which cautioned that the accelerated push to give private capital firms access to the multitrillion-dollar retirement investment industry holds risk for everyone. “Competition for retail investor capital within private markets will intensify as alternative asset managers roll out new partnerships and special funds to address this potentially vast, still largely untapped market,” the analysts wrote. “But rapid growth within this still relatively opaque market also carries systemic implications.” One example, they cited, is the potential for a liquidity crisis. “Unlike institutional investors, retail investors expect ready access to their cash. To help, managers are launching products with periodic windows of liquidity. But in volatile markets, retail investors may run for the exits, which would exacerbate liquidity needs and the risk of potential mismatches between a product’s available liquidity and what investors are expecting.” The promise of investing in private equity is that the additional expense and risk assumed by investors can be rewarded with potentially strong returns over time. While it’s hard to easily and quickly track private equity performance on your own, there have been academic and industry studies on it, and the results have been mixed, said Jason Kephart, senior principal for multi-asset strategy ratings at Morningstar. So, while you will likely pay more and have less transparency into what you’re investing in, having a stake in private capital is no guarantee that you will enjoy meaningfully better returns in your portfolio. As for the diversification argument, Kephart said, it’s worth remembering that just as with public companies, private companies’ performance will be affected by external forces such as economic downturns, interest rates, geopolitical concerns, tariffs and supply chain issues. “Being private doesn’t shield you from the world,” he noted. And, Kephart added, “It’s not like the public markets are broken. Public stocks and bonds have paid off pretty well for those who’ve stayed invested.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo Air taxi maker Archer Aviation on Thursday said it raised $850 million in funding following executive orders signed by U.S. President Donald Trump to boost electric air taxis. Trump's orders also focused on bolstering U.S. defenses against hostile drones, and supporting the development of supersonic commercial aircraft. Earlier this year, Archer secured $300 million in a funding round led by institutional investors, including accounts managed by BlackRock . In April, Archer unveiled plans to establish an air taxi network in New York City in partnership with United Airlines. The company has also been named the official air taxi service for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

The fund also register another monthly dividend record, distributing over $10 million in May. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) expanded by about $1 billion between March 26 and June 11, representing roughly half of the $2 billion growth of the tokenized US treasuries market in the period. According to rwa.xyz data, BUIDL’s size is $2.89 billion as of June 11. It is the largest tokenized money fund, representing 40% of the $7.34 billion market. The March 26 benchmark is significant because it’s when Ethena Labs stopped adding the fund shares to back its USDtb stablecoin. USDtb drove most of BUIDL’s growth in 2025, channeling 90% of its reserves into the fund, totaling $1.3 billion. Consequently, the significant 35% growth in less than three months without Ethena’s boost suggests continuing demand for regulated, high-yield cash instruments on public blockchains. Furthermore, the fund has grown by nearly three times since it reached $1 billion on March 13, achieving this milestone in just over a year. However, it took less than 90 days to triple the amount, suggesting a spike in interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, especially tokenized US treasuries. According to rwa.xyz’s overview, the RWA market grew by nearly $5 billion between March 13 and June 11. The tokenized US treasuries market represented almost half of the global RWA market growth. As shared on June 12 by ETF Store CEO Nate Geraci, BlackRock recently published its effort to bridge the traditional capital markets “with the developing digital assets ecosystem,” currently focusing on tokenized funds. Alongside asset growth, BUIDL’s income distributions continued to set new highs. The fund paid $4.17 million in March, pushing cumulative payouts above $25 million. April dividends rose to about $7.9 million, lifting lifetime payments past $33 million, according to issuer posts. May distributions exceeded $10 million, bringing total dividends to more than $43 million since inception. This represented the third consecutive monthly record.

Full Content:
BlackRock Inc. wants to achieve $400 billion in cumulative fundraising between 2025 and 2030, according to an investor day presentation released Thursday. The $10 trillion asset manager’s vision includes expanding its alternative investment offerings to insurers and wealth managers, leveraging its recent manager acquisitions and technology offerings. The firm recently acquired infrastructure investor Global Infrastructure Partners ($170 billion assets under management) and expects to close its acquisition of private credit manager HPS Investment Partners ($157 billion AUM) in the third quarter. HPS and BlackRock reported that together, as of the first quarter, they had $14 billion in fee-paying credit AUM in existing wealth management channels, a figure they hope to grow to at least $60 billion by 2030 by expanding into European direct lending, private asset-based income products and offering private credit investments across wealth management channels. BlackRock, through its acquisition of GIP, has become the world’s largest infrastructure manager, and it sees private capital bridging the infrastructure funding gap. According to BlackRock, the world needs $94 trillion in infrastructure funding by 2040, of which a $15 trillion gap exists between the current pace of investment and what will be needed. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  The asset manager wants to increase its annual revenue to more than $35 billion from $20 billion by the end of the decade, nearly doubling operating income to $15 billion from $8 billion and doubling its market capitalization to $280 billion from $140 billion. Revenue derived from private markets and technology is expected to double as a percentage of BlackRock’s income. In 2024, private markets and technology accounted for 15% of the firm’s $20 billion in revenue. In 2030, BlackRock wants these businesses to account for 30% of total revenue.

Title: Polygon unveils ‘Gigagas’ roadmap to reach 100,000 TPS

The Gigagas roadmap positions Polygon for high-throughput financial applications with planned scalability and instant finality. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Polygon has laid out an ambitious scaling roadmap to reach 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), beginning with a July upgrade that will bring the network to 1,000 TPS. The roadmap comes a day after Polygon announced a governance revamp and shift in focus to Agglayer. Dubbed the “Gigagas” roadmap, the initiative is focused on making Polygon the go-to blockchain for real-world financial applications. It culminates in a long-term plan to power global-scale payments and tokenized assets. The July Bhilai Upgrade will introduce 1,000+ TPS throughput, reduce transaction finality to ~5 seconds, and stabilize gas fees under $0.001 per transaction without increasing validator requirements. In a separate development, the network’s native token POL became available on Solana (SOL) via Wormhole Bridge on June 12. By the end of this year, Polygon expects to scale past 5,000 TPS using a new Validator-Elected Block Producer (VEBloP) model that streamlines block production with stateless validation and a single leader architecture. This approach removes the risk of chain reorganizations by guaranteeing one-block finality, a key requirement for institutions and financial applications demanding predictable execution. Polygon said that the 5,000 TPS benchmark has already been achieved in a devnet environment, with technical proposals (PIP-64 and others) outlining the pathway to mainnet rollout. Alongside this upgrade, Polygon will also integrate with Agglayer, a multichain interoperability layer powered by POL staking that allows seamless liquidity movement across chains. In 2026 and beyond, Polygon’s goal is to exceed 100,000 TPS through continued optimization of its validator network and deeper integration with Agglayer. It will also focus on scaling for high-volume use cases like retail payments, AI-driven microtransactions, and tokenized financial markets. The network aims to match the reliability and speed of traditional payment systems while preserving decentralization. Polygon already ranks among the top chains in stablecoin and RWA activity, with over $134 billion in stablecoin transfer volume in April and hundreds of millions in institutional RWAs deployed by firms like Apollo and BlackRock. However, the Polygon team said the chain needs to scale “an order of magnitude higher” to support trillions in on-chain value. The Gigagas roadmap signals a shift from theoretical scaling to real-world execution and positions Polygon as a high-throughput infrastructure layer for the next wave of blockchain adoption.

Title: Strategy, GameStop Lead $50 Billion Institutional Surge Into Bitcoin as Treasury Asset

Highlights Bitcoin has evolved from a niche asset to a mainstream institutional-grade investment, with Fortune 500 companies, like Strategy and GameStop among others, allocating billions to bitcoin holdings, transforming corporate treasuries into crypto-forward financial operations. Companies are leveraging complex financial instruments (e.g., convertible notes, structured products, bitcoin-backed loans) to gain crypto exposure, potentially blurring the line between financial innovation and speculative risk. The role of corporate treasurers is expanding beyond traditional finance to include crypto expertise, risk governance, and digital asset strategy, prompting a critical reevaluation of bitcoin's place on balance sheets — as a hedge, speculative asset, or branding signal — based on a company’s unique financial profile. In the early days of bitcoin, it was hard to imagine Fortune 500 treasury teams doing anything more than monitoring its unpredictable price swings out of casual interest.

Δ But 15 years and several bull-bear cycles later, the cryptocurrency is no longer just the domain of technologists and retail investors. It’s evolving into an institutional-grade asset. Not just in theory, but in practice. Fortune 500 blockchain adoption has allegedly now hit 60% with institutions injecting as much as $50 billion into crypto funds in Q1. Leading the pack is the one-time software company Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has compiled a war chest of 580,000 bitcoin, worth about $63 billion, since the middle of 2020, with its latest purchase coming within the past two weeks. Strategy has transformed itself into a bitcoin treasury company and is now primarily in the business of selling securities to raise money to buy the cryptocurrency. Far from being viewed as a black sheep, the company’s “bitcoin treasury” approach has spurred a wave of publicly traded copycats. GameStop, for example, on Wednesday (June 11) announced it was issuing $1.75 billion in convertible notes to buy bitcoin. This followed an earlier Q1 acquisition of 4,710 BTC (about $513 million), which made GameStop the 13th‑largest corporate holder. Elsewhere, The Blockchain Group, which describes itself as Europe’s first bitcoin treasury company, on Monday (June 9) announced a $300 million issuance for, you guessed it, the purposes of purchasing more bitcoin. From structured notes and hedging instruments to yield-bearing custodial accounts and even Bitcoin-backed loans, the ecosystem is diversifying at a pace few anticipated. But beneath the innovation lies a familiar tension: are these truly risk-managed tools for corporate finance, or cleverly packaged speculative bets in disguise? Read also: Making Sense of Bitcoin’s Growing Relevance for Corporate Treasuries Milestones like the launch of CME Bitcoin futures (2017), the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. (2024), and the entrance of traditional financial institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, and JPMorgan into the crypto arena have provided a sense of legitimacy. With regulatory clarity slowly improving, especially around custody and reporting standards, corporate finance professionals are being offered a potential new value proposition: the cryptocurrency not as a gamble, but as a balance sheet diversification strategy. As PYMNTS covered, even the Ivy-league institution Brown University has recently disclosed a $4.9 million investment in BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF, signaling a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in diversified portfolios. After all, the CLARITY Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets and crypto markets in the U.S., is set to be considered by the full U.S. House of Representatives after being advanced by two House committees Tuesday (June 10). At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants to ease restrictions governing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. The treasurer’s role in this environment? It’s no longer merely about cash, FX, or interest rate swaps — but increasingly about whether the CFO team has the infrastructure, expertise, risk governance, and capital strategies to harness any crypto strategy judiciously. See also: Are Crypto Markets Going Mainstream? What Treasury Execs Should Know Bitcoin is maturing into a multi-dimensional treasury instrument: a defensive store-of-value, a potential yield generator and a signal of corporate innovation. But behind the headlines and bold plays lies a complex ecosystem rich with financing engineering, volatility exposure, regulatory uncertainty, and governance pitfalls. After all, for all the innovation, there’s a critical issue at the heart of this trend: are these financial tools being used to serve prudent corporate strategy, or are they a new flavor of speculative risk? Some critics argue that bitcoin-linked treasury products may be less about strategic diversification and more about corporate speculation dressed in financial engineering. Today’s suite of corporate crypto offerings are designed to mitigate some of the risks. But in doing so, they can sometimes introduce new forms of complexity — particularly around counterparty risk, liquidity constraints and regulatory uncertainty. The accounting treatment of crypto assets remains a thorny issue. In the U.S., bitcoin is still classified as an intangible asset, meaning unrealized losses must be recognized, but gains can’t be booked unless the asset is sold. This creates a lopsided risk profile for public companies. Perhaps the central question for corporate treasurers is this: What is bitcoin in the context of the corporate balance sheet? Is it a modern hedge against fiat inflation, akin to gold? A speculative instrument that can juice short-term returns but introduces material downside? Or a strategic signaling tool — part financial asset, part branding exercise? The answer may depend on the type of business and its risk profile. For a tech-forward firm with high margins and a long investment horizon, limited bitcoin exposure may offer a form of asymmetric upside. For a capital-intensive industrial company with tight liquidity, it may be an unjustifiable risk.

Share this article BlackRock is aiming to become the world’s dominant crypto asset manager by 2030, targeting at least $50 billion in assets under management (AUM) through its digital asset offerings, according to a Thursday presentation on its website. For its flagship crypto ETFs, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), BlackRock’s goal is to lead their respective categories by AUM. IBIT has already secured the top spot among spot Bitcoin ETFs, managing over $73 billion in assets as of June 11. ETHA also leads the spot Ethereum ETF group, with a $4.3 billion market cap, ahead of Grayscale’s ETHE. On global expansion, the asset management giant targets to expand its digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) beyond the US into Europe and Canada. Following its successful launch of IBIT in the US last year, BlackRock rolled out its first Bitcoin ETP in Europe in March 2025. The fund trades under the ticker IB1T on major European exchanges, including Xetra, Euronext Paris, and Euronext Amsterdam. The fund is BlackRock’s first crypto-linked ETP outside North America. In addition to this, BlackRock offers the iShares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Canada. In the tokenization space, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund remains central to the firm’s long-term digital asset strategy According to rwa.xyz, BUIDL leads the tokenized US Treasury market with approximately $3 billion in assets as of June 11.

Title: ONDO’s TVL hit new ATH with Ripple partnership – Will prices follow?

Time Published: 2025-06-12T03:00:08Z

Despite the ONDO x Ripple partnership, the two cryptocurrencies did not react instantly. Ondo Finance [ONDO] continued to lead in the Real World Asset space with its recent partnership with Ripple’s XRP Ledger to enable 24/7 access through the RLUSD stablecoin. The partnership of Ondo Finance and Ripple has seen the tokenization of the U.S. Treasuries cross stay at the XRP Ledger with 24/7 get right of entry to and redemption in RLUSD. The mixing was enabled via the BUIDL fund, a BlackRock initiative, making ONDO the hub of institutional DeFi infrastructure. But this was not merely a story game — this was operational capital investment in the quest of scalable income. ONDO sprang a new all-time high on its Total Value Locked of $1.368B. This was more than $20 million in additional growth since the previous milestone. Source: DefiLlama The market cap was equal to $2.824 billion, and the daily volume was $167.02 million. The revenue was less impressive though — annualized fees stood at $54.24 million. The platform revenue was $11.69 million as holders continued to get in revenue share. That was indicative of the growth momentum in ONDO but also indicative of the absence of direct holder returns, which may become an issue as the sector matures. Nevertheless, as the XRPL integration went live and the TVL was increasing, the strategy of ONDO proved to bring results. This was in terms of bringing real-world assets to DeFi rails. The extent to which it can maintain this rate will relate to its success in balancing institutional attractiveness with community incentives. Technically, ONDO kept increasing along the trendline, and the support as it approached the $0.867 area. The price was circling around $0.88 and indication of pressure was seen as price retested trendline. Provided this support beneath ONDO held, it may rebound back to the $0.90 area and even come a second time to challenge the swing high at around $0.98. Nevertheless, a decrease to the levels under $0.867 could result in the pullback to $0.84 or even deeper. The MACD indicated a deteriorating bullish trend, with the MACD line falling below the signal line ($0.0053) and heading into negative territory. This reversal indicated possible near term weakness unless momentum could get restored. Source: Trading View The trend structure was intact in the meantime, though a confirmed break below the rising support would turn the sentiment bearish. The traders may observe $0.867 and $1 as directional validation areas. Meanwhile, the price of XRP on the other hand saw modest gains in the last 24 hours while maintaining its stay around the $2.30 zone. This stressed that the partnership did not have direct impact on prices of the crypto in the short-term but would in the long-term.

Title: XRP Ledger Adds BlackRock-Backed Treasuries In Ripple Deal
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-blackrock-backed-treasuries-ripple-deal/
Time Published: 2025-06-12T01:30:20Z

The XRP Ledger (XRPL) moved from theory to production-grade finance today as Ondo Finance switched on its tokenized US Treasury fund, Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries (OUSG), directly on the network. The launch lets Qualified Purchasers mint or redeem OUSG around the clock by settling with Ripple’s enterprise-grade stablecoin RLUSD, effectively marrying BlackRock-custodied Treasury bills to a 24/7 public chain and its native decentralized exchange. OUSG is no boutique proof-of-concept. The fund already commands more than $670 million in total value locked and sits alongside BlackRock’s own BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX at the top of the rapidly expanding tokenized-Treasury league table. Ondo’s broader real-world-asset (RWA) platform manages roughly $1.3 billion, but this is its first deployment on a non-EVM chain—an endorsement of XRPL’s purpose-built tokenization rails. Institutional investors create or redeem OUSG in a single transaction by delivering or receiving RLUSD, Ripple’s dollar-pegged stablecoin that settles natively on XRPL. Because RLUSD itself moves in finality within three to five seconds, OUSG subscriptions bypass legacy cutoff times and traditional bank wires. Ripple and Ondo have committed liquidity to market-make both legs—RLUSD ↔ USD off-chain and RLUSD ↔ OUSG on-chain—so investors can scale in or out without slipping on spreads. The entire flow remains permissioned at the edges and permissionless in the core. Qualified Purchasers authenticate through Ondo’s compliance portal (leveraging Decentralized Identifiers and verifiable credentials), receive an allow-list flag on-chain, and then interact with the built-in DEX like any other asset pair. Settlement remains atomic: OUSG units burn or mint the moment RLUSD transfers, eliminating the daylight-risk gap that plagues traditional T-plus settlement cycles. XRPL’s deterministic order book, low fees, and native token-issuance primitives spare issuers the need to bolt on smart-contract wrappers for basic custody logic. Forthcoming Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) will allow OUSG to embed cash-flow rights and compliance fences at the protocol level, while the planned lending protocol will let desks rehypothecate OUSG as repo collateral without bridging to another chain. Permissioned Domains will give asset managers namespace-level control over who trades within walled gardens—a prerequisite for regulated liquidity pools. For treasury teams juggling intraday cash buffers, tokenized bills on XRPL unlock immediate redeployment of idle dollars. A fund manager who redeems OUSG at 21:00 ET on a Friday receives RLUSD within seconds and can cycle into overnight reverse-repo, stablecoin liquidity farming, or FX settlement in Asia before traditional markets even open. Conversely, corporates that sweep surplus RLUSD into OUSG every evening now capture US Treasury yield without operational drag. Markus Infanger, SVP of RippleX, framed the launch as a watershed: “Ondo’s OUSG going live on the XRPL demonstrates that tokenized finance is no longer theoretical—it’s maturing in real markets. Institutions can now access high-quality assets like US Treasuries on public blockchains, with the compliance and efficiency they need. This represents progress in bringing trusted financial assets into a 24/7 market—enabling greater liquidity, operational efficiency, and faster access to capital.” Ripple and Boston Consulting Group’s joint report projects that tokenization will convert $19 trillion of real-world assets into programmable instruments by 2033. Treasuries have emerged as the beachhead: they are low-risk, deeply liquid, and already digitized in the Federal Reserve’s master ledger, making them ideal for the first wave of on-chain replication. Total tokenized-Treasury value has surged past $7 billion this year, more than doubling since January, and is on track to eclipse the entire stablecoin float of 2017 by year-end. OUSG’s migration to XRPL could accelerate that trend. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund—the underlying asset pool into which OUSG deposits—distributes interest daily and permits same-day stablecoin redemptions, giving on-chain holders a money-market-fund experience without bank-hour limitations. By anchoring that mechanism in XRPL’s always-on settlement layer, Ripple and Ondo have effectively created a composable Treasury bill that “plugs and plays” with any XRPL-native application. The immediate roadmap is functional rather than speculative: open a secondary RLUSD-OUSG order book on XRPL’s DEX, integrate OUSG as collateral in XRPL-based lending markets once live, and extend mint-and-burn access to additional Qualified Purchaser jurisdictions as regulators sign off on the identity stack. Longer term, Ripple plans to use RLUSD as the hub currency for other RWAs—starting with commercial paper and municipal notes—turning XRPL into a full-spectrum capital-markets substrate.

Title: Report: Irish Church abuse allegations jumped 50% in 1 year

By Madalaine Elhabbal Washington, D.C. Newsroom, Jun 11, 2025 / 18:18 pm Allegations of sexual abuse of minors within the Catholic Church in Ireland significantly spiked this past year, a newly published report has found. The total number of allegations rose by more than 50% from 252 in 2023-2024 to 385 in 2024-2025, according to the latest report by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland. The figure represents the highest number since the organization began publishing annual reports on child sexual abuse in the Irish Church in 2009. The majority of these allegations, 73%, date to the period between 1960 and 1989, with only two cases relating to the period after 2000. Forty-seven cases had no time frame attributed to them. According to the report, which covers allegations from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, the increase in allegations took place predominantly in September 2024 immediately following the announcement of a government-sponsored investigation examining historical abuse in religious-run day and boarding schools in Ireland. “These events in September 2024 appear to have given individuals renewed strength to tell of their experiences,” National Board CEO Aidan Gordon said in a June 10 press release. According to the report, 291 of the allegations received by the National Board were categorized as sexual abuse as the primary complaint. The report records 55 additional allegations of physical abuse, four boundary violations, one count of neglect, one emotional abuse, one bullying, and 32 cases where the alleged abuse was not categorized. The report indicates that 385 allegations were made against 376 people, including 318 male religious, 39 diocesan priests, 16 female religious, and three males of unknown affiliation. Of the 39 diocesan priests accused of abuse, 20 (64%) are deceased, three are laicized, three are in prison, four are out of ministry, four are under a management plan, one remains in active ministry, and four are of unknown status. Of the remaining accused, 221 of them are deceased, five are laicized, five are in active ministry, 31 are in prison, 21 are under a management plan, 12 have left the Church, 17 are out of ministry, and 22 are of unknown status. The National Board received 287 requests for advice in relation to safeguarding children from abuse within the Church in 2024-2025. The announcement of the Irish government’s September 2024 investigation came after the government-backed scoping inquiry, published in March 2023. The inquiry was initiated in the aftermath of a 2022 radio documentary called “Blackrock Boys,” which revealed extensive abuse at the Spiritan-run Blackrock College, a boys’ boarding and day school in Dublin. The scoping inquiry revealed that 2,395 allegations of abuse had been made in 308 schools between 1927 and 2013, including extensive accounts of sexual abuse, rape, and sexual assault. Bishop Kevin Doran of Elphin described the scoping inquiry as “a tragedy” at the time, lamenting not only the sheer number of allegations in the report but also “that so many of them had to carry their experience alone for so many years before they felt sufficiently free to tell someone else.” (Story continues below) Your monthly donation will help our team continue reporting the truth, with fairness, integrity, and fidelity to Jesus Christ and his Church. The Dublin-based Iona Institute for Religion and Society has released a comprehensive report that highlights significant shifts in religious attitudes and practices in Ireland. The announcement comes as a report from the Irish government revealed that 2,395 allegations of abuse had been made in 308 schools between 1927 and 2013.

Title: Payments Giant Stripe To Acquire Crypto Wallet Provider Privy Following $1,000,000,000 Purchase of Stablecoin Firm: Report

Payments platform Stripe has announced its acquisition of a crypto wallet provider shortly after closing a $1 billion deal to purchase the stablecoin firm Bridge. In a post on the social media platform X, crypto wallet company Privy says it’s been bought out by Stripe, a firm that provides payment infrastructure for businesses. “Today, we’re proud to announce that Stripe is acquiring Privy. We couldn’t be more excited. Privy will continue as an independent product – but now we’ll move faster, ship more, and serve you even better, so you can stay focused on your users.” Earlier this year, Stripe completed its purchase of stablecoin issuer Bridge, the company behind USDB, a programmable dollar-pegged crypto asset backed by a combination of cash and money market funds held by BlackRock. As stated by Zach Abrams, co-founder of Bridge, at the time, “We closed our acquisition with Stripe! Together we’re scaling digital dollars to businesses everywhere. Stablecoins aren’t the future- they’re already transforming how people move money today.” Earlier this month, Stripe reportedly was in talks with unnamed banks regarding their potential use of stablecoins. Stripe co-founder and president John Collison said that banks seem eager to work with dollar-pegged digital assets. “In the conversations we have with them, they’re very interested. This is not something that banks are just kind of brushing away or treating as a fad. Banks are very interested in how they should be integrated with stablecoins into their product offerings as well.” Featured Image: Shutterstock/DEYASA_346 Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Ivies, Index Funds, And Incarceration: How Universities Became Financial Stakeholders In The Prison Economy

ByMichelle Mbekeani ByMichelle Mbekeani, Contributor. Nashville, Tennessee USA - May 10, 2022: Entrance sign to the private research school Vanderbilt ... More University located in the west end district The private prison industry did not emerge fully formed from a corporate boardroom. It was seeded quietly, often indirectly, by capital from university endowments. American universities, as institutional investors, have long shaped emerging markets by deploying billions through private equity, hedge funds, and index‑tracking portfolios. At the time, these decisions drew minimal public scrutiny, guided by fiduciary responsibility, and framed as financially neutral. But universities’ expanding financial footprints have exposed them, directly and indirectly, to sectors with profound social implications. Now, amid growing demand for transparency and responsible investing, students, faculty, and alumni are asking: What systems have our institutions funded, and at what cost? Seed Money and the Rise of Private Prisons The modern private prison industry traces back to the early 1980s, when governments sought alternatives amid rising incarceration rates. The model: privately operated correctional facilities financed through government contracts. In 1983, Corrections Corporation of America (now CoreCivic) was launched by former Chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, Thomas W. Beasley, with formative investments that included Vanderbilt University, the Tennessee Lookout reported. I have reached out to Vanderbilt University for comment and will update the post if I receive a reply. Three years later, CoreCivic executed its initial public offering (IPO) in October 1986, listing 2 million shares on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol CCAX at an offering price of $9.00 per share. In December 1994, the company transitioned its listing to the New York Stock Exchange, where it began trading under the symbol CXC, signaling its maturation into a more established publicly traded entity. Today the corporation runs over 100 facilities nationwide. According to its 2024 Annual Report, the company reported $2.0 billion in revenue and $68.9 million in net income. CoreCivic continues to derive a significant portion of its revenue from federal contracts, including those with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has expanded to support mass deportation efforts of the Trump administration. Its main competitor, The GEO Group, earned $2.424 billion in revenue and reported $31.97 million in net income in 2024, as detailed in their 2024 Annual Report. ETF Exposure and Indirect Investment Although universities like Vanderbilt have since disavowed direct holdings in private prison companies, some universities may still have indirect exposure within passive index funds. This indirect retention of financial ties stems from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and passive investment vehicles managed by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. An analysis by OpenSecrets highlighted that broad real estate ETFs—like Vanguard’s VNQ and BlackRock’s IYR, include private prison Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), such as CoreCivic in their holdings. ETFs are commonly used by university endowments for low-fee diversification. Because ETFs weight their portfolios based on sector representation, not ethical considerations, private prison companies could be bundled alongside shopping malls, office parks, and senior housing properties. That means universities pursuing passive real estate ETFs can unknowingly gain financial exposure to incarceration-related businesses. While some institutions have moved to ESG-screened portfolios, much of the endowment landscape remains opaque, structured through fund-of-funds vehicles and outsourced managers. According to the 2023 NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments, U.S. colleges and universities manage around $839 billion in endowment assets, with a mean immediate return of 7.7%. Procurement: University Purchases from Prison Labor University interactions with the carceral system extend beyond financial markets. Some universities procure goods from prison labor programs—furniture, garments, and institutional supplies made by incarcerated workers. According to a 2020, Inside Higher Ed report, some of the furniture at the University of Virginia was made in prisons, and so was some of the furniture at George Mason University and the University of Mary Washington. This requirement stemmed from a statewide mandate at the time, requiring all public universities in Virginia to purchase furniture from Virginia Correctional Enterprises (VCE), a state-owned entity that employs approximately 1,300 incarcerated individuals, Inside Higher Ed reported. These types of procurement mandates and restrictions tend to be governed by state-level governments and their statutory and administrative codes, as opposed to university-level administration. I have reached out to each university for comment and will update the post if I receive a reply. Madison, Wisconsin, USA-May 4, 2023: The University of Wisconsin campus in Madison, Wisconsin, USA In some states, public universities have a history of being mandated by their state government to buy prison made furniture. According to the 2020, Inside Higher Ed report, University of Wisconsin campuses have in the past been required to purchase from Badger State Industries, Wisconsin’s prison labor enterprise. According to the ACLU, some incarcerated workers earn as little as $0.13 per hour and many earn nothing at all. The Prison Policy Initiative notes wages range from $0.33 to $1.41 per hour. I have reached out to each university for comment and will update the post if I receive a reply. Institutional Values Follow the Money Capital is not neutral. Where it flows, systems follow. Universities are not merely academic institutions, they are powerful economic actors. Through investments and procurement, many have become stakeholders in the carceral system, often unintentionally. As debates around racial justice, incarceration, and institutional accountability gain momentum, the financial ties between higher education and the prison industry continue to encounter scrutiny. The pressing question is not whether these ties exist, it is whether universities can redesign their capital frameworks to reflect their values.

Title: World Bank Agrees with President Trump Position of Unsustainable, Unbalanced Trade Status – Global Trade Taking Advantage of USA

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/11/2025 11:38:45 AM PDT by SoConPubbie This is actually a very surprising development. The World Bank (WB) is a heavily controlled multinational exploit of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and World Economic Forum assembly (WEF). This could be looked upon as the WTO/WEF taking a knee as they finally accept Godzilla Trump is not going to relent. Remember, the Build Back Better agenda was a construct from the WEF/WTO.Looking a little more deeply at the people behind the latest shift in tone and paying close attention to the wording they are using, there’s an inference the World Bank is telling Europe to stop being intransigent or they will lose U.S. military support. A very unusual shift in WB tone.In my first review opinion, as the legal arbitration system for trade complaints, the WB are trying to mitigate President Trump’s full-frontal assault on the global trade imbalance that brings the global trade wealth back to the USA.NEW YORK POST […] – Top economists at the international institution, which helps finance low and middle-income countries, acknowledged that many nations do not provide reciprocal trade access to the US.“This [situation] could not be sustained indefinitely,” the World Bank’s chief economist, Indermit Gill, said during a news briefing, the Washington Post reported.[Gill] contended that Trump’s actions were merely a response to uneven trade access between other countries and the US.Other experts at the World Bank concurred with that assessment and indicated that Europe, Japan and China should all take steps to reduce trade barriers on the US, while calling for an across-the-board rollback on tariffs on all sides.

A very unusual shift in WB tone.In my first review opinion, as the legal arbitration system for trade complaints, the WB are trying to mitigate President Trump’s full-frontal assault on the global trade imbalance that brings the global trade wealth back to the USA.NEW YORK POST […] – Top economists at the international institution, which helps finance low and middle-income countries, acknowledged that many nations do not provide reciprocal trade access to the US.“This [situation] could not be sustained indefinitely,” the World Bank’s chief economist, Indermit Gill, said during a news briefing, the Washington Post reported.[Gill] contended that Trump’s actions were merely a response to uneven trade access between other countries and the US.Other experts at the World Bank concurred with that assessment and indicated that Europe, Japan and China should all take steps to reduce trade barriers on the US, while calling for an across-the-board rollback on tariffs on all sides.

Title: Bitcoin Poised For Rally To $1 Million, Says Michael Saylor — Here’s What Will Catalyze The Epic Ascent
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-poised-for-rally-to-1-million-says-michael-saylor-heres-what-will-catalyze-the-epic-ascent/
Time Published: 2025-06-11T18:14:43Z
Full Content:
Michael Saylor, cofounder and the executive chairman of Bitcoin-powered giant Strategy, has ruled out the chances of a full-blown crypto winter returning, at least not anytime soon. Crypto winter, as widely known within the cryptosphere, is a period typically characterized by a cruel correction in Bitcoin prices. According to Saylor, BTC is not going to $0 but is headed towards the $1 million per coin coveted milestone based on a number of key factors that he believes will supercharge the price of the oldest cryptocurrency. Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Michael Saylor highlighted that roughly 450 Bitcoin (BTC) are minted by miners every day. At current Bitcoin prices of $109,559 as per CoinGecko, that amount is equivalent to around $50 million. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” Saylor posited. The Bitcoin bull further noted that the increasing number of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is buying “the entire natural supply.” Saylor’s software intelligence-turned Bitcoin Treasury firm Strategy has amassed 582,000 BTC since it started purchasing in 2020, which is valued at around $63.59 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn.” Notably, Saylor acknowledged that if Bitcoin surges to $500,000 or $1 million, it may be more realistic to expect it to fall by about $200,000 a coin. According to Saylor, there are enough confirmations in the wider economy to support his all-or-nothing prediction for Bitcoin. “You have all the evidence you need to determine that,” the Strategy co-founder quipped. Saylor also pointed out that US President Trump’s backing of Bitcoin and his efforts to create a more friendly regulatory environment will buoy the asset’s uptrend. Meanwhile, traditional banks have started to leverage this improving regulatory scene to foray into the fast-growing market, as they prepare to provide BTC custody services. He further pointed out that demand for the scarce asset is going through the roof. For instance, BlackRock and other spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers and nation states are buying up Bitcoin daily. Bilal Bin Saqib, head of Pakistan’s crypto council, recently disclosed that the country is set to create its own United States-esque strategic Bitcoin reserve. Saylor described the growing demand for Bitcoin as a “digital gold rush,” suggesting the top crypto has “gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected.” It’s worth mentioning that Saylor is not the only uber-bullish pundit in the crypto market. As ZyCrypto previously reported, asset manager ARK Invest bumped its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, bolstered mainly by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as “digital gold.”

Dublin Stock image All suspended DART services between Lansdowne Road and Dalkey have resumed, though major delays and disruption are set to continue for commuters in Dublin this evening. An issue with the overhead lines between Booterstown and Blackrock suspended services between the two stations earlier this evening. Services were operating between Howth/Malahide to Lansdowne and from Greystones to Dalkey, with knock-on delays of more than 25 minutes due to congestion on the line. Stock image Today's news in 90 - 11th June 2025 Dublin Bus will honour all rail tickets during the outage and staff are currently on-site as they work to rectify the issue, a spokesperson for Irish Rail confirmed. More to follow... Irish citizens being detained in Egypt, including People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy, have been released.
