Title: Bitfinex Securities Is Taking a Different Approach to RWAs, Launches Two New Products in the U.K.

These days, the mention of blockchain-based real world assets (RWAs) conjures up traditional finance institutions, like BlackRock, presiding over billions of dollars in tokenized money market funds. But the original promise of crypto was about opening up finance opportunities to anyone. That’s the ethos Bitfinex Securities is sticking to with its latest tokenized equity issuances: two alternative finance products in the UK, one focused on community banking debt, the other on litigation relating to mis-sold car finance claims. Announced on Wednesday, Bitfinex Securities’ “TITAN1” product will allocate 5 million british pounds ($6.8 million) into subordinate debt issued by Castle Community Bank, a firm supporting loans to financially excluded customers in Edinburgh, Scotland. This alternative debt product will provide investors with a 20% dividend per annum (net of fees), which will be paid quarterly for up to 10 years, with non-callable provisions for the first 5 years, according to a press release. The second structure, “TITAN2,” will invest 100 million british pounds ($136 million) into litigation financing related to car finance mis-selling claims in the UK, a market expected to generate billions in compensation. Funds will be deployed through equity-linked notes and Investors will receive a 50% share of the claims recovery proceeds split proportionately among investors, Bitfinex Securities said. Both listings will be accessible to investors as tradable tokens via Bitfinex Securities’ secondary market. The tokens have been issued on the Liquid Network, a side chain of Bitcoin developed by technology firm Blockstream, where transfers require issuer authorization, with a whitelist system ensuring compliance standards and jurisdictional requirements. Looking back in time, Bitfinex Securities’ foray into tokenized RWAs pre-dates by some years the current trend for blockchain-based financial assets issued by institutions like BlackRock or Franklin Templeton. The firm started out with niche products like a tokenized bitcoin mining hashrate contract linked to Blockstream, followed by a number of bond issuances, including the first tokenized U.S. Treasuries offering in the nascent crypto hub of El Salvador, bringing T-Bill investments to individuals and organizations who were previously unable to access these products. Jesse Knutson, head of operations at Bitfinex Securities, takes a philosophical view of the current tokenization trend. “We want to be able to help people bridge that gap to investors,” Knutson said in an interview. “Whether it's a company or a bond issuance, or whatever it is, to raise capital and kind of fill that gap that's left by banks in many parts of the world that just aren't willing to lend, or where people struggle to get access to capital.” Fresh off a digital assets panel in London alongside BlackRock and UK asset manager Schroders, Knutson said there’s something of a bias in the ecosystem towards fixed income. Most of the focus is around money market funds, where people tend to buy and hold to get a yield, so there's just not a lot of trading, he said. “A big part of this is about disintermediation, and I think that’s something the institutional guys don't quite get,” Knutson said. “When you look at the details of what they've actually done, it's typically left hand to right hand. It's the same kind of people. It's going through depositories, it's going through transfer payment agents, all of the normal kind of parts of the traditional ecosystem, which I don't think are technologically probably necessary.” Read more: How the Next Wave of RWAs is Becoming Crypto’s Real Edge Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

June 25, 2025 02:01 ET | Source: InfraPartners, LLC InfraPartners, LLC London and Houston, Texas, June 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The research team unveils the new Upgradeable Data CenterTM in its first white paper London and Houston, Texas, June 25, 2025 - InfraPartners, a leader in prefabricated AI data center solutions, today announced the launch of a new research function, InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering. Led by recent hire Bal Aujla, previously the Global Head of Innovation Labs at BlackRock, InfraPartners has assembled a team of experts based in Europe and the US to act as a go-to resource for AI innovation in the data center industry. The function will foster industry collaboration to provide forward-looking insights and thought leadership. Innovating the future of data centers AI demand is driving a surge in new global data center builds which are projected to triple by 2030. AI-specific infrastructure is expected to drive approximately 70% of this growth. Additionally, regulation, regionalization, and geopolitical shifts are reshaping infrastructure needs. As a result, operators are looking at new ways to meet these changes with solutions that deliver scale, schedule certainty, and accelerated time-to-value while improving sustainability and avoiding technology obsolescence. InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering will accelerate data center innovation by identifying and focusing on the biggest opportunities and challenges of this next wave of AI-driven growth. With plans for Gigawatts (GWs) of data center builds globally and projected investments reaching nearly $7 trillion, the impact of new innovation will be significant. Through partnerships with industry experts, regulators, and disruptive newcomers, the InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering team aims to foster a community where ideas and research can be shared to grow data center knowledge, capabilities, and opportunities. These efforts will aim to advance the digital infrastructure sector as a whole. “At InfraPartners, our new research function represents the deliberate convergence of expertise from across the AI and data center ecosystem. We’re bringing together professionals with diverse perspectives and backgrounds in artificial intelligence, data center architecture, power infrastructure, and capital allocation to address the evolving needs of AI and the significant value it can bring to the world” said Bal Aujla, Director, Head of Advanced Research and Engineering, InfraPartners. “This integrated team approach enables us to look at opportunities and challenges from end-to-end and across every layer of the stack. We’re no longer approaching digital infrastructure as a siloed engineering challenge. Instead, the new team will focus on the initiatives that have the most impact on transforming data center architecture and creating business value.” Ensuring access to the right insights As AI innovation and GPU roadmaps outpace traditional data center lifecycles and significantly change the design of sites, operators need access to insights and approaches which enable them to keep pace with rapid industry change. InfraPartners’ Advanced Research and Engineering team will support this by enabling the industry to build smarter, more adaptable infrastructure and improving outcomes for all stakeholders. A new approach to data center architecture: introducing the Upgradeable Data Center™ InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering has developed a new design philosophy that prioritizes flexibility, upgradeability, and rapid refresh cycles. Called the Upgradeable Data Center™, this design future-proofs data center investments and enables greater resilience and sustainability in a fast-changing digital landscape. “The Upgradeable Data Center™ reflects the fact data centers must now be built to evolve. In a world where GPU generations shift every 12–18 months and designs change significantly each time, it is no longer viable to build static infrastructure which has decade-long refresh cycles. Our design approach enables operators to deploy the latest GPUs and upgrade data center infrastructure in a seamless way” said Harqs Singh, Chief Technology Officer at InfraPartners. In its first white paper, ‘Data Centers Transforming at the pace of Technology change’, the team explores the rapid growth of AI workloads and its impact on digital infrastructure, including the thought-provoking GPU technology roadmap, increasing rack densities, and the implications for the modern data center. It highlights the economic risks and commercial opportunities emerging from these trends and introduces how the Upgradeable Data Center™ is enabling new data centers to transform at the pace of technology change. InfraPartners' model is to build 80% of the data center offsite and 20% onsite, helping address key industry challenges like skilled labor shortages and power constraints, whilst aligning infrastructure investment with business agility and long-term growth. About InfraPartners: InfraPartners is a global leader in digital infrastructure, delivering turnkey prefabricated data center solutions for AI workloads. The company’s standardized design process and offsite manufacturing offers greater schedule and cost certainty, plus rigorous quality control. With a core focus on sustainability and innovation, InfraPartners collaborates with hyperscalers, GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) providers, and government entities focused on sovereign AI to design and deploy scalable, energy-efficient data centers.

Title: Leaving Cert grinds industry: ‘Salaries scales for the top teachers can be 100 to 250 grand’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/06/25/leaving-cert-grinds-industry-salaries-for-the-top-teachers-are-100-to-250-grand/
Time Published: 2025-06-25T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
The final Leaving Cert exams are over – but another competition has been raging among grind schools where top teachers have been snapped for eye-watering salaries. The race is for a slice of a grinds industry estimated to be worth up to €60-80 million. Grinds360 is the newest competitor on the market, which raised more than €3 million from investors who include former and present rugby players such as Brian O’Driscoll, Caelan Doris and Jordan Larmour. It describes itself as a “hybrid” service, combining an app which streams weekly grinds across 20 subjects, a Netflix-style catalogue of video lessons as well as in-person workshops at certain times of year. The cost, which has varied since its launch almost a year ago, is currently €1,399 a year. The company started out by poaching several teachers from rivals such as the Institute of Education and the smaller Dublin Academy of Education on huge salaries for the sector. The circumstances of one those cases – maths teacher Rob Browne, who left the Dublin Academy of Education to work for Grinds360 – was at the centre of a High Court row last September, which was subsequently struck out. Brendan Kavanagh, chairman and co-founder of Grinds360, says the firm started out hiring teachers from its competitors for key subjects like maths, English, Irish, sciences and business. The going rate to attract some of the top talen from its rivals initially was, he says, “anywhere from 100 to 250 grand”. “Are they worth 200 grand or 250 grand? For the hours they had to work – they were working six, seven days a week in day school and night school – I’d want that kind of money – especially for teaching!” Kavanagh laughs. At the online platform, he says, they are able to work fewer hours but play key roles in developing the future of the company. “It’s not really apples for apples. The more experienced grinds teachers are able to add a lot of value as we train other teachers throughout the country [who are now working for the company].” Some, he says, were also attracted by the idea of becoming involved in ownership of the firm. “If you earn that kind of money, you pay a lot of tax. So I think the opportunity for them to become stakeholders in the business ... created a new sort of environment there.” Subsequent teachers have been hired part-time, on different contracts, from various schools in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Roscommon. The result, he maintains, is that the company is making grinds “accessible and affordable” for students, while disrupting the “superstar teacher” narrative which he says has been pushed by some grind schools. “I’m off a few Christmas Card lists and I’ve been referred to as the Michael O’Leary of grinds. I’ll take it if making overpriced, over-glorified education finally compete on fairness, access, and transparency earns me that comparison,” he says. Nearly one year on from launch, Kavanagh says Grinds360 has seen “explosive growth” with more than 3,000 paying members and 18,000 app users. Backed by a €3.2 million seed round, he says the company is set to “double revenue” in 2025-2026 and claims the company has established itself as the “go-to alternative to traditional grind schools”. “The numbers speak for themselves – there’s a real hunger for a new model of academic support,” he says. Yet, business is also booming at the Institute of Education on Dublin’s Leeson Street, which itself was a disruptive force in the education sector 57 years ago when it started the trend for exam-focused tuition. The institute was sold to a UK-based schools group, Dukes Education, in 2023 for just under €135 million. This year, the institute is forecasting a record enrolment of 1,700 full-time students in September across fourth, fifth and sixth year, with students paying annual fees of up to €11,000 a year. It also runs grinds, crash courses and online learning for up to 10,000 students attending other schools. Yvonne O’Toole says demand is growing not just for exam results but because students have “moved on” from single-sex, religious schools and uniforms by the time they are in senior cycle. While it lost some teachers to Grinds360, she says “crazy salaries” are not the norm, but that teachers are paid well on the basis that they are “expected to go above and beyond”. “They do a lot more hours ... there are extra classes – morning, evening – and they’re expected to be available. They put their heart and soul into it.” The institute’s main competitor, the Dublin Academy of Education in Stillorgan, south Dublin, is also running at capacity. It had about 350 full-time fifth- and sixth-year students last year and says it is on course to grow to 400 when it moves to a larger premises in Blackrock in September. It expects numbers to grow to 500 in 2027 when it launches a fourth year offering. Founder Chris Lauder says while it also lost some teachers to Grinds360, it has “a deep squad” and was able to “march on”. The academy, he says, is always looking for top teaching talent. “What we used to do was ask our students if they knew of great teachers and surveyed them. Teachers also know other great teachers. And, these days, you also find them on social media,” he says. He questions whether some of the top salaries being mentioned are sustainable for the sector and insists the best teachers ultimately want to teach students in-person rather than online. “We pay more than what the public sector has to offer, and in some cases a lot more – maybe 50 per cent more,” he says. “Our teachers want to work for not just for remuneration; they like teaching students who are serious about academics. This is senior cycle only. They’re young adults, not children. They are driven – and they are a joy to teach.” Sign up to Classroom to College, our essential newsletter to navigating the Leaving Cert for parents, guardians and students Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Carl O'Brien is Education Editor of The Irish Times.

Title: Why did the US Army commission four technocrats as high-ranking military officers?

Four technocrats who are closely affiliated with Meta, Palantir, and OpenAI were just commissioned into the U.S. Army as lieutenant colonels, which I find to be extremely odd, and seriously concerning. Here’s the story, from a report at Task & Purpose: Four senior executives of tech giants like Meta and Palantir are being sworn into the Army Reserve as direct-commissioned officers at the unusually high rank of lieutenant colonel as part of a new program to recruit private-sector experts to speed up tech adoption. For context, these Silicon Valley executives just skipped the entire enlisted rank structure (12 ascending positions), and four officer ranks, and jumped right to O-5. And, here are the four names: The Reserve’s new lieutenant colonels are Shyam Sankar, chief technology officer for Palantir; Bosworth, chief technology officer of Meta; Kevin Weil, chief product officer of OpenAI; and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab and former chief research officer for OpenAI. Since my mind immediately goes to scandal and conspiracy when I see the federal government cozying up to Big Tech (I’m engrossed in the news every day, can you blame me?), I quizzed a military friend trying to understand any reason why this might not be the nightmare it seems, wondering if I were overlooking or missing something. His conclusion was logical and simple: the only reason people are commissioned into the military is because they want to work within the military framework. I asked if it was because maybe their civilian status precludes them from being involved in sensitive tasks or missions? He replied no, noting that civilian consultants are a normal thing in the military, and then referenced Hillary Clinton who “never served a day in her life” but held a Top Secret SCI until very recently, when President Trump revoked it. And, these four men aren’t going to be officers in the traditional sense, as they’re exempt from standard military requirements: As Task & Purpose notes, the men will get to skip the usual process of taking a Direct Commissioning Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, and they won’t need to complete the Army Fitness Test. So, why are top executives in Big Tech joining the military? Especially alarming is that all three tech firms, largely owned by BlackRock and Vanguard, are known for being enemies to liberty and freedom. (I wrote on a disturbing development regarding Palantir here.) At least two of these technocrats are World Economic Forum elites—and now they’re leaders in our military? Is Sankar just a surrogate for Palantir’s Alex Karp? This doesn’t sit right with me at all. Image from Grok.

Total: 0.31 times (BSE data as at 3.54 pm) The credit growth of NBFCs which has trended above India’s GDP growth historically, is expected to continue to rise at a faster pace. NBFCs have shown remarkable resilience and gained importance in the financial sector ecosystem, growing from less than Rs 2 trillion AUM at the turn of the century to Rs 48 trillion at the end of FY25. NBFCs AUM as of FY19 was approximately Rs 23 trillion which grew at a 6-year CAGR of 13.2% to Rs 48 trillion as of FY25. Rapid revival in the economy is expected to drive consumer demand on FY26, leading to healthy growth in NBFCs. The NBFC credit is expected to grow at 15-17% between FY 25 and FY 28, driven by growth across retail, MSME and corporate segments continuing to be the primary drivers. HDB Financial Services Limited being one of the leading and the fastest growing NBFC is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities within the sector and the company aims to diversify and expand addressable customer segments by widening and enhancing product offering and continue to expand pan-India omni-channel distribution network. Investors looking to invest can invest in the IPO for the long term. - Master Capital Services Ltd With scalable operations, granular customer acquisition, diversified funding, and expanding fee-based revenues, HDB is expected to sustain its growth momentum, outperform the sector, and continue delivering healthy, sustainable returns. We recommend to subscribe to the issue as a good long term investment as the company aligns with the aggressive mindset of the parent and improvement in npa levels that have seen recent deterioration while the CAR levels post issue are adequate for the next 12-18 months. SMIFS Sensex ended 700.40 pts or 0.85% higher at 82,755.51 and Nifty 50 settled at 25,244.75, up by 200.40 pts or 0.8%. We expect that its AUM and disbursement will witness higher growth compared to FY25, led by higher urban and rural consumer demand driven by government’s intervention in reducing income tax rates, RBI’s efficient inflation management and expected cuts in GST rates for the overall consumption basket. HDB’s initial issue is priced at 3.4x TTM P/B (considered equity raise for calculating TTM BV) compared to the peer average of 4.4x TTM P/B. We believe the issue is attractively priced considering its parentage, peer group ROA average and its growth potential. We assign a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to the initial issue of the HDB Financial Services. - Deven Choksey Research Key risks, according to Canara Bank Securities, include a high cost-to-income ratio (42%) and 27% unsecured loan exposure, though mitigated by data-driven underwriting. Despite valuation concerns, HDB’s strong brand, stable financials, rural reach, and niche positioning offer long-term potential for medium-to-long-term investor HDBFSL has reported a steady topline CAGR of 14.6% between FY23 and FY25. On the return front, HBDFSL has reported ROA at 2.1% in FY25 (vs 2.7% in FY24), while ROE declined from 17.9% in FY24 to 14.6% in FY25. GNPA and NNPA both increased from 1.9% and 0.6% in FY24 to 2.3% and 1.0% in FY25, respectively, as a result of slippages and write-offs during the fiscal. Despite the relatively lower return ratios and profitability growth, we remain optimistic of the company’s longer -term growth trend supported by a strong brand parentage, diversified liability franchise supported by a strong credit rating of AAA and a pan-India presence. The issue is valued at a P/B ratio of 3.9x at the upper price band based on FY25 book value, which we believe to be fairly valued compared to its peers. Considering the above compelling factors, we recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to this issue from a long term perspective. - BP WEALTH HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.28 times as at 3.03 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.28 times (BSE data as at 3.03 pm) HDBFS, a fast-growing subsidiary of HDFC Bank, is set for a ₹12,500cr IPO with a valuation of ~₹61,253cr at 3.9x P/B basis FY25 book value. Its strong presence in semi-urban and underbanked markets, diversified and expanding loan portfolio, advanced digital capabilities, and robust financial performance underscore its compelling long-term investment potential. - Aditya Birla Money Backed by strong parentage, AAA-rated credit profile, and an expanding footprint, A C Choksi Share Brokers Pvt. Ltd. says HDB is positioned to leverage growth in underserved segments. However, challenges around rising NPAs, elevated credit costs, and subdued ROEs remain near-term watchpoints. HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.24 times as at 2.21 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.24 times (BSE data as at 2.21 pm) Valuation: The company is valued at an FY25 P/B of 3.2x/3.4x at post\u0002issue capital at the lower price band & upper price band respectively. The company is backed by strong parentage, brand, governance, risk management and a high credit rating. It is one of the largest NBFCs catering to the 2 nd largest customer franchise. The company is well placed to register healthy growth going ahead, while witnessing an improvement in the asset quality. SBI Securities recommend investors SUBSCRIBE to the issue at the cut-off price. At the upper end of the price band, HDB is valued at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.01x and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 3.72x. This places it above peers like L&amp;T Finance and Mahindra Finance, and in line with Sundaram Finance and Cholamandalam, but below the premium commanded by Bajaj Finance. - Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk • Further stake sale by parent HDFC Bank can be overhang on the stock price: The parent HDFC Bank may have to decrease its holding from 74.2% (post-issue @ UB) to less than 20% in a span of 2 years, according to the draft circular by the RBI, which was issued on 4th October 24. • Asset quality risk: The company’s Gross Stage 3 Loans accounted for 2.3% of the gross loans as of Mar’25, which may adversely affect the company’s financials in case of non-payment or default. • Unsecured loan risk: Unsecured loans accounted for 27.0% of the company’s gross loans as of Mar’25. • Liquidity risk: Any asset-liability mismatch may cause liquidity concerns affecting the results of operations and financial condition • Regulatory risk: The NBFC industry is highly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India, and any adverse regulations or any failure to comply with a regulation may have an adverse impact on the business. - SBI Securities All IT stocks traded in green, led by Mphasis, LTIMindtree, Infosys. Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech. Among the defence index, Dynamatic Technologies and Cyient DLM traded with 1-3 per cent gains, while Data Patterns, GRSE, Paras Defence, BEL and Mazagon Dock depreciated 2-4 per cent.

HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.20 times as at 1.27 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.20 times (BSE data as at 1.27 pm) We believe HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO brings investors an opportunity to invest in one of India’s leading and fastest-growing diversified NBFCs, with a well-balanced loan portfolio across Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance. We think as it is backed by the brand strength and operational discipline of its promoter, HDFC Bank, HDB has demonstrated consistent growth, strong underwriting capabilities, and resilient asset quality— evidenced by its low GNPA and NNPA ratios. We also think with over 19 million customers, a granular loan book, and a robust phygital distribution network of 1,771 branches and 140,000+ retail touchpoints, the company is well positioned to capture underpenetrated credit demand, particularly among “new to credit” borrowers. By looking at the financials, the company has demonstrated a a revenue growth of 14.3% in FY2024 and 15% in FY2025, with net profit rising by 25.6% in FY2024, though witnessing a modest decline of 11.6% in FY2025, mainly on account of two- fold increase in provision. On valuation parse at the upper price band of ₹740/-, the issue is asking a market cap of ₹ 61,388 cr. Based on FY 2025 earnings and fully diluted post-IPO paid up capital, the company is asking for Price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.5x which seems fairly valued looking at its industry average ~3.5-4x. Given its strong parentage, proven execution across cycles, diversified loan mix, and digital-first approach, we believe HDB Financial Services is well positioned to benefit from India’s ongoing financial inclusion and expanding retail credit demand. Hence, looking at all attributes we recommend investors to “SUBSCRIBE” the HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO for long term perspective. Mehta Equities HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.17 times as at 12.42 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.17 times (BSE data as at 12.42 pm) We compare HDB with Bajaj Finance and also with other vehicle, MSME, Consumer financiers like Chola, M&M Finance, Shriram Finance and L&T Finance. HDB’s asset quality is superior to peers on the back of its strong ownership and management pedigree. Its loan growth has been in line with peers over last 3 years. However we note that owing to HDB’s prudent focus on quality of customers, it earns a lower spread vis-à-vis peers. Also HDB’s operational cost is elevated. Thus HDB has managed to deliver ROA in the range of between 2 to 3% over last 3 years with FY25 post IPO ROA of 2.0%. This is below the peer average of 3.2% and Bajaj Finance’s 5.0% witnessed in FY25. Although we believe that HDB should be valued at a substantial discount to Bajaj Finance, its superior parentage and asset quality performance lead us to believe that it is attractively valued from a long term perspective upon comparing with Chola which has ROA of 2.4% and is being valued at 5.5x FY25 compared to HDB’s 3.4x (post IPO). Also HDB’s valuation is in line with the peer average which provides us comfort. Therefore, we recommend SUBSCRIBE to the issue, with a Long-term POSITIVE outlook Nirmal Bang Timing the Tide: Cyclical Sweet Spot or Regulatory Compulsion? The IPO’s June launch coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs – credit growth remains robust at 15%+, asset quality metrics have normalized post-pandemic, and risk appetite is returning to rural markets. However, beneath these favorable conditions lurk structural challenges: rising cost of funds (HDB’s NIMs compressed 30 bps in FY24), increasing competition from new-age fintechs, and the perennial volatility of unsecured lending (27% of HDB’s portfolio). HDFC Bank’s decision to monetize part of its 94% stake through a ₹10,000 crore OFS while retaining 74% ownership suggests cautious optimism – they’re taking money off the table but maintaining skin in the game. The fresh ₹2,500 crore capital infusion will strengthen HDB’s tier-1 capital adequacy (currently at 16.8%), providing ammunition to chase growth while maintaining healthy buffers. For investors, the key consideration isn’t whether HDB is a good company (its 2.26% GNPA and 23% CAGR loan book growth confirm it is), but whether it can translate its HDFC lineage and pan-India presence into superior returns in a maturing market. In many ways, HDB’s IPO represents the NBFC sector’s transition from its “wild west” days to a more regulated, institutional phase. Its performance post-listing will reveal much about public market appetite for steady, diversified lenders in an environment where specialists often steal the spotlight. The company’s fate won’t just belong to its shareholders, but will serve as a barometer for the entire NBFC sector’s next chapter. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says IPO-bound non-banking finance company (NBFC) HDB Financial Services does not get or give any business leads to HDFC Bank or share any office space with the latter, and is not reliant on its parent for operational purposes, MD & CEO G Ramesh, told businessline in an interaction. “We originate our business ourselves, we don’t get any leads from any of our promoter companies. We underwrite our own business, and operate 1,771 branches of HDB Financial Services. They are our own branches and there is no shared space with HDFC Bank. And our technology stack is different than the bank, which makes our business independent,” he said. His comments come in the backdrop of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 2024 draft norms which state that only a single entity within a bank group can undertake a particular form of permissible business. Report by Piyush Shukla of businessline | Read more HDB Financial Services, an IPO-bound NBFC, operates independently from HDFC Bank, with an upcoming IPO on June 25. HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.14 times as at 12.03 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.14 times (BSE data as at 12.03 pm) HDB’s IPO crystallises three critical trends in Indian finance. First, it underscores the RBI’s push to bring systemically important NBFCs (like HDB, classified in the “upper layer”) under greater market discipline through public listings. Second, it highlights how banks are reluctantly reducing stakes in lucrative NBFC subsidiaries ahead of anticipated ownership caps. Third, and most importantly, the offering serves as a referendum on whether generalist NBFCs can command premium valuations in a market that increasingly rewards niche lenders. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned. More to come At upper price band, IPO is priced at 3.2x FY25 P/BV post capital raise (V/s its close peer Chola Fin-5.5x) with 2.2% ROA. We recommend SUBSCRIBE for long term. Key risk: Regulatory overhang on overlap of business activities with the parent. - IDBI Capital The ₹12,500 crore HDB Financial Services IPO marks a pivotal moment for India’s NBFC sector – not just as the largest NBFC debut to date, but as a test case for how public markets value diversified lenders in an era of tightening regulations and evolving credit demand. Coming at a time when RBI is pushing large NBFCs toward listing (with a September 2025 deadline), this IPO represents both a regulatory compliance exercise and a strategic coming-of-age for HDFC Bank’s 17-year-old shadow lending arm. The timing is telling: with credit growth outpacing GDP expansion and NBFCs capturing 40% of new retail loans, HDB’s public listing offers a calibrated entry point into India’s formalisation of credit. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned. More to come HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.12 times as at 11.36 am on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.12 times (BSE data as at 11.36 am) We recommend to subscribe this IPO with long term view, as With its robust brand, varied loan portfolio, and wide distribution network, the company which is supported by HDFC Bank offers a great chance. With a focus on digital infrastructure and underbanked segments, it is well-positioned for long-term growth. Considering the company’s constant growth in its headline numbers and the recent rate cut by the RBI will improve liquidity and reduces borrowing costs, which will benefits the company. - Kunvarji Wealth Solutions JM Financial, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities India, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt Ltd, IIFL Securities, Jefferies India, Morgan Stanley India Company, Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt Ltd, Nuvama Wealth Management, and UBS Securities India are managing the company’s IPO. HDB Financial Services, a subsidiary of HDFC Bank, has garnered Rs 3,369 crore from anchor investors, according to an update on the exchange. The anchor round saw participation from a host of investors such as domestic mutual funds, insurance companies, and foreign entities, according to a circular uploaded on the BSE website on Tuesday. Life Insurance Corporation of India, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), SBI MF, Nippon India MF, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, BlackRock, Royal Bank of Canada, Allianz Global Investors, Morgan Stanley, Prudential plc, Copthall Mauritius Investment, APG Asset Management, Baillie Gifford, Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, and Goldman Sachs have participated in the anchor round. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, British multinational Schroder, Fidelity Investments, Societe Generale, and Tata Investment Corporation, among others, have also been allotted shares in the anchor round. According to the circular, HDB Financial Services has allotted over 4.55 crore equity shares to 141 entities at Rs 740 per equity share, which is the upper end of the IPO price band, aggregating the transaction size to Rs 3,368.99 crore. Of the total equity share allocation to the anchor investors, the company has allocated nearly 1.94 crore shares to 22 domestic mutual funds that have applied for the public issue through 65 schemes, the circular said. PTI “HDB Financial Services Ltd. is India’s second largest and third-fastestgrowing NBFC franchise, serving 19.2 million customers as of March 31, 2025, with a CAGR of 25.45% over two years. Its growth is supported by financial inclusion initiatives, and it offers 13 lending products across Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance, tailored by loan type, customer profile, tenure, and interest rate. They have built a pan-India hybrid presence, comprising over 1,771 physical branches across more than 1,170 towns and cities in 31 States and Union Territories as of March 31, 2025, supported by a digitally enabled distribution network through both in-house and third-party channels. They intend to further diversify their funding sources by expanding and strengthening their lender base, with the goal of optimising leverage and reducing the average cost of borrowings. At the upper price band, the company’s FY25 price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 3.7x, with a post-issue market capitalization of ₹6,13,879.4 million. Backed by the strong parentage of HDFC Bank, India’s second largest private bank by total assets, the company offers a well-diversified product portfolio with robust granularity, scale, and sound lending quality. We consider the IPO fairly valued and recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating.” Anand Rathi HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.08 times as at 10.48 am on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.08 times (BSE data as at 10.48 am) HDB Financial Limited IPO: We recommend a SUBSCRIBE rating to the issue, supported by: 1) A robust brand franchise and granular retail lending model, 2) A wide-reaching Omni-channel (phygital) distribution platform, and 3) Access to low-cost funding anchored by a AAA-rated credit profile. - Centrum Broking Sharekhan IPO report mentions, HDB Financial Services is valued at an FY25 price-to-book ratio of ~3.2x/~3.4x at post-issue capital at the lower price band & upper price band respectively, which is reasonable as compared to its peers considering the growth and return ratio profile. “Strong parentage and much smaller in size as compared its core peer (Bajaj Finance) provides a long runway for growth. Additionally, favourable macro environment will act as tailwind for the sector in the near to medium term. We expect healthy listing gains and remain assertive from a medium to long-term perspective.” ❑ Asset Quality: High exposure to unsecured loans and MSMEs increases the risk of defaults, especially during economic stress. ❑ Geographic Concentration: Over 80% of branches are in semi-urban/rural areas, which may be more vulnerable to economic or monsoon-related disruptions. ❑ Liquidity & Interest Rate Risk: As an NBFC, HDB relies on borrowed funds. Tightening liquidity or rising interest rates could impact margins and loan growth. ❑ Regulatory Risk: RBI’s evolving norms for NBFCs could affect operations, compliance costs, and capital requirements. ❑ Competition: Intense competition from banks, fintechs, and other NBFCs may pressure yields and affect credit quality. ❑ Limited Transparency: Being unlisted, HDB provides less public disclosure than listed peers, limiting investor visibility HDB Financial Services IPO has been subscribed 0.04 times as at 10.18 am on June 25, its opening day. The NII portion has been booked 0.07 times, retail 0.05 times, employee portion 0.29 times and reserved for shareholders 0.07 times. QIBs were NIL.

Arisinfra Solutions stock rose 1.55% on the NSE to ₹208.18 as at 10.09 am after listing at ₹205, a 7.65% discount from the IPO price of ₹222. Valuation: HFSL is the seventh largest leading, diversified retail-focused NBFC in India in terms of the size of total gross loan. The company is categorized as an Upper layer NBFC (NBFC-UL) by RBI. Its lending products are offered through three business verticals which is Enterprise lending (39.3%), Asset lending (38%) and consumer finance (22.7%). The company’s loan book comprises 73% secured loans and 27% unsecured loans, with its customer base primarily consisting of salaried individuals, self-employed professionals, and business owners. GNPA stood at 2.3% and NNPA at 1% for FY25. At the higher price band, the issue is valued at a P/BV of 3.4x (based on post-issue BVPS), which is in line with the peer average, making the issue appear fully priced. While the company has delivered steady growth in interest income driven by the expansion of its gross loan book, profitability has been impacted by interest rate volatility, leading to a decline in PAT for FY25. Additionally, the NIM has been under pressure and remains lower compared to peers. The declining ROE and PCR further underscore operational concerns. Although the company is well-positioned for long-term growth, supported by its strong brand and expanding customer base, considering the near-term operational challenges, we recommend a “Subscribe For Long Term” rating for this issue -Choice Broking India’s largest NBFC public issue, HDB Financial Services, will hit the primary market today at a price band ₹700-740 a share.

Title: Spot Ethereum ETFs record $1B inflows in 15 trading days, hitting $4B for the first time

BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) drove the expansion with $5.3 billion of gross inflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the US crossed $4 billion in cumulative net inflows on June 23, only eleven months after their market debut. The products launched on July 23, 2024, and required 216 US trading sessions to accumulate their first $3 billion by May 30. Following the $3 billion mark, spot Ethereum ETFs added the next $1 billion in just 15 trading days, lifting lifetime net subscriptions to $4.01 billion by the close of June 23. Those 15 sessions represent 6.5% of the 231-day trading history but account for 25% of all cash committed so far. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) drove the expansion with $5.31 billion of gross inflows, while Fidelity’s FETH contributed $1.65 billion and Bitwise’s ETHW added $346 million. Grayscale’s legacy ETHE trust, which converted to an ETF at launch, recorded $4.28 billion in outflows over the same period. Daily flow data show the inflection. ETHA absorbed more than $160 million on June 11 alone, and the complex booked five separate days above $100 million between May 30 and June 23. Grayscale’s redemptions slowed during the same window, allowing aggregate flows to turn sharply higher. ETHA and FETH charge 0.25% management fees, matching the sector median and undercutting ETHE’s 2.5% rate. Lower costs, combined with established primary-market relationships, continue to steer inflows toward BlackRock and Fidelity, according to a CoinShares report that spoke with brokers who allocate on behalf of wealth managers. The report highlighted three factors as drivers for the June surge. The first is a rebound in ETH’s price relative to Bitcoin, coinciding with the Internal Revenue Service’s more explicit guidance on staking income within grantor-trust ETFs. Lastly, larger rebalancing orders from multi-asset allocators, treating ETH as a portfolio extension rather than a standalone speculative bet, contributed to the surge in inflows. The next quarterly Form 13F deadline in mid-July will reveal whether professional managers joined the late-spring push. Through March 31, those firms accounted for less than 33% of spot Ethereum ETF assets, suggesting room for broader institutional uptake even as retail flows concentrate on low-fee vehicles.

Title: Principal of school in Blackrock, Dublin, given further 16 months for indecent assault charges

Full Content:
A former school principal jailed for indecently assaulting two students has been told he will spend a further 16 months in prison for indecently assaulting another four boys. Aidan Clohessy (85) was jailed for four years on Monday for indecently assaulting two boys in the 1980s. He was convicted of 19 counts of indecent assault in relation to six boys following two separate trials at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court last month. On Tuesday, Judge Martin Nolan imposed sentence in relation to the second trial, in which Clohessy was convicted of five counts of indecently assaulting four boys. Two of these counts of indecent assault related to one boy, with one count each in relation to the other three boys. All of these offences took place between 1969 and 1986. Clohessy was acquitted of three further counts of indecent assault. After hearing facts on Monday, Judge Nolan adjourned the case overnight to consider sentence and the defence’s submission in relation to the totality principle. Judge Nolan said the indecent assaults were “undoubtedly very serious” for the injured parties, noting that many of the incidents described were “obviously physical chastisement as well”. He said the aggravating features included that Clohessy was in a position of trust which he betrayed. The judge also noted that the injured parties were vulnerable and said Clohessy “took advantage of their vulnerability”. He said there was some “small mitigation”, including Clohessy’s age. Judge Nolan said if this was a stand-alone trial, and Clohessy was younger, he would impose a sentence of between three and four years. But, the judge said the court had to take into account the totality principle and that Clohessy is already serving a sentence. He imposed a 16-month sentence, which is to run consecutive to the four-year sentence imposed on Monday. This means Clohessy has received a sentence of five years and four months for his offending against the six injured parties. A member of the Order of St John of God, Clohessy was the principal of St Augustine’s School, Blackrock, Co Dublin, from the early 1970s until 1993, when he was appointed to lead a mission in Malawi. Clohessy, with an address at the Hospitaller Order of St John of God, Granada, Stillorgan, Co Dublin, voluntarily returned to Ireland in 2013. The six boys were all pupils of the school. Some were boarders at the school, which catered for boys with mild to moderate learning disability at that time. The injured parties were aged between 10 and 13 when Clohessy’s offending took place. The abuse primarily took the form of inappropriate touching, the court heard. In the first trial, Clohessy was convicted of 14 counts of indecent assault – 10 in relation to one boy and four in relation to a second boy on dates between 1983 and 1985. The court heard that some of the complainants had no objection to being identified.

Title: These 3 Big Dividends Just Got Cut. They’re Safer Than Ever
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/06/24/these-3-big-dividends-just-got-cut-theyre-safer-than-ever/
Time Published: 2025-06-24T16:17:00Z

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Hundred Dollar Bill Being Cut With a Scissor If you invest for long enough, you may hear a skeptic of high-yield investments—such as 8%+ yielding closed-end funds—say something like: “Sure, you’re getting a lot of income now, but what if that dividend gets cut?” Today we’re going to answer that with a look at how a dividend cut can actually send a CEF (or any dividend investment, really) on a profitable run. We’ll do it by looking at three CEFs that followed this exact pattern: Cutting dividends and then going on to give investors huge returns for years and years. These funds show that a dividend cut on its own isn’t reason enough to avoid an investment. It could, in fact, be a buy signal. Let’s start with the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), which yields 8.2% as I write this and trades at a 7.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Put another way, the fund’s portfolio is valued at just over 92 cents on the dollar. That portfolio consists of a basket of large- and mid-cap stocks, with holdings like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) alongside firms such as property manager FirstService (FSV) and Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI), which runs a chain of discount stores. The fund uses an approach to dividends that a handful of other CEFs also follow: It commits to paying 8% of its NAV in payouts each year (in ASG’s case through four quarterly installments). That means that the dividend does tend to float, and the latest one is about 17% below where it was a decade or so ago. Now in light of that policy, this dividend “cut” is a little different than one we might see at a fund with a fixed payout, like the two we’ll examine next. But regardless, ASG’s lower payout might cause some investors to pass on the fund. That’s too bad for them, since ASG has delivered plenty of special dividends in the last decade (the spikes in the chart above), culminating in a 162% total return (with price gains and reinvested dividends). Did ASG’s payout technically decline? Yes. But that strong total return more than makes up for it, proving that the lower payout is a poor reason to avoid this well-run CEF. Our next fund yields well into the double digits: the 13.6%-yielding BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX). As the name says, BTX holds well-known tech stocks like NVIDIA, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). It also holds a collection of private-equity investments. We added BTX to my CEF Insider service in our April 2025 issue. But before then we avoided it, partly because its IPO was in 2021, when many tech firms, and many of the PE investments BTX’s former management team purchased, were overvalued. BTX, which replaced its managers at the end of January, has only recently traded at what I would consider a buyable price. We’ve been more than happy that we were patient! In less than two months since our buy call, BTX has returned 16%, as of this writing. Even with its recent dividend cut (more on that in a moment), BTX’s current yield still translates to more than $11,000 per month on every $1 million invested. But you could easily miss this if you just looked at its dividend history. BTX Dividend Of course, a 19.3% decline in the last five years jumps out, and that gentle slide lower at the right side of the chart also looks like it could be a warning sign. Let’s take the second point first: That slide is due to the fact that the fund’s previous management team overdid it on their last dividend hike. The new team is gradually adjusting lower. That’s not a reason to worry. Meantime, a major reason why BTX’s yield so high is that the fund remains underpriced, even after its recent run (as yields and share prices move in opposite directions). As you can see above, at the start of the year, it traded at a double-digit discount that has since narrowed to around 2%. That’s a major reason for the 16% total return we’ve realized from this fund at CEF Insider. So, even if BTX’s 13.6% yield is at risk of moving lower, investors who’ve bought the fund are still doing fine, thanks to the stock-price appreciation they’ve realized. (And of course, the huge income stream, which remains so even with a decline.) In other words, a continued gradual drift lower in the payout is fine, as long as BTX’s portfolio keeps rising. We’ve seen that happen consistently over the last couple of months, and I expect it to continue as the fund’s discount moves closer to becoming a premium. Finally, let’s consider another “cutter” that’s (now) delivering consistent income: the Pioneer High Income Fund (PHT), which holds high-yield corporate bonds. PHT’s portfolio has been appreciating, despite volatile markets, as the Fed postponed rate cuts. The longer the central bank holds off, the more high-yield, longer-duration bonds PHT can buy (these bonds become more valuable as interest rates decline). PHT has had a 15.6% annualized return over the last three years, as of this writing, as it recovered from the 2022 selloff. And look at what the dividend did in that time: PHT Dividend That 12% payout cut happened while PHT was delivering those same strong returns. Sure, the dividend—current yield 8.2%—made up a smaller part of PHT’s 15.6% annualized return due to the cuts, but capital gains more than made up the difference. In a situation like that, does the lower dividend really matter? Look at it this way: Every dollar put into PHT three years ago now earns a 9.6% yield on an investor’s original cost. And on the price front, every dollar is now worth $1.17. These funds are just three examples of how dividend cuts are only one part of the story when looking at high-yield investments like CEFs—and how they can actually spark a turnaround in an investment’s performance. That said, it’s also true that you can’t just put all of your money in one CEF and rely on that payout for the rest of your life. But it is possible to tap a strong income stream and, with just a bit of elbow grease, rebalance your portfolio every now and then to secure that income stream. And, of course, capital gains are also on the table to grow your portfolio in the long run. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Global liquidity and BTC’s resilience could fuel continued uptrend. Bitcoin [BTC] continued to show resilience as Global Liquidity climbed to $140 trillion, nearly reclaiming all-time highs. The move came as the U.S. dollar weakened, and the MOVE Index dipped, boosting overall liquidity in risk markets. This uptick was not random—weekly liquidity grew by $0.46 trillion, a 0.33% increase, as confirmed by Alpha Extract. That surge helped reinforce the current macro support for Bitcoin’s bullish bias. The 3-month Rate of Change (RoC) stayed elevated, backing the thesis that Bitcoin’s $78,000 breakout wasn’t just noise. Historically, a rising 3-month RoC aligns with bull market territory and risk-on appetite. In fact, the RoC’s trend has been consistent since the initial breakout and continues to support the uptrend even as geopolitical risks shift. Source: Alpha Extract Due to the de-escalation of geopolitical tensions, especially between the U.S. and Iran, fear-related volatility was diminished. Oddly enough, a direct war could have spurred liquidity via emergency spending. However, markets now lean toward reduced uncertainty, favoring slow-and-steady growth over chaos. This lowered volatility backdrop is ideal for assets like Bitcoin, which thrive on confidence and consistent capital flows. Following the powerful resilience exhibited by Bitcoin, the whale activity and institutional inflows increased. A whale made a withdrawal of 163 BTC from Binance worth $17.16 million, but this was just a part of a bigger transfer. The same whale withdrew 2,263 BTC, or $235.02 million in total. Of that, 2,100 BTC was sent straight to cold storage. In fact, it was this vigorous hoarding that indicated an increase in the confidence of Bitcoin as a long-term trend and a determined course in self-custody. Moreover, according to Trader to The Fund’s latest ETF flow data, Bitcoin ETFs saw $350.48 million in Net Inflows, marking the 10th straight day of green. BlackRock was on top with IBIT raising a total of $217.65 million, and Fidelity followed with $105.66 million Source: Trader to The Fund/X Healthy participation was found even in smaller funds. Even though Grayscale had a small outflow amount of $5.69 million, mini funds had a positive $10.06 million gain. Overall, the sustained demand from both majors and minors confirms that institutional appetite remains firm in this liquidity-rich phase. On the 15-minute chart, BTC jumped past $105,000, liquidating short positions en masse. A strong bullish candle supported a high-paced move of the price up to $105,112, after initially standing at a distance of $103,697. Meanwhile, CVD dropped to -10.438K, confirming that aggressive short-selling failed to hold the line. At the same time, Open Interest (OI) fell to 289.18K from 290.84K. This indicated liquidation of short positions rather than fresh long entries—a classic wipeout as bears got squeezed. Source: TradingView As OI declined while prices continued rising, it became clear that short positions were being liquidated in real time, fueling even more momentum for the ongoing bull market.

Title: New BlackRock ETF Signals A Strong Focus On The Texas Economy

ByDavid Blackmon ByDavid Blackmon, Senior Contributor. BlackRock chairman and CEO US Larry Fink gestures as he addresses the audience, during the annual ... More meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Alpine resort of Davos on January 24, 2025. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) The Texas state government made big news a few years back when it invoked sanctions on big institutional investor BlackRock, claiming the firm’s ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) based investing strategies unfairly discriminated against the state’s oil and gas energy sector. The sanctions were invoked related to a state law passed in 2021, during the height of the ESG investment boom. But that movement has faded rapidly over the past year as oil and gas corporations have refocused their capital allocation strategies away from low carbon projects, which shareholders have noticed also largely proved to be low profit endeavors. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has adjusted as well, removing the term “ESG” from his internal and external communications and tailoring BlackRock’s investment strategies to reflect current trends. Most recently, Blackrock has made significant moves to re-engage in the Texas marketplace. Bloomberg reported in late March that Fink’s firm had filed to establish a Texas-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) which would invest in companies headquartered in the Lone Star State. On Tuesday, BlackRock launched the iShares Texas Equity ETF (NASDAQ: TEXN) to be based off the Russell Texas Equity Index, which is designed to reflect the performance of Russell 3000 companies with Texas headquarters. “TEXN presents a new opportunity for Texans, and investors across the country, to invest in nearly 200 companies powering the state’s economy and to capitalize on Texas’ twin engines of business and population growth,” said Joe DeVico, Head of the Americas Client Business at BlackRock. Despite its controversies with the state’s government, BlackRock was one of the founding investors in the nascent Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE). With current plans to launch operations in 2026, TXSE has taken in over $120 million in capital from investors like BlackRock and Citadel, who see the state and its massive economy as a major growth engine for the future. TXSE plans to function as a national securities exchange and is banking on being able to obtain application approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of 2025. In response to BlackRock’s filing for its Texas-focused ETF, James H. Lee, Chairman and CEO of the Texas Stock Exchange, posted about it on LinkedIn: “BlackRock’s plan to create a Texas ETF is a masterclass move that puts it at the forefront of two key trends. The first is the momentum behind the Texas Miracle. We’re seeing the same demand to invest in and grow Texas businesses, especially since our state is already home to more than one in 10 U.S. public companies. The second key trend is the rapidly expanding market for ETPs, which is projected to grow to more than $25 trillion over the next decade.” Lee added that he was "excited that the world's largest institutional investor is making another bold strategic move in our great state.” So, despite the dustups with state officials of the recent past, BlackRock maintains a large and growing presence in Texas. According to BlackRock’s Texas state spotlight, they have over $379 billion invested in Texas public companies, $134.6 billion invested in state energy, and over $14 billion invested in Texas municipal bonds on behalf of clients. In fact, BlackRock today stands one of the largest investors in Texas oil and gas. For Fink and his management team, the motivations for such a robust presence in the state are obvious. Investing in Texas, as TEXN will promote, not only strengthens the state’s energy infrastructure but also aligns with and advances America’s rapidly evolving national energy policy objectives. Texas is the nation’s largest energy producer, accounting for 41% of national crude oil and 25% of natural gas production. The state also leads the country in both wind and solar power generation capacity, making up about 28% of U.S. wind-powered electricity. Regardless of anyone’s personal views about the various forms of generation, all investors must recognize that grid infrastructure like transmission lines and upgrades, battery storage systems, and weatherization of critical facilities require constant injections of new capital. These rising levels of investment are crucial for maintaining grid stability and accommodating renewable energy sources and baseload generation from natural gas, coal and nuclear alike. For Texas’s nation-leading suite of wind and solar installations, programs like the federal government’s $7 billion investment in the Solar for All program, including nearly $406 million for Texas, and the Renewable Energy Electric Generation (REEG) program in Texas, which has attracted approximately $62 billion in investments, provide major injections of such capital. The same is true of the state’s natural gas generation sector, which is again embarked on a growth path as power generators strive to meet Texas’s rapidly expanding electricity demand in the coming years. In essentially every possible way, Texas stands as a pivotal player in the U.S. energy landscape. There is no question the state must be able to attract major, strategic investments to maintain and further bolster its leadership in energy production, grid reliability, and clean energy transition. BlackRock continues to invest heavily in local industries, including energy, infrastructure, and real estate because Texas offers what few other states can: low taxes, light regulation, a booming population, and thriving energy and tech sectors. In the end, while political drama may dominate headlines, economic and energy reality drives investment decisions. Texas remains a place where business still comes first, and BlackRock, through its investment in the TXSE and establishment of its Texas-focused ETF, appears committed to both Texas and financial returns in its continuation of doing business in the state.

Title: Analyzing Ethereum’s 8% rebound – Will Q3 push ETH to $3K?

Time Published: 2025-06-24T12:00:56Z

Caught between conviction and caution, Ethereum tests a key supply wall. After nearly two weeks of relentless selling pressure on Ethereum [ETH], a sharp 8.27% green candle has emerged, at press time, clawing back nearly 21% of those losses in just one move. On closer look, this resembles a textbook “reset and rebound” setup, where a cooldown offered patient investors a shot at discounted supply, especially with macro FUD starting to ease off. Yet, the line between a relief rally and a breakout could be razor-thin. According to AMBCrypto, which side Ethereum lands on may well dictate its directional bias heading into Q3. Yet again, Ethereum’s two-week decline has been noticeably steeper than [BTC], with ETH shedding 26% from its $2,878 mid-June peak, more than double BTC’s 10.89% drop. And this wasn’t just a fluke. While Bitcoin showed relative resilience, Ethereum’s Short-Term Holder (STH) NUPL plunged into the capitulation zone right as ETH broke below the $2.5k mark, after nearly a month of tightly range-bound trading around that level. This was further confirmed by a surge in realized losses, suggesting that STHs began unwinding their positions in weakness. Now, with ETH climbing back toward that same $2.5k zone, these holders may view the rally as a break-even escape, right as Ethereum re-enters a high-density cost basis cluster, as highlighted by the chart below. Source: Glassnode The yellow and orange bands highlight where most Ethereum holders bought their supply, clustering heavily around this zone. Numerous entries sat specifically in the $2.4k to $2.6k range, making it one of the most crowded and critical areas to watch as ETH approaches resistance. If ETH pushes through this band with strength, it could clear the way for further upside. But if weak hands step in to exit at breakeven, it could turn into a near-term ceiling. As Ethereum climbs into a key cost basis cluster, whether holders stay confident in a continued move higher could shape how Q3 plays out. Despite a solid run through Q1 and Q2, ETH still hasn’t managed to reclaim the $3k level, a psychological barrier that might push some investors to sell early, especially with macro risks still lingering. That’s why the recent $100 million in ETF inflows feels encouraging, as it shows fresh capital is still flowing in. Pair that with a 9.3% jump in Open Interest and a 61% long bias on Binance ETH perps, and clearly, the market’s leaning bullish. Source: CoinGlass But is this conviction? Or are we looking at blind optimism, a setup for another volatility-driven shakeout just as ETH nears resistance? Well, BlackRock’s recent $18.4 million sell-off adds a layer of caution. Smart money seems to be dialing back, too. So, unless Ethereum can break through that $2.4k– $2.6k supply wall with strength, the idea of a clean run to $3k in Q3 might be a stretch for now.

Title: Investment Firm Waltz Secures $25M Line of Credit

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy In a sign that U.S. real estate investment remains a safe harbor for foreigners, investment company Waltz announced Tuesday that it has secured a $25 million line of credit, bringing its total debt and equity funding to $50 million. Setpoint Capital provided the new funding to support Miami-based Waltz’s up to $1 billion in loan volume capability for foreign investors looking to invest in U.S. residential real estate. “The demand is growing,” said Yuval Golan, founder and CEO of Waltz, which plans to use the new funding to expand into Latin America and meet some of that demand. “What we see in the market, even though there’s some uncertainty, is that foreigners keep investing and being very bullish on America right now, especially the sophisticated investors. A lot of demand is from countries that are seeing some macro political issues.” The line of credit is intended to originate additional U.S. mortgage loans for foreign buyers through its digital platform, which will support Waltz’s official launch across Central and South America, with a focus on Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Argentina — the first three being the region’s largest sources of U.S. real estate investment. Data shows that Latin American buyers make up 29 percent of international investors in U.S. residential real estate purchases of existing property sales, not including new developments. In addition, Golan is seeing investor interest from Canada, Cuba, Israel, Russia and Ukraine. “We don’t use our equity funds to lend,” said Golan. “We use a warehouse line that we can recycle, so then we can lend more and more. How does this work? Let’s say I have a line of credit of $25 million and at any given moment I have $25 million to lend. I originate the loan, then we sell that loan to Apollo or Acra Lending, one of our other secondary market players. They pay us back the principal plus the premium, and then I can redeploy the capital to use that again. Let’s say I sell to them every week. That means that I can recycle the $25 million times 52, and I use this money to turn it into a billion. “These are premium buyers that understand what they’re doing, and people believe in the U.S. economy,” said Golan of his international clients. “And that’s the time to raise and boost up the demand. There’s a lot of new construction coming up in the next few years. Post-COVID, things got a bit delayed, but now they’re coming back and inventory is back up.” Waltz’s end-to-end digital platform allows foreign investors to quickly and easily form an LLC, open a U.S. bank account, exchange currencies, secure financing, and close on property purchases. It launched in July 2024 and has processed more than $300 million in loan applications on four continents, with 15 to 20 percent of clients being U.S.-based high-credit borrowers, according to Waltz. The company uses its AI-enhanced technology across its platform, including onboarding, underwriting, processing, and selling loans to Wall Street institutions including Acra Lending, a subsidiary of HPS acquired by BlackRock; and Atlas SP, which is backed by Apollo. “We have a lot of data on our loans,” said Golan. “Many Wall Street players are very excited about our product and are partnering up with us. We automate and use artificial intelligence more and more, so that we can sell the loans faster with a lot of data. So they’re very excited about it.” “With Waltz’s full-service approach, they are streamlining investment opportunities and making it easier for individuals across the globe to invest in income-producing residential properties in the U.S.,” said Kendall Ranjbaran, managing director of investments at Setpoint Capital. “Setpoint is proud to provide a tailored credit solution as they continue to scale.” Philip Russo can be reached at prusso@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Vanguard Vs. Fidelity Index Funds: Which Is Best For Your Investments In 2025?

Time Published: 2025-06-24T11:00:00Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Vanguard and Fidelity have sufficient index fund options to fulfill simple or complex investing ... More strategies. Vanguard and Fidelity offer popular index funds with competitive expense ratios. Is one fund family better for your investment portfolio than the other? This detailed comparison of Vanguard and Fidelity index funds—covering fees, performance and selection—helps you decide. One fun fact sums up Vanguard’s investment philosophy: Under the direction of company founder John Bogle, Vanguard created the world's first index fund in 1976. Bogle's innovation gave investors convenient access to a low-cost portfolio that could be held for decades. Bogle also decided to market Vanguard funds directly to investors, bypassing brokers, and to eliminate sales loads. Both moves, unconventional in the 1970s, showed Vanguard's commitment to the individual investor's success. The move to drop sales charges has spared investors from hundreds of millions in fees over the past several decades. Today, Vanguard retains its reputation as a leader in low-cost funds and a champion of retail investors. According to Morningstar, Fidelity is the third-largest fund family after Vanguard and BlackRock in terms of U.S. market concentration. The company was formed to take over the Fidelity Fund in 1946 and launched its first index fund in 1988. Fidelity's index fund strategy emphasizes low costs and fund performance that aligns closely to the target index. Both objectives benefit index fund investors by minimizing dilution of underlying investment returns. Below are head-to-head comparisons for Vanguard and Fidelity on expense ratios, fund selection, fund performance and minimum investment requirements. Vanguard expense ratios on index funds with investment minimums of $3,000 or less range from 0.03% to 0.2%. Per author calculations, the average expense ratio is 0.07%, which equates to $7 annually for every $10,000 invested. Fidelity expense ratios across 82 index funds for retail investors range from 0% to 0.4%. The average is 0.12%, per author calculations. This translates to $12 annually per $10,000 invested. Vanguard has the lower average expense ratio, but Fidelity offers a selection of zero-expense funds. Also, Fidelity’s S&P 500 fund, FXAIX, has lower expenses than Vanguard's S&P 500 portfolios. FXIAX charges 0.015%, while Vanguard's VOO ETF and VFAIX fund charge 0.03% and 0.04%, respectively. Both companies beat broader expense ratio averages. A Morningstar report concludes that the average fees for passively managed funds in 2023 was 0.55%. Vanguard has more index funds with low investment minimums than Fidelity, but both families cover these popular market segments: Cryptocurrency is one point of differentiation and Fidelity has the edge. Fidelity has funds stocked with bitcoin (FBTC) and ethereum (FETH). Vanguard does not offer crypto funds. Performance comparisons for index funds can be tricky because the underlying index is primarily responsible for defining the portfolio. So, the comparison is most telling when two funds are targeting the same index. In that case, sampling methods and trading efficiency can introduce a higher-than-necessary tracking error—causing one fund to underperform. The table below compares returns for S&P 500 funds and U.S. bond market funds from both families. Fidelity performed slightly better on the S&P 500 fund and in the one-year period for the bond fund. Lower expense ratios on the two Fidelity mutual funds contribute to the outperformance. More generalized comparisons can be made between funds that offer similar exposures but rely on different target indexes. The index gets most of the credit for outperformance, particularly when both compared funds have low tracking errors. Even so, the fund family can take responsibility for choosing the stronger index. This table compares Vanguard and Fidelity funds with similar strategies, implemented through different target indexes. You can see the performance gaps are larger vs. the prior comparison. The Vanguard index funds mostly outperformed here, despite Fidelity’s funds having lower expense ratios. Both Vanguard and Fidelity have at least 80 index funds with a $0 or $1 investment minimum. These are predominantly exchange-traded funds. Vanguard additionally has about 50 mutual funds with a $3,000 minimum investment. Both Vanguard and Fidelity are appropriate for beginner investors. Those who plan to own only an S&P 500 fund and a bond fund might earn slightly higher returns with Fidelity, thanks to the ultra-low expense ratios. On the other hand, Vanguard’s website and fund research tools are somewhat easier to navigate than Fidelity's. Fortunately, choosing one fund family doesn't mean you give up access to the other. If you are trading in a Vanguard brokerage account, you may pay extra fees to buy Fidelity mutual funds and vice versa. You can avoid the fees by purchasing ETFs instead or by opening a new account with the other fund family. Morningstar is a leading researcher of mutual funds and fund families. The company's Fund Family Digest summarizes research and ratings on the 150 largest fund families in the U.S. According to the 2024 Fund Family Digest, Vanguard is the largest fund family with $8.5 trillion in U.S. assets under management (AUM). Fidelity is ranked third with $2.95 trillion in AUM. Vanguard also has the highest Parent Rating by Morningstar Manager Research analysts. Only 10 fund families earn this rating, based on manager tenure, risk management, performance, fees and other factors. Additionally, 99% of Vanguard’s assets are in share classes with Gold, Silver or Bronze Medalist Ratings. Morningstar analysts assign these ratings to funds that are expected to outperform their category index after fees. Fidelity's parent rating is Above Average and 95% of its assets are in funds with Gold, Silver or Bronze Medalist Ratings. Vanguard and Fidelity have sufficient index fund options to fulfill simple or complex investing strategies. Fidelity does have cryptocurrency funds, which may be an advantage if bitcoin or ethereum exposure is part of your allocation plan. Vanguard has more assets under management and slightly higher Morningstar ratings, implying a more stable fund management team and better performance potential. Bottom Line You can implement many passive investment portfolios with Vanguard or Fidelity. To choose the right family, review Vanguard.com and Fidelity.com. See if one brand speaks to you over the other. If not, identify which exposures you'll invest in first, such as the S&P 500 or all U.S. stocks. Compare your options across the two families and select the one with lower tracking errors. That hopefully keeps much of the underlying investment returns flowing into your net worth.

Title: Mumbai Airport Operator Secures $1 Billion Financing for Upgrades

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Photo Credit: Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai, India Chhatrapati Shivaji Internatonal Airport, Mumbai, India / David Wong Adani landing two big funding deals back-to-back says a lot about how easily the group can tap into global money. And it’s happening just as India’s trying to catch up on airport infrastructure. Select a question above or ask something else Indian airport operator Adani Airport Holdings has raised $1 billion to support the growth and improvement of Mumbai International Airport. The funding comes just weeks after the airport company secured $750 million from a group of global banks to upgrade six other airports across India. Adani Airport Holdings manages seven Indian airports and is the country's largest airport infrastructure company, accounting for 25% of passenger footfalls and 33% of the country’s air cargo traffic. The $1 billion is a mix of a $750 million bond sale and the option to raise another $250 million later. The funds will go toward “transforming the airports infrastructure through continued investments in modernization, capacity expansion, digitization, and technology integration,” Adani said in a statement. It added that the investment will also support sustainability goals, including a target for Mumbai Airport to hit net-zero emissions by 2029. This is the first time a private company in India’s airport sector has raised money through an investment-grade bond. Adani Airport said it expects the bond to receive a BBB- rating, which is a medium-grade score. Adani Airport raised the money using a structure called “project finance,” which ties the loan directly to Mumbai Airport’s income rather than backing it with the broader Adani Group. Apollo, a US-based investment firm, led the deal, with other participants including BlackRock and Standard Chartered. Calling it the “largest private investment-grade project finance issuances,” Arun Bansal, CEO, Adani Airport, said: “With participation from Apollo-managed funds and leading institutional investors, we are proud to deepen our access to global pools of capital.” This new round of funding follows a $750 million loan Adani Airport took earlier this month from a consortium of international banks, including First Abu Dhabi Bank, Barclays, and Standard Chartered. The company said the loan would support upgrades at six regional airports: Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mangaluru, Jaipur, Guwahati, and Thiruvananthapuram. Adani Airport had said it would also use the money to grow non-aviation services like retail, food and beverage, and duty-free shopping inside airports, all of which are becoming big revenue sources for airport operators. Last year, reports quoting Jugeshinder Singh, the group's chief financial officer, said Adani Enterprises is planning to list Adani Airport Holdings by fiscal 2028. Together, these two fundraising deals suggest Adani Airport is pushing ahead with its plan to modernize and expand capacity across its network. The company served 94 million passengers in the last financial year and aims to handle 300 million annually by 2040. The upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport, also managed by Adani, is being developed for $2 billion and is expected to ease congestion at the current Mumbai airport. The aim is to position the city as a global transit hub. The airport's opening has now been pushed from May this year to August. The first phase will add capacity for 20 million passengers, with eventual expansion up to 90 million. Airlines like IndiGo have already committed to flying from the new airport as soon as it opens. Low-cost carrier Akasa Air became the latest airline to partner with Adani Airport to commence flight operations. IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said earlier this month that the Navi Mumbai airport will connect to 14 international destinations at launch. India is now the world’s third-largest aviation market, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). India’s 174 million passengers in 2024 accounted for 4.2% of global air traffic. IATA projects India’s annual passenger traffic to triple by 2044, reaching 425 million journeys per year. The airports in Mumbai, along with the upcoming Jewar airport in Delhi, will help cater to the growing demand for air travel in the country.

Title: The best new restaurants and cafes to open in Ireland in the past year
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/2025/06/24/the-best-new-restaurants-and-cafes-to-try-this-year/
Time Published: 2025-06-24T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
It’s all change in Barna where chef Nathan Hindmarch has a brand new diningroom to showcase his talents. With a menu inspired by the elements of land, sea and fire, a new open flame set-up works wonders in dishes such as black sole on the bone or dry-aged rib-eye with ramson capers. Long-serving sommelier Fergal Guiney is always happy to guide you through the wine list. Joanne Cronin With a bright open room, big windows for people watching and outdoor seating for fine days, Caribou has already established itself as a fun spot in the middle of town for bar food that’s a cut above. Its steak frites with Irish rump steak and peppercorn sauce or double smash burger bring in the weekday lunch crowd, while hearty roast lunches with unlimited gravy fill the seats at weekends. JC Peking duck at China Tang – €88 for a whole duck, ordered in advance – arrives gleaming and carved tableside by Mr Chan. The skin is brittle and amber – the first bite cracks, melts and disappears. Warm house-made pancakes, dark hoisin, sharp scallions and cool cucumber build the rest. The second course – wok-fried duck with cumin – is darker, crispier, and just as essential. Pricey, yes – but it is one of the best ducks you will eat in Dublin. Corinna Hardgrave Cush recently relocated from the seaside village of Ballycotton to the busy town of Midleton, where Dan Guerin’s cooking remains as sharp and welcoming as ever. A strong focus on locally caught seafood remains at the heart of Cush, with John Dory, roast monkfish and smoked haddock all showcased on the menu. But fear not carnivores, there’s also hearty dry-aged beef chop roasted over charcoal or pork shoulder and mozzarella croquettes. JC A cool Australian coffee vibe in Liscannor. Elaine Slattery’s coffee shop offers a small, well-executed menu with daily baked goods such as brownies, cookies and scones, plus sandwiches made with local ingredients. Headed by coffee expert Richard Mattey, it’s a laid-back spot with a retractable roof, ideal for sunny afternoons or sheltered seating, and an upstairs studio for yoga and Pilates. CH Toulouse out front, La Rochelle in the kitchen – this narrow Ranelagh bistro from Colin Dapot and Sidjy Batista turns out deft French classics. Raclette-stuffed croquettes, pork in mustard sauce with buttery spaetzle, and a fish gratin show up on the short dinner menu from Wednesday to Sunday. By day, it’s a deli for coffee, croissants and charcuterie – with a smart wine list and retail bottles available with €10 corkage. CH Classic French bistro cooking arrived firmly in Dublin to great acclaim, courtesy of industry stalwarts John and Sandy Wyer. Located over M O’Brien’s pub, the L-shaped diningroom is home to a menu packed with Gallic delights. Start with home-made saucisson or seasonally perfect asparagus with cockles followed by chicken au vin jaune or steak frites with pepper sauce. Make sure, though, to leave room for the croissant pudding with Calvados caramel. JC Dublin’s north inner city received a huge boost with the arrival of Joe Smith’s cooking, tucked inside the revitalised Juno pub. The menu is packed with good value downright tasty plates, influenced by Mediterranean flavours. Scoop up smoked cod taramasalata with home-made crisps, crunch through aubergine schnitzel or share a luxurious fish pie for two. Enjoy with one of their excellent cocktails or craft beers. JC Soup hot enough to scald your soul, dumplings fat enough to need a strategy, and French toast that should come with a defibrillator. Hong Kong Wonton is the Pau family’s 16-seater tribute to proper Hong Kong fast food: blisteringly fresh pork and prawn wontons, beef brisket falling apart into spiced broth, and deep-fried peanut butter sandwiches soaked in syrup. It’s a cha chaan teng (Hong Kong diner) drop-kicked into Dublin, serving serious food without apology. CH From former Locks restaurant to new kid on the block, Lena’s transition has been utterly seamless. The old bar is gone, replaced with a sleek new counter, the diningroom is better than ever and the menu is packed with chef Paul McNamara’s unmissable Italian dishes. Sourdough toast with melting lardo, the peppery pici cacio e pepe and the rich veal shin osso bucco will have you coming back for more. JC A Hong Kong native, chef Ben Wong came to Ireland at age 15 and now calls himself a proud Corkman. At Nosh 19, his menu is inspired by Hong Kong cha chaan teng cafe culture, mixing classic Irish-Chinese favourites with authentic Hong Kong and Asian dishes. Recent seafood showcase nights have been a hit, as are dishes like the roast duck noodle soup, Sichuan sour fish and Hong Kong ice milk tea. JC Reggie White could have stayed the guy who fixed everyone else’s pizza. Instead, he built the best one in Dublin – a sharp, low-waste pizzeria set in a reworked redbrick building in Rathmines. Behind a front window rattling with a 1981 Diosna mixer, he’s turning 48-hour fermented Wildfarmed sourdough into blistered, nutty bases topped with whey-braised leeks, Cashel Blue, and Andarl Farm sausage. CH Tucked above Conway’s Bar in Blackrock, Sea Shanty is in a creaky-floored room where dinner drifts between anchovies sharpened with ponzu, grilled octopus on smoky muhammara, green curry and oysters straight from Woopstown, Cooley, and Killough Bay, and battered seaweed bhajis. Uruguayan chef Sebastian Sainz and Spanish sommelier Elena Segura run the floor like it’s their front room, pouring serious natural wines to match the tide of sardine tins, tacos and tentacles. CH Jalisco and Oaxaca meet in Ranelagh as chefs Victor Lara and Celina Altamirano combine to bring elevated Mexican food to Dublin. Dishes such as Michelada oysters, tostada de ceviche, birria tacos with consomé and incredible charcoal grilled steak would not be out of place in Mexico City itself. It goes without saying that the cocktails made with imported tequila and mezcal are superb. JC The Bucks Head still looks like a Mournes hiking pub from the outside – pint, crisps, dog asleep under the table. Inside, Alex Greene (formerly of Michelin-starred Eipic, Pétrus, Claridge’s), and co-owner Bronagh McCormick are turning out Kilkeel scallops with beurre blanc, black crab and pork ravioli, and a black garlic bread-and-butter pudding that’s worth the drive alone. It’s serious cooking without the ego – a village inn where you can have steak and chips or savour some of the best sauces in Northern Ireland. CH Following a recent hiatus, the Pig’s Ear is back with a menu that is an ode to Irish literature and art. In other hands this would be twee, even touristy, but under owner Stephen McAllister the results are elevated and confident. Indulgent Dublin Lawyer omelette features whiskey flambéed lobster and Béarnaise sauce, holding true to its origin story of being “as rich as a Dublin lawyer”. JC Two restored carriages from the Orient Express, Leona (1927) and Linda (1954), at Glenlo Abbey, set the stage for a dining experience led by Angelo Vagiotis (Terre, Noma, Manresa) and pastry chef Linda Sergidou. The tasting menu combines exceptional technique with creativity: from organic leaves tied in a bouquet to Jerusalem artichoke paired with monkfish liver, and turbot in brioche butter with Champagne sauce. The pastry? Some of the best you’ll find. It’s clear – this is Michelin-level ambition, and one to watch. CH With summer on the way, Two Pups could not have picked a better time to launch its new evening food and wine offering. And while the name may be tongue-in-cheek, there is absolutely nothing pretentious about Adam Kelly’s food. It’s all bang on trend and beautifully executed, ranging from whipped cod’s roe on grilled sourdough and asparagus in Parmesan sauce and guanciale to chunky ham hock croquettes. Oh, and there’s wine now too. JC Vada is a daytime cafe that has livened up Stoneybatter with creative and fun dishes. Chef Hannah O’Donnell maintains a zero waste philosophy as she serves up breakfast, lunch and weekend brunch. The Vada hash goes a step beyond with Ethersons gammon steak and asparagus, while the croissant French toast is for those with a sweet tooth. Look out for pop-up dinners with natural wines over the summer months. JC The Barrett family of Dunmore House Hotel know more than a thing or two about hospitality. Over the years, they have consistently developed and improved their little piece of heaven overlooking Clonakilty Bay. Under head chef Manuel Canapini, Adrift has become a contender for the country’s top seafood spots – trawler to table. Joanne Cronin It was all change last year at Aniar when owner JP McMahon commissioned architect Aidan Conway to create a new interior for this iconic Galway restaurant. Out went the lighter greens and neutral tones, making way for a darkened interior with dramatic focused lighting. It makes sense though, acting as a focus for McMahon’s dishes which have evolved into an intense, almost primal, expression of the west of Ireland. JC Baba’de may be the little sibling to Michelin-starred Dede, but this charming little spot is standing firmly on its own two feet. Under chef Muslim Karafil, savour fragrant delights such as charcoal grilled chicken thighs with hazelnut satay sauce, spiced crispy chicken with brown butter dip, or a whole west Cork blue lobster with pil pil potato mousseline. Or come for Turkish-influenced brunch on weekends. JC At Ballyfin – a hotel so exclusive it barely seems real – Richard Picard-Edwards has delivered the final flourish: a Michelin star for the diningroom. The €145 eight-course tasting menu is on the familiar side of grandeur, with a thrillingly good Jerusalem artichoke cream topped with chicken jelly and gold leaf, and dishes featuring lobster and caviar. Broths, purées and reductions bring depth without being overwrought. Non-residents can book, but getting a table feels about as casual as applying for citizenship. Corinna Hardgrave Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix turns out sharp, confident cooking built on serious pedigree – Sam cooked at Ballyfin and Bath Priory – and produce from their own walled garden. The lunch menu and midweek Supper at Six are great value, but it’s at dinner that the kitchen really hits its stride, with a la carte and tasting menus (€80) delivering dishes like seared scallops, honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion, pan-fried wild halibut with mussels, and slow-roast organic duck. CH The dark wood panelling of Ashford Castle’s George V diningroom might scream old-school but under executive head chef Liam Finnegan the food has taken a fresher turn. French-rooted, yes, but lighter, with sauces built on serious stocks rather than just butter and cream. Much of the produce now comes from a new two-acre kitchen garden, run by head gardener Alex Lavarde using no-dig methods and supplying everything from beets to honey. The twice-baked Hegarty’s cheese soufflé is a must; the wine cellar, as always, is formidable. CH It’s not every day a stone-walled cottage on the wild west coast lands a Michelin star, but Robbie McCauley’s precise cooking makes it feel inevitable. Along with his wife Sophie, he has transformed this former cafe into something rooted in tradition but unmistakably modern, serving a nine-course dinner (€125) and six-course lunch (€85). McCauley works tightly with local producers, using Burren outwintered beef, and lobster and crab from Michael O’Connell, they raise their own chickens and have an impressive vegetable garden. There’s even a small terrace for pre-dinner drinks – if the weather behaves. CH When Bryan Meehan – the Irish entrepreneur behind Blue Bottle Coffee – bought The Park Hotel from the Brennan brothers last year, two things changed in the diningroom. The tasting menu was dropped in favour of a focused a la carte, and Meehan hung two Sean Scully paintings – one of which gives the room its name, The Landline. Local chef James O’Sullivan keeps things classic but special with seared scallops, Kerry Hill lamb, and pan-seared sole. Non-residents can book. CH One of Dublin’s smallest restaurants and one of its mightiest, Liath is an intimate space where food is staged as art. Damien Grey and team perform manoeuvres with grace through service in the fully open kitchen, allowing guests to see the artists at work. Grey is looking to move to a larger space, so make sure to get a booking at Blackrock market before they leave. JC Chef Stevie McCarry recently won the Northern Ireland final of the Great British Menu, a well-earned accolade for this self-taught chef. With wife Rebekah, he has developed Lir into a truly exciting seafood restaurant. The Japanese konro grill is put to good use in the kitchen which turns out cod collar schnitzel, ling kofta with burnt apple sauce and smoked dogfish corndog. Look out for the upcoming summer music nights on the terrace. JC After more than 30 years in business, Denis Cotter is planning his transition away from his legendary fine-dining vegetarian restaurant. Long-term restaurant manager Dave O’Mahony is in line to take over, with head chef Miguel Frutos continuing to lead the kitchen into the future. With produce grown in a unique partnership with Gort na Náin farm and a super natural wine menu, Paradiso continues to set the standard. JC There isn’t another restaurant quite like Rare. Drawing on his classical French training, chef Meeran Manzoor has invented a cuisine that is all his own, using the best of local produce accented with flavours from his home city of Chennai. His menu descriptions may sound simple but they belie a complexity of spice and nuanced technique that is simply delightful. JC Rob Krawczyk and Elaine Fleming’s Michelin-starred Chestnut offers three routes – a €55 two-course prix fixe, a four-course for €75 or the full €120 tasting menu. Ingredients are local and fiercely seasonal – Lisheen Greens, Twomey’s butchers, Union Hall fish – with much of it cooked over a custom wood-fired grill. Expect wild halibut with mussels or aged Skeaghanore duck with coal onion and sour cherries. His food is exacting, mature and restrained – one of the country’s top chefs. CH Sitting in a little glen outside Ballyvaughan, Gregans Castle is the quirky but extremely stylish countryside hotel of dreams. Chef Jonathan Farrell moved from Dublin to take over the kitchens and is producing food perfectly harmonised with the stunning landscapes. Choose from dishes such as wild garlic spaetzle, Atlantic scallop with XO, butter-poached cod, roast rack of Burren lamb or forced rhubarb direct from the hotel garden. JC The Olde Glen bar would have a serious chance in any “Ireland’s most traditional pub” competition, and is worth a visit in its own right. But it’s the cooking of Ciaran Sweeney to the rear of the pub that brings the punters in night after night. The menu is packed with local produce including roast Mulroy Bay scallops, fermented potato bread with Gortahork cabbage and glazed Killybegs cod. JC Former Michelin star chef Danni Barry keeps things razor sharp at the Owenmore Restaurant, with a four-course table d’hote menu (€95) that lets the ingredients do the talking. Kilkeel scallops with caramelised kohlrabi, line-caught mackerel with blood orange and horseradish, barbecued quail with soy and honey, and wild sea bass with salt-baked celeriac are cooked with precision. Bookings are available for non-residents. CH © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Vatican backs report calling for financial reforms to alleviate global debt crisis
URL: https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/264943/vatican-backs-report-calling-for-financial-reforms-to-alleviate-global-external-debt
Time Published: 2025-06-23T19:15:00Z
Full Content:
By Victoria Cardiel Vatican City, Jun 23, 2025 / 15:15 pm The Vatican has endorsed a report calling for reforms to alleviate the global debt crisis affecting billions of people in developing countries. The document, titled “The Jubilee Report: A Blueprint for Tackling the Debt and Development Crises and Creating the Financial Foundations for a Sustainable People-Centered Global Economy,” was presented at the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences on June 20 as one of the main initiatives of the 2025 Jubilee Year of Hope. Supported by Pope Leo XIV, the publication is the work of the Jubilee Commission created by Pope Francis in June 2024 in order to find a way to carry out sovereign debt restructuring based on ethical principles. Thirty international economic experts were on the commission, including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and former Argentine Economy Minister Martín Guzmán. According to data maintained by the U.N., global public debt reached $97 trillion in 2023, an increase of $5.6 trillion compared with 2022. The document reports that more than 50 developing countries already allocate more than 10% of their tax revenues to interest payments, a dynamic that diverts financial resources from vital sectors such as health, education, and climate resilience (the capacity to respond to climate change or extreme weather events.) “The debt crisis that is suffocating the global financial system is also fueling a development crisis,” the report states. It proposes a series of measures and recommendations to transform the international financial system into an instrument of justice and sustainability. These include the creation of an international bankruptcy mechanism for sovereign countries similar to those that exist for private companies; an end to government bailouts for private investors; and the provision of bridge loans and short-term financial support for countries in crisis. The initiative is part of the spirit of the jubilee year, traditionally associated with mercy and debt forgiveness. In fact, in the 2024 papal bull Spes Non Confundit, Pope Francis expressly asked governments to show clemency by extraordinary measures, such as forgiving the external (foreign) debt of poor countries. The June 20 report recaptures the spirit of the Jubilee of the Year 2000, when in 1997, St. John Paul II initiated a truly global movement based on the Church’s social teaching that called for debt relief for the poorest countries. That call gave rise to the “Jubilee 2000” campaign, which collected millions of signatures around the world and mobilized religious communities of all traditions. Thanks to this movement, more than $100 billion in debt was canceled. “Global finance must serve people and the planet — not punish the poorest to protect profits,” the report concludes. The report was presented June 20 at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences during a day dedicated to discussions about how reforms to international financial systems could move toward a truly people-centered system. Nobel Prize-winning economist Stiglitz, professor at Columbia University and honorary fellow of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, issued a forceful call to “curb the abuses of large private creditors.” “Normally, we talk about shared responsibility between creditors and debtors, but I would say there is greater responsibility on the part of creditors. These are voluntary transactions. No one has forced creditors to lend money, and they are supposed to be the experts in risk analysis,” he stated in his remarks. (Story continues below) The economist was particularly critical of BlackRock and other large funds, which, he said, encourage a type of high-risk lending that ends in crises. He therefore advocated strengthening the role of multilateral development banks, which can provide loans at lower rates, something that “would help reduce interest rates and make debt sustainable.” Within the framework of the international meeting on debt, social justice, and development held at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences headquarters, Caritas International representative Alfonso Apicella urged that the technical debate on debt never lose sight of the people most affected. “We’re here to talk about sustainable growth, but the real question is: sustainable growth for whom? That’s the question we’re asked time and again by communities when we launch campaigns like ‘Turn Debt Into Hope,’” he explained. Speaking on behalf of the global network of 162 organizations that make up Caritas, Apicella emphasized that the discourse on “sustainability” runs the risk of becoming an empty slogan if its inclusive focus isn’t made explicit: “We have to talk about sustainable growth for all, not just a few. And we must always remember this, especially when we speak from a technical perspective, because behind every figure there are people who experience these realities firsthand.” Apicella also focused on the need to change the narrative on debt: “We must frame this fight for debt justice as a win-win situation. If we work for the poor, policymakers must understand that they will also benefit.” Professor Kevin Gallagher, director of the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University, pointed to international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund that have forced poor countries to “prematurely open their capital accounts.” However, he also acknowledged the internal responsibility of many developing countries that, as the report notes, “have borrowed too much and invested too little.” In any case, he made it clear that while “debt relief is essential,” it is also necessary to propose viable implementation measures within the current international environment that transform the financial system. “We have already learned from the last jubilee debt forgiveness in 2009 that debt relief without reforms to the international financial architecture will only lead us to repeat this whole process. It’s a shame that we are in this situation again. Let us not repeat the same mistakes,” Gallagher said. This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.

A FORMER SCHOOL principal convicted of the indecent assault of six boys over a 30-year period has been jailed for four years for some of the offences, with further sentencing to follow for the others. Aidan Clohessy (85) was convicted of 19 counts of indecent assault following two separate trials at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court last month. Imposing sentence in the first case against him today, Judge Elva Duffy said Clohessy was “living a life full of good deeds during the day” but was also “an ogre” who carried out “what can only be described as atrocities at night time, when no one could see that behaviour”. Clohessy was the principal of St Augustine’s School, Blackrock, Co. Dublin from the 1970s until 1993. The six boys were all pupils of the school. Some were boarders at the school, which catered for boys with mild to moderate learning disabilities at that time. The boys were aged between 10 and 13 when Clohessy’s offending took place. The abuse primarily took the form of inappropriate touching, the court heard. In the first trial, Clohessy, with an address at the Hospitaller Order of St John of God, Granada, Stillorgan, Co. Dublin, was convicted of 14 counts of indecent assault – 10 in relation to one boy and four in relation to a second boy on dates between 1983 and 1985. Today, he was sentenced four years in relation to the offending against these two boys. Judge Duffy noted Clohessy’s age and health would make custody more challenging for him. The jury in the second trial returned guilty verdicts on five counts of indecent assault – two for one boy, and one count each in relation to three other boys. All this offending took place between 1969 and 1986. Clohessy was acquitted of three further counts of indecent assault. Having heard evidence in this case today, Judge Martin Nolan adjourned the case overnight to consider sentence. Victim impact statements were read to the court on behalf of all six injured parties. They outlined how the abuse affected their mental health, relationships, education and later employment opportunities. One man said: “Brother Aidan, I don’t forgive you but I don’t judge you anymore. That responsibility does not belong to me. “One day, you will stand before the man you chose to serve. One day, you will stand before your maker, and on that day, you will be handed your judgement.” Another said he struggled to learn his wedding vows or to read his children a story. Clohessy was interviewed voluntarily by gardaí and denied wrongdoing. He acknowledged that corporal punishment was used in the school, including by him. Clohessy told gardaí this included striking boys on their bare buttocks, but said this was only for the most serious offences and only of those boys who were residents at the school. The investigating gardai agreed with Ronan Kennedy SC, defending, that his client was co-operative during the investigation. The garda further agreed that Clohessy has been the subject of adverse media publicity. Kennedy told the court his client will not be appealing the jury’s decision in either trial. Clohessy is originally from Co. Limerick and entered the religious order after completing his Leaving Certificate in 1958. He initially trained as a psychiatric nurse and after some years working in this area, retrained as a teacher. Clohessy started work at St Augustine’s School in 1969, becoming principal in the mid 1970s. Kennedy said his client served in roles on the provisional leadership team and was appointed in 1993 to lead a mission in Malawi to develop mental health services there, where he remained until 2013 when he returned to Ireland. Kennedy said Clohessy lives “a humble and quiet existence” and supports other members of the religious community who have significant health issues. A medical report and two testimonials were handed to the court on Clohessy’s behalf. Kennedy asked the court to take into account his client will find custody more difficult due to his age and health issues. He submitted that his client would have to live with the stigma of being a sex offender and has already been subject to negative publicity. “In many respects, he was already condemned and judged in the court of public opinion before he was ever tried in this court,” Kennedy said. An investigating garda outlined the evidence of the first trial to the court. The first boy was aged around 10 when he went to St Augustine’s School in 1973. Advertisement In the first incident, the boy, who was a boarder, had returned to the chalet and was making a sandwich when he heard the front door open. He knew it was Clohessy. Clohessy called the boy “demon” and said he had to get the demon out of him. The boy was taken to a room, where Clohessy slapped him on his bare buttocks and touched his testicles. The court heard there were other similar incidents including occasions when the boy felt something wet on the small of his back. On one occasion, the boy felt something in his buttocks, didn’t know what it was, but knew Clohessy had done it. The court heard there is no suggestion that this was an object. The abuse ended when the boy was around 11 or 12. A victim impact statement was read to the court by the injured party’s wife. He said the pain “imposed on me as a child has never truly gone away” and has “shaped every part of what I became”. He developed trust issues and has had feelings of shame, confusion and fear. He said the trial brought a lot of that fear and trauma back to the surface. “It was like being haunted by the ghost of your own life,” he said. The man said the abuse took away his childhood and “stole my future” as he could not learn like other children and left school with limited literacy skills. He said he struggled to find work to support his family, and they had experienced financial pressures. Addressing Clohessy directly, he said: “Brother Aidan, I don’t forgive you but I don’t judge you anymore. That responsibility does not belong to me. “One day, you will stand before the man you chose to serve. One day, you will stand before your maker, and on that day you will be handed your judgement.” A second boy, who was also a boarder at the school, was around 11 when the first incident took place. He was in a changing area after he had taken part in a swimming race when Clohessy came in. Clohessy told the boy, “I told you to win the next time” and touched the boy, who was getting changed, in his genital area. In a separate incident on the same day, Clohessy called the boy over while walking past the chalets and touched him inappropriately. Clohessy put his finger to his lips in a shushing motion. The boy was in Clohessy’s office on another occasion when the principal told the boy to take down his clothing. The boy refused to remove his underwear and Clohessy pulled it down. The boy felt something hard on his buttocks, then something wet. The boy dried himself off and asked Clohessy why, but didn’t get an answer. Clohessy put his finger to his lips in a shushing motion and said something like “son, no one knows”. The court also heard evidence about another incident in a storage area of the gym building where Clohessy touched the boy inappropriately. Clohessy said to him: “Son, I hope no one knows.” In a victim impact statement he said the abuse impacted his education, his mental health and his later employment. Imposing sentence, Judge Duffy said the age of the injured parties and that the offending took place on multiple occasions, were aggravating features. The judge noted the contents of both victim impact statements. She said these were “vulnerable children” who had been entrusted to Clohessy’s care. Judge Duffy noted the defence had indicated there would be no appeal and she expressed the court’s hope that this might offer some peace for the two injured parties in moving forward. The judge said she had read the testimonials and acknowledged that while Clohessy has “good elements”, this offending took place “in total secrecy”. She said she would impose two separate sentences of two years, to run consecutively. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Ethereum Co-Founder Projects Disruptive Global Dominance for Ethereum layer-1 (L1)

Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has taken to X to share his outlook on the future of the Ethereum Layer 1 blockchain, which he believes is primed for global dominance. Lubin’s assertions are in response to the recently approved Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, a bill designed to clarify the use of stablecoins. The Ethereum co-founder can be seen on X, affirming the sentiments of an Ethereum supporter, who referenced Pro-Ethereum sentiments shared by Robbie Mitchnick, the head of Digital Assets at BlackRock. The BlackRock official, who appears to be bullish on Ethereum, previously revealed that Ethereum ranks as the first choice on the company’s radar, particularly when the investment firm begins to explore tokenization. On the other hand, Lubin highlighted some of the blockchain’s key features, including its permissionless nature and flexible structure, neutral state, and anti-censorship design, adding that the Ethereum blockchain is primed to continue on a decentralized path. “Ethereum Layer 1 will be the master ledger for the world; Permissionless to inspect, use, and add data or functionality to. Credibly neutral [and] censorship resistant. Tamper-resistant and tamper-evident (via slashing and transparency). Incessantly progressively decentralizing itself.” He wrote. Lubin stressed the role of the Ethereum community in strengthening the blockchain, hailing community members from developers to users, and applauding their commitment to the network’s core values. However, he maintains that network regulation is bound to become increasingly difficult as barriers are underway. “With a best-in-class giant community that is constantly hyper vigilant as there will always be patient, well resourcedactors working to subvert the system. Fortunately this will get harder and harder as Ethereum grows and matures.” He asserts.

Title: Is the $313 Million Ether Transfer to Coinbase Signaling Major Sell-Off?

A large Ethereum (ETH) transfer has sparked renewed fears of a potential market dump, just as leverage in the ETH futures market surges to record levels. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain flagged a massive transaction of 113,000 ETH—valued at approximately $313 million—deposited into crypto exchange Coinbase. The move was initiated from a single whale wallet amid heightened speculative trading activity and rising institutional accumulation of ETH. Whale deposits to centralized exchanges are often interpreted as a signal that large holders may be preparing to sell. Lookonchain reported the transaction on X, noting that the wallet had remained dormant for a considerable period before suddenly moving its entire holdings to Coinbase. While the motive behind the transfer remains unknown, such high-value movements often precede large sell orders, especially when combined with current market conditions. The timing of the whale deposit aligns with a new all-time high in Ethereum futures open interest. According to data from Coinglass, ETH futures open interest has surpassed $29 billion, driven by increasing speculative activity using stablecoin-backed, cash-margined contracts. This trend is also reflected in the growing presence of retail traders in Ethereum’s derivatives market. CryptoQuant reported that futures trading frequency among smaller investors has spiked above its 12-month average, contrasting with Bitcoin’s stagnant on-chain activity. Despite the potential for short-term volatility, institutional demand for ETH has remained steady. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, reportedly acquired $163.6 million in ETH across two consecutive weeks, according to blockchain data tracked by Lookonchain. Ethereum is currently trading at $2,295, marking a slight 0.16% decline over the past 24 hours. Analysts have identified $2,800 as a critical resistance level. According to crypto traders such as Daan Crypto Trades and Duo Nine, a break above this threshold could lead to a push toward the $3,000 mark. However, with leverage peaking and large ETH volumes moving to exchanges, the market remains on alert for a possible correction. High open interest and excessive retail positioning have historically led to liquidations during sudden price swings. In contrast to bullish sentiment, some traders are beginning to open short positions on ETH. Lookonchain highlighted this divergence, suggesting that some market participants prepare for a downside move in response to the whale transfer and overheated derivatives activity. While Ethereum continues to enjoy institutional inflows and speculative momentum, the $313 million whale transfer to Coinbase has introduced a new layer of uncertainty.

Title: What The GENIUS Act Could Mean For The Digital Dollar
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/06/23/what-the-genius-act-could-mean-for-the-digital-dollar/
Time Published: 2025-06-23T15:04:49Z

BySandy Peng BySandy Peng, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC (Photo by Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images) The Senate passed the GENIUS Act on Tuesday, aiming to bring stablecoins under a national regulatory framework. In this historic bill, which now needs to pass the House of Representatives, lawmakers are moving to define what a “digital dollar” really is. The stablecoin market expanded from $5 billion in 2020 to nearly $261 billion today, with Tether alone holding $155 billion. For context, Tether’s $155 billion market cap rivals the GDP of Hungary, which was about $212 billion in 2023. Last year, the company reported $13 billion in profits from investing its reserves, primarily in the U.S. Treasuries, making it more profitable than BlackRock. In fact, according to a report by the crypto exchange CEX.io, more money moved through stablecoins than Mastercard in 2024. Over $27.6 trillion was settled via tokens most mainstream credit card users still haven’t heard of, or understand, quite yet. Until now, the most rapid growth of stablecoin usage has taken place outside of North America, even though most stablecoins are pegged in some way to the dollar. In Latin America, 71% of financial services firms now use stablecoins for cross-border payments. The region processes $94.2 billion in genuine payment settlements, not trading volume. Business-to-business payments alone account for $3 billion per month. The acceleration gained momentum after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s April 2025 guidance declared that traditional 1:1 backed stablecoins aren’t securities. Within weeks, Société Générale announced USDCV, backed by Bank of New York Mellon. Standard Chartered partnered with Animoca Brands for Hong Kong's first licensed stablecoin. And all in all, one thing is clear: stablecoins have found their product market fit. Fit for emerging economies, where people don’t want to lose ~6.65% to remittances. Fit for better yield than what standard banks are providing. Fit for everyone who doesn’t want to wait for their payments to settle in three days. By the end of 2025, there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of stablecoins launching. Yet they won’t take on the typical form as we commonly know it — instead, stablecoins will be getting more and more complicated. This explosion in usage is precisely what the GENIUS Act aims to address: how do you regulate a financial instrument that already moves more money than global card networks? Today’s stablecoin landscape ranges from fiat-backed tokens like USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT), to algorithmic models, to complex financial instruments that generate yield or track exotic assets. In February, Figure Markets launched YLDS, the first SEC-registered yield-bearing stablecoin, offering 3.85% APY tied to Secured Overnight Financing Rate rates. MakerDAO’s new USDS accepts everything from Ethereum to tokenized U.S. Treasury bonds as collateral. The GENIUS Act assumes stablecoins are simple, static, and centrally issued. But the next thousand stablecoins won’t look like these stablecoins at all. They'll be yield-generating machines wrapped in “dollar clothing” — commodity plays disguised as cash or real estate exposure that fits inside your digital wallet. We’ll soon be able to use stablecoins that automatically shift between treasury bills and corporate bonds based on market conditions, or tokens that give you exposure to African farmland while maintaining a dollar peg. We’re already beginning to see certain hints: tokenized gold reserves, carbon credit backing and even stablecoin protocols that track baskets of emerging market currencies. Projects like Virtual Finance, who are building on Scroll — a blockchain that I co-founded, and Synthetix, are experimenting with synthetic dollar models. ViFi’s synthetic dollar model for example is designed to offer local currency stability in high-inflation environments, without centralized reserves. The winners won't be the most stable — they'll be the most useful. Just as you can’t currently distinguish which dollar bill is coming from Chase and which from Bank of America, soon users won’t look at who is issuing the stablecoin. Instead, the yield and what else can be done with it will matter more. Regulators are fighting yesterday’s war with tomorrow's weapons pointed backwards. The GENIUS Act assumes stablecoins are static instruments — issued here and regulated here. But what happens when a stablecoin issued in Singapore, backed by London real estate, traded on a Cayman Islands exchange, and held by someone in Lagos, eventually fails? Whose problem is that? The answer: everyone’s and no one's. Europe tried the heavy-handed approach with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation. And as a result, Europeans now access the same stablecoins through DeFi, just with extra steps and (potentially) higher risk. The U.S. wants domestic oversight while Tether laughs from the British Virgin Islands, holding more treasuries than most countries. Asia is crafting its own rules, creating a patchwork where regulatory arbitrage isn’t a bug — it’s an entire business model. When thousands of stablecoins exist, each with different mechanisms, backings and jurisdictions, traditional regulation becomes a game of whack-a-mole. Except the moles are armed with smart contracts and the hammer is made of strongly worded letters. The barbarians aren’t at the gate — they're already inside, issuing tokens and earning yield. When this unravels, and parts of it will, there's no Federal Reserve to lower rates, no U.S. Treasury to backstop losses and no coordinated response from people who can't even agree on what a stablecoin is. But maybe that’s the point. Maybe the chaos is the feature. In Argentina, chaos means 50% inflation, so a synthetic dollar backed by derivatives feels like stability that not all citizens are used to. In Nigeria, chaos means capital controls, so any dollar access beats none. For millions, these complicated, possibly fragile and definitely risky instruments solve real problems — and they solve them today. The thousand stablecoins launching this year won’t all survive. Most won't. But the ones that do will reshape how money works, who controls it and what it can do. Traditional finance took centuries to build safety nets. We’re speedrunning the same evolution in years, maybe months. Whether that ends in breakthrough or breakdown depends entirely on how thoughtfully we build today. As the GENIUS Act attempts to define what a regulated stablecoin, and by extension, a “digital dollar,” should look like, it may be racing against a moving target. The market is evolving faster than legislation can draft definitions. Disclosure: Sandy Peng is the Co-Founder of Scroll, a blockchain that ViFi is building on with regards to a stablecoin project.
