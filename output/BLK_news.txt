SEC grants Dimensional Fund Advisors approval for ETF share classes of mutual funds. This move could reshape the $12.6 trillion ETF industry September 29, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. “The SEC has published a notice indicating they intend to grant our funds relief to offer ETF share classes,” Gerard O’Reilly, co-chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer at the firm, said in a press release. The notice comes after Dimensional filed an amendment to its exemptive relief application on Friday. The SEC’s Monday notice said it will grant so-called exemptive relief to Dimensional to offer dual share class funds unless the commission orders a hearing. Roughly 70 other asset managers are waiting to hear back from the SEC on their applications. The long-awaited regulatory approval is set to be a major win for asset managers seeking to shrink clients’ tax bills and expand into the $12.6 trillion ETF industry as mutual funds lose ground to the generally cheaper, easier-to-trade wrapper. The novel fund design, where one share class of a mutual fund is exchange-traded, was invented by Vanguard more than two decades ago. Since the firm’s patent expired in 2023, nearly every major money manager — including BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. — has asked the SEC for permission to use the dual share class model.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. The decision is a potential watershed moment for US money managers, more than 70 of which have sought permission from the SEC to adopt the dual-class structure.

Title: Frontal and parietal planning signals encode adapted motor commands when learning to control a brain–computer interface

Perturbing visual feedback is a powerful tool for studying visuomotor adaptation. However, unperturbed proprioceptive signals in common paradigms inherently co-varies with physical movements and causes incongruency with the visual input. This can create challenges when interpreting underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. We employed a brain–computer interface (BCI) in rhesus monkeys to investigate spatial encoding in frontal and parietal areas during a 3D visuomotor rotation task where only visual feedback was movement-contingent. We found that both brain regions better reflected the adapted motor commands than the perturbed visual feedback during movement preparation and execution. This adaptive response was observed in both local and remote neurons, even when they did not directly contribute to the BCI input signals. The transfer of adaptive changes in planning activity to corresponding movement corrections was stronger in the frontal than in the parietal cortex. Our results suggest an integrated large-scale visuomotor adaptation mechanism in a motor-reference frame spanning across frontoparietal cortices.

Recent advancements have extended this approach to signals obtained from the parietal cortex [7–10]. Besides their translational applications, BCI paradigms provide a crucial tool for studying the neurophysiological basis of motor learning [11–23]. Unlike conventional motor learning paradigms involving physical limb movement, BCI control establishes an experimentally controllable mapping from brain activity to effector motion through the neural decoder. Additionally, BCI paradigms help isolate the impact of visual feedback on movement adaptation by keeping proprioceptive feedback constant during visuomotor perturbations [16]. This approach reduces potential confounds inherent in the adaptation of physical movements, which co-vary with proprioceptive feedback, and emphasizes the visual aspect of feedback control. In our study, we employ a BCI visuomotor rotation paradigm in rhesus monkeys to explore the role of visual feedback and the contributions of parietal and premotor sensorimotor areas to BCI adaptation. We ask whether both brain regions (i) contribute to adaptation irrespective of an immediate impact on the produced motor behavior, (ii) reflect the same or different sensory or motor-related spatial dimensions of fast visuomotor adaptation, and (iii) show adaptation of motor planning activity consistent with motor behavior. In BCI learning, behavioral performance can be improved by exploiting an existing repertoire of neural dynamic states (“within-manifold” learning) or by reconfiguring the neural network structure (“outside-manifold” learning). In response to perturbations of a BCI decoder, short-term learning does not appear to significantly affect the correlation patterns among neurons in the motor cortex [15,20,24]. This suggests that at least the local network structure supplying input to the decoder (i.e., the controlling motor area) remains largely unchanged and constrains neural adaptation during short-term learning. However, with longer-term learning, the brain can be trained to generate new activity patterns in the controlling units that deviate from the expected correlation pattern of the network. Such outside-manifold learning aligns with the view that the tuning of individual neurons can be adapted independently during BCI learning [13,24–25]. A way how the decoder input could be adapted without changing the network structure is by means of “re-association”. According to this view, a specific neural activity pattern associated with compensating for the introduced visuomotor perturbation is recruited from the range of patterns available within the existing network structure [15,18–21]. This view implies changes in activity, but under the constraint of an unchanged network structure also for neighboring neurons, such that also noncontrolling units in the controlling area that do not provide input to the decoder adapt their activity in a manner consistent with changes in the BCI controlling units. Based on these previous findings, we expect that the comparatively fast adaptation to visuomotor rotation, achievable within a single session of a few hundred trials, is accompanied by such re-association learning. After establishing that this is indeed the case in our visuomotor adaptation task, we will test three implications of this hypothesis. First, we will address the question of whether changes in neural activity during BCI learning occur consistently not only in nearby noncontrolling neurons, as shown previously [13,18,28], but also across a larger-scale sensorimotor network, including frontoparietal circuits. Previous studies in humans and monkeys have not extensively examined the extent of adaptation within a distributed neural network, including regions that are not directly involved in generating or updating motor commands but may still play a crucial role in sensorimotor integration. These regions, such as the parietal cortex, are expected to contribute to motor learning [29,30]. In a human BCI motor learning study involving the prefrontal cortex, dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), primary motor and sensory cortices, and the posterior parietal cortex, neural changes occurred with long-term learning and were associated nonspecifically with reduced cognitive demand [31]. In contrast, we aim to understand the neural characteristics of fast adaptation, which is particularly desirable for BCI learning and, in conventional visuomotor rotation learning, is often associated with the updating of an internal model [32,33]. Fast adaptation is especially important for BCI applications because it enables users to achieve accurate and efficient control with minimal training time, which is critical for practical and clinical use. We compare the contributions of noncontrolling neurons residing locally next to the BCI controlling neurons in the frontal areas or remotely in parietal areas to test if fast adaptation effects generalize to remote brain regions. Second, we ask whether premotor and parietal brain regions not only both adapt but do so in the same spatial frame of reference. Specifically, we test if neural changes reflect the adapted motor command (this is mandatory for the controlling units, but unclear for noncontrolling units) or if the parietal cortex rather reflects the associated adapted sensory feedback. Preparatory activity in frontoparietal motor planning areas includes information about the reach goal represented in different body-related frames of reference. While encoding at the level of neural populations and often also at the level of the individual neurons shows typically mixed representations of different reference frames, different coding schemes predominate across areas. For example, the parietal reach region (PRR) in the medial intraparietal area (MIP) predominantly encodes reach targets in an eye-centered reference frame [34], whereas area 5d in the posterior parietal cortex represents reach goals more strongly in a hand-centered frame [35]. PRR representations can relate both to the visual location and the physical goal of the movement [36,37]. Nearby sensorimotor areas V6A in the anterior wall of the parieto-occipital sulcus and PEc at its shoulder show gradually more selectivity for the hand position, additionally to target and gaze-related information [38–40]. Similarly, the PMd encodes reach targets in a mixed reference frame, integrating the relative positions of the hand, eye, and target [41,42]. Thus, while both premotor and parietal regions are involved in reach planning and show overlapping tuning properties during instructed delay, they differ with respect to their neuroanatomical embedding. Posterior parietal networks integrate sensory information from multiple modalities, including visual input, and contain motor-goal information during reach planning without directly driving motor output [43,44]. Premotor cortex, on the other hand, has direct connections to primary motor cortex (M1) and its more caudal parts even to spinal cord [45]. Here, we test if these differences between frontal and parietal motor planning areas reflect in differences in the predominant frame of reference when motor command and sensory feedback are dissociated during sensorimotor adaptation. During a visual working memory task, frontoparietal areas can even contain spatial information not related to the body, but relative to a visual object, which is an allocentric form of spatial representation [46]. The possibility of such spatial coding in a reach context, which does not reflect the planned physical arm movement, raises the question in which spatial frame of reference frontoparietal cortex represents reach-associated information during BCI learning and whether parietal and frontal areas share a common frame of reference. Rather than reflecting trial-to-trial updates of the corrected movement to produce adapted motor outputs, as observed in the motor and premotor cortices [11,28,47,48], parietal dynamics could reflect the unchanged sensory state of the system during the planning period before movement onset, as part of its role in state estimation [49–55]. Third, we propose that motor adaptation is reflected in changes in motor signals during movement preparation already and that planning activities co-vary with signals during movement control. Fast adaptation at the neural level has been previously described from a dynamical system perspective [22,23,56–58]. According to this view, the neural state, which represents the activity pattern across the population of neurons in motor areas, follows established dynamics to generate movements [59–63]. During movement preparation, the neural state is initialized with different conditions for different movements and then evolves based on the network-inherent dynamics during movement execution. This concept is particularly applicable to ballistic reaches toward spatially segregated targets in space. The fixed neural dynamics are determined by the stable recurrent connectivity of the network itself [19,61,64]. According to this view, adaptation could be implemented by updating of the initial states. Hence, adaptation induced neural changes should reflect in late planning activity, at a time when uncertainty about the position of a BCI-controlled cursor position deteriorates planning signals [65]. Over the course of fast adaptation, the idea, neural dynamics are initialized with changing conditions to compensate for movement errors from trial to trial, while the network structure in the motor cortex remains stable. A BCI learning study in monkeys indicated that such adaptive state initialization probably applies to BCI controlling units in the motor cortex [23]. In line with this finding, other work suggested that motor learning involves systematic changes in preparatory activity within the motor cortex to adapt to a force field [66]. It is yet unclear to what extent such adaptation of initial states also applies to changes in preparatory activity in the larger frontoparietal network, including noncontrolling units and areas outside the motor cortex. By introducing an instructed delay in the BCI movement task, we can compare adaptation of the preparatory states with the movement-associated dynamics. We ask whether such a relationship between the two states exists also for visuomotor adaptation and whether the relationship changes over the course of learning. In this study, we conducted a 3D visuomotor rotation task under BCI control to investigate neural adaptation across the distributed frontoparietal network, including M1, PMd, and PRR. We selectively connected only a subset of units, referred to as controlling units, to the decoder to assess whether neural signatures of adaptation extend beyond the units immediately controlling the BCI movements. After demonstrating visuomotor rotation adaptation in BCI control of 3D movements and its compatibility with the idea of fast within-manifold learning, we address our three main research questions. First, we test if adaptation is distributed and also affects the coding in parietal areas, remote from the frontal lobe areas that controlled the BCI movements. Second, we determine the spatial frame of reference in which the noncontrolling units co-vary with the controlling units that determine the behavior. Third, we test the hypothesis that re-association learning leads to adaptation of movement planning signals consistent with the observed adaptation in motor behavior. To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying movement planning and execution, we designed an experiment to investigate adaptive changes in neural dynamics during a memory-guided reach task under BCI control. Two rhesus monkeys (Y and Z) performed a memory-guided 3D center-out reach task using a computer cursor in a virtual reality (VR) environment (Figs 1A and S1A). The task involved the presentation of a target, followed by a memory period during which the target was no longer visible. The monkeys were then required to move the cursor to the previously cued target in a corner of a 3D cube (Fig 1B). This delay period between target presentation and movement execution allowed us to investigate adaptive changes in neural dynamics during movement planning, independent of immediate sensory feedback, and compare these to the adapted motor commands during execution.

In contrast, PRR cells were either fully integrated into the decoding process (decoder FP) or entirely disconnected (decoder FO). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.g001 The monkeys controlled the cursor either through natural hand movements (manual control, MC) or via a BCI driven by intracortical neural activity (Fig 1C). During MC trials, the cursor movements in virtual space were aligned with the animals’ hand movements in physical space. In BCI trials, the monkeys kept their unrestrained hand in a resting position while controlling the cursor mentally. S1B Fig shows that residual hand movements were minimal and barely correlated with cursor speed (Pearson’s correlation: monkey Y, r = 0.085, p < 0.001, n (total number of decoded speeds) = 575,258; monkey Z, r = 0.072, p < 0.001, n = 108,933). This means the animal managed to control the cursor movement without any longer attempting own physical movements, neither during planning nor during movement, which ensured a constant somatosensory input during BCI trials. During baseline trials, i.e., without visuomotor perturbation, monkey Y successfully drove the cursor to the target in 99% of the movement trials (trials in which the animal successfully completed the planning period without, e.g., fixation breaks; see Materials and methods) under MC and in 89% of the BCI trials. Monkey Z succeeded in 97% of the movement trials under MC and in 85% of the BCI trials. Only successful trials were analyzed. We recorded brain activity from three regions: the primary M1, PMd, and PRR. Monkey Y had 64 electrodes in each of M1, PMd, and PRR, while monkey Z had 64 electrodes in M1 and 96 electrodes in each of PMd and PRR (S1C Fig). Units from all three areas were selectively connected (controlling units) or not connected (noncontrolling units) to the decoder (Fig 1D). This design allowed us to investigate whether adaptive mechanisms in individual neurons depended on their immediate causal influence on movement, which is only guaranteed for connected units. Subsets of PMd and M1 units were always involved in the decoder, whereas PRR units were either entirely connected (in combination with PMd-M1; Decoder fronto-parietal (FP), Fig 1D, lower) or completely disconnected (Decoder frontal-only (FO), Fig 1D, upper). This setup enabled us to study adaptive mechanisms in PRR even without its direct involvement in generating movements and to compare it to the case when PRR directly contributes to the control of BCI movements. We utilized a short-term visuomotor rotation (VMR) adaptation paradigm tailored to our 3D experimental setup [67] to induce repeated BCI learning (Fig 2). In the daily sessions, first, the decoder was recalibrated until animals became proficient in controlling unperturbed cursor movements without computer support (see Materials and methods). We then recorded 160 baseline trials before we introduced the perturbation, a rotation of 30° to the visual feedback (cursor) in the fronto-parallel X–Y plane, for 300 trials (Fig 2A). In each daily session, the perturbation was consistently either clockwise or counterclockwise only (S1 Table). The perturbation was applied globally throughout the workspace, which means it affected movements to all eight targets but only in the X and Y dimensions, not in the depth dimension away from the body (Fig 2A, left). Finally, the perturbation was removed during the washout phase, which continued until the animals disengaged from the task (Fig 2A, right). In designing this study, we leveraged previous findings from [67], which showed that human subjects adapted most easily to perturbations applied in the fronto-parallel plane. (A) Left: visual representation of 3D-VMR. In different experimental sessions, the 3D movements were rotated 30° clockwise or counterclockwise in the frontal-parallel plane. The Z-axis points towards the monkey’s head and was unperturbed. Right: the experimental protocol consisted of a baseline phase followed by a 30° VMR and a washout phase where the visual perturbation was removed. Below each phase of the experimental progression, example traces from a single experimental session in Monkey Y are shown. (B) In the plane of the applied perturbation, deviations above the zero line correspond to positions in the visual signal plane. Conversely, negative deflections in trajectories exist in the motor signal plane and correspond to the motor commands issued to counteract the visual perturbation. For averaging across all target directions, the trajectories were rotated into a shared reference frame. One axis was aligned with the perturbed direction, while the other was aligned with the vector from the center to the target. In this plane, trajectories above the zero line represent positions in the visual signal plane, while trajectories below zero pertain to the motor signal plane. Additionally, we calculated the angle at the midpoint of each trajectory as the angle between the perturbation direction and the vector from the center to the target. (C) For the analysis, the 3D trajectories were projected onto the 2D plane of the applied perturbation. The trajectories showed stereotypical adaptation profiles during rotation and negative aftereffects during washout. (D) The angle at the midpoint of the trajectory, plotted as a function of trial number, reveals stereotypical adaptation profiles in response to the introduced VMR. The perturbation angle approaches 30° upon perturbation introduction, gradually decreases with learning, and then deviates in the opposite direction during the washout phase following perturbation removal.

During the baseline phase, the trajectories were on average relatively straight toward the target. During early rotation trials, as expected as a consequence of the perturbed feedback, trajectories in the perturbation plane curved in the direction of the applied feedback perturbation (Fig 2A, right). The average trajectories were less curved in late rotation trials. In the early washout phase, the trajectories on average curved in the opposite direction compared to during perturbation. The reduced curvature in late rotation trials and inverse curvature observed during washout indicate successful adaptation, which we quantified jointly across all target directions. To obtain averaged trajectories across targets, we rotated them for each target such that the X-axis aligned with the center-to-target direction and the Y-axis aligned orthogonally to this (perturbation direction, Fig 2B; see Materials and methods). Fig 2C depicts the average cursor trajectories across all eight targets and for all sessions for monkey Y. Additionally, the corresponding “motor” signal, representing the trajectories that would be produced by the unperturbed decoder using the neural activity of the controlling units, is visualized (Fig 2B–2C). To quantify adaptation, we calculated the trial-by-trial angular movement error (α) from the starting direction of the movement. To have a good enough estimate of movement direction while keeping the influence of online movement corrections small, we measured the angle of the cursor position at the halfway point of the trajectory relative to the straight line connecting the starting position and the target position (Fig 2C). On average, during baseline trials, the angular error was close to zero and did not decrease over time, as the fitted data with exponential decay did not show significant differences from zero (Monkey Y: intercept = 0.637, p = 0.26, decay = 0.006, p = 0.43, n = 51; Monkey Z: intercept = 1.5, p = 0.26, decay = 0.0029, p = 0.8, n = 15). It increased to about 20° at the onset of the VMR perturbation and gradually decreased as the monkeys adapted their neural activity to regain better control (Fig 2D). Fitting the data with an exponential decaying function during the perturbation phase indicated significant visuomotor adaptation (Monkey Y: n = 51, intercept = 20.99, p < 0.001, decay = −0.0026, p < 0.001; Monkey Z: n = 15, intercept = 20.69, p < 0.001, decay = −0.0018, p = 0.0017). During the washout phase, movement errors were committed in the opposite direction to the applied perturbation, consistent with a negative aftereffect as typically seen in visuomotor rotation adaptation. Fitting the data with an exponential decay revealed a significant intercept for both animals (Monkey Y: intercept = −11.63, p < 0.001, n = 26; Monkey Z: intercept = −17.255, p = 0.0018, n = 4), indicating significant aftereffects for both animals. These findings suggest a change in the sensorimotor transformation achieved during BCI adaptation trials. In BCI-controlled movements, behavioral changes represented by the cursor on the screen (i.e., the decoder output) directly mirror the activity of the neural population that controls the decoder. When faced with a VMR-type perturbation, this controlling neural group can restore its performance by re-associating certain target directions with different movement directions [15,18]. The re-association hypothesis means that the neurons can direct the cursor to the desired target using activity patterns consistent with those observed during the center-out reach task on which they were originally trained, associating a direction suited to compensate for the perturbing rotation. In contrast to the re-configuration hypothesis, the covariance structure between different neurons should change very little with re-associations, since the network remains stable. This stability implies that the neural dynamics that define the low-dimensional neural subspace (i.e., the neural manifold), which explains most of the neural variance before adaptation (during baseline), also explain most of the variance during perturbation and after adaptation (washout). To test the re-association versus re-configuration hypothesis, we calculated the alignment index [62] of the neural manifolds between the baseline trials and the other experimental phases (S2 Fig). Alignment should be high in the case of re-association. The alignment index is computed as the ratio of the explained variance when projecting the neural activity from the other experimental phases onto the principal components (PCs) derived from the baseline activity (see Materials and methods section). We focused on the first four PCs, which capture the majority of the variance in the baseline trials (S3A, S3C, S3E, and S3G Fig). Supporting the re-association hypothesis, we find that a substantial portion of the initially explained variance remains constant throughout the learning process. In fact, the average difference between the alignment indices during late rotation and the cross-validated alignment index during baseline is smaller than 1% for all the different neural populations that we calculated (S2 Fig). This suggests a preservation of the manifold structure during VMR adaptation in the frontal motor network. Our primary research goal was to identify the spatial reference frames of movement parameters encoded by neurons without a direct causal link to the movement (noncontrolling units) in frontal versus parietal brain areas. During BCI movements, noncontrolling units could encode movement parameters in either a visual coordinate system (reflecting the cursor movement) or a physical coordinate system (reflecting intended limb movements). To distinguish between these spatial encoding strategies, we used an offline decoding approach to reconstruct movement trajectories from noncontrolling units. First, a Kalman filter (KF) decoder (as for online decoding) was trained offline with neural activity of the noncontrolling units during BCI baseline trials (training set, Fig 3A) to reproduce the cursor trajectories actually produced by the animal with the controlling units during baseline. During unperturbed baseline trials, these trajectories represent both the motor command (of the controlling units) and visual cursor feedback alike, since both are spatially congruent (identical except for sensory noise). (A) Schematic illustration of the offline decoding principle during the movement period. A velocity Kalman filter decoder was applied to reconstruct theoretical memory trajectories from neural activity (first column). During the movement period, real BCI trajectories were used for regression with neural firing rates from noncontrolling neurons during baseline trials (second column, training set). After calibration during baseline trials, the decoder was used to reconstruct continuous trajectories during perturbation trials (third column). The example averaged trajectories demonstrate continuous movements toward the target. In the last column, the reconstructed 3D trajectory from the offline decoder is projected onto the perturbation plane for perturbation trials. These projections assess visual-like or motor-like encoding, where positive deviations along this axis correspond to the visual signal, and negative deflections indicate motor output during adaptation.

Numerical data are available in S2 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.g003 Second, this decoder was then applied to the neural activity during VMR trials of the same neural population (test set, Fig 3A). During VMR trials, the motor command of the controlling units and the visual cursor feedback are spatially incongruent. This allows us to test which spatial reference frame the noncontrolling units better correspond to. More specifically, the projection of the decoded trajectories along the perturbation axis (deflection measure) allowed us to study whether neural activity of the noncontrolling units during adaptation reflects (i) a stationary, nonadaptive signal (H1), (ii) the adapting visual cursor trajectories (H2), or (iii) the adapting motor signal as produced by the controlling units (H3). Straight trajectories to the target as during baseline would reflect a nonadaptive signal in noncontrolling populations, corresponding to a lack of deviation in the perturbation direction (Fig 3A). Deviation from baseline deflecting in the positive direction of the perturbation axis would reflect the visual signal (visual signal plane; corresponding to perturbation direction greater than 0), while deflection in the negative direction would reflect the motor command (motor signal space; corresponding to perturbation direction <0). In our results, the negatively deflected reconstructed trajectories in both animals show that noncontrolling units in M1 and PMd reflect the motor command similarly to controlling units (Fig 3B–3C). To accurately capture this deflection, we used a trajectory deflection measure in our analysis. This approach differs from the angular movement error (α) that we previously calculated to quantify adaptation, where α was measured at the midpoint of the trajectory relative to the straight line connecting the starting and target positions (Fig 2C). We chose the deflection measure for the reconstructed trajectories because it accounts for the overall shape and direction of the entire movement path. The mean deflection of the activity of monkey Y at the end of the movement (100%) was −8.69 mm ± 4.43 mm (mean ± standard deviation), significantly different from zero (one-sample t test, t(50) = −14.010, p < 0.001). For monkey Z, the mean deflection of activity at the end of the movement was also significantly below zero, at −9.88 mm ± 5.27 mm (t(14) = −7.250, p < 0.001). To isolate area-specific adaptation between M1 and PMd, we also tracked how each neuron’s preferred direction (PD) evolved during learning. This analysis revealed robust, systematic PD rotations that were independently measurable in both M1 and PMd (S4 Fig). These tuning shifts are well-aligned to partially compensate for the experimentally induced visual rotation. To gain deeper insight into the level of adaptation achieved by the noncontrolling neuronal population, we calculated the angle representing the deviation in the perturbation direction at the final level of adaptation. This angle was measured between the reconstructed trajectory of each population and the direct path to the target. To compare the adaptation levels across different populations, we then scaled the final angle reached by each neural subpopulation relative to that of the controlling unit population and called this the “relative gain.” The relative gain quantifies the deviation along the perturbation axis relative to the level of adaptation achieved. By expressing these deviations as a fraction of the total adaptation level exhibited by the controlling units, we could assess and compare how much each population contributed to adapting to the perturbation. Specifically, the M1-PMd noncontrolling population reached a relative gain of 59% for Monkey Y and 94% for Monkey Z, underscoring the significant adaptation observed in the M1-PMd noncontrolling population. We next investigated how VMR adaptation affects PRR activity, focusing on whether PRR’s adaptation-associated neural dynamics share the same spatial frame of reference as the frontal regions. By analyzing the adaptation process in PRR both with direct influence on movement control (decoder FP, controlling PRR units) and without it (decoder FO, noncontrolling PRR units), we determined whether PRR predominantly mirrors visual feedback or plays an active role similar to frontal areas. The overall neural yield in PRR was lower than in the combined M1-PMd recordings for both subjects. To still achieve similar baseline performance across conditions and to have enough noncontrolling units in PRR for analysis, the controlling PRR neurons were combined with a subset of M1-PMd units in the FP decoder sessions. This design choice was motivated by the fact that we observed lower performance in pre-testing trials when using PRR alone, possibly due to its weaker motor coding properties. Still, this experimental strategy allowed us to compare adaptation of PRR while partially causing the movement or not causing it directly at all. First, we evaluated whether the respective contributions of M1-PMd and PRR to the cursor movement were balanced during FP decoding, or rather predominated by M1-PMd inputs. Each cell’s contribution was determined by multiplying the norm of the vector that translates decoded speed into its firing rate summed with its baseline firing rate (Fig 4A), a similar approach as described in [68]. The distributions of the contribution values differed only modestly between PRR and M1-PMd (Cohen’s d: d = 0.67 for Monkey Y, d = 0.38 for Monkey Z). This suggests that both the PRR and M1-PMd areas similarly drive the motor output of the decoder. We also ensured that after baseline trials, neither of these areas significantly decreased their firing rate during adaptation which might indicate a substantial silencing of the area. Average firing rates between baseline and adaptation did not differ significantly (Mann–Whitney test, p > 0.05; Fig 4B). Together, these results indicate an active contribution of PRR to decoder adaptation. (A) Distributions of the norm of the linear regression vectors from velocity to neural firing rate for every single unit contributing to the decoder, color-coded depending on the neural population. Numerical data are available in S3 Data. (B) Mean firing rates for PRR and M1-PMd controlling units during baseline and late rotation epochs show that neither PRR nor M1-PMd is reducing their firing rate when compared to baseline (all p values nonsignificant with Mann–Witney test, n = 11 for Monkey Y, n = 5 for Monkey Z). Numerical data are available in S3 Data. (C) Similar to Fig 3C, the bar plots show the deflection of the trajectories at the end of the reach.

Across both decoder configurations (FP and FO), significant deflections from zero were observed at the end of movement. For monkey Y, under FP decoding, the mean deflection was −1.64 ± 1.56 mm (t(10) = −3.48, p = 0.006); under FO, −1.85 ± 2.25 mm (t(39) = −5.20, p < 0.001). For monkey Z, under FP decoding, deflection was −10.90 ± 2.87 mm (t(4) = −8.49, p = 0.001); under FO, −5.18 ± 5.08 mm (t(4) = −12.37, p = 0.0001). These results indicate a motor-like encoding during adaptation, qualitatively similar to M1-PMd (Fig 4C). Even when PRR was not contributing to the control of the decoder, an equivalent pattern of adaptation was observed, indicating motor-related changes rather than representation of the visual feedback. For the PRR controlling units, Monkey Y showed a 13% relative gain to the final adaptation, while Monkey Z showed 64%. When PRR was noncontrolling, Monkey Y showed a 14% relative gain, and Monkey Z achieved 37%. In summary, our findings suggest that PRR exhibits substantial motor-like encoding during movement adaptation, even when it is not directly controlling the movement, highlighting its involvement in the adaptation process. This indicates that PRR plays a more integral role in motor adaptation than merely reflecting visual feedback. An important aspect of our study design is to compare movement planning and execution to understand the dynamics of neural adaptation. Specifically, we ask whether motor preparation and the associated initial states of neural dynamics are updated trial-by-trial during adaptation, or if only online motor control changes during BCI learning. The transition between planning and movement phase was comparable in the BCI and MC contexts. We applied a PC decomposition and cross-projected the neural activity during planning onto the dimensions that best explained the activity during movement. We found that the explained variance in the planning activity, when projected into the first four dimensions of the movement subspace, was significantly reduced in comparison to the movement activity (S3 Fig, paired t test, all comparisons p < 0.001. Monkey Y, MC: M1-PMd meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.46, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.86, t(49); PRR meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.87, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.91, t(49). BC: M1-PMd meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.67, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.92, t(49); PRR meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.88, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.96, t(49). Monkey Z, MC: M1-PMd meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.53, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.76, t(14); PRR meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.63, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.74, t(14). BC: M1-PMd meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.62, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.83, t(14); PRR meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.79, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.87, t(14)). The subspace misalignment was more pronounced in frontal areas compared to parietal areas in both monkeys. The alignment patterns were equivalent in both manual and BCI trials. These results show substantial differences between the manifold structure in the planning and movement phases not only in MC but also in BCI. We attribute these change in neural state to a transitions from planning while not attempting cursor movements during the delay period to actually producing a cursor move towards the target during the movement period. If the animals had attempted cursor movements during the delay period of the BCI trials already, the release of the cursor blockade at the end of the delay period would have led to an immediate cursor movement, since neural response modulations directly affect cursor movements in BCI control. Instead, what we observed in BCI trials were neural response latencies from the go cue that were similar to, or even longer than those during manual reaches (animal Y: MC activity peak 259.55 ± 31.58 ms versus BCI 255.05 ± 29.09 ms; animal Z: MC activity peak 353.05 ± 43.13 ms versus BCI 463.72 ± 43.86 ms; see S3I Fig). To better understand how the FP network adjusts to altered feedback, we examined changes not just during the control of movement but also during its planning phase. To measure neural changes during planning, we employed an offline decoder approach similar to the one used for studying the movement phase. For planning, similar to movement decoding, we trained the decoder with baseline trials but used neural activity from the memory period. Unlike movement decoding, this training involved regressing the firing rates against a directional vector that continuously pointed to the cued target. Decoding the direction every 50 ms enabled us to reconstruct hypothetical 3D trajectories offline during the planning phase. For each target direction, we took the 400 ms time interval before the ‘go’ cue. We then calculated the vector sum of the individual unit vectors, each pointing in the direction decoded within that specific time bin (Fig 5A). The hypothetical trajectories we produced stem from a direct projection of the neural space into the 3D task space through the decoder, reflecting the intended direction during planning. In essence, these trajectories transform neural activity into a space where variations are explicitly linked to the task space (via the decoder), such as aiming at a target. To validate our decoding methodology during the planning phase, we identified the intended targets by determining the closest target to the final position attained at the conclusion of the planning phase for each reconstructed trajectory within the task space (using an 8-way discrete classifier). In our baseline trials, the decoder produced hypothetical trajectories in the task space that were consistent with the intended target (S5 Fig). (A) Schematic illustration of the offline decoding principle during the memory period. As previously described for movement decoding, a velocity Kalman filter decoder was applied to reconstruct theoretical memory trajectories from neural activity (first column). During the memory period, a unity vector always pointing at the target was used for regression with neural firing rates (second column, training set). After calibration during baseline trials, the decoder was used to reconstruct continuous trajectories during perturbation trials (third column). The example averaged trajectories demonstrate continuous movements toward the target. In the last column, the reconstructed 3D trajectory from the offline decoder is projected onto the perturbation plane for perturbation trials. These projections assess visual-like or motor-like encoding, where positive deviations along this axis correspond to the visual signal, and negative deflections indicate motor output during adaptation. (B) The reconstructed trajectories in the perturbed dimension exhibit a negative deflection, indicating re-aiming, even during the planning period.

Numerical data are available in S4 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.g005 Equivalent to the analyses during movement, we tested the decoder’s generalization to quantify adaptation and its spatial frame of reference. This was done by training it during the memory phase of the baseline trials and then applying it during the memory phase of the rotation trials. Much like neural activity observed during movement, any deviations in the reconstructed hypothetical trajectories (once projected onto the perturbation direction) would suggest either motor- or visual-like adaptation. We quantified this in a manner equivalent to how we assessed data during movement control (Fig 5A, right side). For both monkeys, the controlling and noncontrolling units in the M1-PMd regions exhibited motor-like adaptation during the planning phase. This demonstrates the use of a re-association strategy in a motor-reference frame during motor planning (Fig 5B). In the PRR, re-association in a motor-reference frame during planning could also be observed. Differences were statistically significant for the individual monkeys in either only the controlling units (monkey Y) or in the noncontrolling units (monkey Z) with nonsignificant trends in the respective other group of neurons (S6 Fig). By extracting the re-associated movement directions in both the planning and movement periods, we tested whether the observed level of trial-by-trial adaptation during planning predicts the adaptation levels during movement. We correlated the deviations of the decoded trajectories from a direct-to-target trajectory towards the end of the planning period (400 ms before go cue) with the deviations observed during movement 200 ms after the go cue for each trial (Fig 6A). We chose the early 200 ms deflection in the movement to reduce the impact of feedback-driven online corrections, which would be anticipated at later intervals. A positive correlation would support the hypothesis that adaptation is mostly achieved by adapting the initial conditions prior to the onset of movement, while movement-associated neural dynamics remain comparably stable. It’s important to note that trajectories in the task space are theoretical during the planning phase and are decoded differently (see Materials and methods) than during the movement phase. Therefore, the regression slope between the planning and the movement trajectories is in arbitrary units. However, relative values in the slope across brain regions, different neuronal groups, or between the initial and advanced stages of adaptation can still signify the ratio at which changes related to adaptation during planning manifest as dynamic changes during movement. (A) Schematic representation of the analysis method. The reconstructed trajectories at the end of the planning period were regressed against those at 200 ms into the movement phase to test if adaptation levels during planning correlate with those during movement. For each axis, they represent the values assumed for each trial along the perturbation dimension in the specific period (planning and movement). (B) Multi-comparison of regression slopes for all controlling and noncontrolling populations. The slopes were extracted using a multiple linear regression model from data collected from two animals, with random factors considered. Paired multiple comparisons were deemed significant for an interaction effect between the two tested populations with a Bonferroni-corrected p-value < 0.05 (*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001). The error bars indicate 95% Bonferroni-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals as estimated by the model. (C) Graphical representation of learning-related changes in slope.

This model incorporates the trial number (perturbation trials) as an interaction factor to examine if the relationship evolves during adaptation. We applied a combined model, accounting for both animals, with the individual animal as a random factor and the day of the experiment nested within the animal random factor. Additionally, we separated the analysis for different brain areas and further categorized it based on controlling and noncontrolling units. Significant correlations were observed between deflections during planning and movement across all brain areas, but not all subgroups of neurons (Fig 6B). For controlling and noncontrolling M1-PMd populations, slopes were significant (p < 0.001 and p = 0.0085, respectively), indicating correlations. Similarly, for PRR noncontrolling units, a significant correlation was observed (p < 0.001). For PRR controlling units, such a relationship was not evident (p = 0.30). When we compared the slope values across all controlling and noncontrolling populations in the absence of the interaction parameter, we noticed a significant difference in every comparison (Fig 6B). The linear relationship between planning and movement was already apparent during the baseline BCI trials and, though less pronounced, also during the MC trials (S7 Fig). The fact that neural states during late planning and initial movement are correlated indicates that adaptation-induced changes during planning manifest as dynamic changes during movement. We next ask if this relationship remains unchanged over the course of learning, implying a stable relationship between initial state before movement and consecutive motor-related dynamics, or if the relationship evolves as learning progresses, implying a dynamic interplay changing the “gain” with which neural adaptations during planning are linked to changes in movement execution. The regression slope changes for both controlling and noncontrolling neural populations in PMd-M1, as well as in the noncontrolling population of PRR (Fig 6C shows the first half of the trials versus the second half of the trials). This change is indicated by a significant interaction of correlation strength with trial number in our model (for M1-PMd controlling p_change_slope < 0.001, for M1-PMd noncontrolling p_change_slope = 0.0053, for PRR noncontrolling p_change_slope = 0.023, for PRR controlling p_change_slope = 0.4. This suggests that, over time, the same degree of neural adaptation during the planning phase results in more pronounced motor corrections (interaction M1-PMd controlling: 0.000223, interaction M1-PMd noncontrolling: 0.00010. At the same time this translates in the opposite effect in PRR noncontrolling (interaction effect: −0.00010). Previous studies on motor learning in primates have predominantly focused on the motor cortex in 2D settings [11,22,23,47,56,58]. Here, we investigated the adaptive mechanisms underlying short-term adaptation in a distributed network involving both frontal and parietal sensorimotor areas. By employing a VMR task in 3D movements, we explored motor adaptation and the associated neural dynamics with the same dimensionality as natural movements [69], reducing physical constraints. To minimize potential confounds arising from changes in cross-modal congruency due to the applied perturbation, we employed a BCI paradigm which removes movement-contingent proprioceptive feedback. By selectively manipulating the remaining task-relevant visual feedback and exclusively controlling movements through observed neurons feeding into the BCI decoder, we gained precise control over the sensorimotor loop and associated transformations [16,17]. Furthermore, we utilized memory-guided reaches to examine how motor planning activity and its relationship to movement are influenced by learning in both frontal and parietal sensorimotor regions. Our findings revealed coherent neural adaptation in a motor-reference frame across both frontal and parietal motor areas, i.e., including the parietal region remote from the frontal neurons controlling the BCI. This adaptation was observed in both planning- and movement-related activity, regardless of whether the neurons controlled BCI movements or not. Our results suggest the presence of a distributed mechanism of “re-association” which is happening in a motor-reference frame and influences initial states of movement associated neural dynamics during movement-planning already, both in frontal and parietal cortices. A key finding of our study on BCI-VMR is that even neurons in the PRR area exhibit changes in neural activity during adaptation. Notably, this change is evident even though PRR neurons do not directly govern BCI movements and are remote from the controlling units in PMd-M1. By maintaining a consistent physical state (posture) during BCI movements, we ensured that proprioceptive input remained constant. Consequently, sensory changes induced by perturbations were confined to the visual cursor, which was directly and solely managed by the controlling units via the decoder [16]. Therefore, the decoder input represents the motor command, while its output corresponds to the task-relevant sensory feedback. Additionally, using offline decoding, we could analyze the encoding in groups of neurons not involved in online control. Earlier research has highlighted the preservation of covariance and neural manifold structures during short-term BCI learning tasks in the motor cortex’s controlling units [15,20]. We expand this notion by demonstrating that both noncontrolling motor cortex units and PRR units adapt, while preserving their correlation structure (S3 Fig). This within-manifold adaptation suggests that the constraints imposed by the underlying neural circuitry remains relatively unchanged during VMR learning [20,70,71]. Our findings indicate that a correlated network structure is maintained within the widespread frontoparietal sensorimotor cortices during fast BCI adaptation. In this study, we chose to apply a perturbation in the fronto-parallel plane, as we previously found that subjects adapt most easily to visual perturbations of the cursor in this orientation. It remains an open question whether perturbations around other axes, which have been shown to be more difficult to learn in a human VMR study [67], might require more complex changes in neural activity, potentially extending beyond the intrinsic manifold. On the other hand, mixed representations of neural information about reach direction and distance (depth) in posterior parietal cortex [72–74] and also in PMd [75] do not suggest fundamental differences between dimensions. Our findings indicate that noncontrolling M1-PMd and PRR units reflect adaptive changes in the same motor-related spatial frame of reference that controlling units use. In other words, the changes in noncontrolling units predominantly reflect the adapted movement directions that the controlling units have to produce to counteract the feedback perturbation. The uniform encoding of the movement-associated corrective variable across the frontoparietal network may facilitate efficient information exchange within a closed-loop system for motor corrections, especially involving direct PRR engagement [76]. Our results add to previous work in which parietal area 5 was found to encode motor errors, and where electrically stimulating this area generated movements opposite to the PD of the stimulated cells [77], in line with results from motor areas M1 and PMd [78]. The conclusion that PRR generates a signal in the same frame of reference as the motor areas, in our case, is based on the analysis of neural population responses during a motor adaptation task, without a potentially confounding co-varying proprioceptive feedback. In tasks that impose a rule, requiring animals to learn and apply overt, context-specific stimulus-response associations, such as an anti-reach task [79], animals might be able to use an “explicit” strategy and solve context-specific spatial remapping of a target stimulus onto the motor goal by re-associating different neural dynamics with preexisting neural manifolds [36]. A closely related form of rule-based, explicit learning has been documented in discrete BCI experiments in monkeys [18] and humans [21]. Those studies employed a binary classifier to choose one of two targets, with the “cursor” shown only at the start and end of each trial, so continuous movement-contingent feedback was absent. Because the subject must discover and then apply a categorical association, the resulting adaptation may be based on an explicit strategy. The corresponding neural adaptation has been termed intrinsic-variable learning, i.e., re-association that reuses a preexisting neural manifold. Our experiment differs in at least one key aspect. We used a continuous VMR paradigm in which the cursor was visible throughout the reach, providing a moment-by-moment error signal since the feedback deviated from the expected feedback in perturbation trials. Under these circumstances, human psychophysics with classical VMR tasks often suggest primarily implicit recalibration of the visuomotor map [32,67,80,81]. Yet, learning in continuous VMR tasks may also involve a mixture of implicit recalibration and explicit re-aiming strategies [82]. Moreover, explicit processes themselves are not unitary but consist of dissociable strategies that interact with implicit recalibration in flexible ways [83]. The balance between these processes depends strongly on preparation time: explicit re-aiming requires longer preparation intervals, whereas restricting preparation to ~250 ms suppresses its use and yields behavior dominated by implicit adaptation [84,85]. Since our task design included a delay period prior to movement initiation, it may have provided the animals with additional opportunity to engage explicit strategies. Thus, while we interpret the re-association signals we observe across PMd, M1, and PRR as likely reflecting implicit recalibration, we cannot rule out contributions from explicit re-aiming. In either case, our findings reinforce that re-association is a general neural mechanism, expressed not only in rule-based explicit tasks but also in predominantly implicit adaptation contexts such as continuous VMR. In our study, we probed the trial-by-trial adaptation within the frontoparietal network during the movement planning phases. Specifically, we were keen to understand how re-association processes during planning are transferred to the execution of movement. Drawing from dynamical systems theory, we considered the possibility that neural activity during planning could establish the initial conditions, thereby guiding the dynamical system to produce adapted movements without the need for explicit cognitive computation [60] or enhanced restructuring of the network. Our observations revealed linear correlations between trial-by-trial adjustments of planning and movement activity, evident in both controlling and noncontrolling units of frontal motor areas M1-PMd and, less pronounced, in noncontrolling units of PRR. From a dynamical systems perspective, this suggests that the adaptation of initial states to define updated starting conditions for the following dynamic evolution of states during movement might be particularly true for frontal, but less for parietal areas. Additionally, we found an enhancement of this relationship over the learning phase, indicating that changes during planning translated to more pronounced changes in movement in the later adaptation phase. This suggests that not only the motor error was reduced, but also that the adaptive mechanism became more efficient over the course of learning. These findings partly challenge the notion of a linear dynamical system in motor learning, suggesting that the dynamical system itself may undergo changes. However, [86] offer an complementary perspective, proposing that evolving relationships may reflect the brain’s effort to optimize its energetic costs. In this model, efficient control strategies favor selectively targeting dimensions that most impact future motor outcomes, reducing redundant preparatory effort. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed that as learning progressed, adjustments in planning became more effective in driving corrective changes in movement. This shift implies that less extensive re-association during planning could still enable more substantial corrections during movement, aligning with the view that learning serves not only to reduce error but also to refine the efficiency of neural control mechanisms in an energetically optimal way. We conducted a comparative analysis of online and offline decoding, revealing that all neurons, including noncontrolling units, coherently encode a corrective variable during motor control to counteract visuomotor rotations. This re-association mechanism, previously observed in motor areas, supports efficient information transfer in a feedback control-loop [11,15,18,21,28]. Additionally, our results indicate that re-association during planning can predict movement correction, although their relationship varies throughout learning and depends on the area and causal relationship between the area and the BCI movement. During the later stages of adaptation, it appears that less re-association is required during planning to achieve a specific degree of movement adaptation. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that generalized adaptation mechanisms operate within a distributed neural network during three-dimensional movements, offering insights into neural manifold structures and motor error correction. By employing a VMR task in a 3D workspace and using a BCI, we captured spatial encoding and motor adaptation without physically constraining movements and independently controlling sensorimotor transformations from proprioceptive feedback. Our findings highlight the critical role of an integrated motor and parietal sensorimotor network in adaptation. Both frontal and parietal regions primarily encode adapted motor commands rather than merely responding to perturbed visual feedback, supporting the re-association hypothesis of VMR learning. Moreover, learning-associated changes occurred not only in neurons controlling the BCI output but also in neurons not directly connected to the BCI, indicating a widespread mechanism of motor adaptation. Finally, neural adaptation manifests in both planning and movement-related activities across the brain, with learning-associated changes in the correlation between these phases. This relationship evolved particularly within frontal areas during learning, suggesting different adaptation trajectories in frontal versus parietal regions. Our results underscore the distributed nature of adaptation within neural networks underlying motor control and highlight the importance of this network in fine-tuning spatial encoding for precise movement correction. All procedures and experiments were authorized by the relevant regional authority (Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit [LAVES]) under the permit numbers 3,392,42502-04-13/1100 and 33.19-42502-04-18/2823, and fully conformed to German law and the European Directive 2010/63/EU governing the use of animals in scientific research. The setup allowed the animals to perform reaching movements in a three-dimensional VR environment [67,87]. The animals were seated in a dark room with two monitors (BenQ XL2720T, 27-inch diagonal, 1920 × 1080 px, 60 Hz refresh rate) positioned on either side (Fig 1A). They looked through two semi-transparent mirrors (75 × 75 mm, 70R/30T, Edmund Optics) angled at 45° relative to the monitors. This created a stereoscopic 3D virtual impression in front of the subjects. The monitors were tilted 30° relative to the horizontal plane so that the workspace was projected below eye level, allowing the animals to perform ergonomic arm movements in front of their body. To optimize the perception of the virtual workspace, the interpupillary distance of the monkeys was measured (Monkey Y = 33.2 mm, Monkey Z = 33.1 mm). The setup software and screen projections were then calibrated to these individual values to minimize discrepancies between the images for the left and right eyes. Eye position was tracked at 2 kHz (EyeLink 1000 Plus, SR Research LTD, Ottawa, Canada), and the gaze was required to be maintained on the central fixation point during the memory period (see below). The custom-written task controller was implemented in C++, allowing simultaneous tracking of multiple interfaces including the BCI, the eye and the hand tracking systems [88]. The BCI was implemented as a Matlab program running an online loop, which communicated with the task controller via a Matlab implementation of the VRPN library through a MEX file [89]. Neural data were not just recorded to hard drives but also processed online through a MEX interface provided by the recording system (Cerebus, Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, USA) to extract spike counts (see below). The loop operated every 50 ms in consecutive nonoverlapping time windows. During BCI trials, the cursor was automatically placed at the central fixation point during the holding phase and after the movement was completed (see task description below). Four infrared cameras tracked the position of four passive markers centered on the monkey’s palm in real-time (Fig 1A) at 100 Hz. The two animals were trained to wear a 3D-printed plastic framework containing the four reflective markers arranged around the right wrist. The center of geometry of the four markers was tracked using four Vicon Bonita B10 cameras (Vicon, Oxford, UK) and aligned with the midpoint of the palm. To facilitate accurate tracking and control in the VR setup, we performed two calibrations. First, we calibrated the cameras to stream the center of geometry of the markers attached to the monkey’s wrist. We added an extra marker at the position of the monkey’s wrist, which served as the reference point during this calibration. Using Vicon Tracker 1.3.1 software (Vicon), we adjusted the center of geometry of the four markers to align with this additional marker. This allowed the software to stream the position of the center of geometry online to the task controller, ensuring that this position corresponded accurately to the monkey’s wrist position in the physical setup. Second, we calibrated the camera space with the task controller space to ensure proper alignment between the virtual environment and the physical setup. During this calibration, a human operator co-registered the cursor position and the displayed target positions using semi-transparent mirrors. This process translated the coordinates from Vicon space to the task space, allowing the VR system to accurately reflect the monkey’s movements within the task environment.[67]. Two Rhesus monkeys performed a 3D, memory-guided, and center-out reach task (Fig 1B). At the beginning of each trial, during the decoder calibration phase, the animals were required to acquire and maintain a central fixation point with both their hand and gaze for 400 ms (fixation period). Following this, one of eight targets, positioned at the vertices of a 70 mm-sided cube and centered around the fixation point, was briefly displayed for 300 ms (cue period). The animals had to continue holding their hand and gaze at the center of the cube for an additional 400 ms (planning period), followed by a variable delay of up to 600 ms. After the delay, the central fixation target disappeared, signaling the animals to move toward the target (movement period), with a timeout limit of 1,500 ms. During BCI control trials, the cursor movement was controlled by a neural decoder. The task remained identical to the MC task that had been used for calibration. If, at any point, the animals directed their gaze outside a 30 mm tolerance window around the fixation point or moved their hand more than 15 mm from its starting position (security radius) during the fixation period, the trial was aborted. MC trials were employed to calibrate a biomimetic velocity KF decoder, which was subsequently used to perform the BCI trials (Fig 1C, BCI). Once the animals became proficient in controlling the cursor during the BCI task (reaching a baseline of 160 successful trials), we introduced a VMR to perturb the visual cursor feedback. This was implemented by applying a 30° visuomotor rotation of the cursor’s movement in the fronto-parallel plane. The direction of the rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) varied between days, and the perturbation lasted for a variable number of trials with a maximum of 320 trials. Following the perturbation phase, a washout phase was introduced, during which the visuomotor rotation was removed, and the animals returned to controlling the cursor without any rotation for another variable number of trials until they finished their session for the day. Both animals were housed socially with a single male of the same species at the German Primate Center. The enclosure sizes surpassed the standards required by both German and European regulations. They were kept in a setting enriched with wooden structures, toys, and various other enrichment devices. Neuronal activity was recorded from two macaque monkeys implanted with floating microelectrode arrays (FMAs, MicroProbes, Gaithersburg, USA) in three cortical areas: M1, PMd, and PRR. Monkey Y was implanted with two 32-channel FMAs in each area, while monkey Z was implanted with three 32-channel FMAs in PMd and PRR (see S1C Fig). Both animals were implanted in the left hemisphere, contralateral to the arm used for calibrating the BCI decoder and performing the MC task (S1C Fig). Premotor array positions in monkey Z range between 18.2–25.2 mm AP and 10.5–13.5 mm ML (array centers), and in monkey Y between 18.6–19.6 mm AP and 13.1–17.4 mm ML. M1 array positions in monkey Z range between 14.2–17.2 mm AP and 12.5–14.5 mm ML, and in monkey Y between 10.3–11.6 mm AP 11.9–16.2 mm ML. Parietal array positions in monkey Z range between −1.3 and −6.8 mm AP and 5.5–10.5 mm ML, and in monkey Y between −0.4 and −4.1 mm AP and 8.1–11.9 mm ML. Position data per each array can be found in S1 Fig. The positioning of the premotor arrays aimed at the arm region of PMd. M1 arrays targeted the arm region along different depth in the anterior wall of the central sulcus. Parietal arrays covered the MIP region of the posterior PRR with the longer electrodes, while the shorter electrodes sample from closer to the surface and may partially include area 5 (also referred to as area PEc). In single-day sessions, we recorded from 128 electrodes simultaneously in monkey Y, while we recorded from all 256 electrodes in monkey Z. Activity was recorded online and stored on a hard drive using a 128-channel Cerebus system (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, USA) for monkey Y and two 128-channel Cerebus systems for monkey Z. Data were sampled at 30 kHz. Signals were band-pass filtered (250 Hz–7.5 kHz), and a threshold of −4.5 times the root-mean-square (RMS) voltage was used to isolate below-threshold waveforms. Before the start of each daily experimental session, manual online sorting was performed by an expert user. Sorting involved identification of clusters in PC space to classify neuronal activity based on waveform characteristics. Online neuronal activity during movement was used to train a velocity KF decoder [90] by regressing neuronal firing rates from a subset of single and multi-units with hand velocity (50 ms steps, nonoverlapping time windows) while the monkey manually performed the task during the movement period. During FO decoding a subset of M1 and PMd units where used while during FP decoding subsets of M1 and PMd units were combined with all PRR units. After an initial MC calibration consisting of about 60 trials for initializing KF parameters, the velocity KF decoder was retrained using velocity vectors that directly pointed toward the target [91]. During retraining, first the computer mostly controlled the cursor movement. The computer’s contribution then was step-by-step progressively reduced until real-time neural activity fully guided the cursor. The transition was managed by applying a weighted vectorial sum of both the computer-generated and neural signals, gradually increasing the brain’s control for smoother cursor operation. This adjustment was performed over successive blocks of 20–30 trials, reducing the computer’s contribution from 70% to 0%. The process was not automated and required expert judgment to determine the appropriate timing of the transitions. Additionally, hand movements greater than 15 mm from the resting position were discouraged to prevent the animal from using its hand during BCI trials. This retraining calibration step was necessary to eliminate hand movement during BCI control. We employed the method described by [28] to average trajectories reaching different targets. In brief, trajectories were first projected onto the plane of the applied perturbation (xy—fronto-parallel plane). For each trajectory to a target, the dimension orthogonal to the direction from the center to the specific target was defined as the “perturbation dimension.” This allowed all trajectories to the eight different targets to be averaged within this common reference frame. The positive sign of this second axis was chosen based on the direction of the applied perturbation (clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the session). The online-sorted spikes were re-sorted offline using Boss software (v.1.0.3, Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, USA) to better isolate and identify additional units among the noncontrolling units. Units used for online decoding were left unchanged. A threshold of −4.5 times the standard deviation of the noise was used to isolate spikes, with a refractory period of 1.5 ms. Clusters were identified using a semi-automated k-means method in PC space. This semi-automated process required the user to specify the number of clusters and define the initial centroid for each. To study changes in the encoded correction variable during adaptation for noncontrolling units, and during the memory period for all units, we applied a KF decoder offline, similar to the one used for online BCI trials, to reconstruct cursor trajectories. The decoder was always trained on the activity from baseline trials and then applied to the activity from the rotated trials to identify the encoded variable during adaptation. For the evaluation of the decoder during baseline trials, a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure was used to include all baseline trials in the analysis. Each time point, sampled every 50 ms and containing all the spikes from each neuron, was used as input to the decoder. For the decoder’s training output, real movement speeds were used during the movement epoch (sampled every 50 ms), while a normalized vector pointing to the cued target was used during the planning epochs (also sampled every 50 ms). This approach allowed us to reconstruct theoretical neural trajectories from the decoded speeds during movement for noncontrolling units and during the memory phase for both controlling and noncontrolling units. We calculated the PC space for each analyzed epoch and region, plotting the variance explained by each dimension (S3 Fig), averaged across the dataset. In the cross-projected analysis of S3A, S3C, S3E, and S3G, we computed the PCs during the movement phase, projected the activity from the memory phase onto the seven PCs, and calculated the explained variance in each specific direction (component). For the alignment index calculation in S3B, S3D, S3F, and S3H Fig, we followed the method of Elsayed and colleagues [62], considering the top four PCs in the transformation. In brief, the alignment index measures manifold alignment and is calculated as the ratio between the explained variance of the projected activity (e.g., during the planning phase) along the original dimensions and the explained variance of the original main dimensions (e.g., derived from movement activity). To calculate the original PC space, we used cross-validated baseline trials to ensure that the alignment index reflects genuine differences between baseline and experimental phases, avoiding artifacts from overfitting. Neuronal contributions were computed from the observation matrix, the rows of which contain the weights linking x, y, z speed to the expected firing rate of neuron. We determined the firing rate of a single cell given the direction of movement using the following equation: We calculated the amplitude of the regressing vector (b1, b2, b3), summed to b0, to estimate the single neuron’s contribution to the decoder, as shown in Fig 4A. This measure provides a single scalar that reflects how much leverage the neuron can exert on the decoded cursor state. We used a linear model to test the significance of the relationship between the planning and movement phases in brain each area, separately for the groups of controlling and noncontrolling units. We also included trial number as variable to model slope changes due to learning and tested the interaction between learning and the planning-movement slope. Different experimental sessions and the two animals were treated as random factors in the model, with a nested hierarchical structure. The Wilkinson notation for the modeled variable was as follows: To calculate slope differences between controlling and noncontrolling populations, as well as between different areas, we employed a similar model that incorporated pairwise-tested interaction effects for the areas being compared. All six pairwise comparisons were corrected for significance using the Bonferroni method (see Fig 5B). The corresponding Wilkinson notation was as follows: Experimental design. This table summarizes, for each recording session, the number of units for each population, the type of decoder used, the rotation angle, and the direction of rotation (clockwise, CW, or counterclockwise, CCW). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.s001 (PDF) Hand movement speed and array implantations.

Numerical data are available in S6 Data. (C) Array locations. Monkey Y received six 32-channel floating micro-wire arrays (FMA, MicroProbes for Life Sciences, Gaithersburg, USA) in three distinct brain regions contralateral to the arm used for decoder calibration. Two arrays with staggered electrode lengths ranging from 7.1 to 1.9 mm were implanted in the arm region of the primary motor cortex (M1), two with staggered electrode lengths ranging from 4.5 to 2.1 mm in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), and two with staggered electrode lengths ranging from 7.1 to 1.9 mm in the parietal reach region (PRR). Similarly, in Monkey Z, three arrays were implanted in PMd, two in M1, and three in PRR.

Alignment indexes (AI) during various task epochs for planning (left) and movement (right) phases were calculated. The AI was determined by projecting the neural activity from both the early and late adaptation phases onto the principal components (PCs) derived from baseline activity. We selected a sufficient number of PCs to explain 90% of the baseline variance. AI during the baseline was computed using cross-validation. Notably, AI exhibited minimal variation between the baseline and visuomotor rotation (VMR) phases, indicating the preservation of neural manifolds throughout the learning process.

Today’s top news: The world’s second-largest asset manager is considering letting its U.S. clients buy crypto ETFs. The final walls are falling down. Last week, Crypto in America reported that Vanguard is weighing access to select spot crypto ETFs for brokerage customers. This is a sharp departure from its 2024 stance, when it blocked spot Bitcoin ETFs on-platform. There’s no final decision or product list yet; the discussions reflect persistent client demand and the competitive reality that most major peers already enable trading. Notably, Vanguard’s CEO Salim Ramji was previously at BlackRock and oversaw the launch of their Bitcoin ETF IBIT, one of the most successful ETF launches of all time. For asset context, Vanguard today oversees ~$10T in AUM and serves more than 50 million investors globally, so even a cautious rollout would be consequential for ETF liquidity. “They’re being very methodical in their approach, understanding the dynamics have been changing since 2024.” - source talking to Crypto in America “Vanguard, the 2nd largest asset manager in the world, is finally planning to allow clients to invest in crypto ETFs on their platform. By waiting this long, they have “protected” clients from +150% gains on $BTC since the ETFs went live.” - Satoshi Stacker on X If Vanguard enables crypto ETF access, even with tight guardrails, it adds a massive set of ongoing inflows into crypto majors. That means deeper secondary-market liquidity, broader retirement-account penetration, and more “default” exposure from set-it-and-forget-it investors who previously had to move assets elsewhere. Just 1% of $11T is $110B in inflows (and likely a major up-front portfolio rebalance adjustment). That’s massive. It also marks a symbolic validation: the firm that once said “not appropriate for long-term portfolios” would be acknowledging a durable role for crypto alongside stocks and bonds. The final holdouts are starting to capitulate.

Title: Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs bleed $1.7B as investor nerves kick in – Why now?

But will altcoin approvals save the market after Bitcoin and Ethereum’s $1.7B outflow shock? Fidelity’s FBTC led with $330.4 million in outflows, followed by Ark 21Shares’ ARKB. Even BlackRock’s IBIT, a usually strong performer, wasn’t spared, shedding $37.3 million. They faced $795.6M redemptions. Fidelity’s FETH led with $362M outflows, while BlackRock’s ETHA saw $199.9M. Only ETHE and TETH gained. After weeks of strong momentum in the ETF market, the tide has turned. Spot Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. saw a sharp reversal last week, recording over $1.7 billion in combined outflows. The exodus came as both cryptocurrencies faced heightened volatility, with Bitcoin and Ethereum each sliding more than 8% over the same period. According to data from Farside Investors, U.S.-listed Spot Bitcoin ETFs logged net withdrawals of $903 million last week. This ended a month-long streak of inflows that had signaled rising institutional confidence. On the 26th of September, Fidelity’s FBTC led the exodus with $330.4 million in redemptions, followed by Ark 21Shares’ ARKB and other funds. BlackRock’s flagship IBIT, typically regarded as one of the strongest performers, also saw outflows worth $37.3 million, while Bitwise’s BITB shed $23.8 million. Several other funds reported smaller redemptions, while a few remained flat with no notable flows. On the other hand, for the week ending the 26th of September, nine U.S.-listed spot Ethereum ETFs collectively saw $795.6 million in withdrawals, marking their heaviest week of outflows since their launch. Fidelity’s FETH once again stood out for recording the largest withdrawals at $362 million, trailed by BlackRock’s ETHA, which saw $199.9 million in redemptions. Grayscale’s ETHE and 21Shares’ TETH were rare exceptions, posting modest inflows while most other funds stagnated. With this shift in investor sentiment, attention is now shifting toward altcoin ETFs, with several final deadlines for approval arriving in October. Popular analyst Daan Crypto Trades even described October as “ETF month,” hinting at a potentially decisive moment for the broader digital asset ETF market. He said, “We’re expected to see approvals on ETFs from a variety of major altcoins like $SOL, $XRP, $LTC & $DOGE.” Daan Crypto Trades noted that none of the ETF applications with October deadlines come from industry heavyweights like Fidelity or BlackRock, two of the most influential players in the crypto ETF arena. Still, the pending approvals could inject fresh momentum into the market in the weeks ahead. Interestingly, this wave of outflows came even as institutional appetite for Bitcoin ETFs remained evident. Just last week, Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $642.4 million in inflows, according to Farside Investors. The broader landscape has also seen Wall Street deepening its crypto ties, with JPMorgan in June 2025 starting to accept Bitcoin ETF shares as collateral for loans. Together, these developments highlight the mixed signals in today’s ETF market: short-term volatility shadowed by long-term institutional integration.

Title: Opinion: Ireland must resist EU attempts to slash and burn environment standards for businesses

THE EU IS making moves that would trample on hard-fought protections meant to prevent catastrophic workplace tragedies and environmental abuses. Ireland should stand up against that effort. Activists across Europe from Brussels to Dublin took to the streets last week to demand greater regulation of bad behaviour by big corporations. The protests were a response to an attempt by the EU to gut protections meant to ensure that disasters like the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh 12 years ago – which killed more than 1,100 garment workers, mostly women who were sewing clothes for some of Europe’s biggest brands – never happens again. The international outcry after the Rana Plaza disaster sparked reforms, most notably France’s 2017 “duty of vigilance” law, which for the first time imposed legal obligations on French-based companies to prevent human rights and environmental abuses throughout their global supply chains. This duty of vigilance law requires large multinationals to publicly disclose and act on risks in their operations across their value chains globally. France’s leadership spurred momentum across Europe, culminating in the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) which is designed to compel companies to identify, prevent, mitigate, and remedy human rights and climate harms across their entire value chains. It requires accountability through civil liability, involvement of stakeholders, and yearly monitoring. While the directive is not without its faults, most notably the exclusion of the financial sector, it still holds the potential to deliver tangible protections for millions of women working in global supply chains, from garment factories to farms to mines. The Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh collapsed in April 2013. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo It was a hard-won achievement, the result of years of sustained pressure from trade unions, NGOs, women’s rights organisations, and environmental groups across Europe and the world. The directive faced intense resistance from corporate actors and member states and only passed after months of deadlock and political brinkmanship. But that hard-won progress is under serious threat from an EU “Omnibus” proposal unveiled last February that would eliminate the protections meant to ensure what happened in Rana Plaza never happens again. Driven by intense corporate lobbying, the Omnibus proposal strips the CSDDD of its core protections. It limits due diligence requirements to a company’s direct, first-tier suppliers, ignoring the deeper layers of subcontracting where the worst abuses, particularly against women, frequently occur. It weakens stakeholder involvement by narrowing who must be consulted, effectively sidelining already marginalised voices. Critically, it significantly curtails civil liability, meaning victims would have limited legal routes to hold companies accountable, and it blocks trade unions and NGOs from representing them in court. Advertisement It also waters down climate obligations by making climate transition plans optional, undermining efforts to address the environmental harm that disproportionately affects communities in the Global South. This is not about reducing red tape. It is a slash and burn of protections. One of the most glaring weaknesses in the original CSDDD was the exclusion of the financial sector. While banks, insurers and investment firms were not required to conduct due diligence on activities such as loans, investments, and insurance, a review clause offered a chance to revisit this gap in two years’ time. The Omnibus proposal would scrap that clause entirely, locking in the exemption and eliminating any future prospect of aligning financial flows with the EU’s human rights obligations or the goals of the Paris Agreement. This rollback is particularly dangerous in light of new research from ActionAid and Trócaire that exposed the staggering scale of harmful finance coming from the financial sector in Ireland. As of June 2024, Irish-based subsidiaries of investment companies held €31.76 billion ($34 billion) in fossil fuel investments. Much of this has been shielded from scrutiny thanks to unprecedented lobbying from the financial industry. BlackRock, one of the major investors through Ireland of fossil fuel, despite its public sustainability pledges, is among the most active and influential players pushing to weaken regulation. The Omnibus, if passed, would ensure such actors remain beyond the reach of meaningful accountability. While corporate lobbyists continue to push their agenda in Brussels, people mobilised across Europe and Ireland to push back. In Brussels thousands marched to demand that Europe strengthen, not weaken, protections for people and the planet. And outside Leinster House civil society groups, trade unions, and NGOs challenged the “deregulation” agenda that is becoming more and more prominent in Irish economic policy. This law will translate into real impacts for women globally. In Bangladesh, for example, research shows 80% of female garment workers in Dhaka have witnessed or experienced gender-based violence. With due diligence limited to first-tier suppliers, deeper subcontracting where such abuses thriv will escape oversight. Companies prominent in Ireland like Primark, Nike, and H&M have already been implicated in serious corporate abuse, including wage theft in factories across Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Indonesia, where workers were underpaid during the Covid-19 pandemic. Without legislation with teeth, corporate profit will comes first and women’s rights, climate change, human rights will all suffer. The Irish government is sending mixed signals on this issue. Ministers have publicly declared their support for the CSDDD. Yet they also express backing for the Omnibus proposal that would effectively gut it. This contradiction is reflected in recent policy developments in Ireland. The government just launched the “Action Plan on Competitiveness and Productivity” which frames deregulation and so-called “red tape cutting” as essential to Ireland’s growth. Decisions made in Brussels and backed in Leinster House have direct consequences for the women stitching our clothes, farming our food, or extracting the minerals in our phones. They are the ones who will be left more vulnerable if corporate accountability is gutted. The Irish government must reject the Omnibus rollbacks and defend the core of the CSDDD. Ireland must also look beyond Brussels and introduce a strong, gender-responsive national due diligence law that holds Irish companies and investors accountable for their impact on people and the planet. This must include financial services within Ireland’s foreign direct investment. We owe it to the women who died in Rana Plaza and to the millions still working in similar conditions not to let history repeat itself. Anything less is prioritising profit over people, and silence over justice. Cillian Quinn is Policy and Programme Manager with ActionAid Ireland who works to end gender-based violence and promote equality in over 71 countries around the world.

Title: CEO Talks: Jamie Salter on Building Authentic Brands Into a $32 Billion Juggernaut Over 15 Years

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The founder and chief executive officer of the brand management and entertainment firm expects to transition to executive chairman in around two years. Senior Editor, Men's Jamie Salter has come a long way in the past 15 years. The 62-year-old Toronto native started his career in sports marketing and was the cofounder of Ride snowboards in the early 1990s. After that company went public, he and Fanatics’ founder and executive chairman Michael Rubin created Global Sports Inc., which eventually became GSI Commerce. Once he exited that business, Salter turned his attention to licensing, cofounding Hilco Consumer Capital. After a difference of opinion with Hilco’s majority owner, he partnered with Leonard Green and created Authentic Brands Group. Related Articles Shoe Industry News Puma Shares Seesaw on Authentic Brands Group Takeover Speculation Fashion Features WWD's 115 Newsmakers: S to Z Today, Authentic has amassed a portfolio that encompasses more than 50 brands including Reebok, Brooks Brothers and Champion that generate annual retail sales of $32 billion globally. The addition of Guess by early year will bring that number to $38 billion. But that’s not good enough for Salter, whose goal is to reach $100 billion in sales within the next five years by purchasing brands that have sales of more than $1 billion with global expansion potential while also expanding his reach in the entertainment and hospitality sectors. You May Also Like Authentic, which is on track to post 7 percent organic growth from its brands this year, now has headquarters in New York, London and Shanghai and offices in Los Angeles, Miami, Tokyo and South Korea. It counts 1,800 licensing partners globally, and its licensees operate 16,000 stores and 29,000 shops-in-shop around the world. The group is by far the largest of what is a new wave of brand management companies, which are rewriting the fashion and retail landscape in the U.S. by snapping up brand seemingly every week. While it’s a model that first emerged in the U.S. almost 50 years ago, Authentic and the likes of WHP Global, Bluestar and Marquee Brands are now taking it to another level. Here, Salter talks about his journey, how he’s built Authentic and his plans to pass the reins to the newly named president, Matt Maddox, within the next two years. WWD: How has the licensing model evolved since you started 15 years ago? Jamie Salter: It’s dramatically different. When we came into the business, Iconix was really the prize in the industry. It was doing DTR [direct-to-retail] with big retailers, and it was very item driven and category specific. When I looked at the business back then, I always asked the question, “Why don’t they sell home and shoes and whatever?” Well, it wasn’t because they didn’t want to, but they had a DTR [strategy]. So I said, OK, I know they’re doing really well, but that’s not going to work for us. We have to have another angle on how can we do well in the licensing business. So we took a different approach. WWD: And what was that? J.S.: Our approach was we’re going to go after wholesalers, and we’re going to do it by category and by territory, and they’re going to have to sell into retailers. That was very different from what Iconix was doing. So you could say we got lucky, or you could say we’re smart. I would say it’s probably a little bit of both. But what it really proved to me was you could actually grow the businesses so much bigger. WWD: Was there a downside? J.S.: You could argue our model was more expensive to run than a traditional licensing model, because we had to put a lot of money from the royalties that we were collecting into marketing. In the beginning, we weren’t putting enough into the marketing side of the business, but we learned very early on — when my partner Nick [Woodhouse] came into the business — that we really had to spend money on marketing. But we couldn’t afford it. It was hard. WWD: But I assume you decided to make the investment? J.S.: I met a guy named Adam Kronengold who is still with me today. He’s our chief digital officer. He was one of our first employees and in his interview, he asked me how many social media followers I had. I said, “What do you mean? Me? Jamie Salter?” He said, “No, not you, your company.” I said, “I don’t really understand the question.” So he goes on Instagram and says, “You don’t have an account.” This is in 2010, and he said, “Marilyn Monroe has an account. She has 250,000 followers. You know you can talk to people, post stuff and market.” I said, “How much does that cost?” He says, “It’s free. You can put up a post, send your message and tell people where Marilyn Monroe is being sold. You can do whatever you want. It’s your channel.” WWD: Guess he convinced you. J.S.: I asked him how Instagram made money and he said it didn’t make a lot then, but their whole strategy was to get everybody on social media and eventually turn it into an advertising platform. I said, “I like free — you’re hired.” So we were one of the very early adopters in the social media world. I think that is really the base of Authentic Brands — we really built the company like a tech start-up. Here we are 15 years after and we’re still like a start-up in the way we think. We’re always on the cusp of what’s next. WWD: How do you differ from the other brand management companies you compete with today like WHP Global, Marquee Brands and Bluestar? J.S.: We welcome competition, and we want them to do well, because if they do well, it’s good for us. But everyone builds a niche for themselves. WHP is using the Iconix/Sequential playbook and they’ve transitioned from that a little bit. I think Yehuda [Shmidman, WHP’s chief executive officer] learned some good hard lessons through his experience there and he’s building a pretty good platform [at WHP]. But scale matters now in this business because of the money you have to spend in order to build these brands and keep them relevant in the marketplace. We have a big international platform and nobody else really has that. But where we’re really separate from them is that we have 80 people in the marketing department today, we have 700 million social media followers — that’s 10 percent of the people that live on the planet. We’re on TikTok and WeChat and Instagram and Red Note — we’re on every platform around the globe. We have social media influencers in 150 different languages. WWD: Is that why you’re often always the first call when a brand is for sale? J.S.: If you have an opportunity to partner with Authentic versus Bluestar versus WHP, you’re going to partner with Authentic if it’s the same economics, just because it’s a much bigger platform. We can actually pay more because our platform is so efficient. And we can run businesses more efficiently because of our sheer size. WWD: You swooped in at the last minute to buy Guess even though WHP already had a deal. What happened there? J.S.: They always say anything’s for sale for the right price. But that’s just not true. [Guess cofounder] Paul Marciano was looking for a partner and unless he got the best deal for his shareholders, he would never have sold the company. So he’s selling 51 percent to us, and the family [with CEO Carlos Alberini] will own other 49 percent. Relationships matter, strategy matters, legacy matters. Paul’s last name is on the door. Look at LVMH: the family is all involved in the business and I think that’s why it’s such an incredible company. They learned from their father and they care — the legacy lives on. My name is on the door too — Authentic is the Salters. My family will be involved with Authentic Brands forever, I hope. WWD: All four of your sons are in the business, right? J.S.: Yes. And at some point, Jamie Salter will have to hang up the skates as I get older. WWD: In January, you brought in Matt Maddox, the former CEO of Wynn Resorts, as president. What is his role? J.S.: He worked with Steve Wynn for 22 years and for the last four or five years, was CEO of Wynn Properties. Everyone asked me why I didn’t hire someone from the fashion business. Look, we’re in the licensing business, which means we’re effectively a landlord. We buy these great brands, we fix them up, we market them and we rent out rooms. And the rooms happen to be shoes and socks and intimate apparel and home goods. And we do that by territory, by category. Matt understood the retail luxury space, because he has his own mall at the Wynn. He understood that he has to rent out his rooms every day. He has to market. He understood the entertainment business and events and celebrities and athletes. He has relationships with all these. We knew a lot of the same people and were partners with the Wynn through our live events division. WWD: Sounds like a good match. J.S.: Matt was offered some of the biggest jobs in the United States and initially he said no to me [when I offered him the job]. I asked him why and he said, “I’ve looked at your business. It’s working really well. You’re doing an incredible job. You’re not going anywhere. You don’t need me.” So I called Steve [Wynn] and told him he had to convince Matt to take the job. He did and we hired Matt. WWD: What are your ultimate plans for Matt? J.S.: I made a commitment to Matt that he would become the CEO of the company in the next two years. I will move to executive chairman. And you know, people ask me, “Are you OK with that?” Well, I’m super excited. Matt is 49, he’s young, he’s beyond smart. He’s working incredibly well with the team. He’s working great with my children, which is really important to me. He’s mentoring my son, Corey, who, you know, I ultimately want one day to run the company with his brothers. But I’ve got an incredible partner in Matt, who I believe will lead Authentic to $100 billion. WWD: The business community is filled with founders who find they can’t actually step aside when they turn over the reins to someone else. Why is this different? J.S.: Like I told Matt, I’m not going anywhere. But we’ve got to stay young; we’ve got to stay nimble. He understands the loyalty side of the business better than me because they had a big loyalty program at the Wynn. He understands the digital side of the business. He’s doing an unbelievable job upgrading Authentic on the process side. And if we do decide to go public over the next year or two, he’ll be an excellent CEO that the Street can rely on. I’m excited to just continue doing what I’m really good at, which is building great relationships around the world and working on the M&A side, and I have a great partner in Matt to run the day-to-day. WWD: Sounds like hiring someone from outside the fashion industry is working out for you. J.S.: I’m a big believer in hiring outside the industry — not that we don’t hire inside the industry, because we still need merchants and great marketing people. But if you really look at Authentic, the average age here is about 35. And they come out of the digital space, the legal space, the finance system. Authentic is a big marketing department, a big legal department, a big digital department. So, we’re hiring people from Meta and Google and Microsoft and Amazon. You still need merchants to touch and feel and make great product, because you can have the greatest digital team and the greatest marketing team but if don’t have good product, then it doesn’t work. But at the end of the day, data is everything. WWD: What do you look for when you’re hiring people? J.S.: When you’re hot, you attract great talent. When I’m hiring someone, the first question I ask is, can AI do this job? If the answer is no, the second question is: is that person smarter than you? And we’re a loyal group, so if you’re really good, you’re going to be here forever. But Authentic is not for everyone. Do not come here if you’re looking for a 9-to-5 job because we work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We’re a global company, so we’re always working. With the globalization of the world, the internet, social media, the news cycles and staying ahead of trends and culture, you always have to be on. WWD: You also have other components to your business beyond brand management. J.S.: Yes. Twenty-five percent of the platform is entertainment. [Our competitors] don’t have an entertainment business. And entertainment, in my opinion, drives fashion culture. The entertainment business is really music culture and sports culture, which is where we have a big edge. The other 75 percent of our turnover is rooted in the lifestyle space. WWD: How do you evolve the company going forward, where are the opportunities? J.S.: We think we’re just scratching the surface. I know people think that’s kind of crazy with a business that has about $32 billion in annual retail systemwide sales. But we think we can be about $100 billion within the next five years. It’s not as crazy as you think when we pull off deals like Guess, which does $6 billion at retail. There are lots of other brands that are in that $1 billion to $10 billion range that we could buy. And we really, truly believe that we will crack those opportunities. Over the next five years, we’ll do another four or five big deals and that’s another $50 billion. This year alone, and the year is not over, we added almost $7 billion in revenue. WWD: You were close to going public a couple of years ago and then decided against it. Are you revisiting the idea? J.S.: Authentic is a very different model. We trade like a tech company because we are a tech company. Think about it. When you have 75 percent margin, 99 percent cash conversion and virtually no capex, you trade like a software company. So could we be public? The answer is yes. Should we be public? I don’t know. There’s no need to be. Why is SpaceX not public? It doesn’t need to be. We trade at a very high multiple; we have 36 percent growth in the company. We’re low levered. We took our first money from Leonard Green in 2010 and the company has been self-funded since then. WWD: But you have other investors including General Atlantic, BlackRock, CVC Capital Partners, Simon Property Group and Brookfield, among others. J.S.: True. There’s been $9 billion of secondaries in the last three years, but that’s just one shareholder selling to a new buyer. There’s been no need for investment from outside. We actually just bought $1 billion of stock back and retired the shares, so the company’s very flush with cash. WWD: A lot of the brands you buy are distressed. Is that what you look for? J.S.: The brands aren’t necessarily distressed, the companies are. Reebok wasn’t a bad brand. Adidas just wasn’t putting the effort into one of the greatest athletic brands in the world. Their focus was on building Adidas. They milked Reebok as far as they possibly could, and they didn’t need it anymore. We’ve owned Reebok now for a couple years and we’ve almost doubled the business. We still have lots of work to do, but Reebok is a $6 billion business and our ambition is to grow to a $10 billion business over the next three years — and we feel very confident we’re going to get there. WWD: So what is the criteria you use when exploring a purchase? J.S.: A good brand but a broken business. Champion wasn’t broken but Hanes needed liquidity. Truth be told, I spoke to Gildan before we bought Champion. I said, “Let’s go buy Hanes together. I’ll take Champion. You take Hanes.” We ended up buying Champion. They ended up buying Hanes, which is interesting. We could have done the deal together. Anyway, our model is to license by category, by territory, to best-in-class partners. So you get the best underwear-maker, you get the best sock-maker, you get the best sportswear-maker. It means the business grows much quicker. But we have to unwind the overhead so we can run these companies much more efficiently. People always say, “When you buy a company, all the jobs go away.” It’s not true — lots of new jobs are created. When we look at our portfolio, I would say that probably 75 percent of the jobs either stay or new jobs are created. So maybe people lose their jobs in California, but there are new jobs in New York, and it’s more efficient. WWD: Where do you see the growth coming from in the future? J.S.: Entertainment and kids’ animation. Those are two really big areas for us. We believe entertainment really does drive lifestyle. So we’re going to continue to drive that. And when I say the kids’ space, think Disney, think Mattel, that type of stuff. And with Matt’s background, we’re moving into the hospitality business. We’ve done multiple deals now for hotels and condos. We have the Barneys hotel. We have Sports Illustrated resorts, we have Eddie Bauer lodges. We have Nautica condos going up in Mexico. Our hospitality business is bigger than you would think. Also, beauty. Our beauty business is over a couple billion dollars today, but there’s big opportunity there. And you’re going to see us do more deals like David Beckham and Shaq. WWD: Speaking of Beckham and Shaquille O’Neal, neither of them has been playing for a while. And you also own the rights to Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe, who are dead. J.S.: We don’t call them dead — they’re icons, and with AI coming into play, Marilyn Monroe is going to be on fire in 2026, which is her 100th anniversary [of her birth]. We’ve done an enormous number of deals around Marilyn Monroe. And don’t be surprised if you see her in movies again. And look at what’s going on with Elvis Presley. There was the movie and we now have an immersive theater production, Elvis Evolution, at the 02 in London. WWD: But how do you appeal to young people who don’t know Elvis and never saw Shaq or David Beckham play? J.S.: Shaq has never been bigger — no pun intended. Shaq’s business is 10 times as big as when we partnered with him in 2015. And David Beckham‘s business has doubled since we joined forces Now, we’ve only been working on David’s business for a couple years — Shaq’s we’ve owned much longer. I’m not going to say live celebrities are better, but there are bigger opportunities than if they’re not with us anymore. WWD: Let’s talk about the Authentic Luxury Group. Can you explain what that is and how it’s working? J.S.: ALG is a joint venture between Saks Global and us that licenses the IP of the Saks brands and select Authentic premium brands. Richard [Baker, executive chairman of Saks Global] has had a bit of a bumpy road. He is a total optimist and a great visionary, but he needs to prove to the world that financially, he’s set up properly. It seems he’s on the right track now but we’re going to continue to be careful. We’re going to continue to build the affordable luxury — or premium — side of our business. Luxury is a word you have to be careful with. LVMH is luxury, Kering is luxury, Prada is luxury. Vince is premium, Brooks Brothers is premium, Hugo Boss is premium. We’ll continue to play in the premium space in a big way, because it’s the next level from where we are today. We have the full support of Saks, Neiman’s and Amazon, because that’s the joint venture, and we’ll fully support Richard and his journey. But we’re going to be careful. WWD: Are you still looking to buy Marc Jacobs? J.S.: I can’t really comment on that. What I will tell you is we will continue to look at companies in that space, like Marc Jacobs, and we’ll see where it goes. WWD: Let’s talk about the whole department store and retail space where you have a lot of partners. It’s not easy out there. J.S.: We have to go where the customers go. If T.J. Maxx is a winner, we’ve got to sell them. if Burlington, Target and Walmart are winners, we’ve got to sell them. The consumption is the same as it was a year ago — people aren’t buying any less product. They’re just buying from different places. So we continue to go where the customers go, and that’s really been our model. We think independent retailers, or omnichannel retailers like Lucky or Brooks Brothers, are actually important to building these brands. It’s tough, but it’s important to the model. Today, we have about 6,000 licensed full-price/outlet stores around the globe. And then there are another 24,000 shops-in-shop. So when you really look at our portfolio, half of our volume is done through stores that have our name above the door, and that’s a big investment. It’s going to take a long time before Kohl’s and JCPenney and Macy’s are not here anymore. But they’ve got to continue to reinvent themselves. Great retailers survive. Look at Harrods: it’s packed wall-to-wall all the time. WWD: Why do you think that is? J.S.: It may be the model: a department store made up of all concessions. It doesn’t matter what concession [shop] you go into, one’s better than the next one — they’re all just amazing. Take food: you can’t just have a food hall anymore, you have to have restaurants. Look at David Simon [head of Simon Properties]: everyone asks why his stock is so high. It’s because he reinvents himself all the time. He never gets stale. So when you go into a Simon mall, it’s busier than everyone else’s because he’s constantly looking at the best brands and reshuffling things. I don’t think the mall is dead. I think the mall is very alive — if you’re in the right malls. And I don’t think the department store is dead. It just needs to be reinvented. Now, are we over-retailed in America? The answer is yes. That’s why going online is critical. If you want to be in this business, you’ve got to go where the customers go. WWD: There’s a lot of criticism about the licensing model. Why are you so enamored with it? J.S.: There are two types of licensing. One really comes out of the animation business. Look at Disney: it’s the greatest company in the world. And what do they do? They make movies. They make TV shows. Then they have the parks where they sell you a lot of merchandise. I’ve got that same attitude. Authentic has content and experiences and if we continue to do that, we can license our brands and be successful. If you’re just brand slapping and there’s no meat behind it, I think you will die a slow death. You have to treat your brands like your children. You can’t give them back. If you don’t constantly maintain your brands, you’re not going to win. And I think that’s where licensing gets a bad reputation. Disney has done an unbelievable job — we think they’re the best of the best of the best. They’re number one, we’re number two, and they’re way above us. But we’re working hard every single day to continue to make this a better place. Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: Ethereum spot ETFs see record $795 mln outflows: What’s going on?

Are investors turning cautious, or is a bigger trend unfolding in crypto markets? The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) experienced the largest outflows at over $362 million, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA fund, with more than $200 million exiting. Ethereum traded at $3,990.17, down 0.58% on the day and 10.78% over the past week, reflecting short-term market volatility. Ethereum [ETH] has been making headlines recently, not just for its price movements, but also due to heightened network activity that has drawn investor attention. Yet, despite the buzz, spot Ethereum ETFs faced a historic drain last week, recording their largest weekly outflows on record. Data from Farside Investors shows that for the week ending the 26th of September, these ETFs saw $795.6 million in outflows amid a trading volume surpassing $10 billion. The ETFs just edged out the previous notable week of the 5th of September, which saw $787.7 million exit the funds. BlackRock’s industry-leading ETHA fund saw more than $200 million exit, even though the fund still manages over $15.2 billion in assets. Meanwhile, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), the third-largest Ethereum ETF by assets under management, experienced the largest outflows among its peers, with over $362 million pulled during the same period. Grayscale’s ETHE also reported notable withdrawals, highlighting a broader trend of investor caution in the Ethereum market. The outflows coincided with Ethereum’s price slipping below the $4,000 mark, trading at $3,990.17, down 0.58% on the day and 10.78% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. The retreat in ETF flows mirrors the wider market sentiment, as investors appeared to pull back amid short-term volatility. Weekly outflows across available Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs totaled $902.5 million, with Fidelity’s FBTC leading the pack in withdrawals. Bitcoin itself traded at $109,352.01, reflecting a modest daily decline of 0.02% and a 5.53% drop over the week, according to CoinMarketCap. This coincided with the SEC has postponing decisions on multiple crypto ETF and staking applications, pushing review deadlines into late October and mid-November. Major issuers, including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, 21Shares, and Grayscale, are among those affected. Yet, despite these delays, market optimism remains, with Ripple [XRP] Futures reaching record highs and new filings emerging, such as VanEck’s proposed Spot Hyperliquid ETF and the first U.S.-based Dogecoin [DOGE] ETF.

A MAN WHO has spent forty years tending to the graves of the only two victims of the Air India disaster who were left unclaimed has been honoured by an Indian cultural group in Cork. All 329 passengers and crew on board Air India flight 182 were killed on June 23rd, 1985 when a bomb exploded on board the aircraft as it cruised some 190km off the south west coast of Ireland on route from Montreal to Delhi. The flight was brought down off the coast of Cork. It remains the worst aviation disaster in Irish and Canadian history. Most of the dead were of Indian descent. Annu Alexandra, who was originally from Kerala in India, and her daughter Rena were among the victims. The bodies of her husband and son were never recovered. Finbarr Archer, who is the official driver to the Lord Mayor of Cork city, was working for an undertaker at the time of the terrorist attack. He was tasked with documenting details of the 132 bodies which were recovered. He realised there was nobody left to claim the bodies of Annu and Rena. Mother and daughter were subsequently buried together in a single grave in St Michael’s Cemetery in Blackrock in Cork city. Advertisement Along with tending to their grave Mr Archer organises an annual commemorative ceremony at the cemetery to coincide with the anniversary of the Air India disaster. Cork Sarbojonin Durgotsab (CSD) yesterday presented its first-ever Shamrock Lotus Award, to Mr Archer citing his “extraordinary compassion, humanity, and service to society.” “This award recognises his decades-long devotion in caring for the grave of an Indian mother and daughter lost in the Air India Flight 182 tragedy, reflecting unwavering dedication, compassion, and humanity that inspire our entire Indian community. “His actions embody the spirit of selfless service, community bonding and the profound impact one individual can have in honouring others. “May this award, uniting the shamrock of Ireland and the lotus of India, forever remind us that kindness knows no borders and remembrance has no end.” Meanwhile, on 23 June some sixty relatives of the victims were among those who attended a ceremony in Ahakista in West Cork to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Air India crash. A remembrance ceremony takes places annually in the village of Ahakista which is the nearest point on land to the crash site. Following the ceremony, family members laid wreaths at a monument which bears the names of all those who died. The plane crash led to the biggest search and recovery operation ever mounted by the State.

Title: Cork man who tended graves of Air India 1985 terror victims honoured by Indian community

A Cork man has been honoured by the Indian community for tending to the graves, for 40 years, of the only two victims of the Air India disaster to be buried in Ireland following the terrorist attack which claimed the lives of 329 people off the Irish coast in 1985. Finbarr Archer was described as “a light of kindness in Ireland” at a presentation by the Cork Sarbojonin Durgotsab (CSD) for his work tending the graves of Annu and Rena Alexandra who died in the tragedy. Mr Archer, who now works as the official driver to the Lord Mayor of Cork, was working with O’Sullivans Undertakers in Cork in 1985 and was tasked with documenting the details of the 132 bodies that were recovered from the sea off the southwest coast. When he discovered that there was no one to claim the bodies of Annu Alexandra and her young daughter, Rena, as her husband and son also perished in the bomb attack, Mr Archer arranged for their bodies to be buried together in a single grave at St Michael’s Cemetery in Blackrock, Cork. Since the burial, for the past 40 years, Mr Archer has tended the grave and organised commemorations each June 23rd to mark the anniversary of the Air India atrocity. This weekend, he was honoured for his work by the Indian community in Cork as part of their Hindu Durga Puja celebrations. The CSD, a group that celebrates members of the Indian community in Cork, held a special ceremony on Saturday in which they presented Mr Archer with its first ever Shamrock Lotus Award. Speaking at the presentation, Nivedita Basu, of CSD, said: “Today we salute and are honoured to recognise Finbarr Archer, whose gentle care and remembrance for the family of Annu Alexander, lost in the Air India Flight 182 tragedy for four decades, have been a light of kindness in Ireland. [ Cathy Dillon: A reporter remembers the Air India Disaster of June 23rd, 1985Opens in new window ] “This award recognises Finbarr’s decades-long devotion in caring for the grave of an Indian mother and daughter lost in the Air India Flight 182 tragedy, reflecting unwavering dedication, compassion, and humanity that inspire our entire Indian community. “With no family here to take Annu and her little daughter, Rena, Finbarr stepped forward and gave them a resting place in Blackrock and for 40 years he has cared for the grave, holding memorials and keeping their memory alive so even though far from home, they are never forgotten. “His actions embody the spirit of selfless service, community bonding and the profound impact one individual can have in honouring others. May this award, uniting the shamrock of Ireland and the lotus of India, forever remind us that kindness knows no borders and remembrance has no end.” Accepting the award from Cllr Dan Boyle, deputising for Lord Mayor of Cork, Cllr Fergal Dennehy, Mr Archer said he was deeply humbled by the honour but all he was endeavouring to do was ensure that Annu and Rena and their other family members lost in Air India would not be forgotten. [ Victims of Air India bombing remembered at dignified 40th anniversary ceremony in CorkOpens in new window ] “It’s deeply humbling and a great honour to be here and to remember Rena and her mother, Alexander – it’s something that I’ve done since they were buried in Blackrock – every year the emergency services involved in Air India gather to remember them so they will never be forgotten. “They may rest now far from India, but they are not far from home, they are with us, and they are with the people of Cork and with the Indian community - I would like to thank too all the emergency service personnel who come every year for the memorial to remember Annu and Rena.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Big Tech’s hunger for energy draws private equity to utilities

Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI. Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines. “The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance. Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT , Brown said. BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.” “We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy" and energy, Fink said. In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co. Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9 percent stake in the utility to Blackstone. However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share . Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies. Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes. “It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources. big tech, Ukraine said on Tuesday that a Russian overnight drone strike had killed a family of four in the northeastern Sumy region.

Title: ‘Regrets over delay’ – Vanguard to offer crypto ETFs to 50M investors

Client FOMO has forced Vanguard to rethink crypto ETF ban Client demand for crypto ETF access reportedly drove the shift, forcing Vanguard to adapt and open its brokerage platform to third-party products. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Balchunas, it will be positive for the sector. Vanguard, a $10 trillion asset manager, is reportedly planning to offer access to crypto ETFs after distancing itself from the industry since 2024. According to a former Fox Business reporter, Eleanor Terret, the firm is planning to allow clients access to third-party crypto ETFs. The world’s largest mutual fund and second-biggest asset manager will enable access through its brokerage platform. Gerald Gallagher, General Counsel at Sei Labs, confirmed the Vanguard plans, citing a senior insider familiar with the issue. He added that the asset manager had “regrets” and wished they had done it “sooner.” Gallagher noted that the firm will not do original crypto ETF issuance but will offer access to third-party providers due to client demand. By contrast, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the pivot was expected. He previously predicted that the new Vanguard CEO, Salim Ramji, who spearheaded BlackRock’s Bitcoin [BTC] ETF, would accept crypto. He added that it was “smart of them” to end the Bitcoin ETF ban. “Smart of them imo. Bitcoin and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs hugely popular, and Salim (the CEO) was one of IBIT’s midwives, so he knows.” Source: X As of September, BlackRock crypto holdings were worth about $100 billion. Its Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), had over $85B worth of assets at current market prices. Overall, the world’s largest asset manager was earning about $250 million in revenue from its crypto section, surpassing its equity business line. Source: X Fidelity was the second-largest crypto ETF player, with about $25 billion in net crypto assets under management. That being said, the details on Vanguard crypto ETF plans will be known in the near future. But the impact will be positive for the market, added Balchunas. “Vanguard has 50 million investors. Obviously, many are not the bitcoin type, but that’s massive; they are the biggest fund company in the US by two times over.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Analyst Predicts Solana Staking ETFs To Be Approved For Trading Within Two Weeks — Is $300 SOL Next Stop?
URL: https://zycrypto.com/analyst-predicts-solana-staking-etfs-to-be-approved-for-trading-within-two-weeks-is-300-sol-next-stop/

Multiple applications for Solana (SOL) staking exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are poised to secure the regulatory nod from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the coming weeks. In a recent post on the X social media platform, Nate Geraci, the president of NovaDius Wealth Management, pointed out that on Friday, asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, Grayscale Investments, VanEck, Canary Capital, Bitwise, and Fidelity, all submitted revised S-1 registration statements for their spot SOL ETFs to the SEC to clarify details around their staking activity. Fidelity, which manages the second-largest spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund by assets under management, will stake a portion of its SOL holdings to generate yield, according to its updated filing. According to Geraci, this flurry of SOL applications, which include a staking component, is likely to receive US approval by mid-October. “Guessing these are approved w/in next two weeks,” he stated. The ETF analyst further suggested that the inclusion of staking in the SOL filings “bodes well for spot ETH staking.” Notably, BlackRock, which is the undisputed leader of the U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, has not yet submitted paperwork to list its own spot SOL fund. REX Shares and Osprey launched the first-ever Solana staking ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange in July after securing automatic approval under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The SOL fund attracted $12 million worth of investments in its Wall Street debut and currently boasts assets under management of around $301 million, signaling considerable demand for Solana ETFs. Additionally, Hashdex recently added Solana, Cardano, and Ripple’s XRP to its Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, alongside the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) it already held. The regulator also greenlighted a similar multi-crypto fund from Grayscale, giving investors exposure to several assets, including SOL. Solana was trading hands at around $201.61 as of press time, largely flat over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The token’s price has fallen 31.2% since hitting its current all-time high of $293.31 in January, not long after the historic introduction of U.S. President Donald Trump’s SOL-based meme coin. With the US SEC approval almost certain, SOL’s path to the coveted $300 milestone heavily relies on capturing significant ETF inflows and maintaining steady accumulation from Solana treasury firms.

Title: Bitcoin Trails Equities, Metals, and USD in Q3. Here Is a Key Level to Watch for Next Move

BTC$112,884.24 just ended what is historically the largest cryptocurrency's third-worst week of the year with a greater-than-average drop of 5%. Week 38 effectively closes out the third quarter, which is up about 1%, as well as September, which has managed to hold flat. While the figures are consistent with the period's historical reputation as one of the weakest seasons of the year, a few catalysts might have contributed to the underperformance. On Friday, more than $17 billion in options expired, with the max pain price — the strike price at which option holders lose the most money and options writers profit the most — sitting at $110,000, which acted as a gravitational center for the spot price. A key technical factor remains the short-term holder cost basis at $110,775, which reflects the average on-chain acquisition price for coins that moved in the past six months. Bitcoin tested this level in August, and in bull markets, it typically moves toward this line multiple times. This year, it broke significantly below that level only once: during the tariff tantrum in April, when it dropped to as low as $74,500. Zooming out, it is important to assess whether bitcoin remains in an uptrend characterized by higher highs and higher lows to get an idea of whether the rally is sustainable. Analyst Caleb Franzen highlights that bitcoin has slipped below its 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), with the 200-day EMA sitting at $106,186. The previous significant low was around $107,252 on Sept. 1, and for the broader trend to remain intact, bitcoin will need to hold above that level., The U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 3.8% in the second quarter, well above the 3.3% estimate and the strongest performance since the second quarter of 2023. Initial jobless claims dropped by 14,000 to 218,000, coming in below expectations and marking the lowest level since mid-July. While spending data came in line with the market's expectation. The US core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of underlying inflation that excludes food and energy, rose 0.2% in August 2025 from the prior month. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries bounced off the 4% support, and is now trading near 4.2%. The dollar index (DXY) continues to hover around long-term support at 98. Meanwhile, metals are leading the action, with silver at around $45 approaching an all-time high at levels last seen in 1980 and 2011. U.S. equities, in the meantime, are just shy of their records. Bitcoin remains the outlier at more than 10% below its peak. Bitcoin treasury companies continue to face severe multiple-to-net-asset-value (mNAV) compression. Strategy (MSTR) is barely positive year-to-date. At one point, it dipped below $300, a negative return for 2025. The ratio between Strategy and BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) stands at 4.8, the lowest since October 2024, which shows just how much the largest bitcoin treasury company has underperformed bitcoin over the past 12 months. Strategy’s enterprise mNAV is currently 1.44 (as of Friday). Enterprise value here accounts for all basic shares outstanding, total notional debt and total notional value of perpetual preferred stock minus the company’s cash balance. The silver lining for MSTR is that three of the four perpetual preferred stocks, STRK, STRC and STRF, are all sporting positive lifetime returns as Executive Chairman Michael Saylor looks to buy more BTC through these vehicles. A growing issue for MSTR is the lack of volatility in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency's Implied volatility — a measure of the market’s expectation of future price fluctuations — has dropped below 40, the lowest in years. This matters because Saylor has often framed MSTR as a volatility play on bitcoin. For comparison, MSTR’s implied volatility is at 68. Its annualized standard deviation of daily log returns over the past year was 89%, while over the last 30 days it has fallen to 49%. For equities, higher volatility often attracts speculators, generates trading opportunities and draws investor attention, so the decline is likely acting as a headwind. Meantime, the fifth-largest bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet (3350), holds 25,555 BTC and still has roughly $500 million left to deploy from its international offering. Despite this, its share price continues to struggle at 517 yen ($3.45), more than 70% below its all-time high. Metaplanet’s mNAV has dropped to 1.12, down sharply from 8.44 in June. Its market capitalization now stands at $3.94 billion compared to a bitcoin NAV of $2.9 billion, with an average BTC acquisition cost of $106,065.

Title: Crypto’s Quiet Mainstreaming This Year

ByAlex Lazarow, Senior Contributor. For years, the crypto headlines have vacillated between hype (coin X is breaking out!) and gloom (but limited real-world adoption is nil). Quietly, the industry has migrated from speculation, into becoming the real plumbing of global finance. In this piece, I wanted to highlight three key developments that are harbingers of change to come. BlackRock already has a tokenized U.S. treasury vehicle with over $1b in assets. This makes it the largest tokenized firm of its kind. But to me, that’s not the big news. Blackrock is reportedly looking to tokenize its ETFs. This would change how ETFs are traded. It would allow them to be traded 24/7 – and represent an explosion in relevant assets. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was blunt: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing.” Robinhood is making similar moves, launching both tokenized versions of stocks and ETFs over the summer. Interestingly, it includes those of private companies like OpenAI or SpaceX. The market for tokenized assets already grew 85% last year to $15 billion (excluding stablecoins). McKinsey estimates tokenized markets could reach $2 trillion by 2030. The World Economic Forum projects tokenization could represent 10% of global GDP as soon as 2027. Tokenization is moving from fringe experimentation, into a likely mainstay of some of the world’s largest asset managers. Stablecoins represent more than $250 billion in value today. More than 500 million wallets now hold stablecoins, with emerging markets driving much of that growth. While in the past crypto wallets were for speculation, many use cases today are mainstay financial services across treasury, settlements, cross-border payments. For corporates, they enable instant settlement with transparency. For banks, they radically reduce counterparty risk. For investors, they provide stability in volatile markets. And for consumers in emerging markets, stablecoins offer a way to escape currency depreciation. In countries like Argentina, Nigeria, and Turkey, inflation and currency volatility erode savings. Apps like Dollar App are building on top of stablecoins to allow users to save and spend in US dollars. Fintechs And Central Banks Are Building Their Own Rails Making headlines of course are fintech players. For example, Stripe is incubating Tempo, a new Layer-1 blockchain designed for payments. Its design partners include Visa, Deutsche Bank, Shopify, Revolut, Nubank, DoorDash, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Stripe has also spent over a billion dollars acquiring stablecoin infrastructure — including its $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge (Fintech Futures). Circle, Visa, and others are experimenting with proprietary blockchains to reduce costs and accelerate settlement. More quietly, but likely far more transformative are central bank actions. One hundred and thirty-seven countries, representing 98% of global GDP, are now exploring central bank digital currencies. Seventy-two are in advanced development or pilot stages. In Nigeria, the eNaira doubled to 10 million active users in 2024. In India, the e-rupee in circulation grew 334% in a year, exceeding $120 million by Q1 2025. As governments adopt digital money, banks, fintechs and corporates will likely follow. Whereas much of this innovation was once the viewed as fantasy, it is increasingly becoming mainstream. The U.S. passed the Genius act. Europe passed the MiCA framework for digital assets. But it has happened slowly and now seemingly all at once.

Title: Are Whales and Institutional Players Still Bullish on Bitcoin? — Here’s What Market Data Says‬

Large investors and institutional players are quietly increasing their Bitcoin exposure, even as the broader market remains stagnant. New data from the Coinbase Premium Index reveals that the measure has remained positive since April, indicating that U.S. institutions and whale accounts on Coinbase Pro continue to purchase at a faster pace than retail traders elsewhere. The index, which tracks price differences between Coinbase and exchanges such as Binance, has long been seen as a barometer for institutional demand. The momentum is closely tied to the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Coinbase acts as both a custody and pricing partner for several of the funds, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity, meaning ETF inflows are now directly reflected in this institutional premium. On-chain analyst Darkfost noted the trend on X, stressing that “whales and institutions are still accumulating BTC today.” He cautioned, however, that past cycles show how quickly sentiment can turn if euphoria builds unchecked. The Federal Reserve’s latest quarter-point rate cut appears to have sparked additional activity. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin open interest on Binance increased by 4.7% in the 24 hours following the decision, rising from $12.8 billion to $13.4 billion. Given Binance’s outsized share of global derivatives trading, analysts say the increase is a reliable signal of renewed appetite among high-volume traders. Many cryptocurrencies typically gain momentum during easing cycles since lower rates encourage risk-taking. The surge in open interest suggests that institutional traders are anticipating potential upside, complementing the steady accumulation already evident on Coinbase. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Bitcoin commands a 57.1% share of the total cryptocurrency market, with an overall capitalization of $4.04 trillion at the time of writing. These figures are supported by a balanced market sentiment, even as whales expand their holdings. Whether that institutional support will be enough to push Bitcoin through resistance in the weeks ahead may depend less on short-term sentiment and more on how investors digest the Fed’s policy path.

RELATED STORY | As electric bills rise, evidence mounts that data centers share blame Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said. BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.” “We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy" and energy, Fink said.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power. Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies. Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes. “It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources. The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers. Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.” That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations. That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say. About Scripps News

Title: How Ripple’s XRP Can Help Address The Global Debt Crisis, According To Black Swan Capitalist Founder

The founder of Black Swan Capitalist believes that XRP, which spent years fighting the US Securities and Exchange Commission in court, could play a pivotal role in solving the global debt crisis by restructuring the financial system. Black Swan Capitalist founder Versan Aljarrah took to the X social media platform to suggest that global debt cannot be repaid under current conditions and must first be restructured. The real solution, in his opinion, involves converting trillions into tokenized liquidity running on neutral assets such as Ripple-affiliated XRP, tokenized gold, and regulated stablecoins. Global debt can't be paid back. It has to be restructured.The real play is converting trillions into tokenized liquidity running on neutral assets like XRP, tokenized gold, and regulated stablecoins.Cycles reward those who prepare before the narrative, not after. pic.twitter.com/pEYIswQ9jd “Trillions in debt will be tokenized,” he asserted in a different post. “But only XRP can unlock the liquidity trapped inside.” Aljarrah’s remarks come as large swaths of institutions increasingly experiment with the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) on blockchain rails in the new era of programmable finance. Tokenization of RWAs is the process of converting ownership or rights to physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain or distributed ledger. This strategy leverages blockchain technology to convert tangible assets such as real estate, artwork, stocks, or commodities into digital tokens that can be conveniently bought, sold, and traded on-chain. These talks of XRP unlocking debt liquidity follow a report from the International Monetary Fund revealing that global debt currently stands at around $250 trillion (or 235% of GDP). An increase in public borrowing to nearly $100 trillion last year helped offset reductions in private sector debt. These figures underscore how tokenized liquidity could prove key in easing the overwhelming debt burden. Ripple is gaining traction in the burgeoning tokenization sector. DBS, Franklin Templeton, and Ripple have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on offering trading and lending solutions that leverage tokenized money market funds on the XRP Ledger blockchain and Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Moreover, the $740.4 million RLUSD stablecoin was recently integrated into a new smart contract on Securitize’s platform as an off-ramp option for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized money-market funds.

Vanguard, the world’s second-largest fund management company, has long stood firm on its old-fashioned anti-crypto stance. Back in January 2024, the company stated it would not offer cryptocurrency exposure to its clients, arguing that the assets were too volatile and incapable of generating sustainable long-term returns. This shift comes in response to strong client demand and an increasingly favorable regulatory environment around the crypto industry. Unlike BlackRock, which has launched its own crypto ETF, Vanguard has no immediate plans to roll out a fund of its own. Instead, its first step would be to allow clients access to third-party crypto ETFs. Read on as we uncover more about Vanguard’s future plans, as well as highlight the best altcoins to buy right now. Although Vanguard has openly criticized cryptocurrencies, it also happens to be the largest shareholder in Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR). Today, Strategy is hands down the largest corporate accumulator of Bitcoin, with 639,835 tokens in its kitty. Vanguard itself owns 20M shares in MicroStrategy, representing around 8% ownership. Adding to this, Vanguard appointed Salim Ramji as its CEO in July 2024. With 25 years of industry experience, Ramji was instrumental in launching BlackRock’s iBIT spot Bitcoin ETF while leading the firm’s global ETF business. His appointment was widely viewed as a signal that Vanguard might eventually pivot toward a more crypto-friendly stance. However, in August, the new CEO clarified that Vanguard had no immediate plans to launch any crypto ETFs. Still, while the company has shied away from direct crypto investment vehicles, there have always been subtle hints pointing in the opposite direction. With competitors like BlackRock leading the charge, Vanguard’s rigidity risks alienating pro-crypto investors. Perhaps that’s what has sparked its recent shift in mindset. With Vanguard finally stepping onto the crypto ship, there couldn’t be a better time to start building your own crypto portfolio. But simply stacking blue-chip digital assets won’t be enough; you’ll need to spot and invest in promising low-cap coins early. Here are our top 3 suggestions. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the first-ever Layer 2 solution for the Bitcoin blockchain designed to solve issues of Web3 compatibility, speed, and scalability. While Bitcoin is the face of the crypto industry, it still lags behind when it comes to innovation and adaptability. For example, Bitcoin can still only process around 7 transactions per second with a block time of 10 minutes. By contrast, Solana can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second. Bitcoin Hyper addresses this gap by integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), aka the same technology that powers Solana’s high throughput. This integration allows developers to build dApps and execute smart contracts directly on Bitcoin. The SVM uses parallel execution, meaning it can process multiple transactions simultaneously as long as they’re not related. While these transactions occur off-chain, you won’t have to compromise Bitcoin’s renowned Layer 1 security. Supporting this is a non-custodial canonical bridge that locks up your Layer 1 Bitcoin and mints an equivalent amount of Web3-compatible Layer 2 tokens. This utility-driven approach has already helped the $HYPER presale raise $18.5M. At present, 1 $HYPER costs just $0.012985, and based on our $HYPER price prediction, the token could reach $0.32 by the end of 2025, representing a potential 2,364% return. Interested? Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website to learn more about this new cryptocurrency project. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) powers a new content creation and sharing platform aiming to disrupt the $85B industry with innovation and transparency. Imagine spending hours conceptualizing, planning, shooting, and editing a piece of content, only for the platform to take 70% of your revenue in the name of platform and management fees. Infuriating, right? That’s why many content creators are shifting to SUBBD, which charges only a fraction of creators’ earnings as fees. In return, it offers a full suite of AI tools – voice generators, text, image, and video creators – to help produce engaging content. This frees up more time for creators to interact directly with fans and build loyal communities. But it’s not just creators who benefit from SUBBD. Holders of the $SUBBD token can access premium content, subscribe to their favorite creators, request personalized videos, and even send tips as tokens of appreciation. The $SUBBD presale is live and has already pulled in over $1.2M, with each token available for just $0.05652. Here’s how to buy $SUBBD. According to our $SUBBD price prediction, it could surge to $0.301 by the end of 2025, delivering a staggering 432% return on investment. For more details, check out SUBBD Token’s official website. MemeCore ($M) is an innovative Layer-1 blockchain that aims to change how investors perceive meme coins today. Even the best meme coins are often seen merely as fun, speculative assets – entertainment-driven cryptocurrencies that thrive on virality and on-chain activity with little to no utility. MemeCore challenges this by introducing a unique Proof-of-Meme (PoM) mechanism, built on the belief that every on-chain activity strengthens the network. It records and rewards all forms of participation, whether it’s creating and sharing memes, staking, or trading tokens. $M serves as the platform’s native currency, powering all on-chain transactions, gas fees, and reward distributions. On the technical front, MemeCore ($M) gave a strong breakout on September 4 when it broke past its long-term resistance at $1. After hitting an all-time high of $2.96 on September 18, the token is now trading at $2.33 with strong support at $2.12. While the broader crypto market pauses for breath, MemeCore too is consolidating nicely between $3 and $2.12. A breakout above its previous high could propel the token to a new peak of $4 in the coming weeks. Want in? Buy $M on BingX or any of the other crypto exchanges.

Title: 8 Years In Hiding—Now $3 Billion In Ether Comes Alive

A major Ethereum holder that had been quiet for years suddenly moved roughly 200,000 ETH Friday, worth about $800 million at current prices. Based on reports from on-chain trackers, the investor controls a total of 736,316 ETH spread across eight wallets — holdings that are now valued nearly $3 billion. The activity caught attention because several of those addresses had been inactive for years, making this one of the more notable returns by an early-era holder. According to blockchain observers, the transferred coins were not sent to trading venues. Instead, the funds were directed into new addresses tied to staking services, including Ethereum’s Plasma infrastructure, where assets can earn yield while remaining locked. Two wallets that have been dormant for over 8 years just woke up and moved 200K $ETH($785M) to 2 new addresses. This Ethereum OG originally sourced their $ETH primarily from #Bitfinex, currently holds a total of 736,316 $ETH($2.89B) across 8 wallets. Wallets:… pic.twitter.com/wVFzXZcL0o — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 26, 2025 Emmett Gallic, an analyst who flagged the movement, described the action as “bullish.” The choice to stake rather than sell has been noted by market watchers as a possible signal of long-term confidence in Ethereum’s prospects. Reports have disclosed that much of the ETH came from Bitfinex and mining pools active around 2017. Some of the wallets had last moved funds about four years ago; others had been dormant for over eight years. At the time those coins were last active, their combined worth was about $30 million. That figure contrasts sharply with today’s value, which approaches $3 billion, highlighting how much the asset has changed hands in value even for those who stayed put. Ethereum’s price was under stress when the whale reappeared. Based on market data, ETH dipped to $3,829 today, a low not seen since August. Reports show institutional vehicles have been selling recently: ETFs recorded roughly $547 million in outflows over four consecutive days earlier this week. On Thursday, all ETFs logged net outflows except BlackRock, which posted neither inflows nor outflows that day. That said, BlackRock had sold close to $27 million worth of ETH the previous day. These moves appear to have helped push the price lower ahead of the whale’s action. Analysts have pointed out that a large transfer like this would normally stoke fears of a liquidation. In this case, the absence of exchange deposits seemed to calm some traders. Staking shifts coins off liquid markets and can reduce immediate sell pressure. Still, the broader sell-off from ETF products has been sizable and may keep acting as a drag on price until flows stabilize.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto.

A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.

Title: $10 Trillion Asset Manager Vanguard Prepares To Offer Access To Crypto ETFs For The First Time

One of the world’s largest asset managers, Vanguard, is reportedly preparing to enter the digital asset space by offering access to crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the first time. This move comes after a period of skepticism from the firm, which manages approximately $10 trillion in assets. According to a Friday report from Crypto in America, a source familiar with Vanguard’s plans has disclosed that the company has begun laying the groundwork for this initiative due to increasing client demand for digital assets and a more favorable regulatory environment. While Vanguard is not planning to launch its own crypto products, as competitors like BlackRock have done, it is reportedly considering granting brokerage customers access to select third-party crypto ETFs. However, the timeline for this decision remains uncertain. “They’re being very methodical in their approach, understanding the dynamics have been changing since 2024,” the source remarked, highlighting the cautious yet adaptive strategy Vanguard is adopting in response to evolving market conditions. Vanguard’s plans come as under President Donald Trump’s administration, regulatory agencies have significantly shifted their approach toward crypto assets, led by the SEC’s drop of enforcement cases, new frameworks for the growth and adoption of crypto assets and related products. The SEC’s recent approval of a new generic listing standard is expected to expedite the approval process for crypto ETFs, alongside the greenlighting of index funds that include leading crypto assets, further contributing to renewed stances from asset managers like Vanguard. Vanguard’s CEO, Salim Ramji, who previously spent a decade at BlackRock overseeing the successful launch of its Bitcoin ETF, has been at the forefront of this strategy. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has attracted over $60 billion in net inflows since its debut in January 2024, amassing more than $80 billion in assets. Since taking the helm at Vanguard last year, Ramji’s leadership style has been closely watched, with many speculating whether he might emulate strategies from his former boss, Larry Fink. In January of last year, Vanguard had publicly stated that “Spot Bitcoin ETFs will not be available for purchase on the Vanguard platform,” dismissing the notion of offering crypto-related products. This decision led some users to threaten account closures due to dissatisfaction with Vanguard’s stance on digital assets. At the July Morningstar Investment Conference, Ramji reiterated that the asset management firm would not replicate competitors by launching its own crypto ETFs. However, he avoided directly addressing the possibility of offering access to third-party crypto ETFs. Yet, as the performance of crypto ETFs has significantly improved over the past year, the firm’s views appear to be evolving, in line with broader market trends and regulatory shifts that are fostering a new era for digital assets.

Title: Anti-Bitcoin Investment Giant Vanguard Reportedly Considering Crypto ETF Access For Customers In Dramatic U-Turn

Vanguard, the $10 trillion asset manager known in crypto circles for blocking client access to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), is reportedly reconsidering its stance on offering its clientele access to such investment vehicles. According to a Sept. 26 report from Crypto in America, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter, Vanguard is now examining ways to satisfy customer demand for digital assets amid the evolving regulatory environment. Notably, Vanguard does not intend to introduce its own products. Instead, the famously anti-Bitcoin investment manager is exploring whether to give clients access to third-party crypto ETFs on its brokerage platform, even as its biggest competitor, BlackRock, launched the wildly successful iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which became the fastest ETF in history to achieve the $80 billion assets under management record. “They’re being very methodical in their approach, understanding the dynamics have been changing since 2024,” the source reportedly stated. Vanguard staunchly indicated that it wouldn’t offer its clients trading access to any of the dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs that went live on US exchanges in January 2024, citing the crypto’s high volatility as bad for generating long-term returns. The company in July last year named Salim Ramji, the pro-crypto ex-BlackRock exec, to take the reins from his predecessor CEO Tim Buckley, leading to speculation of a reversal of the decision to shun BTC ETFs. However, Ramji poured water on the idea that he had any intentions for the asset management giant to change its approach to crypto funds. “Vanguard is looking to end Bitcoin ETF ban (aka bend the knee lol),” Bloomberg Senior’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed on X. “We heard chatter of this too. Smart of them imo. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are hugely popular and Salim was one of IBIT’s midwives so he knows.” <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>Vanguard is looking to end bitcoin ETF ban (aka bend the knee lol). &quot;The dynamics have been changing&quot; Nice scoop by Eleanor.

Obv many are not the bitcoin type but that’s massive, they are biggest fund company in the US by two times over,” Balchunas added. Bitcoin fell below $109,000 yesterday, marking its weakest price in almost a month. The premier crypto has since reclaimed the $110,000 psychological threshold, but it remains to be seen whether the rebound is sustainable.

Title: AI's energy demand draws investment firms to local utilities

(Brooks Johnson/Star Tribune via AP) People leave the The BlackRock investment company in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York, Tuesday, March 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File) HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI. Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines. “The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds. Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said. BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.” “We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said. In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co. Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone. However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share. Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power. Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies. Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes. “It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources. The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers. Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.” That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations. That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say. The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them. Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock. On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills. In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates. In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years. However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs. It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock. In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns. They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return. “For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.” That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations. That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say. The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them. Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock. On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills. In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates. In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years. However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs. It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock. In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns. They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return. “For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Private equity sees profits in power utilities as electric bills rise and Big Tech seeks more energy

WEATHER ALERT Marc Levy Associated Press Published: September 27, 2025 at 12:01 AM Marc Levy Associated Press HARRISBURG, Pa. – Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI. Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines. Recommended Videos “The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds. Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said. BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.” “We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy" and energy, Fink said. Deals are in the works In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co. Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone. However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share. Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power. Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies. More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes. “It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

Title: BlackRock Exec Pressed On XRP ETF: His Answer Raises More Questions
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-exec-xrp-etf-answer-more-questions/
Time Published: 2025-09-27T01:00:31Z

BlackRock’s global head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, was pressed on the prospect of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund during an interview with Nate Geraci on the “Crypto Prime” podcast. While he offered no product reveal, he did spell out precisely how BlackRock is thinking about what could come next after its blockbuster Bitcoin and Ether launches. Geraci noted on air that he has “publicly predicted that BlackRock would file for a spot XRP ETF and a spot Solana ETF,” then asked how the firm evaluates “future product development around crypto-related ETFs.” Mitchnick declined to speak to any specific tickers but was explicit about the decision framework: “There’s a lot of factors that go into that decision-making process obviously, but the biggest driver ultimately is our clients… What is the level of investor demand? What is the logic and investment thesis for investors and for our clients around these potential products? What problem are we solving for them?” He added that BlackRock weighs “market cap, liquidity, [and] maturity,” along with “clarity of investment thesis and overall… portfolio considerations,” describing it as “a constant evaluation process,” not a single point in time. The exchange came amid a wide-ranging discussion of how quickly BlackRock’s crypto business has scaled and how starkly the firm differentiates Bitcoin from Ether in client portfolios. My conversation w/ BlackRock’s @robbiemitchnick… We discuss: -Massive success of IBIT & ETHA -Btc & eth in broader portfolio -Staking in spot eth ETFs -Generic listing standards -Crypto ETF development -Tokenization -Stablecoinshttps://t.co/54NgVDFpVJ via @CryptoPrimePod pic.twitter.com/N5H4EnI7Q7 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) September 25, 2025 Geraci highlighted the growth figures—“[IBIT] launched in early January 2024. It’s over $85 billion in assets… [ETHA] launched in July… around $16 billion”—and asked whether Ethereum’s trajectory matched expectations after Bitcoin’s record start. Mitchnick pushed back on early narratives that Ether ETFs were a “bust” only because they were “being compared against the extraordinary record-setting numbers” of Bitcoin, pointing out that ETHA became “the third fastest ETF in history to reach $10 billion.” Mitchnick drew a bright line between the two assets from a portfolio-construction perspective. Bitcoin, he said, functions for many allocators as “this sort of digital gold type instrument,” a “global scarce decentralized non-sovereign asset” with distinct risk and return drivers. Ethereum is “a more nuanced, more technical discussion,” effectively “a bet around blockchain adoption and digital assets more broadly,” with competitive dynamics and questions about “value capture in the Ether token versus the activity level on the Ethereum blockchain.” As a result, Bitcoin has seen “much greater penetration” among institutional and wealth advisory channels, while Ether ownership remains “overwhelmingly” in the direct investor segment. On the gating factors that could unlock the next wave of demand, Mitchnick said it is “still early days” for both institutions and wealth platforms in the United States. Many large firms allow execution-only access, but “the vast majority of advisers… still do not have the ability to make decisions on this on behalf of their clients.” He described “various stages of approving this” across the wirehouses, including one firm “starting to put it in model portfolios,” and noted that BlackRock’s own model-portfolio team “early in 2025… put IBIT allocations into one of our model portfolios.” For institutions, he argued that further episodes of Bitcoin “decoupling from equities in a… distressed market environment” would be “critical” in cementing its role as a diversifier. Asked about the SEC’s recent move to approve generic listing standards for commodity-based ETPs—the category that includes spot crypto ETFs—Mitchnick called it “a pragmatic step” that “streamlin[es] the process,” with clear, transparent standards that “support innovation.” Taken together, Mitchnick’s comments sketched the contours of BlackRock’s next steps without tipping its hand. On an XRP ETF, he didn’t confirm or deny anything—but he gave a clear readout of the bar any new product must clear: credible client demand, a defensible investment thesis, sufficient market depth and maturity, and a well-defined role in diversified portfolios. At press time, XRP traded at $2.71. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: BlackRock raises Bitcoin exposure by 38% in its $17.1 billion Global Allocation Fund

The diversified fund held 1,000,808 IBIT shares valued at $66.4 million as of July 31, up from 723,332 shares on Apr. 30. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund increased its holdings in the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) by 38.4% during the second quarter, according to a Sept. 26 SEC filing. As of July 31, the diversified fund held 1,000,808 IBIT shares valued at $66.4 million, up from 723,332 shares on Apr. 30. The addition of 277,476 shares represents the fund’s return to Bitcoin allocation after reducing exposure earlier this year. Year-over-year growth demonstrates accelerating Bitcoin adoption within BlackRock’s portfolio management. The fund held just 198,874 IBIT shares as of July 31, 2024, representing a 403% increase over the previous twelve months. IBIT represents 0.4% of the Global Allocation Fund’s $17.1 billion assets under management, a 62.5% increase from the 0.25% allocation recorded in the first quarter. The current weighting marks substantial growth from the 0.1% position held in October 2024. BlackRock recommended 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation as a “reasonable range” in its model portfolio on Feb. 28, positioning the Global Allocation Fund below its target range. The recent increases indicate movement toward this recommended exposure level through gradual and cautious accumulation. The Global Allocation Fund invests across US and international equities, debt securities, money market instruments, and other short-term assets. Portfolio composition varies periodically in response to market conditions and investment opportunities. BlackRock launched IBIT in January 2024 as part of the first wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of Sept. 25, the fund has the largest Bitcoin ETF, with nearly $61 billion in cumulative net flows. The Global Allocation Fund’s methodical approach to Bitcoin allocation demonstrates institutional investment strategies for crypto exposure. BlackRock continues building its position toward recommended portfolio weightings while managing volatility through gradual accumulation.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) hovering under $110,000 has traders debating whether support will hold or a drop below $100,000 is imminent. What Happened: Position trader Bob Loukas noted on X that Bitcoin is approaching its Weekly Cycle Low, five weeks after peaking. While $118,000 would confirm a new cycle, short-term control remains with the bears. Loukas highlighted that BTC failed to break its all-time highs in mid-August, signaling the weekly cycle peaked around Week 18. Despite this, he remains bullish on the late-stage 4-year cycle, citing altcoins holding up as BTC dominance drops—a classic late-cycle pattern. Trader Joe Consorti pointed out that Bitcoin endured $2.75 billion in long liquidations across just four days, two of the three largest events of 2025. CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten drew parallels to September 2024: Bitcoin trended higher, then fell 11% after losing the trend line, consolidated for two weeks, and broke higher in mid-October, without breaching the early September lows. Also Read: Bitcoin Tumbles To $111,000: Bear Market Beginnings Or Still A Bull Market Dip? Why It Matters: Prediction markets show traders now see a 61% chance of Bitcoin dipping below $100,000 before 2026, up from 41% last week. Similarly, the probability of BTC hitting $100,000 before $130,000 has jumped to 61% from 36% as of Sep. 19. These predictions come on the heels of a major options expiry today, with over $22.3 billion set to expire on Deribit. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said BlackRock has registered the iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF, a covered call strategy designed to generate yield for Bitcoin holders. This product would complement its iShares Bitcoin ETF IBIT, which has seen $60.7 billion in inflows since January 2024. Read Next: Image: Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.
