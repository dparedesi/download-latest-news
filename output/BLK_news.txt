The growing intersection between traditional finance and digital asset infrastructure has taken another step forward, as Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon announced a joint initiative aimed at integrating blockchain technology into the money market fund (MMF) ecosystem. The collaboration will see BNY Mellon leverage Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP® (also known as its private blockchain) to maintain a mirrored tokenized record of customer ownership in select MMFs. This marks the first instance in the United States where mirrored tokenization will be used to reflect ownership in MMFs through a blockchain-based ledger. The rollout includes major asset managers such as BlackRock, BNY Mellon Investment Management’s Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Investors will now be able to subscribe to and redeem MMF shares using BNY’s Liquidity management platform, which has been integrated with its digital assets platform to connect with the private blockchain. The mirror tokens created on the Goldman Sachs’ private blockchain platform do not replace official records but serve as a complementary layer that increases the accessibility and potential use cases of MMF shares in a digitized financial ecosystem. The mirrored tokenization of MMF shares using blockchain represents a new model for fund management infrastructure. Although the underlying assets remain managed through traditional custodial and compliance channels, the blockchain layer enhances interoperability and real-time transferability. Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP®, is built on smart contract technology from the startup Digital Asset and offers programmable finance functionality for institutions. BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirectSM platform is also one of the leading portals for institutional cash investors, and the integration of the private blockchain opens the door to extending MMF shares into use cases like collateral optimization and intraday liquidity management. According to Laide Majiyagbe, BNY Mellon’s Global Head of Liquidity, Financing and Collateral, “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition,” noting the company’s position as a link between established financial systems and new technology. GS DAP® was previously piloted for bond issuance on blockchain networks in Asia and Europe. Its adaptation for MMF share representation in the US signals a broader vision for tokenizing real-world assets beyond equities and debt, potentially reshaping capital markets infrastructure. This particular use case focuses on liquidity and settlement efficiency in short-term investment vehicles, valued at over $7 trillion globally, according to ICI data. Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, emphasized the potential benefits of using tokenized MMF shares as collateral in various trading and settlement contexts. “Using tokens representing the value of shares of Money Market Funds on GS DAP® would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future,” he said in a statement. BNY Mellon will continue to serve as the official recordkeeper, maintaining existing regulatory compliance and settlement protocols. However, the addition of tokenized mirrors creates new flexibility for financial institutions seeking to modernize collateral management and liquidity strategies. While this initiative currently focuses on US MMFs, both institutions signaled interest in expanding the model globally, potentially applying similar technology to other fund structures and asset classes.

Title: World Liberty’s 3,473 Ethereum Purchase Sets Tone As Companies Pile Into Altcoin

World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture linked to US President Donald Trump, has made another big move into Ethereum. The group converted $13 million worth of USDC into 3,473 ETH, adding to its already large stash of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The move pushes the platform’s total Ethereum holdings to 73,616 ETH—worth about $275 million based on current prices. This latest transaction continues a buying trend that’s gained attention over the past few months. Data from Lookonchain shows that World Liberty Financial is sitting on an unrealized profit of more than $33 million. The project’s average entry price for Ethereum sits around $3,272. With ETH trading higher now, the bet appears to be paying off. Trump’s World Liberty(@worldlibertyfi) just spent 13M $USDC to buy 3,473 $ETH at $3,743 again! World Liberty has bought a total of 73,616 $ETH($275M) at an average price of $3,272, with an unrealized profit of $33M+.https://t.co/0qWkRUhTQb pic.twitter.com/WG1zpl3PJC — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 23, 2025 Last week, World Liberty also picked up over 3,000 ETH for $10 million. In May, they added another 1,580 ETH at a cost of $3.5 million. These steady acquisitions show a clear strategy: accumulate ETH and hold while prices climb. On the market side, Ethereum has responded with more green candles. The token rose 2% in the last 24 hours, hitting a daily high of $3,763. Over the past week, ETH is up 20%. Over the last month, it’s gained 65%. World Liberty Financial is not alone in taking a deep plunge into Ethereum. SharpLink and Bitmine have also boosted their ETH positions. And BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is said to be developing increasing interest in Ethereum, after establishing a strong presence in the Bitcoin arena. The momentum has also fueled the emergence of Ether Machine, a $1.6 billion Ethereum-specific effort. That effort is backed by the likes of Pantera Capital, Archetype, Kraken, Blockchain.com, and Electric Capital. All these moves set the scenario for Ethereum to be a leading option among the major players, not merely independent traders. The surging interest is driving ETH into the mainstream limelight. While new investors are buying in, older Ethereum holders are also stirring. Some dormant wallets recently moved vast amounts of the altcoin. This type of movement is bound to attract notice. It’s not the money—it’s when. And with so many of the major players stepping in, even long-quiet holders may find this the time to do something. Ethereum isn’t merely riding a wave of price activity. Institutions, funds, and political parties are stockpiling it, quietly transforming it into something bigger than another crypto token.

Title: Elon Musk wants more control of Tesla so activist investors can’t boot him—but not so much the board can’t fire him if he goes ‘crazy’
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/23/elon-musk-tesla-earnings-control/
Time Published: 2025-07-24T00:11:36Z
Full Content:
Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. Tesla CEO Elon Musk just confessed that he thinks his 13% ownership stake in the electric vehicle manufacturer leaves him vulnerable to activist shareholders who could move to oust him from the $1 trillion company. Still, he admitted he shouldn’t have so much control over Tesla that the board can’t fire him if he goes “crazy,” he said during an earnings call on Wednesday. “It is a big deal—I don’t want to find I have so little control I can be easily ousted by activist shareholders,” Musk said. “That is a major concern to me as I’ve mentioned in the past and I hope that is addressed at the upcoming shareholders meeting.” I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned.Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. You don’t seem to understand…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 15, 2024 Musk owns 13% of Tesla, a stake currently valued around $139 billion. He has previously stated he wants to own 25% of the electric vehicle manufacturer as it further expands into AI with unassisted Full Self Driving and robotics. Such a stake would be worth about $267.5 billion and would eclipse holdings by large institutional investors in Tesla such as Vanguard and Blackrock. Musk has worried in the past about the influence of activist investors or proxy advisory firms steering Tesla down the wrong long-term path at the expense of short-term pressures. However, Tesla currently maintains a defensive position against activists. Its bylaws call for what is termed a supermajority vote requirement, meaning shareholder votes must achieve support from two thirds of all outstanding shares (66.67%) rather than a simple 50% majority in order to pass. The board committed last year to Tesla shareholders that it would eliminate the supermajority vote requirement, but it hasn’t been able to muster enough investor participation. Tesla amended its bylaws in 2023 to provide shareholders with proxy access rights, meaning a shareholder or group of shareholders owning 3% or more of Tesla for at least three years can nominate directors to Tesla’s board. A stake that size would be valued at more than $20 billion. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require activist investors to disclose their stakes in company stock once they reach 5%, which is also the point where an activist can typically gain credibility with the board. A 5% stake in Tesla is worth more than $30 billion. In comparison, legendary activist investor Nelson Peltz took on the Walt Disney board after building a stake valued at about $3.5 billion at its peak. Activist investors often typically target small-cap publicly traded companies. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk shared his view on his ownership stake in response to an analyst’s question about how comfortable the CEO was in evolving Tesla in new directions with only the 13% stake. Musk pointed the annual shareholder meeting, which will be held November 6, as a potential issue to get aired out then. “I think that, as I’ve mentioned before, I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy,” he said. Musk has been working without a base salary or annual bonus for years, after the Tesla board granted him a moonshot pay package once valued as high as $56 billion—the highest for a publicly traded CEO. However, that pay package was twice rescinded by a judge and Tesla has announced it formed a board committee to hash out next steps. With the delay in Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, the company has not yet published a proxy report to shareholders, which typically includes executive compensation disclosures. Tesla reported mixed results in its second quarter financials on Wednesday. Revenue declined 12% year-over-year to $22.5 billion, its worst revenue performance in the past decade. Operating income dropped 42% year-over-year to under $1 billion, although Tesla was still profitable with $1.2 billion in GAAP net income. Meanwhile, free cash flow cratered 89% year-over-year to $146 million, compared to $1.3 billion during the same quarter last year. Deliveries were down 13% to 384,122, although there were some major developments noted. Tesla launched its much-ballyhooed Robotaxi pilot in Austin, and it boosted its AI training capacity. Separately, Tesla opened a new diner and drive-in theater at a mega charging station in Hollywood this week. Tesla executives did not address speculation about a Tesla investment in Musk’s xAI, nor did they address questions from retail investors about Musk’s involvement in politics and its impact on Tesla’s value. Retail investors post questions on an open platform for Tesla shareholders called Say in advance of the earnings releases. Many related to Musk had to do with his compensation and the board’s plan to oversee Musk’s future political moves. “Elon the person has freedom of speech,” wrote one shareholder representing 47,000 shares. “The brand ambassador of Tesla does not. What is the board doing to distance Tesla from the private actions of its CEO?” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

When a company issues a token representing a real-world asset, such as a stock, but it doesn’t have any right to the underlying, “what you’re really doing is taking away from the integrity of investing and moving towards a gambling mindset,” he told Decrypt in a recent interview. “This is the meme-coin-ification of equities,” he added. In 2023, Kaplan testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had clearly laid out a path to compliance for crypto firms, provoking scrutiny from Republicans and crypto advocates who argued the status quo is unworkable. With tokenization gaining traction under a crypto-friendly SEC following the reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump, Prometheum is trying to reposition itself as a firm specializing in on-chain securities, reprising a familiar tune, but in a slightly different way. “It’s not really a pivot,” Kaplan said. “We've been working with issuers for a long time, and we're very excited for more and more products to come on-chain.” Through a panoply of licenses and subsidiaries, Kaplan said Prometheum can service the “entire lifecycle of a digital asset,” using its transfer agent, alternative trading system, and a special-purpose broker dealer, which also serves as a custodian. Kaplan said Prometheum can currently safeguard a handful of tokens but on-chain securities are coming next. From the beginning, Kaplan said that Prometheum’s goal has been to “to integrate blockchain technology into market infrastructure to just create a better apple cart,” following the same rules but “eliminating the drag that occurs from legacy systems.” The vision parallels BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who predicted tokenization would become the “next generation of markets” by making markets more efficient in 2022. Citadel Securities, one of the world’s largest market makers, urged the SEC in a letter earlier this week to treat tokenized equities in a similar manner to traditional counterparts. “Simply put, while we strongly support technological innovations designed to address market inefficiencies, seeking to exploit regulatory arbitrage for ‘look-a-like’ securities is not innovation,” it argued, calling on the SEC to “resist self-serving requests for broad exemptions.” In a statement weeks ago, SEC Commissioner and crypto task force boss Hester Peirce told firms structuring tokenized offerings to consider meeting with the regulator, noting that tokenization does not provide an exemption from existing rules and regulations. In recent months, crypto exchange Kraken has backed xStocks on Solana, while trading platform Robinhood has introduced “stocks tokens” on the Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum. Robinhood clarified, following criticism from OpenAI, that its tokens represent contracts, and in the case of the ChatGPT maker, they give “indirect exposure to public markets.” Earlier this month, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo argued to Decrypt that the only true form of tokenization is “native,” meaning the asset itself is issued on-chain, as opposed to representing an asset that’s held, managed, and recorded somewhere else. Kaplan agrees, but he thinks not all companies are getting the compliance element. “I think people have started to view tokenization as an alternative to regulation,” he said. “It might be a derivative, but it's a security, and therefore it still has to follow the rules.” CORRECTION (JULY 23, 2025, 4:40 p.m.): Fixes title in headline to Co-CEO.

Title: President Trump Plans to Open 401(k)s to Bitcoin, Crypto, Gold, and Private Equity: FT
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/president-trump-plans-to-open-401ks-to-bitcoin-crypto-gold-and-private-equity-ft/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T20:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Crypto Bitcoin Magazine, Oscar Zarraga Perez The executive order, expected this week, aims to unlock the $9 trillion retirement market by allowing 401(k) plans to invest in alternative assets. Financial Times reported today that President Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that would allow 401(k) retirement plans to invest in alternative assets such as gold, private equity, and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. “Donald Trump is preparing to open the $9tn US retirement market to cryptocurrency investments, gold, and private equity in a move that would spur a radical shift in the way Americans’ savings are managed,” reported the Financial Times. According to Financial Times, the order is expected this week and will direct federal regulators to remove barriers preventing 401(k) plans from including these non-traditional investments in managed funds. This includes digital assets, metals, private loans, infrastructure deals, and corporate buyout funds. “President Trump is committed to restoring prosperity for everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future,” said the White House in a statement to the Financial Times. “No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself.” Trump’s move builds on his administration’s earlier efforts to ease bitcoin and crypto regulations. In May, the Department of Labor reversed a rule that discouraged bitcoin and other crypto in retirement plans. Trump has also supported recent bitcoin and other crypto related bills passed by the House and credited the industry with helping him win the 2024 election. The executive order could benefit major private investment firms such as Blackstone, Apollo, and BlackRock, reported the Financial Times, which have all pinned much of their future growth on investing money on behalf of retirement savers. “Blackstone has struck a partnership with Vanguard, while Apollo and Partners Group are among firms that will offer investments to Empower, a large 401k plan sponsor. BlackRock has already begun working with Great Gray Trust, a third-party manger of retirement savings plans,” stated Financial Times.

Title: Project Flash update: Advancing Azure Virtual Machine availability monitoring
URL: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/project-flash-update-advancing-azure-virtual-machine-availability-monitoring-2/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
Previously, we shared an update on Project Flash as part of our Advancing Reliability blog series, reaffirming our commitment to helping Azure customers detect and diagnose virtual machine (VM) availability issues with speed and precision. This year, we’re excited to unveil the latest innovations that take VM availability monitoring to the next level—enabling customers to operate their workloads on Azure with even greater confidence. I’ve asked Yingqi (Halley) Ding, Technical Program Manager from the Azure Core Compute team, to walk us through the newest investments powering the next phase of Project Flash. Project Flash is a cross-division initiative at Microsoft. Its vision is to deliver precise telemetry, real-time alerts, and scalable monitoring—all within a unified, user-friendly experience designed to meet the diverse observability needs of virtual machine (VM) availability. Flash addresses both platform-level and user-level challenges. It enables rapid detection of issues originating from the Azure platform, helping teams respond quickly to infrastructure-related disruptions. At the same time, it equips you with actionable insights to diagnose and resolve problems within your own environment. This dual capability supports high availability and helps ensure your business Service-Level Agreements are consistently met. It’s our mission to ensure you can: During our team’s journey with Flash, it has garnered widespread adoption from some of the world’s leading companies spanning from e-commerce, gaming, finance, hedge funds, and many other sectors. Their extensive utilization of Flash underscores its effectiveness and value in meeting the diverse needs of high-profile organizations. At BlackRock, VM reliability is critical to our operations. If a VM is running on degraded hardware, we want to be alerted quickly so we have the maximum opportunity to mitigate the issue before it impacts users. With Project Flash, we receive a resource health event integrated into our alerting processes the moment an underlying node in Azure infrastructure is marked unallocatable, typically due to health degradation. Our infrastructure team then schedules a migration of the affected resource to healthy hardware at an optimal time. This ability to predictively avoid abrupt VM failures has reduced our VM interruption rate and improved the overall reliability of our investment platform. The Flash initiative has evolved into a robust, scalable monitoring framework designed to meet the diverse needs of modern infrastructure—whether you’re managing a handful of VMs or operating at massive scale. Built with reliability at its core, Flash empowers you to monitor what matters most, using the tools and telemetry that align with your architecture and operational model. Flash publishes VM availability states and resource health annotations for detailed failure attribution and downtime analysis. The guide below outlines your options so you can choose the right Flash monitoring solution for your scenario. Many customers have emphasized the need for user-friendly monitoring solutions that provide real-time, scalable access to compute resource availability data. This information is essential for triggering timely mitigation actions in response to availability changes. Designed to satisfy this critical need, the VM availability metric is well-suited for tracking trends, aggregating platform metrics (such as CPU and disk usage), and configuring precise threshold-based alerts. You can utilize this out-of-the-box VM availability metric in Azure Monitor. Now you can use the Context dimension to identify whether VM availability was influenced by Azure or user-orchestrated activity. This dimension indicates, during any disruption or when the metric drops to zero, whether the cause was platform-triggered or user-driven. It can assume values of Platform, Customer, or Unknown. The new dimension is also supported in Azure Monitor alert rules as part of the filtering process.

The product, built with technology developed by Goldman Sachs, will allow fund managers to enable the subscription of shares of MMF via BNY’s Liquidity Direct and digital assets platform that are then reflected with mirrored tokens on Goldman Sachs's Digital Asset Platform (DAP). “As the financial system transitions toward a more digital, real-time architecture, BNY is committed to enabling scalable and secure solutions that shape the future of finance,” said Global Head of Liquidity, Financing and Collateral at BNY Laide Majiyagbe in a statement. "Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition, and we are proud to be at the forefront of this first-of-its-kind initiative," she added. The initial launch will have participation from BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, while the official books, records, and settlement will be maintained by BNY Mellon. “Using tokens representing the value of shares of Money Market Funds on GS DAP would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future,” said Goldman Sachs Global Head of Digital Assets Matthew McDermott, in a statement. “We are excited about this strategic collaboration with BNY in our journey towards the longer-term vision for GS DAP and as we continue to lead and innovate in the digital assets space.” Expanding participation in global financial services via tokenized assets is a growing trend among financial firms. Last month, Robinhood announced a tokenized equity platform to provide greater access to American stocks for those in the Europe, and American crypto exchange Coinbase is seeking to offer its own tokenized solution as well. Meanwhile, other crypto exchanges have leaned into offering xStocks, a feature that allows users to trade popular stocks like Meta and Tesla on Solana, which are backed by actual shares in the respective companies.

Title: The DORKs are popular this week. Here's the new class of meme stocks retail traders are pumping to the moon.

The DORKs are popular this week. With stocks at record highs, there's a new class of meme stocks that's grabbed the attention of retail traders. Absent are the OG meme names GameStop and AMC. Those early favorites have been replaced by another group. The DORKs—an acronym being thrown around by bullish traders to refer to the ticker symbols of Krispy Kreme, Opendoor, Rocket Lab, and Kohl's—are spiking in the last few days, with the burst of enthusiasm sparked by a stunning rally in Opendoor stock that's mostly cooled off even as the rest of the group surges. It's looking similar to 2021, when everything from crypto to pandemic-era blank check firms to highly-shorted companies with weak financials were getting pushed to dizzying heights. And with recent legislation proposing to loosen day trading restrictions by lowering the minimum margin account threshold, there's never been a more retail-friendly time in the markets. But there are differences, too, between today's rally and the pandemic-era frenzy. "Today's surge is powered by advances in trading technology, wider use of leverage, and the rapid expansion of the options market. Confidence among retail traders is notably higher, fueled in part by recent gains in crypto markets," Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide, said. "While this activity reflects rising risk appetite, it remains isolated and has yet to challenge the broader market's calm and steady tone." Taking a page from Warren Buffett's book, investors are getting greedy, which also means extra caution may be warranted. Tony DeSpirito, head of US fundamental equities at BlackRock, is sensing some pockets of froth in the market as sentiment continues to rise and meme stocks surge. In particular, stocks with high multiples but low growth are concerning to DeSpirito. "Meme stocks are the epitome of greed," DeSpirito told Business Insider. "If I'm advising an individual, I'd tell them to stay away from the meme stocks and get the stocks that actually have good cash flow, good earnings, etc." Here's what's been moving in the meme stock world. Prior to last week, Opendoor was an unloved penny stock on the verge of delisting from the Nasdaq. After hedge fund manager Eric Jackson shouted out the stock on X and gave it a hefty $82 price target, enthusiasm for Opendoor surged, activating the retail trader cohort who quickly went all-in. The stock has rallied over 440% in the last month alone, going from under a dollar to $2.88, even hitting $4.71 briefly at one point on Monday. The rally has stalled in recent days, with the shares down as much as 28% on Wednesday. The stock is still up 310% in the last month. Kohl's stock jumped 38% on Tuesday, not on the heels of corporate news or earnings, but rather r/WallStreetBets chatter. Retail traders identified a short interest of nearly half of the company's float, making the stock a perfect candidate for a short squeeze. The frenzy caused trading in Kohl's shares to be temporarily paused during Tuesday's session. The doughnut chain Krispy Kreme surged 28% on Tuesday. The stock started 2025 trading at nearly $10 and proceeded to slide downwards in the following months after the company reported disappointing earnings—until this week. The stock soared again on Wednesday, up as much as 39%before paring gains. Krispy Kreme also has a significant short interest level of 33%, making it another target for Reddit short squeezers. Rocket Lab stock has surged amid increased retail interest in space technology. The company provides end-to-end space services and is a rival to Elon Musk's SpaceX. The stock has been a Wall Street Bets favorite for many months now. Rocket Lab has surged nearly 50% in the last month and is up nearly 100% year-to-date, bolstered by news of recent government contracts and scheduled launches. The company's short interest comprises 13% of its float. Digital camera producer GoPro was also swept up in the meme-stock craze. In its heyday back in 2015, the stock traded at $67. A big influx of retail volume has propelled the stock from under a dollar to above $2 immediately upon Wednesday's open. The stock was up as much as 72% on Wednesday before paring the gain to around 40%. Nearly 10% of GoPro's float is shorted. Jump to

Δ The collaboration will see BNY use Goldman Sachs’ blockchain technology to maintain a record of customers’ ownership of select money market funds (MMFs). The companies said in a Wednesday (July 23) press release that the project is “a significant step towards enhancing the utility and transferability of existing MMF shares.” It’s also the first time that fund managers in the United States have enabled subscription for shares of their MMFs via BNY’s LiquidityDirect and Digital Asset platforms, “the corresponding value of which will be represented through mirrored record tokenization utilizing GS DAP,” Goldman Sachs’ blockchain-based platform, per the release. BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are all participating in the launch, the release said. “As the financial system transitions toward a more digital, real-time architecture, BNY is committed to enabling scalable and secure solutions that shape the future of finance,” Laide Majiyagbe, global head of liquidity, financing and collateral at BNY, said in the release. “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition, and we are proud to be at the forefront of this first-of-its-kind initiative.” Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs, said in the release that using tokens representing the value of shares of MMFs on GS DAP “would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future.” BNY will continue to maintain the official books, records, and settlements for the funds within approved guidelines while also enabling mirror tokens on GS DAP to create future opportunities, according to the release. Meanwhile, tokenization is transforming the way consumers and merchants think about payment security, Valeri Vanourek, vice president of digital products at Discover® Network, told PYMNTS this month. “The benefits of tokenization haven’t changed,” Vanourek said. “A streamlined checkout process, additional protection as part of the transaction, the account updates in the case of a cardholder’s primary account number being lost or stolen or needing to be replaced, all of those result in a frictionless and secure transaction.” What has changed is that companies that choose to invest in tokenization for their payment architecture could be best placed to flourish in the next wave of digital commerce.

Title: What’s up with… Nokia, AT&T, Comcast, Charter, T-Mobile US

Jul 23, 2025 In today’s industry news roundup: Currency exchange fluctuations and tariffs force Nokia to issue a profits warning for the full year; AT&T is to pump billions more into its fibre access network infrastructure as it celebrates massive tax savings from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; Comcast and Charter have hooked up with T-Mobile US, and not existing MVNO partner Verizon, for B2B mobile services; and much more! Nokia’s share price slumped by 8.5% to €3.76 during Wednesday trading on the Helsinki stock exchange after the vendor issued a profit warning late on Tuesday, blaming foreign exchange rate fluctuations (a weaker dollar) and “tariff headwinds” that are “outside its control”. While the vendor says its “underlying business performed as expected” during the first six months of the year, the foreign exchange shifts and the impact of trade tariffs have forced the company to lower its operating profit outlook for the full year to €1.6bn-2.1bn from its previous outlook of €1.9bn-€2.4bn), a difference of €300m. The main impact has come from the change in the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar: When Nokia made its initial full year calculations in January, the €/$ exchange rate was 1.04, but its new calculation is based on a rate of 1.17. That shift has had a €230m negative impact on its operating profit projection, while the “tariff landscape” is expected to have a negative impact this year of between €50m and €80m. Nokia is set to publish its second quarter 2025 results during the morning of 24 July but ahead of that publication it noted that it expects to report revenues of €4.55bn and an operating profit of €300m. Nokia, of course, won’t be alone in taking this kind of hit: Other European vendors that do a lot of business in the US will also be impacted by the same “headwinds”, especially if the US does impose 30% tariffs on EU goods from 1 August, as has been threatened. AT&T expects to benefit from cash tax savings worth between $6.5bn and $8bn during the 2025-2027 period, relative to the financial guidance it provided at its 2024 investor day, due to the impact of the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The telco expects savings of $1.5bn-$2bn this year, followed by $2.5bn-$3bn in 2026 and again in 2027. The news came as the operator reported its second quarter financial results. AT&T says it plans to invest $3.5bn of those expected savings into its network infrastructure to “accelerate its fibre internet build-out to a pace of 4 million locations per year, a run-rate it expects to achieve by the end of 2026.” The telco added: “As a result of this increased pace of organic fibre deployment, AT&T expects that by the end of 2030 it will reach approximately 50 million customer locations with its in-region fibre network,” and more than 60 million fibre locations once it includes: the Lumen Technologies Mass Markets fibre broadband network assets it has agreed to acquire for $5.75bn (and which it plans to expand); its Gigapower joint venture with Blackrock; and agreements with open access fibre broadband network providers. As for the rest of the savings, AT&T plans to pump $1.5bn into its employee pension plan by the end of 2026 and use the remaining savings for “financial flexibility to support additional strategic investments, incremental capital returns and debt repayment, among other potential uses.” For the second quarter, AT&T reported communications services revenues of $29.7bn, up by 3.9% year on year, and communications services operating profits of $7.07bn, up by 0.9%. US cable operator giants Comcast and Charter Communications have struck a joint (and exclusive) MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) deal with T-Mobile US to offer mobile services to their enterprise customers. Mobile services will be offered by Charter and Comcast to US businesses under the Spectrum Mobile for Business and Comcast Business Mobile brands, respectively, noted T-Mobile US in this announcement. Edward Zimmermann, president of Comcast Business, stated: “Comcast Business delivers advanced, converged solutions to business customers by uniting the scale of our nationwide WiFi network, gig-plus speeds, and the integration of top-tier 5G mobile capabilities. Our capital-light partnership with T-Mobile further strengthens our growth strategy in wireless for business customers and provides them exceptional value.” Danny Bowman, executive VP for Product at Charter Communications, added: “Spectrum Mobile for Business offers a truly converged connectivity experience, combining gig-powered internet and superior WiFi service with a premium 5G mobile network. This partnership with T-Mobile will allow us to rapidly and cost-effectively bring even more value to our Spectrum Mobile business customers.” The deal is great news for the wholesale unit of T-Mobile US, which is not shy in telling the world how advanced its 5G network is, but something of a blow to Verizon, which already provides MVNO services to Comcast and Charter for their consumer mobile service offerings – Xfinity Mobile (8.1 million customers) and Spectrum Mobile (10.4 million customers), respectively. The cable companies have stressed that their “existing long-term MVNO partnership will continue to support residential and current business customers”. That’s a small crumb of comfort for Verizon, which will now face even fiercer competition in the enterprise mobile services space from the cable giants. Of course, AT&T and T-Mobile US will also face similar competitive pressure in the B2B market, but at least T-Mobile US will be reaping the rewards of the MVNO fees from Comcast and Charter. Research firm Omdia has taken a look at what Asia’s cloud service providers – including SK Telecom and China’s cloud providers such as Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei and Tencent – are doing in order to meet the rising demand for AI inference from the region’s enterprise sector. By examining which GPUs (graphics processing units), AI accelerators and AI-optimised CPUs (central processing units) these companies have deployed, and the current status of their own AI models and custom chip projects, as well as their AI service and pricing plans, it has come up with an interesting take on the sector. “Despite heavy stockpiling of Nvidia H800 and H20 GPUs during 2024 and early 2025, prior to the imposition of US export controls, these high-performance chips are difficult to find in Chinese cloud services, suggesting they are primarily used for the hyperscalers’ own model development projects,” noted Omdia in this announcement. At the same time, “there are relatively few options that use any of the Chinese AI chip projects; exceptions include Baidu’s on-premises cloud products and some Huawei Cloud services, although they remain limited,” it added. Omdia principal analyst Alexander Harrowell noted: “The real triumph in Chinese semiconductors has been CPUs rather than accelerators. Chinese Arm-based CPUs are clearly in production at scale and are usually optimised for parallel workloads in a way like Amazon Web Services’ Graviton series. Products such as Alibaba’s YiTian 710 offer an economically attractive solution for serving the current generation of small AI models such as Alibaba Qwen3 in the enterprise, where the user base is relatively small and workload diversity is high,” he added. Where “modern GPUs” are deployed, “the strongest offering Omdia found was the GPU-as-a-service product SK Telecom is building in partnership with Lambda Labs,” the research firm noted. Philippines operator Globe Telecom has committed to power 3,000 cell sites in Metro Manila and Calabarzon with 100% renewable power in a move that will lead to the consumption of 80 million kWh of clean electricity and cut its greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 5.5 million kilograms, reports Southeast Asia Infrastructure. Research firm Mobile Experts has taken a broad look at the impact of AI on mobile networks and concluded that “AI assistants and AR [augmented reality] will strain the 5G network, but AI-for-RAN optimization [the use of AI to enhance the performance and efficiency of radio access networks] will create more capacity than consumer applications will use, at least through 2030. The wild card is in automated use of AI for video analysis, in automotive, drone, and industrial applications.” Joe Madden, principal analyst at Mobile Experts, stated: "New applications are coming to your smartphone, taking advantage of on-device AI processing capability. We have been able to identify which apps will run on your phone, and which ones will require network connectivity. The frame rates, resolution, and persistence of video inputs will have a profound impact on the 5G network," added Madden. – The staff, TelecomTV Jul 24, 2025 Jul 24, 2025 Jul 24, 2025 Jul 24, 2025 Jul 23, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Goldman Sachs and BNY have joined hands to launch digital tokens that mirror shares of money market funds, deepening Wall Street's push to bring blockchain technology into traditional finance. Investors can now buy and sell money market fund shares on BNY's LiquidityDirect platform, with a digital record of those shares created on Goldman's blockchain system, the two financial giants said on Wednesday. The move marks an early step toward modernizing the infrastructure that underpins most of the financial ecosystem. If adopted broadly, it could make it easier and faster for institutional investors to use these assets as collateral and reduce trade settlement times.

Due to its 71.6% monthly rise, per CoinGecko, XRP has surpassed drinks company PepsiCo, telecommunications firm AT&T, and taxi app Uber. Ethereum, by comparison, is the 29th largest asset, ahead of the likes of retail company Cotco and medical firm Johnson & Johnson. As for Bitcoin, it currently sits as the 6th largest asset behind Amazon and ahead of Google's creator, Alphabet. However, one expert warns against treating the market capitalization of a public company and a cryptocurrency as the same thing. "It's important that the two concepts are not treated the same," Matej Janež, Head of Partnerships at crypto privacy firm Oasis, told Decrypt. "A public company's market cap counts shares that confer a legal claim on earnings and assets. A crypto market cap is the price multiplied by the circulating token count. Both numbers can reveal speculative appetite, but only one comes with enforceable rights to dividends and residual assets." XRP set a new all-time high earlier this month for the first time in seven years. It came following a five-year legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleged that Ripple and two of its executives had participated in the sale of unregistered securities through XRP. The worst of the legal battle appears to be behind the project as President Trump’s pro-crypto administration begins to ease regulatory scrutiny. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse even claimed the battle was over in March, despite some details of the lawsuit—a $125 million penalty—still lingering. Since Trump secured re-election in November 2024, XRP has surged 585.8% from $0.503 to $3.44. That move has seen the cryptocurrency surpass the likes of investment titan BlackRock, aircraft creator Boeing, and sporting giant Nike. “PesiCo, Uber, BlackRock, Google, Uber will remain in the dust because of XRP. [It] will continue to grow and grow because it has real value,” MackAttackXRP, a pseudonymous member of the XRP Army, an avid supporters group, told Decrypt. “XRP is on its way to the top ten. And it might happen sooner than many might think.” For XRP to climb into the top 10, the cryptocurrency would need to jump more than 735% in value—assuming no other assets increase or decrease in value. MackAttackXRP and other XRP Army troopers argue that XRP will become the standard for transactions across the globe, replacing the traditional banking system, because of its low fees and fast processing speeds. Breaking into the top 10 remains some distance away for XRP, however. Looking to a more achievable goal, XRP needs to rise just 5% to surpass fast-food behemoth McDonald’s. Such a move would also see it surpass oil company Shell and banking firm American Express.

Title: Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon to launch tokenized money market funds for institutional investors

Share this article Goldman Sachs and BNY are launching a new platform that allows institutional clients to invest in tokenized money market funds, CNBC reported Wednesday, and it already has backing from titans like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Federated Hermes. Under the initiative, BNY clients, such as hedge funds, pensions, and corporate treasurers, will gain access to tokenized fund share classes recorded directly on Goldman’s private blockchain. Tokenized money market shares promise an alternative to stablecoins. Unlike stablecoins, money market funds generate real returns, making them a compelling on-chain instrument for parking idle capital with low risk and high liquidity. In March 2024, Goldman Sachs, BNY, and other financial institutions participated in a network test on Digital Asset’s Canton Network to facilitate seamless transactions and settlements of tokenized assets. The pilot involved 15 asset managers, 13 banks, four custodians, and three exchanges, demonstrating the potential of enterprise blockchain to reduce risks, optimize capital, and enable more efficient financial processes.

Title: Overnight sensation Thomas Clarkson taking advantage of surprise Lions call-up

If ever there was a five-year overnight sensation it is assuredly Thomas Clarkson. He made his Leinster debut in August 2020 but went into this campaign with less than 20 starts under his belt and as his province’s third choice tighthead. Yet there he was on Tuesday night in the Marvel Stadium mixed zone after the 24-19 win over the Pasifika XV, a bona fide British & Irish Lion. No one seemed more incredulous as well as delighted than the 25-year-old himself, for he freely admitted he wouldn’t have thought all of this was possible when he was named as one of the additional, or development, players to train with Ireland’s squad last November, before making his debut against Argentina off the bench, backing it up against Fiji, and then playing in four Six Nations games, starting against Wales. Clarkson is eligible for Italy on his mother’s side and also revealed he was approached by Italy at the start of last season. “I wasn’t even really expecting to play in that. So, to get a cap I was delighted. “The Six Nations; I was happy enough with how it went. I wouldn’t have said I set the world alight or anything. So, to then play well for Leinster at the end of the season and come in here, it’s pretty mad.” As recently as January 2025, Clarkson was playing an AIL Division 1B game for Blackrock. “I made my Leinster debut five years ago now, so I’ve been waiting a long time. So, the fact that when it has come, it’s all come at once is a bit crazy. Because I went through a good few years of not getting a sniff in at all really.” It’s been a Lions tour of an unprecedented and, frankly, unexpected bounty for Irish tightheads, three of them making the tour. And two of whom are inextricably linked. Had it not been for the calf and hamstring issues which restricted Tadhg Furlong to just seven games for Leinster and one for Ireland, Clarkson would never have had the opportunities that came for province and country. Even so, after adding three more Champions Cup pool games to his one outing before this season, Clarkson didn’t make the Leinster 23 in their European knockout games. But with Furlong sidelined again, Leo Cullen started Clarkson in their round 18 game against Glasgow. “It all kind of just clicked and then kept that momentum going. That was the first game when I thought: ‘That was a proper performance’.” David Humphreys has now lifted his moratorium on the provinces signing props from abroad and although Furlong’s injury woes have been a factor, Clarkson’s own account of his growth this season shows how Irish players can learn from overseas acquisitions like Rabah Slimani. “I’ve been kind of understudy to Tadhg for a good few years now. He’s consistently been probably the best tighthead in the world over the last few years. It’s been unbelievable being there, just around him. “Rabah’s come in and probably offered something a bit different, where he’s 100 per cent scrum. Tadhg obviously has an array of different stuff that he brings to it, whereas Rabah, when you’re scrumming against him in training, it’s all or nothing against him. It’s been a different kind of experience with him, but I’ve felt I’ve come out the other end well.” Clarkson retained his starting place at tighthead in the URC quarter-final, semi-final and final wins, before playing against Georgia and Portugal. That Saturday night in Lisbon, he thought his breakthrough season was done until he received a text from Andy Farrell at 3am. “We were on a night out; I had to go home straight away. But yeah, some text to get. It was like: ‘ring me when you’re awake’, so I said: ‘Oh yeah, grand’. Then Paulie [O’Connell] rang me and was like: ‘Ring him right now’. So yeah, I had to just compose myself and go outside. I told Jack Boyle and then just legged it.” Sadly, social media can be a nasty world, and on foot of the backlash to him and Jamie Osborne being called up, Clarkson opted to ignore it. “I feel like the last few weeks in Leinster, before the semi-final, was fairly negative. I just tried to use that as a bit of motivation. I knew, just because Jamie got called in right before me, there was a bit of backlash to that. So, I knew it was going to be even more when I got the nod. So yeah, I just tried to stay away from it.” “It was a bit of a shock at the start, to be honest. You grow up using social media. It was hard to step away from it. But I just had to get rid of a lot of that.” Clarkson admits that linking up with the Lions at short notice was a good deal easier for him than the late Scottish call-ups given his familiarity with so many players and coaches, not least Andy Farrell and John Fogarty. On Tuesday morning Fogarty told Clarkson that his form for Leinster merited his call-up and encouraged him to continue that form into the match that night, so building up his confidence. “I felt like I was chasing my tail a little bit, but happy enough with the scrum and I made a few tackles. It was a good start.” To make Clarkson’s landmark night even better, his father Finbarr made it out in time for Tuesday’s match. “I think he knew if he was going to be here for any game, it would be this game. So yeah, he legged it down.” All the while in the mixed zone, he still had his Lions cap in his grasp, which had been given to him by Ieuen Evans. “It’s crazy, 886,” he says, of his number in Lions’ playing history. “I didn’t even know they did caps if you don’t play in the Test.” He’s a Lion now all right.

Title: Italian call a distant memory for new Lion Clarkson

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist As Thomas Clarkson stood in Melbourne's Marvel Stadium, clutching his newly minted British and Irish Lions cap, he reflected on a sliding doors moment from two years earlier. Fun fact: The 25-year-old's full name is actually Tommaso Clarkson, with his mother Nina Cafolla coming from a small town between Rome and Naples. At the start of the 2023/24 season, the Italians came calling. Clarkson turned down the offer, but with the tighthead prop yet to get his full break at Leinster, his qualification to play for Italy was kept in his back pocket, just in case. "They came looking for me, but I'd just signed a new contract with Leinster," he said, after making his Lions debut against the First Nations and Pasifika XV on Tuesday night. "I thought it could be open at some point down the line, but obviously, this year it's gone very well." It's been a fast 12 months for Clarkson. A run of games to start the season, and injuries elsewhere, saw him brought into the Ireland squad for the first time in November as a training panellist. He was retained after the training camp and impressed in two appearances off the bench against Argentina and Fiji. More big appearances came in the Champions Cup, and four more Irish caps followed in the Six Nations, before he produced arguably his best Leinster performance in their URC final win against the Bulls, a game he says was the moment where he believes he arrived. "It all kind of just clicked [that day] and then kept that momentum going," he said. "That was the first game when I was like, 'that was a proper performance’." He thought he finished the season with two more Irish caps against Georgia and Portugal, scoring a try in the second of those wins, and it was while celebrating that victory with a few beers in the early hours of the morning in Lisbon that he received an urgent message from Andy Farrell. "It was like: ‘ring me when you’re awake’, so I said ‘oh yeah, grand’. Then Paulie [Paul O’Connell] rang me and was like, ‘ring him right now!’ "So yeah, I had to just compose myself and go outside. "I told Jack Boyle and then just legged it." His dream Lions call-up wasn’t met with universal warmth outside of Ireland, mainly due to the him being the 18th Irish international drafted in by Farrell on this tour, and the third tighthead prop. Farrell made a point of namechecking Clarkson (above) after last night’s game, insisting he was very much the "next cab on the rank" when he was called into the group, and the player says that message has been drilled into him by the coaching staff. "It wasn't a kind of ‘nepo’ selection if you’d call it that," Clarkson added. "It was just nice to hear going into it. We were bouncing into the game. "I benefited from Tadhg [Furlong] being injured at the end of the season, definitely benefited from that. "But I'd like to think I took the opportunity. "I've been kind of understudied to Tadhg for a good few years now. He's consistently been probably the best tighthead in the world over the last few years. "It's been unbelievable being there, just around him. "Rabah’s [Rabah Slimani] come in, probably offered something a bit different, where he's 100% scrum. "Tadhg obviously has an array of different stuff that he brings to it. Whereas Rabah, when you're scrumming against him in training, it's all or nothing." While the breaks have fallen his way this season, he served a long apprenticeship at the province, in large part down to playing behind Furlong, as well as Michael Ala’alatoa in previous years. Remarkably, he was lining out for Blackrock College in Division 1B of the Energia All-Ireland League as recently as January 2024. Asked if he though playing for the Lions was on the cards even six months ago, he admitted "not a hope!". "I made my Leinster debut five years ago now, so I've been waiting a long time," he said. "The fact that when it has come, it's all come at once is a bit crazy. Because I went through a good few years of not getting a sniff in at all really. So yeah, it’s mad. "I put a lot of work into getting it, so any time I did get a shot, there was a whole lot of work behind it. So it felt like it just kind of rolled into another. "Once I got a foot in the door, I think I was trying to open it fully." Barring a couple of injuries, it’s likely Clarkson has now finally finished his gruelling, 27-game season, and will head home with something to remember it by. "It’s crazy, 886," he says, repeating the number stitched into his red and gold Lions cap after Tuesday’s win. "I didn't even know they did caps if you don't play in the Test. It's some energy."

Business FILE PHOTO: Representations of cryptocurrencies are seen in front of displayed decreasing stock graph in this illustration taken November 10, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File photo NEW YORK :Tokenization has long been a buzzword for crypto enthusiasts, who have been arguing for years that blockchain-based assets will change the underlying infrastructure of financial markets. The technology is seen as rapidly increasing in coming years, especially in the U.S., helped by the passage of three new bills. President Donald Trump's administration has eased regulation of the broader crypto industry, paving the way for a boom in the valuation of companies in the sector and the rapid growth of crypto-related securities. However, the growth of the market for tokenized assets has been far slower than expected in recent years, with many projects still in their infancy or not yet live. HOW DOES TOKENIZATION WORK?

Title: The stock market is on a hot streak. It’s about to face a huge test | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Six months into President Donald Trump’s second term, a quick glance at the stock market offers a reassuring picture: The S&P 500 just closed above 6,300 points for the first time ever and has notched eight record highs in the past month. If you look at markets halfway into the year, it might not be apparent that there has been unprecedented trade turmoil, conflict in the Middle East and relentless attacks on the Federal Reserve’s independence. The stock market and bitcoin have soared to record highs, while bonds have resumed a steady rally and volatility in oil prices has subsided. Global markets so far this year have been remarkably resilient. The calm mood on Wall Street is an extraordinary change from early April, when the S&P 500 hit its lowest level in over a year and was on the precipice of a bear market after Trump unveiled his initial “Liberation Day” tariffs. “Perhaps the move by US stocks off the early-April lows is emblematic of the age-old adage about bull markets often climbing a ‘wall of worry,’” Liz Ann Sonders and Kevin Gordon, investment strategists at Charles Schwab, said in a note. “There is no shortage of things to worry about; but that’s the wall markets often climb.” Markets are floating near record highs despite underlying tariff uncertainty. While investors have begun to shrug off a myriad of concerns, US stocks are trading at historically expensive valuations as Trump’s self-imposed August 1 tariff deadline approaches. As Trump presses forward with his trade war, markets’ momentum will face a tariff test. “What has held stocks aloft … is the premise that whatever tariff increases come on August 1, they will not be permanent,” Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group, said in a note. “The prospect that ‘deals’ will be struck thereafter remains a factor, we believe, in keeping traders from selling stocks more aggressively,” Wizman said. Jeff Buchbinder and Adam Turnquist, strategists at LPL Financial, said in a note that the S&P 500’s “unusually sharp and swift ‘V-shaped recovery’” from its low point in early April was “one of the most powerful post-correction rebounds in stock market history.” The ferocity of the market’s recovery has raised questions about whether it is supported by fundamentals — or if underlying weakness could arise. While the market experienced bouts of enormous volatility in recent months, stocks continue to push higher. The S&P 500 is up 5.2% since Trump took office. Trump has acknowledged the market’s rebound. The president earlier this month told NBC News that “tariffs have been very well received,” noting that the “stock market hit a new high.” The “softening” of initial tariff announcements has “removed the worst-case scenarios” for outlooks for economic growth and inflation, investors at BlackRock said in a note, which has supported the market’s rally. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers trading platform, told CNN that the rally has also been driven by momentum and a fear of missing out. “Ever since the president’s about-face in early April that turned the market around, a lot of money has been made basically by investors assuming that these tariffs will be postponed, renegotiated or otherwise watered down,” Sosnick said. “And if there’s a trade that works very well for people over a long period of time, they’re going to keep doing it.” Meanwhile, bitcoin last week surged to a record high above $123,000 as Republicans in Congress pressed forward with landmark legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies. Economists at the consultancy Capital Economics said in a note that they think the “US economy will weather the global trade war,” enabling the S&P 500 to rise further. However, they said, Trump’s “unpredictable approach” to trade and attacks on the Fed’s independence could “trigger” a downturn in stocks. “The widespread assumption among market participants still appears to be that the president will not follow through on threats to raise tariffs much further and that Chair Powell will remain in place, but that may prove too optimistic,” they said. The S&P 500 has not posted a gain or loss of more than 1% since June 24. It’s a sign that momentum has slowed down. Bitcoin traded around $119,000 as of Tuesday. Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors, said she thinks markets might be complacent about potential risks, given stocks are historically expensive. While stocks and bonds have emerged relatively unscathed, one outlier is the US dollar, which has continued a precipitous decline. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six major foreign currencies, is down almost 11% since Trump took office. Gold and silver, meanwhile, have continued to serve as hedges against Trump’s trade uncertainty. The yellow and silver precious metals have soared 30% and 35% this year, respectively. The rally in recent months has been driven by retail investors, or individuals buying their own stocks, as opposed to Wall Street institutions, according to Venu Krishna, an equity strategist at Barclays. “Re-risking by institutional money remains muted, making it likely that retail investors were at the helm for the latest leg of the rally,” Krishna said. He estimates retail investors poured more than $50 billion into global stocks across the past month. Investors who bought the dip when markets dropped in April have been rewarded with an extraordinary march to fresh highs. The S&P 500 has gained almost 27% since its low point in April. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has soared almost 37%. Related article Wall Street is calling Trump’s bluff The smaller Nasdaq 100 has gone 62 days without crossing below its 20-day moving average, which is the second longest streak on record after a 77-day streak in 1999, according to Jonathan Krinsky, chief markets technician at investment firm BTIG. And Wall Street money that has been on the sidelines has been creeping back into the market. A survey of global fund managers in July by Bank of America showed the biggest surge in “risk appetite” on record. The survey also showed the most bullish sentiment since February. Ethan Harris, a market watcher and former economist at Bank of America, said in a post on LinkedIn that Trump’s tariff announcements could be characterized as “Trump always tries again,” as opposed to “Trump always chickens out.” “His aggressive announcements are a way to test what he can ‘get away with,’” Harris said. “Hence the steady flow of new threats, partial retreats and then more threats.” As stocks hold near record highs as Trump’s trade deadline approaches, it remains to be seen whether markets will push back on the president’s plan to disrupt international trade. “The bond vigilantes may or may not have started to make a comeback this year,” Harris said. “Will the stock market become the trade war vigilante or remain complacent?” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Strategic Plan for the United States to Accumulate 4 Million Bitcoin
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2025/07/23/strategic-plan-for-the-united-states-to-accumulate-4-million-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T06:25:26Z

Executive Summary The United States is embarking on a bold, 15-year strategic initiative to accumulate 4 million Bitcoin (BTC) as a national asset. This visionary plan spans short-term (1–3 years) foundational actions, mid-term (4–7 years) expansion, and long-term (8–15 years) consolidation. It mobilizes all sectors – federal and state governments, private corporations, financial institutions, the tech industry, and individual citizens – in a coordinated effort. The strategy is funded through innovative, budget-neutral mechanisms (leveraging existing reserves, redirected budgets, public-private investment, and blockchain-related revenues) and emphasizes ethical, legal acquisition methods (mining, market investment, ETFs, voluntary pooling, and international partnerships). Strategic objectives include enhancing economic resilience, diversifying national reserves, cementing blockchain technology leadership, and strengthening national security. This plan anticipates and addresses challenges such as market impact, global competition, regulatory frameworks, and environmental sustainability. The following report details a roadmap for this initiative, with clear milestones, roles for each stakeholder, and an inspirational vision of American leadership in the digital asset era. Introduction: A New Frontier in National Economic Strategy Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” has matured from a niche experiment into a credible strategic asset on the global stage . With its permanently capped supply of 21 million BTC, Bitcoin’s scarcity and security present a unique opportunity for nations that move early to incorporate it into their reserves . Just as the U.S. historically accumulated gold and foreign currency reserves, the time has come to thoughtfully manage national ownership of digital assets for prosperity . Other countries and forward-looking leaders have begun to recognize Bitcoin’s potential. The United States itself holds a significant amount of Bitcoin from forfeitures, but until recently had no comprehensive strategy to leverage these holdings . A turning point came with high-level proposals and actions in 2024–2025, including calls for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and legislation to acquire substantial BTC for the Treasury . These moves signaled that Bitcoin is entering the halls of U.S. fiscal policy as a long-term store of value and hedge against inflation . Why 4 million Bitcoin? This ambitious target – roughly 20% of Bitcoin’s eventual supply – would position America as the world’s largest Bitcoin holder, securing a dominant stake in the digital asset that could shape the future of finance. Holding such a reserve over decades is envisioned to strengthen the dollar’s resilience, hedge against economic volatility, and even help address the national debt by capitalizing on Bitcoin’s historical growth trajectory . While bold, this goal is in line with America’s tradition of thinking big and leading in new frontiers, from the space race to the internet revolution. Core Values and Principles: This strategy aligns with U.S. values of innovation, free enterprise, and individual liberty. It relies on voluntary, market-driven participation rather than coercion – there will be no forced appropriation of private Bitcoin holdings. Instead, the government will incentivize and inspire collective action. Transparency, rule of law, and respect for property rights will be upheld at every step. By embracing Bitcoin within a legal and ethical framework, the U.S. will demonstrate how democratic societies can innovate responsibly in the blockchain era. The following sections lay out the strategic objectives guiding this plan, the stakeholders involved and their roles, a phased roadmap across short, mid, and long-term horizons, funding sources and mechanisms, and considerations to mitigate risks. This comprehensive approach ensures that by 15 years from now, the United States will have not only accumulated 4 million BTC, but also solidified its position as the global leader in the digital asset economy – fostering prosperity, security, and technological leadership for generations to come. Strategic Objectives 1. Economic Resilience and Inflation Hedge Build a more resilient economy by holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin’s provable scarcity makes it akin to a digital commodity that cannot be inflated at will . By allocating a portion of national reserves to BTC, the U.S. can protect wealth against currency debasement and reduce reliance on any single foreign creditor or currency. Over time, Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation (historically averaging ~55% annually ) offers the potential to strengthen the national balance sheet and even help pay down public debt as its value grows . This financial buffer would enhance stability during economic downturns or crises, providing a store of value that is uncorrelated to traditional markets and immune to foreign political influence . 2. Digital Reserve Diversification Complement traditional reserves (such as gold and foreign currencies) with digital reserves. Establishing a Bitcoin reserve diversifies the nation’s holdings into a 21st-century asset class . Just as gold bolsters confidence in a country’s financial footing, Bitcoin – with its decentralized, transparent network – can serve as a trust anchor in an increasingly digital global economy. A U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would be a portfolio diversifier and innovation signal , reducing dependence on dollar-centric systems while positioning the nation for a future where digital assets play a key role in global finance . This diversification is pragmatic: it hedges against potential weakness in other reserves and embraces the evolving monetary landscape. 3. Technological Leadership and Innovation Assert American leadership in blockchain technology and the emerging digital economy. A national effort to accumulate Bitcoin goes hand-in-hand with promoting innovation in the underlying technologies – from cybersecurity and cryptography to financial technology. By actively engaging with Bitcoin, the U.S. signals that it is the best place to develop and deploy blockchain innovations, attracting talent and investment. Strategic Bitcoin accumulation is a “statement of alignment with a digitally native economic future,” providing a blueprint that encourages private sector adoption and innovation . This objective includes fostering a robust domestic cryptocurrency industry, supporting research in energy-efficient mining and scalability, and setting global standards for blockchain use. Ultimately, it’s about ensuring the next generation of tech companies and protocols are made in America, securing our role as the global hub of blockchain development. 4. National Security and Geopolitical Influence Enhance national security by preventing strategic adversaries from dominating the crypto realm and by leveraging Bitcoin as a geopolitical asset. In the 21st century, economic security is national security. If Bitcoin and other digital assets become integral to the world financial system, the U.S. must not fall behind. A substantial BTC reserve gives America greater influence over the future of decentralized finance, much as our gold reserves bolstered our clout in the 20th century. It also acts as a neutral reserve asset that could reinforce alliances (for example, through coordinated accumulation or exchange agreements with allies) and provide options in sanction regimes or international aid (using BTC for humanitarian payments where traditional systems fail). By leading in Bitcoin ownership, the U.S. can help set global norms (for transparency, anti-money-laundering, cyber defense) and ensure that open societies, not authoritarian regimes, shape the rules of digital finance. As Senator Cynthia Lummis noted, Bitcoin’s strategic importance for the country is such that some call it “manifest destiny for the United States” – a new frontier to secure for the nation’s freedom and prosperity. These objectives are interlocking and mutually reinforcing. Economic strength supports security; technological leadership fuels economic growth; reserve diversification aids resilience; and all enhance America’s standing in the world. With the “why” established, we now turn to the “how” – the stakeholders and strategies that will deliver on these objectives. Key Stakeholders and Their Roles Achieving a goal as ambitious as accumulating 4 million BTC requires a “whole-of-America” approach, engaging public and private sectors as well as individual citizens. Each stakeholder group has unique strengths to contribute: All these actors will coordinate under a shared vision. A National Digital Assets Task Force can be established to ensure communication and synergy between federal agencies, state governments, industry leaders, and community representatives. Regular summits and progress reports will keep everyone aligned. The message is clear: every American can be part of this endeavor, and everyone stands to benefit from the innovation, wealth creation, and security enhancements it will bring. Strategic Roadmap by Timeframe The journey to 4 million Bitcoin is mapped out in three phases – short-term, mid-term, and long-term – each with specific initiatives and milestones. This phased approach ensures steady progress while allowing assessment and course-correction at each stage. Importantly, actions are designed to minimize market disruption (accumulating gradually and via multiple avenues) and remain flexible to technological and economic developments. Short-Term (1–3 Years): Laying the Foundation Goals (1–3 years): Establish the legal, institutional, and infrastructural groundwork for large-scale Bitcoin accumulation. Kickstart the reserve with existing assets, enact supportive policies, and galvanize private sector involvement – all while raising public awareness. Early moves are budget-neutral or low-cost, relying on reallocated resources and voluntary participation to avoid burdening taxpayers. Milestones for Phase 1: With the foundation laid and early momentum achieved, the stage is set to accelerate into the mid-term phase. Mid-Term (4–7 Years): Scaling Up and Integration Goals (4–7 years): Rapidly scale the accumulation efforts while integrating Bitcoin more deeply into U.S. economic structures. In this phase, the aim is to go from hundreds of thousands of BTC to millions of BTC under American ownership. The federal government, having proven the concept and established trust in phase 1, can expand its holdings more aggressively (market conditions permitting), and the private sector’s involvement becomes self-sustaining. This phase will likely coincide with greater global attention – both cooperation and competition – which the U.S. must navigate wisely. Milestones for Phase 2: At the end of the mid-term phase, the U.S. should be well on its way to the 4 million BTC goal, possibly around halfway there, and the foundations of a crypto-powered economy fully laid. The final phase will focus on securing the gains and leveraging them for enduring advantage. Long-Term (8–15 Years): Leadership, Preservation, and Prosperity Goals (8–15 years): By this phase, the United States envisions reaching the 4 million BTC target and solidifying the permanence of Bitcoin in its national asset mix. The focus shifts from aggressive accumulation to sustainable management and utilization of the reserve as needed for the national interest (without ever undermining Bitcoin’s ecosystem). America’s leadership in the blockchain space should be unquestioned by year 15, and the strategic Bitcoin reserve serves as a foundation for economic strength, much like gold did in previous eras. This period also involves adapting to any new developments (technological, geopolitical) that could affect our Bitcoin strategy. Milestones for Phase 3: Funding Sources and Mechanisms A variety of funding sources and mechanisms are employed across these phases to finance Bitcoin accumulation in a sustainable, ethical manner. Below is a summary of key funding approaches, emphasizing creativity and public-private collaboration: All these funding sources share a common theme: they are ethical, transparent, and largely voluntary/market-driven. The plan pointedly avoids any coercive measures like forced confiscation or heavy new taxation that would contradict the values of a free economy. By tapping into existing value, future growth, and willing participation, the U.S. can accumulate Bitcoin in a way that strengthens rather than burdens the nation. It’s worth noting that as Bitcoin’s price potentially grows, the dollar cost of reaching 4 million BTC will increase. Thus, early funding (short-term) gets more “bang for buck” in BTC terms, while later on the focus might shift to maximizing value of holdings rather than chasing a numeric BTC total at any cost. Flexibility in funding strategy will be maintained – if Bitcoin’s market is overheated, the U.S. can pause buys and rely more on mining or wait for corrections, for example. Ethical, Legal, and Security Considerations A plan of this magnitude raises important ethical and legal considerations, which are addressed proactively to ensure the initiative upholds American values and the rule of law: In summary, the ethical and legal framework surrounding this strategy is robust: voluntary, transparent, lawful, and responsible. The plan is designed to amplify the best of American capitalism and democracy – using open markets and free choice to achieve a national goal – while putting checks in place to curb excesses or missteps. This strategic journey will be one carried out in the public eye, inviting input and scrutiny, which will only strengthen its execution. Conclusion: A Future-Focused Vision for American Prosperity Fifteen years from now, Americans will look back on this initiative as a pivotal chapter in our nation’s economic story – the moment we seized the opportunity of a digital frontier and made it our own. By accumulating 4 million bitcoins, the United States positions itself not only to benefit from the growth of a revolutionary asset but also to steer that revolution in accordance with our values of freedom, transparency, and innovation. This comprehensive plan harnesses the collective power of federal resolve, state creativity, private sector dynamism, and individual enthusiasm. It is inspirational and optimistic by design: it says that America’s best days are not behind us, but ahead on a new horizon of blockchain technology and digital finance. Just as past generations rallied to ambitious national endeavors – building the transcontinental railroad, landing on the moon, inventing the internet – we too rally to make the U.S. the guiding light in the crypto era. By pursuing this strategy, the U.S. will enjoy a more resilient and diversified economy, new waves of tech entrepreneurship, and a strengthened geopolitical hand. We will have shown that embracing change, rather than fearing it, is the surest path to long-term prosperity and security. The strategic Bitcoin reserve, once a novel idea, will become a cornerstone of national strength – a digital complement to Fort Knox, symbolizing American ingenuity in the 21st century. There will undoubtedly be challenges along the way: market fluctuations, technical hurdles, perhaps political debates. But as laid out, we have plans to navigate these – cautiously, transparently, and boldly when needed. The involvement of all stakeholders means this vision does not belong to one party or administration, but to all Americans. It can and should unite us in common purpose, much like great infrastructure or exploration projects of the past. In conclusion, this strategic plan is more than an economic play – it’s a statement to the world that America remains the land of forward-looking visionaries, unafraid to invest in the future. It invites every citizen, entrepreneur, and public servant to be a part of forging a new legacy. Together, we are not just accumulating coins; we are building a foundation of economic freedom, technological leadership, and national renewal that will support the American Dream for generations to come. Let us proceed with confidence, creativity, and unity on this path. The digital frontier is ours to lead – and in doing so, we will secure the blessings of prosperity and security for ourselves and our posterity, in the true spirit of the United States of America.

Key points: Bitcoinâs path to $200,000 hinges on sustained buying volume, which analysts say is still lacking. Trumpâs presidency has already accelerated Bitcoinâs adoption through policies favoring crypto and fiscal expansion. Institutional demand via ETFs and geopolitical uncertainty are driving Bitcoinâs appeal as a "digital gold" alternative. Historical patterns suggest Bitcoinâs current cycle may have limited months of growth left before stabilization. The $200,000 question: Patience or pipe dream? James Checkâs analysis cuts through the hype. While Bitcoin breached 120,000 in July 2024, he insists the journey to 200,000 requires "stages of stability," not just spikes. "Trading through air" without solid support risks a nosedive, he cautionsâa reminder of cryptoâs volatile soul. Yet his long-term faith is unshaken: five years out, he envisions Bitcoin "well and truly" surpassing $200,000, a belief mirrored by firms like Bernstein Research and Bitwise. The paradox? Retail euphoria clashes with institutional pragmatism. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved in early 2024, have funneled billions into the market, but Check waits for "volume kick-in" before betting big. "No one knows" Bitcoinâs exact path, he admitsâa humble mantra in an industry obsessed with crystal balls. Trumpâs wildcard: Crypto politics meets fiscal fireworks Enter Donald Trump and the economic wins since then. A November 2024 victory rewrote Bitcoinâs playbook. JPMorgan notes Trumpâs pro-crypto stanceâpledging to dethrone SEC chair Gary Gensler and embrace "debt debasement" via tariffs and fiscal spendingâmight turbocharge the "debasement trade." Imagine small Bitcoin handouts to citizens or a White House push for a $1 trillion market cap. Such moves could divert attention from gold, reshaping portfolios worldwide. But Trumpâs policies are a double-edged sword. Expansionary fiscal measures might fuel inflation, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more appealing. Yet regulatory clarity could lure institutional players, stabilizing Bitcoinâs notoriously mercurial markets. Reaching a $200,000 Bitcoin Reaching a $200,000 per Bitcoin price would require a combination of technical, macroeconomic, and psychological factors driving demand higher than supply. Based on Kendrick's projections and historical Bitcoin market cycles, hereâs what would likely need to happen: 1. Sustained Bull Market Momentum Bitcoin is in the "euphoria phase" of a bull run, where FOMO (fear of missing out) drives rapid price appreciation. A continuation of this trend for 12â24 months could propel BTC toward $200K, especially if institutional and retail demand remains strong. 2. Supply Shock & Halving Dynamics The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced the new supply of BTC by 50%. Historically, halvings trigger major bull runs ~12â18 months later due to reduced selling pressure from miners. If demand remains constant or increases while new supply shrinks, scarcity could push prices toward $200K or higher. 3. Institutional Adoption & ETF Approvals Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals (e.g., BlackRock, Fidelity) would funnel trillions in institutional capital into BTC. Major corporations adding BTC to balance sheets (MicroStrategy-style moves) would further squeeze supply. 4. Macroeconomic Tailwinds A weaker U.S. dollar (due to rate cuts, inflation, or debt crises) would make Bitcoin more attractive as hard money. Geopolitical instability (e.g., currency collapses, wars) could drive "safe-haven" demand. 5. Network & Ecosystem Growth Layer-2 adoption (Lightning Network, Ordinals) increases BTCâs utility, attracting more users. Regulatory clarity (e.g., pro-crypto laws) reduces uncertainty, encouraging capital inflows. History whispers: Cycles, shocks, and the retail reckoning Bitcoinâs past cycles offer cryptic clues. Rekt Capital flags 2020âs patternsâif repeated, Bitcoinâs 2024 bull run might exhaust itself by mid-2025. Meanwhile, supply shocks loom. Bitwiseâs Matt Hougan points to institutional demand outstripping new Bitcoin minted post-halving, a recipe for price explosions. Retail investors, burned by 2022âs crash, are tiptoeing back. September 2024 saw ETF inflows revive after Augustâs slump, signaling renewed faith. But as CME futures open interest quadruples in 2024, the question lingers: Is this institutional confidence or speculative froth? Beyond charts and elections, Bitcoinâs saga taps into a deeper hungerâfor financial autonomy amid distrust of centralized systems. The original vision of decentralization battles against Wall Streetâs embrace, a tension Check acknowledges. "The market needs stabilized," he says, voicing a quiet plea for maturity in an adolescent asset class. Whether 2025 becomes Bitcoinâs coronation or another chapter in its volatile epic, one truth endures: in a world of shaky currencies and political turmoil, people crave alternatives. Bitcoin, while it may be more risky than ever, it continues to provide unyielding gains. Will it continue to be the lifeline to combat inflation in the coming years?

A November 2024 victory rewrote Bitcoinâs playbook. JPMorgan notes Trumpâs pro-crypto stanceâpledging to dethrone SEC chair Gary Gensler and embrace "debt debasement" via tariffs and fiscal spendingâmight turbocharge the "debasement trade." Imagine small Bitcoin handouts to citizens or a White House push for a $1 trillion market cap. Such moves could divert attention from gold, reshaping portfolios worldwide. But Trumpâs policies are a double-edged sword. Expansionary fiscal measures might fuel inflation, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more appealing.

Title: ONDO price rallies on 21Shares’ ETF filing and major exchange listing
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/ondo-price-rallies-on-21shares-etf-filing-and-major-exchange-listing/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T05:27:37Z

Ondo Finance’s native coin signals imminent breakouts despite the broad market cool down, fueled by two key developments. First and foremost, asset manager 21Shares has filed with the US SEC to launch an ONDO exchange-traded fund (ETF). Secondly, Binance US confirmed listing the altcoin, with trading starting today, July 23. ONDO soared from the daily low of $1.0583 to $1.1642, a 10% increase, as the bullish news sparked bullish momentum. ONDO is at the center of Ondo Finance’s goal of bringing traditional assets on-chain. With interest in real-world asset (RWA) platforms skyrocketing, 21Shares and Binance US’ moves could not be better as retail and institutional investors seek Ondo exposure. The crypto has witnessed a surge in institutional appetite, with giants like BlackRock showing interest. MasterCard tapped Ondo Finance as its first RWA provider, while Ripple leveraged the blockchain to launch OUSG on its XRPL. 21Shares increases Ondo’s institutional appeal with the latest ETF application. JUST IN: 21SHARES FILES FOR $ONDO ETF WITH U.S. SEC — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) July 22, 2025 The move confirms that traditional finance (TradiFi) is targeting the tokenization sector seriously. Moreover, seeking SEC authorization underscores the asset manager’s commitment to compliance and innovation in the tokenized sector of RWAs and DeFi. This is more than another cryptocurrency product. Ondo Finance remains at the core of the current trend of bringing real-world assets like US Treasuries, credit instruments, and bonds on-chain. Last week, Ondo Finance collaborated with BNB Chain to introduce tokenized equities in the United States. 21Shares’ proposed exchange-traded fund would offer cryptocurrency enthusiasts exposure to ONDO via licensed platforms, without brokerage sites. A leading crypto exchange in the United States, Binance US, confirmed listing Ondo Finance’s token on its trading platform. It opened deposits on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain yesterday, with ONDO/USDT trading set to start today. The official announcement read: We’re excited to announce that ONDO is now listed on Binance.US! Deposits for ONDO on the Ethereum network are now open. Trading for ONDO/USDT will begin tomorrow, July 23, 2025, at 4 a.m. / 7 a.m. EDT. Deposits for $ONDO are now open on https://t.co/AZwoBOgsqS! Trading on the ONDO/USDT pair will begin on July 23 at 7 a.m. EDT.@OndoFoundation is a project that brings institutional-grade financial products onchain by tokenizing real-world assets.https://t.co/oTqaNwyhtO pic.twitter.com/QM5nJpn5hK — Binance.US 🇺🇸 (@BinanceUS) July 22, 2025 The listing is vital as it makes the ONDO token accessible to the massive American retail audience. Moreover, listing on leading exchanges often acts as a Launchpad for many tokens. More US citizens can now trade ONDO without depending on overseas platforms or decentralized exchanges. Ondo Finance’s native coin attracted attention amidst the optimistic developments. It trades at $1.11 after a brief correction from daily highs. Meanwhile, the surging 24-hour trading volume highlights renewed interest in the RWA token, hinting at continued uptrend. Technical indicators support the short-term momentum shift. For example, the MACD on the 3H chart displays green histograms after a bullish crossover, signaling a buyer comeback. Also, the Chaikin Money Flow shows increased ONDO accumulation over the past week. Such trends indicate trust in the token’s near-term performance. Ondo Finance bull target the late January price levels above $1.60. Overcoming this level could catalyze smooth gains to the psychological level at $2.

Title: Grayscale’s ETF chief David LaValle to leave ahead of company’s IPO: Unchained
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/grayscale-etf-leadership-ipo/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T04:04:15Z
Full Content:
Share this article Grayscale’s global head of ETFs, David LaValle, is stepping down at the end of July, closing out a four-year chapter marked by key milestones in the firm’s crypto ETF push, including the conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF, Unchained reported Tuesday. LaValle joined Grayscale in August 2021 when its flagship Bitcoin fund held approximately $25 billion in assets, making it the world’s largest crypto asset manager at the time. In August 2023, Grayscale won a landmark victory over the SEC, which laid important legal groundwork for the eventual approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and opened the door for asset managers to ramp up efforts to bring other crypto funds to Wall Street. But the court victory also set the stage for intensified competition. It allowed fund management giants, including BlackRock and Fidelity, to enter the crypto ETF space with confidence. With the launch of their own Bitcoin ETFs at far lower management fees, these industry titans quickly attracted institutional capital and retail investors. Grayscale’s Bitcoin and Ethereum products, which generate the majority of its income, charge fees of 1.5% and 2.5% respectively. In comparison, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF charges 0.25%. Grayscale has since lost its position as the world’s largest crypto asset manager to BlackRock, which now manages nearly $88 billion in its iShares Bitcoin Trust. GBTC’s assets currently stand at approximately $22 billion. LaValle’s departure comes as Grayscale is gearing toward an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. The company confidentially submitted a draft registration statement to the SEC last week. Apart from going public, Grayscale is also seeking approval to launch numerous spot crypto ETFs, including those tied to Ethereum, Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, Cardano, and other leading digital assets. Earlier this month, the SEC approved Grayscale’s application to convert the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into an ETF through staff’s delegated authority. However, just one day after this approval, the SEC’s commissioners decided to stay the approval for an internal review, effectively halting the fund’s launch temporarily.

Title: Ethereum Off The Hook: SEC Chair Rules ETH A Commodity, Not A Security

According to CNBC, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the Commission treats Ethereum like Bitcoin. He made it clear that securities laws won’t apply to the digital coin. He also noted that this view remains informal until a formal rule‑making is complete. In his words, “Similar to Bitcoin, the SEC has stated informally more than formally that ether is not a security.” That statement gave many investors relief and drove fresh buying by big firms. Paul Atkins: ETH Is Not a Security, Digital Assets Are Being Embraced by the Market Paul Atkins, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov), stated that the SEC “informally” considers Ethereum (ETH) not to be a security.

Industry leaders joined to discuss which federal laws apply to crypto. Under Gary Gensler, the agency probed tokens for possible securities status, but never gave a straight answer on ether. Now Atkins says Ethereum is seen as a commodity. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has long said Ether and Bitcoin are commodities. Yet uncertainty lingers around whether staking rewards count as income or tokens. Major companies are stacking up Ether on their balance sheets. BTCS, SharpLink Gaming and Gamesquare lead the pack. They’ve added millions of dollars’ worth of ETH in recent weeks. One startup, Ether Machine, plans a public debut backed by $1.6 billion in Ethereum capital. That figure shows how confident some treasury teams have become. ETF Flows Break Records And Prices Follow ETH‑focused funds have smashed their daily inflow records. Based on ETF data, new money into ethereum products hit an all‑time high this month. The buzz around these vehicles has pushed Ether’s price to $3,639. It’s up over 24% in the last seven days. Traders say they see more room to grow if regulators stick to Atkins’ remarks. Applications for Ethereum staking ETFs remain on hold. BlackRock filed its proposal months ago, but the SEC has delayed any green light. Some companies worry that staking payouts could be deemed securities or income under tax laws. CFTC head Rostin Behnam continues to back the view of Ether as a commodity. But without clear SEC guidance, players in DeFi and staking pools face unanswered questions.

Title: Why Does Raising the Retirement Age Hurt Young People?

A friend forwarded me a Twitter conversation he thought I would find interesting. The thread started innocuously enough. Lyman Stone was responding to Moses Sternstein analysis about the COVID "pull-forward" retirement wave: millions of people who retired earlier than planned during the pandemic, creating the "labor shortage" that drove wages and inflation up. "What I love about this is how clearly it reveals a fundamental problem: When retirees KEEP WORKING, the effect on career progress and wages for younger workers is... NEGATIVE! Which is why raising the retirement age will not balance Social Security as much as OASDI predicts." He made an interesting claim: "In fact, virtually all cuts to Social Security work this way: if you reduce Social Security, retirees keep working longer, employers are hesitant to fire senior workers, etc. One of many interactions OASDI does not actually entertain!" Stone had articulated something I'd been sensing but couldn't quite name. The standard rhetoric used to justify Social Security cuts and increase retirement ages completely ignores how those cuts destroy younger workers' careers. When someone asked him for solutions, his answer was blunt: "There's no solution except higher birth rates or rapid productivity growth." The idea of delayed retirement crushes young workers' advancement prospects seems like a no brainer (that somehow never brought up in debates on raising the retirement age of Social Security), but something else is still missing. This Substack is reader-supported. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Share The Narrative: By every traditional measure, this should be a golden age for young workers. Unemployment (U3) sits at 4.1%. Business formation hit records with over 5.5 million new companies registered in 2023 alone. GDP growth remains robust. Young people are told they have options: get a college degree for white-collar work, or skip the debt and go into trades for "more secure" jobs with six-figure salaries, freedom to work for yourself, and hands-on skills that can't be outsourced to AI. The Reality: Workers under 40 report feeling trapped in "career purgatory." We are seeing a rise of long-term unemployment, declining hiring rates, and college graduates struggling to find work even in jobs that don't require degrees. Career advancement feels nearly impossible. Home ownership and family formation rates continue declining among young adults. If you are unemployed, you face Great Recession-level risks of long-term unemployment, and if you become long-term unemployed, the prospects for recovery are dire with a good chance it's just game over. The crisis now affects both paths young people were told to follow. Graduate unemployment has climbed above the overall unemployment rate for the first time on record. Male graduate unemployment rose from less than 5% to 7% over the past 12 months, completely erasing the college employability premium. Recently graduated young men are now unemployed at the same rate as their non-graduate counterparts. But the trades aren't offering refuge either. Despite the narrative about trade jobs being safer, building inspectors, electricians, and plumbers face unemployment rates of 7.2%, more than three times that of (formerly) entry-level office jobs like budget analysts. Trade roles dominate the bottom of rankings for best entry-level jobs, with welders, automotive mechanics, and boilermakers among the least promising career starters. After years of analysis blaming millennials' economic struggles on smartphone addiction and delayed maturity, observers like Jean Twenge now wonder why young people still aren't having families despite 'good' economic indicators, besides blaming it on the phones or whatever excuse to blame someone for not having economic stability. The disconnect suggests these commentators were looking in the wrong place all along. The disconnect suggests we're overlooking a crucial mechanism in how the modern economy actually works. Stone's insight provided the first clue. The COVID-19 pandemic accidentally created the largest unplanned retirement experiment in modern American history, providing crucial evidence for solving our mystery. During the COVID crisis, the Federal Reserve documented over 2.4 million "excess retirees": people who left the labor force above what pre-pandemic trends would have predicted. This wasn't simply early retirement by choice. The pull-forward was heavily concentrated among workers aged 55 and older without college degrees, particularly those in jobs that couldn't be performed remotely. These weren't the highly compensated professionals who could afford early retirement; they were often the most economically vulnerable workers, caught between virus exposure and business shutdowns. The sudden exodus created an immediate labor shortage that drove unprecedented wage growth, especially for the youngest workers. From the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2023, nominal wages grew by an extraordinary 25% for workers aged 16-19 and 28% for those aged 20-24. This far outpaced the 18% growth for prime-age workers and the mere 13% for workers aged 55 and older. Young workers suddenly had bargaining power they hadn't experienced in decades. The "Great Resignation" saw millions of low-wage workers quit for better pay and conditions. Entry-level positions that had been scarce suddenly offered signing bonuses. But by 2023, the excess retirements had been absorbed back into expected demographic patterns. The dramatic wage growth slowed. The labor market "normalized" except for one puzzling feature: simultaneous low unemployment and low job growth. Who doesn’t get hired if there are no jobs? People currently unemployed, who are disproportionately under the age of 35. The youth labor market reveals the deeper structural problems. While overall unemployment appears benign, the youth unemployment rate in OECD member countries stood at 11.49% in 2024, consistently and significantly higher than that for the adult population, with December 2024, the OECD youth unemployment rate was 7.0 percentage points higher than the rate for workers aged 25 and over. Nine OECD countries reported youth unemployment rates above 20% as recently as April 2024. More troubling is the quality of available jobs. In the European Union, an analysis covering the period from 1985 to 2019 found that the wages of workers over the age of 55 grew nearly twice as fast as those of workers under 35, an increase in the age wage gap of 96%. A 2020 Brookings Institution analysis found that "44% of all U.S. workers (53 million people) earn low wages, with a median hourly pay of just $10.22." Critically, two-thirds of these low-wage workers are in their prime working years (25-54), and over half work full-time, year-round. Young people are disproportionately funneled into precarious employment. Across the EU, a staggering 43.3% of employed 15- to 24-year-olds were on fixed-term contracts in 2015, a figure more than three times higher than the 14.1% rate for the overall workforce. In countries like Slovenia, Poland, and Spain, the share of young workers on temporary contracts exceeded 70%. The COVID experiment revealed how retirement timing affects youth opportunities, but it was temporary. Stone's insight points to a more persistent problem: what happens when retirement is systematically delayed rather than accelerated, especially as countries are pushing for later and later retirements. To understand the full impact, we need to look inside individual companies. Fortunately, detailed firm-level studies provide concrete evidence of exactly how this mechanism works. Firm-level studies from Europe provide concrete evidence for Stone's thesis. When older workers delay retirement by just one year, the effects on their younger colleagues are immediate and severe: annual wage growth drops by 2.3% to 2.5%. More dramatically, the number of younger workers promoted into managerial roles falls by nearly 50%. For white-collar positions, promotions drop by about 21%. This isn't about overall employment levels. This is about the internal architecture of firms. When the person above you doesn't retire, your promotion doesn't happen. When promotions don't happen, wage growth stagnates. When wage growth stagnates across an economy, you get exactly what we're seeing: low unemployment that somehow doesn't feel like a tight labor market. The phenomenon even has a name: "occupational downgrading." Skilled young workers, unable to advance in their chosen fields, take lower-skill positions just to maintain employment. An engineering graduate becomes a technician. A business school graduate takes an administrative role. The human capital that should be driving productivity growth gets systematically underutilized. It accounts for why there are fewer management positions available and why career advancement has become so difficult, why wage growth has been disappointing despite low unemployment, and showcases a significant blind spot in Social Security policy modeling. This explains why young people struggle to advance in their careers, but it doesn't explain why they're also struggling to start careers. Something else is affecting career entry. Promotion bottlenecks shouldn't prevent companies, especially newer companies, from hiring new graduates for entry-level positions. Young workers should still be able to start their careers, even if advancement is slow (or lets be honest here, it’s non existent), because if an economy grows there should be demand for highly educated (cheaper and more disposable, increasingly on contract) workers and technicians. Instead, we are seeing the opposite trend This Substack is reader-supported. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Share If the problem were purely demographic, we should see strong job creation at entry-level positions as businesses expand to meet demand with available younger workers. We should see new businesses forming to take advantage of all that skilled young talent being held back by promotion bottlenecks, especially at cheaper prices and destroyed expectations. The only ones hiring young workers right now are gig apps like DoorDash, Uber, and OnlyFans. These platforms were designed for extra cash, not full-time jobs. When college graduates are driving for Uber or delivering food as their main source of income, that shows how completely the traditional job market has broken down. Instead, we see the opposite. Between 2020 and 2023, new software company formation fell by 86% in the US, 89% in Israel, and 87% in the EU. Something is systematically choking off the creation of new companies, in addition to the current Fed Rates, that would typically absorb young workers eager to start their careers. As former investment banker Darin Soat of How Money Works has documented, this problem becomes clear when examining broader American market data. Despite record business formation in recent years, the number of publicly traded companies has collapsed. In 1996, 8,090 companies were publicly listed on American stock markets. Today, despite the economy being three times larger and markets handling seven times more capital, fewer than 4,000 companies trade publicly. This decline matters because new businesses are the primary engine of net job creation in developed economies. The Census Bureau shows a decades-long downward trend in the establishment entry rate, from around 14% in the early 1980s to about 10% in recent years. This decline in business dynamism directly translates into fewer new jobs per business, slower aggregate wage growth, and a less competitive marketplace. Startups/Scaleups/SMEs don't just create jobs. They create the right kinds of jobs for young workers at all levels of education, from accountants, marketers, customer service, etc etc . New companies typically hire younger workers who are willing to accept lower initial wages in exchange for rapid skill development, promotion opportunities, and equity stakes. Established companies prefer experienced workers for most positions and use their established hierarchies for advancement. When new business formation (besides sole props and gig contractors) collapses, it eliminates the primary mechanism by which young workers enter the professional workforce outside of service industries. Young workers face constraints from two directions: fewer promotion opportunities within existing firms (due to delayed retirement) and fewer alternative career paths at new firms (due to declining business formation). What's happening to all these businesses? They're getting bought before they can grow. The venture capital industry figured out it's more profitable to build companies specifically to sell them than to actually compete. M&A activity fundamentally disrupts workforces. When companies combine, "overlapping functions in areas like human resources, marketing, finance, and administration are deemed redundant," leading to job cuts that "disproportionately affect the employees of the acquired company."¹ More systemically, M&A increases employer market power. A detailed study of takeovers in the Netherlands found that even four years after an acquisition, workers from the target firm earned, on average, 2.8% less in labor market income and worked 7.3% fewer hours. Research on hospital mergers found that in deals that significantly increased market concentration, annual wage growth for skilled workers was suppressed by as much as 1.7 percentage points, i.e. eroding nearly a third of typical yearly wage growth. Just to show why companies acquire smaller companies, a study tracking over 35,000 drug development projects found that "about 6.4% of all acquisitions were killer acquisitions" (deals where incumbents buy competitors specifically to shut them down.) In the technology sector, the five largest tech firms made 175 acquisitions between 2015 and 2017 alone, and subsequently discontinued more than 60% of the acquired products or services. This creates what has been termed "kill zones" around dominant platforms. Potential entrepreneurs and their investors see little point in developing competing products, knowing they will likely be either copied or acquired and buried by the incumbent. The net result is an economy with fewer large employers, a dearth of new employers, and a suppressed rate of innovation. Private equity firms now control vastly more capital than in 2000, keeping promising companies private rather than letting them go public. Seven companies now control 34.1% of the entire S&P 500, up from just 16.2% for the top ten companies in 2015. The same three asset management firms (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street) hold major stakes in competing companies across entire industries, using funds from pensions, both public and private, to consolidate control. When your biggest shareholders own all your competitors, competition becomes coordination. The traditional escape route for young workers (jumping to a growing startup) gets systematically eliminated through acquisition before those companies can scale and offer genuine career opportunities. A case study from American Affairs Magazine (Scale-Up Nation: The Role of IP-Transfer Restrictions in Israel’s Industrial Policy by Erez Maggor) provides evidence of this dynamic. Erez Maggor's analysis of Israel's industrial policy shows how the conflict between building domestic champions and optimizing for M&A exits affect young workers. Phase One: Building Industrial Capacity (1970s-1990s) From the 1970s to 1990s, Israel had a simple rule: if you take government money for research, you have to build your factories in Israel and keep your intellectual property here. The Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) administered this system with strict conditions: "all products emerging out of OCS-funded projects must be manufactured exclusively in Israel, and the IP created during the R&D stage must not be transferred beyond the state's borders." As former chief scientist Dr. Yehoshua Gleitman explained: "We want to help nurture an industry that will employ workers." The system worked. Given Imaging, which pioneered endoscopy capsule technology, was required to establish manufacturing in Israel and eventually employed close to a thousand workers.⁵ Phase Two: The "Start-up Nation" Model (1990s-Present) Then in 1993, Israel launched Yozma, spending $100 million to create venture capital funds. The new rule was simple: build startups fast and sell them for maximum profit. In 2005, the R&D Law was reformed, lifting "the outright ban on the transfer of IP and replacing it with a fee." The results looked impressive. Israel became the "Start-up Nation" with record $15.8 billion in acquisition deals in 2024. But instead of building the next Intel in Israel, entrepreneurs built companies specifically to be bought by Intel. When Intel bought Mobileye for $15.3 billion in 2017, Israel lost what could have been their first major car technology company. The Employment Impact The employment effects were dramatic. "For each employee of an Israeli high-tech manufacturer, two additional local jobs in nonmanufacturing industries are created. Each R&D center employee, on the other hand, creates only one-third of an additional job." Despite billions in exits, most Israelis didn't benefit from the tech boom. As Dan Breznitz observed: "During the years of extreme high-tech growth, the rest of the economy enjoyed no positive spillovers." Policy Choice, Not Market Forces Israel's experience proves these outcomes are policy choices, not natural market forces. The original OCS model successfully built industrial capacity through government intervention. The Yozma model destroyed it through different government intervention. Both were deliberate policy designs with completely different incentive structures. The same pattern emerges in American data. The collapse in publicly traded companies didn't happen because markets naturally consolidate. It happened because policy changes made private equity more attractive, merger review standards weakened, and tax policies favor quick exits over long-term building. When the same asset managers own competing firms across entire industries, it's the breakdown of competition rather than some market efficiency. The Israeli case study proves that what we call "market outcomes" are actually the result of specific government policy choices about how to structure incentives. Stone's retirement insight and the business formation collapse work together to create a perfect trap for young workers. The Pincer Movement Traditionally, workers blocked from promotion had an escape route: jump to a growing company with rapid advancement opportunities. But that safety valve no longer exists. The same forces that make advancement impossible within firms should create demand for ambitious young talent at new companies. Instead, new companies are systematically eliminated through acquisition before they can scale. The Result You can't advance at your current job because delayed retirement blocks promotions. You can't jump to a growing startup because they're designed for quick acquisition, not independent growth. You can't realistically start your own company because you lack the capital, connections, and safety net required, and even if you could, the venture capital system optimizes for exits, not competition. This explains the central paradox: how an economy can simultaneously produce impressive headline statistics (low unemployment, record business formation) while systematically destroying career pathways for an entire generation. We're measuring business creation while ignoring business elimination. We're tracking job numbers while missing job quality. The economy has been optimized for metrics that look good in policy reports while undermining the mechanisms young workers need to build successful careers. The solution requires practical action, not more measurement. There is a lot to discuss on things, both big and small, which is out of scope for this article. We do need to abandon failed approaches. We can't cut Social Security/public pensions, impose means testing, or raise retirement ages. These worsen promotion bottlenecks. We can't pretend what's happened to young people since 2008 is acceptable. On that note, Blanket forced retirement would be destructive, especially for founder-led companies, which could nasty long term side effects. There is no way getting out of this except by boosting birth rates and achieve rapid economic growth. Not the failed post-2008 methods of financial engineering or wishcasting, but genuine good governance especially in industrial, youth, and familu policies. If I am forced to give you a starting point, it would be with energy. As mattparlmer documents in "America Can Beat China on Energy," Chinese manufacturers pay $0.09/kWh while California companies pay $0.24/kWh. When electrons cost three times more on one side of an ocean, industrial capacity goes to the other side. A massive American energy buildout targeting $0.01/kWh electricity would create millions of jobs across skill levels: electricians, engineers, technicians, project managers. Real careers with advancement potential, not gig work. It requires a lot of political will, YIMBY reforms, the willingness to tax the upper crust until the Fed and bond markets are forced to be reasonable about cost of capital without giving them a tribute of unemployment, and stepping on a lot of other people’s toes. Erez Maggor's Israeli case study shows how government investment can build domestic industrial capacity instead of feeding acquisition targets. When Israel switched from building domestic companies to optimizing for startup exits, each high-tech manufacturer job was replaced by R&D jobs that created one-third as many supporting positions. The country got impressive acquisition headlines but lost the broad-based employment that builds middle-class prosperity. Palmer shows how energy infrastructure creates the fundamental input advantage needed for competitive manufacturing. We need antitrust enforcement to break up consolidated industries (read Matt Stoller and Basel Musharbash for more). We need industrial policy that creates genuine companies with career ladders, not startups designed for quick exits. For workers (white and blue collar) under 40, this helps determines whether you'll afford a house, start a family, or retire with dignity. This Substack is reader-supported. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Share I agree with the ultimate point that it’s all about finding a way to raise birth rates, and investing in clearly useful industries like energy buildout (and on-/friend-shoring those supply chains) makes a lot of sense. (Now if we can just convince the US government to not keep their heads in the sand…) Though on some specifics, RE why startups went off a cliff from 2020-2023, you mention the Fed rates as one factor but not fully explanatory of the decline - doesn’t that explain most of it? As an entrepreneur myself I hear from other founders that it’s hard to raise money these days, along with general worry about not being able to bounce back if they don’t make it - a riskier environment to make a startup. (I’m insulated from this since my company is bootstrapped, outside of the SV tech bubble, and taking a small business early profitability approach, but maybe that’s just another reflection of a more risk-averse approach to business creation 🤷) And I haven’t really heard of people seeing a lucrative acquisition as being a bad outcome for a startup that would drive them to not want to build one altogether (though I agree that it’s not great for the ecosystem of jobs and competition). After all if a company felt that they could get a better outcome by not taking an acquisition, they could just not take it, but they are (especially in this market). RE hiring young people for cheaper with the expectation of growth in the world of software, it seems like the age of LLMs isn’t helping, where an LLM can take a newbie to being a more productive but still junior engineer, whereas it takes a knowledgeable and motivated senior to being a 10x developer—which in my case means getting away with a much smaller and manageable team. Seems nobody wants to hire junior developers anymore, to the industry’s long-term detriment, though I think this has little to do with retirement ages or social security spending, at least in software. Anyway thanks for the post! Wouldn't removing the cap on earnings that are taxed for SS also help a lot for closing the funding gap, or should we just admit that the Congress will never ever go for that and pursue other options?

Title: The risks and rewards of tokenization as crypto heavyweights push for it

As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens. “Tokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,” said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France. Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors. But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century’s worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood’s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world’s most popular startups. The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time. The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast. She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television. “You used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,” Haun said. “You tune in at a specific time, you don’t get to choose your program, you couldn’t be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.” Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies. Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030. The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that’s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs — more than $123,000 on Monday — while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what’s been called the “golden age” for digital assets. Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said the biggest winners in the push for tokenization could be a small handful of exchanges like Robinhood that see their trading volumes and influence spike. “Which is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,” Reiners said. Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday. “Tokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace,” said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins. Securities law can be complex and even defining what is a security can be a hotly debated question, particularly in crypto. The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings of tokenized securities in 2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations of that country’s securities law. Under Trump, the SEC has taken a much less expansive view than the previous administration and dropped or paused litigation against crypto companies that the agency had previously accused of violating securities law. Hilary Allen, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law, said crypto companies have been emboldened by Trump's victory to be more aggressive in pushing what they can offer. “The most pressing risk is (tokenization) being used as a regulatory arbitrage play as a way of getting around the rules,” she said. However, the SEC has struck a cautionary tone when it comes to tokens. Shortly after Robinhood’s announcement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has been an outspoken crypto supporter, issued a statement saying companies issuing tokenized stock should consider “their disclosure obligations” under federal law. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” Peirce said. One of the most closely watched areas of tokenization involves private companies, which aren’t subject to strict financial reporting requirements like publicly traded ones. Many hot startups are not going public as often as they used to and instead are increasingly relying on wealthy and institutional investors to raise large sums of money and stay private. That’s unfair to the little guy, say advocates of tokenization. “These are massive wealth generators for a very small group of rich, well-connected insiders who get access to these deals early,” said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. “Crypto has the power to solve this inequality.” But Robinhood’s giveaway of tokens meant to represent an investment in OpenAI immediately drew pushback from the company itself, which said it was not involved in Robinhood’s plan and did not endorse it. “Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer,” OpenAI said on social media. “Please be careful.” Public companies have strict public reporting requirements about their financial health that private companies don’t have to produce. Such reporting requirements have helped protect investors and give a legitimacy to the U.S. financial system, said Allen, who said the push for tokenized sales of shares in private companies is “eerily familiar” to how things played out before the creation of the SEC nearly a century ago. “Where we’re headed is where we were in the 1920s,” she said. “Door-to-door salesmen offering stocks and bonds, half of it had nothing behind it, people losing their life savings betting on stuff they didn’t understand.” This webinar will introduce new properties for sale from Daiwa House, one of Japan's leading home builders.

However tokenization is about the only truly useful idea for crypto. Stable coins will be replaced by CBDCs and bitcoin will become the little engine that never really could, especially once the hurdles are overcome with quantum computing. The money invested there is not anymore available in the real economy. That is the problem here. But it also shows the real intentions behind. De-industrialization and slowing everything down, especially consumption, by aqueezing the money out of people and suck it in like a vacuum cleaner into the digital, virtual world of crypto, tokens or let's also add game consoles, chatbots, virtual girlfriends and such. Because the developped economies are shrinking and aging, all the big money, saved, earned or inherited, must be drawn out of the masses. That is the development behind. And to be honest, there isn't much left to invest or consume in real life, don't you agree? Big cars dying, brand companies closing, no more smoking, no drinking, no real entertainment, all contacts with the other gender nearly prohibited, powerful amplifiers for listening music have gone , replaced by some toy players and earbuds, travelling is also too dangerous, from wars, terror or gangs and drugs and knife wielders still not speaking. So, what is left for us for spending haed work earned money? Nothing, but some of those virtual investments, cryptos, tokens, whatever. Well, I don't like it and consider it scam, but anyway, enjoy it, there(s nothing else left for you all, especially when still in younger generations.

Title: Bitcoin Acts As A Hedge Against Local Fears And Could Rise To $700,000 – BlackRock CEO

In the ongoing bull market cycle, Bitcoin has been remarkable, as the cryptocurrency becomes a crucial global asset sought after persistently by prominent figures and companies worldwide. Many of these figures and companies are driven by the fact that BTC could serve as a strategic solution to real problems in the financial sector, making it a valuable asset. As local financial instability and economic uncertainty engulf many parts of the world, Bitcoin, often considered as “Digital Gold,” is constantly being pushed into the spotlight as a potential buffer against these negative conditions. This implies that the digital asset is becoming extremely popular among investors looking for protection from inflation and currency devaluation due to its decentralized structure and limited supply. Larry Fink, the chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the largest asset management company, BlackRock, is the latest prominent figure to acknowledge this notion around the flagship asset. The BlackRock CEO made the claims in an interview on Bloomberg. Such claims and statements from well-known figures in the financial sector are an indication of how Bitcoin’s role as a digital gold is now compelling than ever. Fink considers Bitcoin the ideal choice of asset when one is frightened of the debasement of currencies or the economic and political stability of a country. His statement underscores the chairman’s robust trust in BTC’s potential as a notable and reliable store of value during negative periods. According to the CEO, BTC is an internationally based instrument that will overcome and address local fears. As a result, he is confident and believes in the utilization of the crypto king as a key instrument during economic uncertainty. In the event that BTC is generally considered as a strategic internationally based instrument, Fink claims it could be a proper hedge against hope securities and equities. After sharing his insights on Bitcoin’s reputation as an inflation hedge, Fink offered his bullish prediction on the digital asset. The CEO is confident that BTC’s value might soar to untouched territory between $500,000 $700,000 in the foreseeable future. However, this could likely take place if every individual or business allocates 2% to 5% of their capital to BTC investments. Fink noted that this should be a major discussion in the sector as macroeconomic turmoil lingers. Tom Lee, the Head of Research at Fundstrat Global, has also weighed in on Bitcoin’s price potential, predicting a rally to unprecedented levels. In the interview, Lee asserted that a $200,000 to $250,000 per BTC is still reasonable, given that this price range is equivalent to 25% of the entire Gold market. Acknowledging its status as Digital Gold, the chairman believes that BTC should be valued at $1 million if it follows the path of gold. While this forecast may seem over optimistic, Lee is just one of many who believe the asset could reach this value in the next few years. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

"I am in a position to refute all the accusations brought up against me," Schwab said in a statement, responding to a report in SonntagsZeitung. The Swiss newspaper said preliminary findings by Swiss law firm Homburger support allegations that Schwab manipulated economic reports published by the forum and submitted unjustifiably high expense claims.

Title: Institutions Decreasing Real Estate Purchases

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/22/2025 9:41:35 AM PDT by delta7 Investors continue to snap up residential properties, as real estate has evolved into an investment class of its own. New reports show that between 2020 and 2023, investors were responsible for 18.5% of home purchases. In the first three months of 2025, investors composed 27% of all residential properties, marking the highest share in half a decade, according to BatchData. High mortgage rates, coupled with high property values, have caused many would-be buyers to reconsider their purchases. Investors have fewer constraints, leading to the purchase of 265,000 residential properties during Q1, or a 1.2% YoY rise. However, we are seeing a decrease in institutional investments in real estate. The big money is not looking at real estate in this environment. Although investors accounted for 1.2 million homes in 2024, only 20% of the 86 million single-family homes in America are investor-owned. Mom-and-pop investors who own between one and five homes purchased 85% of all investor-owned residential properties, with those owning between six and ten properties securing 5% of the market. Institutions owning 1,000 or more properties account for only 2.2% of investor-owned homes. Purchasing real estate amid record-low rates was a no-brainer for investors, and institutions in particular, who had the liquidity to outbid competitors with cash offers. As interest rates rise, the cost of financing becomes prohibitive even for institutions. Institutions rely on leverage to enhance returns, and when borrowing costs rise, the math simply doesn’t work anymore. Real estate is an illiquid asset. In a world moving toward capital controls and rising geopolitical tensions, institutions are reallocating toward assets with more mobility. Capital is no longer looking at real estate as a long-term store of value. It’s moving into tangible assets that are more liquid—commodities, energy, gold, and equities. The available real estate inventory is at its highest level since the pandemic, but the sector has become stagnant as homes sit on the market for far longer. So while institutions have the capital, interest rates aside, they are not looking at mere rental or flipping income. People investing in real estate in this environment are seeking a modest additional income. Institutions are not interested in buying and holding tangible assets in a volatile environment where returns are not guaranteed. Look at New York City, for example—people are fleeing ahead of an incoming socialist local government that has promised to raise taxes on top earners. Real estate is no longer the safe bet it once was due to a lack of confidence in future regulation. TOPICS: KEYWORDS: housing Another 2008 event on the horizon?

Capital is no longer looking at real estate as a long-term store of value. It’s moving into tangible assets that are more liquid—commodities, energy, gold, and equities. The available real estate inventory is at its highest level since the pandemic, but the sector has become stagnant as homes sit on the market for far longer. So while institutions have the capital, interest rates aside, they are not looking at mere rental or flipping income. People investing in real estate in this environment are seeking a modest additional income. Institutions are not interested in buying and holding tangible assets in a volatile environment where returns are not guaranteed. Look at New York City, for example—people are fleeing ahead of an incoming socialist local government that has promised to raise taxes on top earners. Real estate is no longer the safe bet it once was due to a lack of confidence in future regulation. TOPICS: KEYWORDS: housing Another 2008 event on the horizon?

But it also makes me less confident that big guys like Blackrock, Vanguard, etc…. will prevent a collapse of residential real estate by being“too big to fail”. These mom and pop investors who make up 85% of the market have no institutional pull. Breaking news! (from about 18 months ago) Agreed—I had not seen those numbers before. That should mean less volatility in most markets. IMHO that's a good thing. If the real estate market collapses we'll see houses selling for their intrinsic values (how much they're worth to the consumers) instead of their investor market value (how you can sell it to the next investor in the tulip mania). The bubble popped a while ago. Everyone was too Epsteined up and Alligator Alcatrazed to hear anything else. The media doing its best worst. You still have to pay insurance. You still have to pay property taxes. You still have to find ethical renters. The last one is getting more difficult. So the circling sharks back away . . . waiting for the decline of capital gains taxes. “You still have to find ethical renters.” Ethical renters still have to find ethical Landlords. There are lots of reliable working folks that want to rent a safe home, in a safe neighborhood. They aren’t rich but can afford a fair rent. They can’t afford to buy, nor the “First Time Investor” keystone markup that many Landlords are seeking. Longtime rental-property owners know the value and the kind of stable income stream a quality tenant brings to Real Estate investments. Have had some 15+ year tenants. Every area and deal is unique. Some markets like Austin have already corrected from their 2021-2022 highs. Especially with the national home builders in that market. Places in Florida are also correcting from their Covid boom highs. This is also having a direct effect on the northeast and upper midwest. There are no enough houses in New England and around Chicago for the demand. Places like here in NH continue to be a sellers market. There is just not enough supply of homes. Prices continue to go up slowly 6-8% annually. Manchester/Nashua, NH is one hottest markets in the country. Places like Chicago there are not enough houses to keep up with demand. Yet, BOOM towns like Denver. SLC, Phoenix, Boise are correcting. Even Dallas/Fort Worth is no longer the biggest volume new home start market in the country. Houston has now taken the number one spot. NYC is now the #3 spot for starts/permits in the country. Lots of people that moved during covid are moving back to where they came from. Maybe they weren’t cut out for TX & FL summers. Phoenix and LA including the valley are still growing, but not as fast as they were. These and the Florida markets are where the big investors like Blackrock and Invitation homes have backed off. The big investors think real estate is technically overpriced. That is why they are not buying. Some are selling or have sold already in places like Austin. Orlando is now in the top ten housing market in the country. That is because a lot of people are moving from the beach inland. Most people cannot afford the insurance on the coasts of Florida anymore.

Title: China Threatens to Block $23B Port Deal Without Cosco Stake: Report

By Glenn Taylor The Chinese government is reportedly threatening to nix the $23 billion port deal that has become a key front in its ongoing geopolitical tug-of-war with the U.S. Under the proposed sale, Hong Kong-based port operator CK Hutchison Holdings would hand ownership of more than 40 ports worldwide to a consortium including Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) and BlackRock. But according to a Thursday report from the Wall Street Journal, China wants to block the acquisition if its leading ocean carrier, Cosco Shipping, is not included in the deal. The deal includes the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal in Panama, both of which sit on the opposite sides of the Panama Canal. China has had the deal under antitrust review since March, delaying the official approval of the sale. The Panamanian government also still needs to approve the acquisition. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is pushing for Cosco to be an equal partner and shareholder of the ports alongside both BlackRock and MSC, which is the world’s largest container shipping company, the report said. Related Stories Topics European Port Congestion is 'Here to Stay' Through 2025 Footwear White House Confirms 19 Percent Shoe Tariff Rate With Indonesia: Are China, Cambodia Next? Talks between the current parties in the deal are expected to continue through July 27, which is the end of the 145-day exclusive negotiation period. Cosco would not be able to be part of the talks until that period ends. While BlackRock, MSC and Hutchison are reportedly open to Cosco taking a stake in the deal, U.S. lawmakers don’t share the same feeling. When the deal was first announced in March, it was seen as a major victory for the Trump administration, which has been seeking to rid the Panama Canal of any alleged Chinese influence. The president has claimed that the U.S. must “take back” the canal as part of his protectionist, “America First” rhetoric, so including a Chinese buyer in the sale of the Balboa and Cristóbal ports would further inflame the situation again. The U.S. congressional committee on China remains concerned as Cosco floats in the background of the mega ports deal. After the Wall Street Journal article published Thursday, Chairman John Moolenaar (R-Mich.) of the House Select Committee on China made his letter to a top Panamanian official public. The letter expresses alarm that CCP-directed entities could be included as part of a transaction involving port concessions managed by CK Hutchison, which Moolenaar said would pose a direct threat to the national security of both Panama and the U.S. “The inclusion of Cosco—or any other Chinese company—in port operations or control along the canal would represent an unacceptable risk to the national security of both our nations,” writes Chairman Moolenaar in the letter. The letter mentioned Cosco’s inclusion earlier this year to the Department of Defense’s list of Chinese military assets. Conversely, Chinese President Xi Jinping was reportedly angered with CK Hutchison when it announced the port sale to Western interests. The quick response saw multiple state-owned media firms criticize the deal before the China’s top antitrust body opened its probe. Additionally, reports surfaced that the CCP told state-owned businesses to freeze any impeding deals with Hutchison or other businesses linked to its controlling shareholder, the family of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing. Panama has always maintained that it has full control over the canal, despite Trump’s claims. But the country is having its own doubts over the deal, even as it currently stands without Cosco’s involvement. Ricaurte Vásquez Morales, administrator at the Panama Canal Authority (ACP), said the concentration of terminal operators in one area would be inconsistent with the canal’s neutrality. This is on top of Panama’s Supreme Court already reviewing whether the Hutchison sale is constitutional, and the country’s government insisting that the port operator owes it roughly $300 million in previously unpaid fees stemming from its prior contract. China has been able to sway shipping deals in the past. In 2014, its antitrust regulator shot down the proposed P3 Network that included MSC, Maersk and CMA CGM. That vessel-sharing alliance would have combined the top three container shipping companies by total container capacity at the time, but worried China that it would give the companies too much control over global trade routes. The P3 Network had already been approved by American and European regulators. The failed attempt at the new network led to the creation of the 2M alliance between MSC and Maersk in 2015, which lasted a decade until the agreement expired to kick off 2025.

Title: AI On: How Financial Services Companies Use Agentic AI to Enhance Productivity, Efficiency and Security
URL: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/financial-services-agentic-ai/
Time Published: 2025-07-22T15:00:16Z
Full Content:
Editor’s note: This post is part of the AI On blog series, which explores the latest techniques and real-world applications of agentic AI, chatbots and copilots. The series also highlights the NVIDIA software and hardware powering advanced AI agents, which form the foundation of AI query engines that gather insights and perform tasks to transform everyday experiences and reshape industries. With advancements in agentic AI, intelligent AI systems are maturing to now facilitate autonomous decision-making across industries, including financial services. Over the last year, customer service-related use of generative AI, including chatbots and AI assistants, has more than doubled in financial services, rising from 25% to 60%. Organizations are using AI to automate time-intensive tasks like document processing and report generation, driving significant cost savings and operational efficiency. According to NVIDIA’s latest State of AI in Financial Services report, more than 90% of respondents reported a positive impact on their organization’s revenue from AI. AI agents are versatile, capable of adapting to complex tasks that require strict protocols and secure data usage. They can help with an expanding list of use cases, from enabling better investment decisions by automatically identifying portfolio optimization strategies to ensuring regulatory alignment and compliance automation. To improve market returns and business performance, AI agents are being adopted in various areas that benefit greatly from autonomous decision-making backed by data. According to the State of AI in Financial Services report, 60% of respondents said customer experience and engagement was the top use case for generative AI. Businesses using AI have already seen customer experiences improve by 26%. AI agents can help automate repetitive tasks while providing next steps, such as dispute resolution and know-your-customer updates. This reduces operational costs and helps minimize human errors. By handling customer inquiries and forms, AI chatbots scale support and ensure 24/7 availability, enhancing customer satisfaction. Employees can focus on higher-level, judgment-based cases, rather than performing case intake, data analysis and documentation. In addition, AI agents are crucial for fraud detection, as they can detect and respond to suspicious transactions automatically. The State of AI report highlighted that out of 20 use cases, cybersecurity experienced the highest growth over the last year, with more than a third of respondents now assessing or investing in AI for cybersecurity. AI closes the time gap between detection and action, as a lack of action can result in significant financial loss. To combat fraud, AI agents can monitor transaction patterns in real time, learn from new types of fraud and take immediate action by alerting compliance teams or freezing suspicious accounts — all without the need for human intervention. Plus, teams of AI agents can work with other systems to retrieve additional data, simulate potential fraud scenarios and investigate abnormalities. AI agents make financial management easier, especially for bill payment and cash flow management. Because agentic AI supports machine-to-machine interactions in digital ecosystems, it can ensure regulatory compliance by automatically maintaining detailed audit trails. This reduces compliance costs and processing time, making it easier for financial institutions to operate in complex regulatory environments. For capital markets, the most powerful investment insights are often hidden in unstructured text data from everyday document sources such as news articles, blogs and SEC filings. AI agents can accelerate intelligent document processing (IDP) to provide insight and investment recommendations for traders, enabling faster decision-making and reducing the risk of financial losses. In consumer banking, handling documents like loan records, regulatory filings and transaction records involves a lot of complex data. This amount of data is so large that it can be difficult and time-consuming to process and understand it manually. IDP helps solve this issue, using AI to identify document types, summarize documents, employ retrieval-augmented generation for answers and support, and organize data. The data-driven insights from multi-agent systems inform strategic business decisions as these systems continuously learn from customer and institutional data using a data flywheel. Many industry customers and partners have benefited significantly from integrating AI into their workflows. For example, BlackRock uses Aladdin, a proprietary platform that unifies investment management processes across public and private markets for institutional investors. With numerous Aladdin applications and thousands of specialized users, the BlackRock team identified an opportunity to use AI to streamline the platform’s user experience while fostering connectivity and operational efficiency. Rapidly and securely, BlackRock has bolstered the Aladdin platform with advanced AI through Aladdin Copilot. Using a federated development model, where different teams can work on AI agents independently while building on a common foundation, BlackRock’s central AI team established a standardized communication system and plug-in registry. This allows the firm’s developers and data scientists to create and deploy AI agents tailored to their specific areas, improving intelligence and efficiency for clients. Another example is bunq’s generative AI platform, Finn, which offers users a range of features to help manage finances through an in-app chatbot. It can answer questions about money, provide insight into spending habits and offer tips on using the bunq app. Finn uses advanced AI to improve its responses based on feedback and, beyond the in-app chatbot, now handles over 90% of all users’ support tickets. Capital One is also assisting customers with Chat Concierge, its multi-agent conversational AI assistant designed to enhance the automotive-buying experience. Consumers have 24/7 access to agents that provide real-time information and take action based on user requests. In a single conversation, Chat Concierge can perform tasks like comparing vehicles to help car buyers find their ideal choice and scheduling test drives or appointments with a sales team. RBC’s latest platform for global research, Aiden, uses internal agents to automatically perform analysis when companies covered by RBC Capital Markets release SEC filings. Aiden has an orchestration agent working with other agents, such as the SEC filing agent, earnings agent and a real-time news agent.

Title: VA – Paul Weller Presents That Sweet Sweet Music (2025)

Soul music has always been in Paul Weller’s blood from early Jam covers of Martha & the Vandellas 1963 classic ‘Heatwave’. Along with other forms of music, soul found its way into Paul’s record collection, nourishing his ears and informing his own songwriting. We don’t need to recap a questing musical career from the Jam to the Style Council which then blossomed into one of the most productive and revered careers of any UK solo artist. Paul has written anthems, standards and a songbook that have always developed from his own feelings. Whilst Paul has talked about his love of soul music he has, before now, simply been too busy to sit down and curate a collection of his favourite tracks and get it into the record racks. 199 MB 320 ** FLAC Ace Records are honoured and delighted to finally release that Paul Weller curated collection which he has aptly titled, “That Sweet Sweet Music”. This 2-LP set and CD open the curtains on 26 tracks that are some of Paul’s favourite soul records most of which nestle on vinyl in his own collection. He can still recall paying £70 for his copy of Jon Lucien’s 1971 ‘Search For The Inner Self’ 7” at a record shop in Leicester in the 90s. Some of these tracks are soul classics like James Carr’s 1966 ‘Pouring Water On A Drowning Man’ and Brother to Brother’s brilliant take on Gil Scott Heron and Brian Jackson’s ‘In The Bottle’ from 1975. Others are deliciously obscure wonderous gems like the A-side of Blackrock’s sole 1971 single ‘Blackrock “Yeah, Yeah”’, ‘Life Walked Out’ from the same year by The Mist or Syl Johnson’s ‘Black Balloons’ taken from his 1970 album “Is It Because I’m Black?”. There are plenty of big vocal hitters such as Darrell Banks, Spinners, Joe Simon, O.C. Smith, the Dells and Betty Davis. Whilst the core is vocal soul the music does branch out with Paul selecting a wicked instrumental from the flipside of the Isley Brothers’ ‘Twist & Shout’ from 1962 and the funky jazz of the Headhunters ‘God Made Me Funky’, the A-side of their first 1975 seven-inch. Paul has not only written an introduction but the way he has curated the music allows each side of the vinyl and the CD to flow like a river taking the listener on a journey through some of his favourite music. — acerecords.co.uk « The Boneshakers – Live to Be This (2025) Vanilla Fudge – Where Is My Mind?

Paul Reynolds Crime Correspondent A man aged in his 70s has appeared in court charged in connection with alleged historical sexual offences. Gardaí say the man was arrested this morning following his extradition from the United States. He is accused of 79 offences - 78 counts of indecently assaulting four young girls aged between eight and 14 at the time, and one count of attempting to rape one of the children. The offences are alleged to have taken place between 1971 and 1981 at various locations in south Dublin including Dun Laoghaire, Killiney, Blackrock, Deansgrange, and Foxrock. 42 of the charges relate to one of the girls and 34 to another. Two indecent assault charges relate to another of the girls, while one charge relates to the fourth alleged victim. Sergeant Amy Kelly told the court that she arrested the man at Dublin airport at 5.56am following extradition. She said he was brought to Ballymun Garda Station where he was charged with the 79 offences. There was no application for bail and he was granted free legal aid. His solicitor Tracy Horan told the court that the 76-year-old was not working and had no assets. She also said he required medical assistance because he has no hearing aid and urgently needs dentures because he cannot eat. The man sat in a wheelchair in court and was dressed in a green top, grey shorts, white socks and tan slip-on shoes. He did not speak during the brief hearing. Judge Michelle Finan directed that he receive appropriate medical attention in custody and remanded him to appear again at Cloverhill District Court next Tuesday. Crime Correspondent © RTÉ 2025.

Title: 'Made for Germany': German Companies show optimism

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has joined forces with the country's top business leaders, who pledge major investments to pull Germany out of recession. There is always an element of psychology in economics. If companies are confident they can do good business in the future, they will strongly invest. If prospects look poor, they will hold on to the money. The COVID-19 pandemic with its collapse of international supply chains, the war in Ukraine, the subsequent energy crisis and inflation, the weakening economy in China — all took a heavy toll on the export-oriented German economy. Economic activity nosedived. Germany slid into a lasting recession. Since then, optimism has not returned. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) registered a lower investment ratio for Germany in 2024 than all other 38 member countries. That will soon change, according to the heads of leading companies in Germany. A total of 61 of them, including corporations such as Airbus, BASF, BMW, Deutsche Börse, Mercedes-Benz, Rheinmetall, SAP, Volkswagen but also the US corporations Nvidia, Blackrock and Blackstone — have launched the initiative "Made for Germany." The name is reminiscent, deliberately, of the slogan "Made in Germany" which has become a symbol of quality. Together, the corporations representing a third of the German economy want to invest €631 billion ($733 billion) in Germany over the next three years. The money will go toward new and existing factories, as well as research and development. "We want economic growth, we want to strengthen Germany's competitiveness, we want to defend our technological leadership or extend it further," one of the alliance's two initiators, Siemens chief executive Roland Busch, said following a meeting of the initiative with government politicians at the chancellery. Christian Sewing, chief executive of Deutsche Bank and co-initiator of the alliance alongside Busch, expects even more businesses to join. "Germany is back. It's worth investing in Germany again," said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) after the meeting, describing the situation as "one of the largest investment initiatives that we have seen here in Germany in recent decades. We are not a location of the past, but a location of the present and above all the future," he added. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The mood in the chancellery was clearly positive. However, the economic situation in Germany remains sluggish; the country is facing its third year in a row without growth. Given the tariff policies of US President Donald Trump, the outlook is anything but good. Reviving the economy is the top priority for Germany's new government. The coalition of the center-right Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats has been in office since early May. They have made their first steps: The Bundestag federal parliament and Bundesrat upper house have authorized the borrowing of €500 billion ($580 billion) for a special fund for government investment in infrastructure and climate protection. Its intended focus is to whip the country's ailing transport routes into shape, invest in energy networks, digitization and research. Energy prices for the industry will be reduced, and businesses are set for massive tax relief. Initially, investment in production facilities, machinery, equipment, research and development will be accounted for during tax assessments. In the medium term, taxes on business are to be reduced. In Friedrich Merz, Germany now has a chancellor who himself spent many years in business. Among other roles, the lawyer formerly chaired the supervisory board of US financial investor BlackRock. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video "Today we have begun a new form of cooperation," Siemens head Busch said. "The conversation has shown that politics and business are on the same page." Deutsche Bank CEO Sewing added: "In my view, we are experiencing a government that is moving quickly. The most important things — growth and competitiveness — are right at the top of the agenda." To release the announced billions, politicians should ease up on regulations and give companies more freedom, Sewing said. Businesses are calling for reforms, especially concerning bureaucracy and social security contributions which push up the cost of labor. In Germany, employers and employees each pay half of worker contributions to health insurance, unemployment insurance and pensions. Due to higher costs for healthcare, health insurance contributions increased across the board at the beginning of this year. Contributions to long-term care insurance are expected to rise in 2026. In Germany, 42% of the gross national product goes toward social services. Pension funds are the biggest driver of this. Germany is an ageing society, and the baby boomer generation will retire from the workforce in the coming years. In addition, life expectancy is increasing. To afford the old-age pension, the government must contribute more money to the pension funds each year. According to the OECD, reforming social insurance is the biggest challenge for Germany. If nothing changes, the government will need to keep taking on more debt to keep social systems afloat. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has announced that reforming the social system is next on his coalition's political agenda. Initial findings are expected in the coming months.

BlackRock Inc. has told staff traveling to China for business trips to use temporary loaner phones and not to bring company laptops, underscoring growing concern among some global firms about employees working there. The world’s largest asset manager detailed the “policy enhancement” on business travel to China in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News, saying it is effective July 16. The US firm told staff that using BlackRock issued employee devices, including iPhones and iPads, isn’t permitted, according to the memo. Using BlackRock laptops or remote access via VPN will also not be allowed. Employees were notified they wouldn’t have access to the BlackRock network during personal travel in China. A BlackRock spokesperson didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment. The latest changes come amid growing jitters around business travel to China. Wells Fargo & Co. last week suspended travel to China after one of its top trade financing bankers, Chenyue Mao, was blocked from leaving the country. This week, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said the case was related to a criminal matter. China has also stopped an American citizen who works for the US Commerce Department from leaving the nation for several months, according to media reports. US-China geopolitical tensions have weighed on the global financial industry in recent years, making it increasingly difficult for firms to navigate. Global banks have scaled back their presence in China in the past few years amid slowing economic growth and escalating trade disputes. Since China tightened data security further with two new laws in 2021, global firms have focused on information segregation. Many banks and asset managers have created onshore centers to keep China data in the country as part of global operations, adding costs and hindering management of their Chinese businesses, according to the Asia Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association. BlackRock’s presence in China includes a wholly owned mutual fund firm as well as a wealth management joint venture with China Construction Bank Corp. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Share this article After catching heat earlier this year for bull-posting Ethereum ahead of a sharp decline, Eric Trump finally enjoys a turnaround as the coin bounces back nearly 35% from his promo high. Ethereum’s green candles prompted the US president’s son to celebrate. On Monday, Eric posted the iconic “Mic Drop” minion GIF from Despicable Me as he reshared his February post declaring, “It’s a great time to add $ETH.” https://t.co/MaEelzwY2m pic.twitter.com/YJUZ77qFKm — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) July 22, 2025 “Embrace volatility. If you were smart, you would have also bought the dips (as I said to do),” he replied to an X user. The second-largest crypto asset by market value was trading at around $2,800 at the time of Eric’s February call. It later fell to $1,470 in April, its lowest level since November 2023. However, the asset has since rebounded sharply and is now trading above $3,700, up more than 155% from its April low, CoinGecko data shows. Growing institutional demand and corporate accumulation are key drivers behind Ethereum’s recent rally. Moreover, hopes that the SEC will approve staking features for spot Ethereum ETFs, including a proposal from BlackRock, are helping fuel the momentum. Eric also dropped a “revenge” comment on an April post by market analyst Ted Pillows, who had noted that ETH was down 40% since Eric’s tweet.

China’s biggest shipping company is set to join the global consortium that’s acquiring Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s overseas ports, and is requesting a powerful role in the group in order to secure Beijing’s blessing for the controversial deal, people familiar with the matter said. State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. is asking to have veto rights or equivalent powers in the entity taking over the 43 ports, including two strategically important ones along the Panama Canal, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private matters. Cosco has argued such rights are necessary to block any decisions that are potentially harmful to China’s interests, the people added. Li’s CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. and the original buyer group, which includes BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd., have agreed that Cosco should have full informational access to the operation, the people said. But talks are still ongoing as to the powers that Cosco will have in the consortium and no final decisions have been made, they said. Read: Chinese Firms in Talks to Join Group for Li Ka-Shing’s Ports A 145-day period for exclusive talks between CK Hutchison and the consortium is likely to lapse on July 27, and details of Cosco’s role in the consortium could be settled by the end of September, some of them said. Cosco didn’t respond to calls and a faxed request for comments. CK Hutchison and the Aponte family’s MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co., which controls Terminal Investment, didn’t respond to separate requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment. Cosco’s demands mark the latest twist for a deal that’s become a proxy for US-China rivalry, after President Donald Trump painted the transaction as the return of Panama Canal to US influence. Chinese regulators have, for their part, vowed to investigate the transaction, and Li and his family have come under intense scrutiny and criticism. The Hong Kong tycoon’s younger son Richard Li’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The original structure of the buyer consortium was designed to give the Aponte family-controlled Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to the BlackRock unit.
