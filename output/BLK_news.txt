Title: Wall Street’s crypto debate is over as banks go all-in on BTC, stablecoins, tokenized cash

Big banks aren’t debating crypto anymore — they’re building it. From tokenized cash to ETFs, Wall Street is quietly going onchain. Cointelegraph in your social feed For years, major banks treated cryptocurrency primarily as a risk to be contained. That posture is now giving way to a more deliberate form of engagement. Rather than debating crypto’s legitimacy, banks are increasingly deciding how and where to integrate it, from regulated investment products to blockchain-based payment rails. This shift is on full display in this week’s Crypto Biz. JPMorgan is extending its US dollar deposit token onto new blockchain infrastructure, signaling that tokenized cash is moving closer to production use within global banking. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, is positioning itself to offer exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), potentially bringing crypto investments to millions of wealth management clients. Barclays has made its first bet on stablecoin infrastructure, backing settlement rails designed to connect regulated issuers with financial institutions. And Bank of America has taken another step toward normalization by allowing advisers to recommend spot Bitcoin ETFs to clients. Together, these moves suggest the banking sector is no longer content to watch from the sidelines. JPMorgan announced plans to issue its US dollar-denominated deposit token, JPM Coin (JPMD), natively on the Canton Network, marking another step by Wall Street toward production-ready blockchain infrastructure. Digital Asset, the developer of the Canton Network, and Kinexys by JPMorgan will extend JPM Coin from its existing rails onto Canton’s privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain, enabling regulated digital cash to move across interoperable networks. According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, JPM Coin, described as the first bank-issued, US dollar-denominated deposit token for institutional clients, represents a digital claim on JPMorgan’s dollar deposits and is designed to facilitate faster, more secure movement of regulated money on public blockchains. “This collaboration brings to life the vision of regulated digital cash that can move at the speed of markets,” said Yuval Rooz, co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset. US investment bank Morgan Stanley is entering the cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund market, with proposed products offering exposure to Bitcoin and Solana, following the strong debut of spot crypto ETFs in the United States. The bank has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch two investment vehicles, the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust and the Morgan Stanley Solana Trust, designed to provide passive investment exposure to the performance of their underlying digital assets. If approved, the funds could be made available to more than 19 million clients within Morgan Stanley’s wealth management division, significantly expanding access to crypto-linked investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have ranked among the most successful ETF launches on record, attracting substantial inflows during their first two years of trading. Momentum has continued into the new year, with renewed investor demand driving fresh inflows during the first trading sessions. London-based banking giant Barclays has made its first investment in a stablecoin-focused company, signaling traditional finance’s growing interest in digital dollar infrastructure. The bank announced an undisclosed investment in Ubyx, a US-based stablecoin clearing platform that connects regulated issuers with financial institutions to facilitate settlement and interoperability. The move also marks a notable shift for Barclays, which in recent years has publicly emphasized the risks associated with digital assets. “This investment aligns with Barclays’ approach to explore opportunities based on new forms of digital money, such as stablecoins,” the bank said in a statement. Ubyx has previously raised $10 million in seed funding, backed by Galaxy and Coinbase. The company was founded by Tony McLaughlin, a former Citibank executive. US investors may soon receive recommendations to buy Bitcoin ETFs from Bank of America’s private bank and Merrill Edge platforms, adding to evidence of Bitcoin’s growing integration into traditional finance. The bank’s chief investment office has approved coverage of four U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including products offered by Bitwise, Fidelity, BlackRock and Grayscale. Collectively, the funds manage more than $100 billion in Bitcoin assets. The move comes roughly a month after Bank of America reportedly advised wealth management clients to allocate 1% to 4% of their portfolios to digital assets. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo.

Title: BNY Rolls Out Tokenized Deposits for Near Real-Time Institutional Settlement

© 2026 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BNY introduces tokenized deposit capability mirroring $55 trillion in institutional cash balances on its private blockchain for faster collateral settlement. BNY, one of the largest global financial services platforms with over $55 trillion in assets, has launched a tokenized deposit capability on its Digital Assets platform. This new feature mirrors institutional clients’ existing cash balances on a private blockchain. It enables near-real-time settlement. The service begins with collateral and margin workflows. BNY’s traditional core banking systems keep all official records in their own private blockchain. BNY launched this new service after deploying tokenization services for money market funds with Goldman Sachs, which was announced in July 2025. According to the company blog, BNY creates on-chain digital book entries that correspond 1:1 to clients’ existing demand deposit claims at the bank. It does not issue new money. BNY records these tokens on its private, permissioned blockchain, which provides a secure, internal network for authorized users. The bank maintains the legal deposits on conventional ledgers for regulatory and reporting purposes. When a client needs to meet margin calls or move collateral, participating institutions can transfer the mirrored balances on-chain in near real time. This setup aims to cut settlement frictions. It also supports an always-on operating model. According to their announcement, the system does not bypass bank supervision or existing risk controls. BREAKING: #BNY expands digital cash capabilities by enabling the on‑chain mirrored representation of client deposit balances on its #DigitalAssets platform via #tokenized deposits. This launch helps advance BNY’s ambitions to support programmable, on‑chain cash for institutional… pic.twitter.com/gQRiZuS0va — BNY (@BNYglobal) January 9, 2026 The rollout first targets collateral and margin workflows. Here, intraday liquidity needs and settlement timing are the greatest sources of sensitivity. Institutions shift tokenized balances across the network within seconds to meet margin requirements. They avoid reliance on legacy cut-off times or batch processes. “As institutional markets move toward always-on operating models, BNY is committed to innovating and helping define how cash moves across the modern financial system,” said Carolyn Weinberg, BNY’s Chief Product and Innovation Officer. BNY is not the only company launching tokenized products. BlackRock, another major financial company, has announced that the “tokenization of all assets” has begun. It expects to tokenize more than $4.1 trillion in traditional products. Standard Chartered launched a similar tokenized deposit product in December 2025. Goldman Sachs also continually investigates and develops new tokenized products. This new institutional trend follows the big impetus set in 2025, with the development of Real World Assets (RWA). Over the last year, the real-world use cases of RWA and related projects have grown explosively. Announcements like this show that this technology will likely remain trendy in 2026.

Title: Bitcoin’s next super rally could depend on this key data point
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-s-next-super-rally-could-depend-on-this-key-data-point
Time Published: 2026-01-09T18:30:00Z
Full Content:
Long-term Bitcoin holders sold nearly $300 billion worth of BTC in 2025, but as this sell pressure declines, a bullish outlook for 2026 has emerged. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTHs) went through one of the most aggressive distribution phases on record in 2025. While the scale of selling rattled the market, onchain data analysis suggests that this pressure may be fading, possibly outlining the next bullish period for BTC price. Key takeaways: Long-term holders distributed about $300 billion in BTC in 2025, marking a historic supply reset. Heavy LTH selling has occurred near cycle peaks or during structural transitions, not at the start of new downtrends. With selling pressure stalling, the next phase may hinge on how early the long-term holder supply stabilizes. The amount of Bitcoin (BTC) that had remained unmoved for at least two years moved onchain sharply in 2025. Nearly $300 billion worth of Bitcoin that had been dormant for over a year re-entered circulation. The 30 days from Nov. 15 to Dec. 14, 2025, marked one of the heaviest long-term holder (LTH) distribution periods in more than five years. Since 2019, sharp declines in long-term holder (LTH) supply have rarely appeared in isolation. They have surfaced during phases when Bitcoin’s trend was already under strain, either approaching exhaustion or undergoing a structural shift. In 2018, the LTH supply fell to 12 million BTC from 13 million, with selling intensity peaking when the 30-day distribution reached 1.08 million BTC in December. At that point, Bitcoin had already spent months declining. Price bottomed near $3,500 in February 2019, before stabilizing and rallying to $11,000 by mid-year, illustrating how heavy LTH selling could precede recovery rather than mark its end. The 2020–2021 cycle unfolded differently. LTH supply dropped to 11.65 million BTC from 13.7 million BTC, while Bitcoin price rose to $61,000 from $14,000. The 30-day distribution peak of 891,000 BTC did not immediately halt the rally. Instead, selling persisted as prices rose, gradually eroding upside momentum before the cycle ultimately rolled over, a reminder that LTH distribution can accompany expansion before defining its limits. During the 2024–2025 bull run, supply declined to 14.5 million BTC from 15.8 million BTC, with the 30-day distribution peaking at 758,000 BTC. Price topped slightly earlier in March, and both metrics then moved sideways through Q2–Q3, reinforcing a familiar pattern: Price strength tends to fade as long-term holders step up distribution. The final phase in mid-to-late 2025 proved more abrupt. LTH supply briefly recovered to 15.4 million BTC in June, before collapsing to 13.5 million BTC by December, the sharpest decline on record. Price weakness appeared in October, but the most selling followed later, with the largest-ever 30-day distribution peak of 1.14 million BTC in November. That sequence suggests capitulation rather than orderly profit-taking, marking a reset rather than a continuation of the prior trend. Related: Bitcoin RSI hints at $105K BTC price rebound as bull signals multiply Since December, the LTH supply has stopped falling, currently around $13.6 million, while Bitcoin has entered a sideways range. Additional confirmation comes from the long-term/short-term holder supply ratio. Every time this ratio has fallen to –0.5 or below, Bitcoin has either entered a base-building phase or rallied to new highs within weeks. In December, the ratio dropped to about -0.53, after which price volatility compressed and momentum stalled, consistent with a reset rather than trend continuation. Thus this combination, aggressive distribution followed by supply stabilization, has historically marked transition phases rather than trend continuation. If the trend repeats, the consolidation through Q1to Q2 could act as a base-building period, with any sustained rally more likely to emerge later, potentially into Q3.

In a blog post, the institution co-founded by Alexander Hamilton described the move as a key step in bolstering its ability to move “programmable, on‑chain cash” across digital rails. The product is powered by the bank’s private and permissioned blockchain, BNY added. The product is for both institutions and “digital natives,” it added. BNY described its tokenized deposits as digital book entries representing funds that participating clients would be able to withdraw through traditional means. The bank said the tokens will initially be used in circumstances related to collateral and margin. The move underscored how Wall Street incumbents are increasingly using digital assets as a way to augment their existing businesses. BNY highlighted the ability of tokenized deposits to “reduce settlement friction” and “improve liquidity efficiency” in various settings. The company noted that clients’ balances, although they will be represented on-chain, will continue to be recorded with BNY’s traditional systems for compliance purposes. In a statement, BNY Chief Product and Innovation Officer Carolyn Weinberg underscored the trusted nature of the institution’s bank deposits. The bank, which has existed for more than 240 years, safeguarded $57.8 trillion in assets on behalf of clients, as of September. The New York-based behemoth also has $2.1 trillion in assets under management. As competitors like JPMorgan expand tokenized deposits to various networks, BNY said that its version of the product will serve as “the connective tissue of BNY’s digital infrastructure,” which includes a tokenized money-market fund with Goldman Sachs that was unveiled in July. After forming its digital assets unit in 2021, the company started managing private keys for clients the following year, with the debut of custody services for Bitcoin and Ethereum. BNY’s blog post included statements from around a dozen crypto-native firms, including crypto bank Anchorage Digital, stablecoin issuers Circle and Paxos, BlackRock-backed tokenization specialist Securitize, and Ripple’s institutional prime brokerage platform, Ripple Prime. “BNY taking this step to enable tokenized deposits is a milestone moment for digital cash adoption,” Anchorage Digital co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley said. Citadel Securities, which said in July that it accounts for 25% of U.S. equity volume, also described tokenization as crucial for the future of finance. The market-making giant's CEO, Ken Griffin, had in 2021 called crypto a “jihadist call” against the U.S. dollar.

Title: Historical Data Tells Why Bitcoin Might Record a Parabolic Run in Q1 2026

Historical performance patterns are shaping expectations of a strong first quarter for Bitcoin, especially following a muted year that preceded it. Data shows that Q1 has treated Bitcoin well, even in extreme bear market conditions. Since the negative first quarter of 2018, subsequent Q1 periods have delivered relatively resilient returns, even in the notoriously bearish 2022. After more than a month of sideways movement, price action has settled into a clearly defined channel that resembles an accumulation range rather than a continuation of a broader downtrend. The persistence of this range strengthens the probability that a local bottom has already formed. Market observers note that a decisive break above the $94,500 level could quickly unlock momentum, putting the psychologically critical $100,000 mark back firmly in focus. For further context, Bitcoin’s recent technical behavior is drawing comparisons to gold’s 2018 cycle. Gold at that time spent months bleeding lower within a falling wedge before breaking out, briefly retesting support, and then entering a powerful price discovery phase. Bitcoin has now exited a similar wedge formation, suggesting a comparable sequence may unfold. A shallow pullback followed by renewed upside would fit neatly into this historical analogue, and potentially accelerate sentiment as the year progresses. However, near-term flows are mixed. Recent data shows U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows late in December, with products from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Ark, and 21Shares recording redemptions. On December 26 alone, IBIT, FBTC, and GBTC collectively saw outflows exceeding $589 million, followed by another round of redemptions on December 31, led again by IBIT. Additional funds, including BITB, HODL, BTCO, and EZBC, also posted weekly outflows. Despite this, the overall narrative is intact. Bitcoin’s longer-term trajectory balances institutional demand through reserves and ETFs with ongoing technical evolution, including Layer 2 development and preparations for post-quantum security. If historical Q1 tendencies align with improving structure and macro liquidity, the conditions for a parabolic move may already be forming.

Title: Should You Use the New Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds?

Learn to make your money work as hard as you, so you can focus on your patients, your family, and your own wellness. Quick Start Page Recommended Professionals Financial Boot Camp Since mid-2024, BlackRock has been offering lifecycle-style ETFs that include an income annuity as part of the mix of assets. Now, it looks like Vanguard wants to get in on the action, announcing in December 2025 a new series of target retirement funds called Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds. You should know two things about the Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds. The first is that this is a new series of funds. We're not talking about all of Vanguard's target retirement funds that were introduced in 2003. Totally different funds. I have no idea why Vanguard used such a similar name, but there will be substantial confusion—especially since the existing target retirement funds include one that is called Target Retirement Income Fund. The key difference is the word “lifetime” in the title. The second thing is that these funds will only be available in employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s. That seems kind of silly, so hopefully that's a temporary thing. The reason it's silly is that when people leave their employers to retire (i.e., the time when an immediate annuity of some kind actually makes sense), they usually roll their 401(k) or 403(b) money to an IRA to allow for more control, more investing options, and often lower fees. Now there's an option available in the 401(k) but not the IRA? What a pain. Perhaps the reason these funds will be a 401(k)-only option is because they are not actually mutual funds. They are Collective Investment Trusts (CITs). Here is an excerpt from a future WCI post on CITs, currently scheduled for publication in March 2026: A CIT is a mutual fund alternative that only exists inside qualified retirement plans, like your 401(k). It's best to just consider it the same thing as a mutual fund, but there are a few minor differences, none of which are really bad. Google lists them well: Bottom line, sometimes CITs are put into 401(k)s instead of mutual funds because they're slightly cheaper. Most of them are index funds or lifecycle-style balanced funds, which is generally a good thing for 401(k) participants. However, because they don't have ticker symbols like mutual funds and stocks, CITs can be a little harder to research on the internet (such as Morningstar and similar resources). More frequently you'll just have to obtain and review the information provided by Human Resources at your company or the 401(k) provider to learn more about the investments. The plan for Vanguard is for these new target retirement funds to look like the older ones, at least until you hit the age of 55. Then, it'll start replacing some of the assets with an immediate annuity to provide more guaranteed income. Morningstar hypothesized that it would look like this: The annuity portion will apparently be run by TIAA-CREF. The idea is to provide a more stable income during those years when you really want a stable income: during your retirement. Perhaps it will help reduce the Sequence of Returns Risk a little better than the mix of stocks and bonds in the older version of target retirement funds. More information here: Best Investment Portfolios — 150+ Portfolios Better Than Yours The 15 Questions You Need to Answer to Build Your Investment Portfolio Probably not. Few have. They're brand new. That's reason enough for me not to buy them. Besides, for most WCIers, lifecycle funds are something they grow out of by necessity as their retirement account situation becomes more complex. It's fine for your Roth IRA in residency. Not so fine when you have a 403(b), a solo 401(k), Roth IRAs, a 457(b), a cash balance plan, and a big taxable account. Target retirement funds are all-in-one solutions that function great when all of your investments are in retirement accounts that offer them. That's not the case for most WCIers by the time they're 55, when this new series of target retirement funds would even start incorporating the annuities. I don't necessarily think these annuity-containing lifecycle funds are a terrible idea, but they also feel like a solution looking for a problem. I suspect most WCIers who want to annuitize a portion of their retirement assets are going to do it directly rather than via a target retirement fund—especially since you can't even buy these things in an IRA. It's good to know these Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds exist, but I think you can pass on them for now. What do you think? Are you interested in lifecycle funds that contain annuities? Why or why not? James M. Dahle, MD, FACEP, FAAEM is a practicing emergency physician and the founder of The White Coat Investor.

Δ Δ The problem these solve is that retirees move their money out of the employer plans. I can tell you that my father’s retirement has been financed mainly by TIAA and it has been extremely lucrative. The TIAA-CREF representative told him that his retirement was funded with 30 year treasuries that were purchased in the 70’s and 80’s when you could get 10% (for 30 years). 30 year rates are back to generational highs right now – but only at about 5%. I think Vanguard is trying to capture that lightning again with a vehicle that can pay out better than 5% yearly for the duration of retirement. This is to entice retiring employees to continue to use the employer funds – which was TIAA-CREF’s secret power. I actually think the tranche of retirees and near retirees who move into this (right now) could actually do pretty well.

Title: Colin Hunt: ‘We’ve seen greenwashing. The new phenomenon is greenhushing’

For Colin Hunt, the Lego-loving chief executive of AIB, the State’s exit as investor in 2025 marked a satisfying milestone, with a big final piece of the bank’s painstaking rebuild clicking into place. “It was an important moment from a morale perspective, but it hasn’t led to any change in strategy or operations, because, in fairness, the State always acted as a rational investor and had a clear desire to exit the share register at a point in time,” said Hunt in an interview with The Irish Times. But some things have changed permanently since taxpayers were forced to commit €20.8 billion to prevent the bank’s collapse during the global financial crisis (GFC), he said. “AIB’s a very different organisation now. I think we’re far more externally oriented than we would have been pre-crisis. And I think AIB’s a less siloed, less hierarchical organisation than it was,” he said. “Banking globally is a very, very procyclical industry and, traditionally, banks would have overlent at the top of [economic] cycles and underlent at the bottom. Our approach now is very much that we take a medium term, acyclical approach and lend through the cycle.” The regulatory environment has changed utterly, too, with banks on both sides of the Atlantic required to hold higher levels of capital reserves and have ‘living wills’ in place to bail-in creditors if regulators deem a lender is likely to fail. The Central Bank of Ireland has gone further, introducing some of the strictest mortgage lending restrictions in Europe, higher fines for wrongdoing, and a regime to make it easier to find senior executives responsible for failings under their watch. “We’re very aware that without the support of Irish taxpayers, this bank would have ceased to exist,” said Hunt. “However, that would have been extraordinarily detrimental to the Irish economy and to our society.” At the end of October, AIB bought back stock warrants that the Government continued to hold in the bank after selling its remaining shares in the lender during the summer. It brought the total that the State has recovered from the bank’s rescue to almost €20.2 billion – leaving a shortfall of a little over €600 million. [ From PTSB sale to Revolut’s mortgage entry: why 2026 is set to be busy year in bankingOpens in new window ] Yet it was far from certain that taxpayers would recoup so much from Ireland’s costliest bailout of a surviving lender – particularly when AIB shares were trading below €1 each during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, just a seventh of the price at which the final shares were sold last June. However, the crisis led to two key developments that have fuelled the bank’s turnaround: a surge in inflation – further stoked by the Ukraine war – that triggered aggressive central bank rate hikes; and the purchase of two large loan books from Ulster Bank, as it exited the market. Ulster’s owner, NatWest, had highlighted the impact of Covid-19 when it confirmed in late 2020 that it was carrying out a strategic review of the bank. AIB – among the most rates-sensitive banks across the sector in Europe – couldn’t help but make record profits in recent years. Indeed, when the European Central Bank’s (ECB) deposit rate peaked at 4 per cent early 2024, AIB was making more money out of parking €32 billion of surplus deposits with the Central Bank than it was from its €35.7 billion Irish mortgage book. But Hunt, who took charge of the bank in 2019, said that measures undertaken by the bank have also underpinned earnings, including the use of financial derivatives – known as interest rate swaps – to protect the bank as the benchmark ECB rate fell by half in 13 months to last June. “That’s an insurance policy that’s working very well,” he said. AIB forecast in November that net interest income would decline only about 10 per cent last year from a record €4.13 billion in 2024. There is a strong preference for instant access on the part of depositors in Ireland and I think that is to do with the psychological scarring from the financial crisis AIB has seen its underlying loan book grow over the past four years, even after stripping out acquired Ulster loans. It follows a series of false dawns for when Irish bank balance sheets would grow again, after contracting dramatically after the financial crash. Hunt has also set up AIB for “a big opportunity” with decisions to repurchase Goodbody Stockbrokers, where he previously served as chief economist, in 2021 and get the bank back into life and pensions after a decade out of this business, by setting up a joint venture, AIB Life, with Canada’s Great-West Lifeco in 2023. Ageing populations are one of three “huge megatrends” (along with artificial intelligence, or AI, and electrification) that Hunt reckons will change the banking sector over the long term. The Republic’s old-age dependency ratio – the percentage of the population aged over 65 relative to those between 15 and 64 – will more than double to about 50 per cent in 2057. “There is inevitably going to be an increase in demand for savings, investment and pensions and it is incumbent on us to make sure that we have AIB-branded products available to our customers,” said Hunt. “And we now have that.” Still, it has a distance to go to catch up with its biggest rival on that front. [ ‘Down to the wire’: ECB’s digital euro project faces decisive vote in 2026Opens in new window ] Bank of Ireland managed to convince the European Commission in 2013 not to force a sale of its New Ireland arm under a restructuring plan tied to its taxpayer bailout. It also repurchased its former Davy unit in 2022, after the firm was plunged into crisis in the wake of a regulatory fine. RBC Capital Markets analysts estimated in a report last month that AIB had €17 billion of assets under management (AUM) at the end of 2025, with Goodbody accounting for 85 per cent and AIB Life the remainder. Bank of Ireland’s AUM stands at €58 billion, with a little over half of this in Davy. While Irish households have grown their wealth by an average of 7 per cent a year over the past decade – more than twice the European rate – they still hold only 12 per cent of their net worth in financial products, including life and investment products and direct shareholdings in companies, the RBC report said. This compares to 19 per cent in France and 16 per cent in Italy and Germany. With 85 per cent of the €172 billion of Irish household deposits sitting in current and on-demand deposit accounts earning little or nothing, according to the latest Central Bank data, RBC said AIB, with the greatest share of Irish deposits, has the best opportunity to nudge customers towards savings and investment products. Goodbody is also known to be in advanced talks to buy BCP Asset Management, which has about €3 billion of AUM. The relationship between AIB and Goodbody is “fundamentally different” from the one that existed when he left the stockbroking firm in 2004, said Hunt. AIB went on to sell the company in 2011 under an EU restructuring plan tied to its bailout. “There were tensions in that relationship that are absent now,” he said. “There is real collaboration and engagement. The AIB that Goodbody came back to is a fundamentally different beast from the one it left.” [ Don’t be fooled — everything has changed for the global economyOpens in new window ] Goodbody now provides investment, pension, and financial planning services for AIB Private Banking clients, whereas under the previous ownership, they competed against each other. Convincing households to put idle money on deposit to potentially better use may be difficult. “There is a strong preference for instant access on the part of depositors in Ireland and I think that is to do with the psychological scarring from the financial crisis,” said Hunt, who was surprised by how reluctant households were to move money to higher-earning term deposits that banks started to offer when ECB rates spiked. The residual trauma has played out in other ways, with debt across households and small businesses at a fraction of where they stood before the crisis, relative to income. “Leverage was completely overinflated in 2007. But, for me, one of the great mysteries in the past 10 years is that while we have had a marked recovery in Irish economic activity, we haven’t seen an increase in credit demand,” he said. “And the best explanation from what I’ve seen is that it’s down to the psychological damage done by the GFC and the collapse of the Irish economy.” AIB disappointed the stock market in early August when it reported that its loan book grew by only 1 per cent in the first half of the year to €71.6 billion, and downgraded its full-year growth forecast to 3 per cent from 5 per cent. This was mainly down to weakness in its international climate capital business, the smallest, but fastest-growing division in recent years, which specialises in large renewable and infrastructure projects across Ireland, Britain, Europe and North America, and caution among small Irish businesses. There was a notable slowdown in green energy investments in the US when Donald Trump took office as president in early 2025. “I think that decisions might have been paused initially,” said Hunt. “There is significantly less talk about the green transition than there was a few years ago. But it’s still happening.” Global spending on green energy investment rose almost 5 per cent to $2.2 trillion last year, double what was allocated to fossil fuels, according to International Energy Agency estimates. “We’ve had greenwashing in the past. The new phenomenon at work now is greenhushing. Investments are being made, projects are being built, but people aren’t talking about it,” he said. “I’ve been of the view for a very long time that capital will need to be deployed [for the green transition] at a scale and pace that we have never seen in the history of global banking. So, it’s an absolutely enormous opportunity – and it requires a certain skill set to safely, prudently deploy capital in this space. We have built that skill set over time.” When Hunt set up a capital climate unit after joining AIB in 2016 from Macquarie to run what was then the group’s wholesale, institutional and corporate banking division, it had four people. It now has about 110. “They do amazing work. They have a really strong reputation.” The team tends to be the lead arranger on many of the multi-banked deals in which it is involved – giving it the opportunity to shape transactions and secure higher fees. The pace at which AI-enabled products and services is evolving is just incredible. It’s going to change our operating environment in ways that we probably can’t even currently envision or imagine On the retail side of the house, close to 60 per cent of the mortgage business written last year was for green loans – where the property has a building energy rating (Ber) between A1 and B3. All told, AIB exited 2025 “with good momentum” on the lending side, Hunt said, adding that he is “comfortable with the medium-term expectation that our loan book will grow by 5 per cent” on a compound annual growth rate basis. Hunt has insisted AIB will bring its running costs, which breached €2 billion last year, back below that level in 2026 – despite its commitment to increase salaries and ongoing inflation – as it continues a policy of not replacing most of the staff who are retiring or quitting naturally. Some analysts say the target will be a tough ask. Total headcount fell by 3 per cent in the 12 months to September – to about 10,350. AIB has become the early front-runner among the domestic banks in warming to AI. It introduced a conversational assistant, called Abi, to customers in 2024 to help with everyday banking questions across its phone and online banking systems. It also rolled out Microsoft Copilot, an AI assistant that helps users write, summarise, analyse data and complete everyday tasks, across the organisation last year. “The pace at which AI-enabled products and services is evolving is just incredible,” he said. “It’s going to change our operating environment in ways that we probably can’t even currently envision or imagine.” Asked if he sees the increased adoption of AI ultimately leading to AIB targeting a much lower workforce, Hunt said: “We’re looking at AI now in terms of cyber [security], fraud detection, our IT resilience, and coding. And I do think you will see it become ever more present in all aspects of the business in the next number of years. Do I have numbers in my head about how this is going to impact our cost base? No. Do I think we’re going to be very significantly reducing our headcount? No.” Hunt said he sees AIB reducing its total workforce by 2-3 per cent a year, through ongoing natural attrition, “in the years ahead”. [ OTC Markets targets Irish companies as listing alternative in New YorkOpens in new window ] The chief executive, meanwhile, has pressed ahead with a plan for staff to work from one of its offices for a minimum of three days a week from the start of the year, even after the Financial Services Union (FSU) said members in the bank had voted “overwhelmingly” to reject the blueprint. The bank is continuing talks this month with the union under the guidance of a mediator on concerns and issues around the new hybrid working model. This year will see Hunt and his team work on the bank’s next three-year strategic plan, which will be presented to the board in November, and will run from 2027. “I’m not letting too many cats out of the bag at this stage by saying I don’t think that our strategic priorities are going to change,” he said. Of big interest to investors will be guidance on how the bank plans to distribute excess capital over the period. RBC estimates AIB has the capacity to fork out €5.7 billion to shareholders over three years by way of dividends and share buy-backs. AIB is also planning the launch of a mobile app in the second half of the year. “I’m really pleased with the shape it’s taking,” said Hunt. “It’s going to be far more intuitive and far easier to use, and it’s going to be more encompassing of all aspects of a person’s financial life.” In the near term, investors will learn how AIB plans to remunerate Hunt, after the Government lifted a bailout-era €500,000 executive pay cap last summer after selling its remaining shares in the bank. “It’s not a matter that I have any influence over. That is decided upon by the remuneration committee of the board, and ultimately by the board itself,” he said, adding that any changes will be revealed at the time of the annual results release, in early March.

Title: Ethereum: BlackRock buys $149mln of ETH, but sellers guard THIS zone

Whales locked supply, leverage unwound, yet ETH refused to move decisively. What’s holding price in place? On-chain data showed whales rotating $31.7 million into staked Ethereum, locking over 40,000 stETH as BlackRock accumulated ETH during market volatility. Large holders continued rotating capital into ETH staking. One whale redeployed $31.7 million via Wintermute, then converted the funds into over 40,000 stETH, worth roughly $126 million. That move locked the supply instead of keeping it liquid. Alongside this, BlackRock added 46,851 ETH, valued near $149 million, over three consecutive days, reinforcing sustained accumulation. Meanwhile, BitMine expanded its commitment by staking an additional 19,200 ETH. This pushed its total staked balance to 827,008 ETH, worth about $2.62 billion. These figures mattered because staking and accumulation removed ETH from circulation. As a result, immediate sell-side pressure continued to thin. Even so, the price did not react impulsively. Ethereum [ETH] traded inside a clearly defined range, reflecting balance rather than weakness. Sellers continued defending the $3,300–3,350 supply zone, where several recovery attempts stalled. Buyers, however, consistently stepped in near the $2,780–2,850 demand zone. Recent pullbacks slowed around $2,800, then rebounded toward $3,100 without acceleration. This repeated behavior highlighted absorption. Volatility narrowed as the price oscillated between these levels. As a result, downside momentum weakened with each test of demand. Sellers struggled to force continuation. Buyers also avoided chasing breakouts. Instead, they accumulated gradually. This range-bound structure aligned with growing staking activity. Locked supply reduced panic selling. Consequently, price stability improved as the market waited for direction. Source: TradingView Spot flow data reinforced the same narrative. ETH continued posting persistent net outflows from exchanges. Recent daily figures showed withdrawals exceeding $52.3M, extending a multi-week trend. This matters because exchanges represent immediate selling venues. When ETH exits, sellers lose fast access to liquidity. Therefore, the circulating supply keeps tightening. However, price has not surged sharply. That detail signals accumulation rather than speculative chasing. Buyers absorb supply without forcing higher levels. Meanwhile, sellers fail to generate follow-through on dips. Outflows remain steady rather than reactive. This consistency reduces downside risk. Each retracement meets thinner sell pressure. Consequently, ETH stabilizes faster after pullbacks, reinforcing the broader compression structure. Source: CoinGlass Derivatives data added another layer to the picture. Open Interest declined by about 2.03%, settling near $40.64 billion. That drop reflected leverage unwinding rather than aggressive short positioning. Importantly, the ETH price held firm during the reduction. This limited forced liquidations and cooled volatility. As leverage exited, the market reset risk instead of amplifying moves. Lower Open Interest reduced liquidation cascades during pullbacks. Consequently, downside moves lost speed and depth. Combined with staking growth and exchange outflows, reduced leverage supported price stability. The market shifted from speculation toward positioning. Source: CoinGlass Overall, growing staking and accumulation activity pointed to rising conviction that downside risk remained limited at current levels. Locked supply, persistent exchange outflows, and declining leverage continued to reduce selling pressure. Upside remained gradual, but structure favored stability over breakdowns.

Title: Warner Bros investors torn on Paramount Skydance bid

Some investors criticise board’s rejection of Paramount’s offer, citing better regulatory chances Share Save Some of Warner Bros Discovery’s biggest investors are split on Paramount Skydance’s sweetened offer for the storied movie studio owner, giving the smaller media company a fighting chance at winning over shareholders. Investors have until January 21 to accept Paramount’s latest $108.4bn proposal, paying them $30 a share, an offer the Warner Bros board says is inferior to its agreement to sell to Netflix. Though the creator of, Stranger Things, is offering just $27.75 a share or $82.7bn, Warner Bros says the financing is more solid and that Paramount’s deal would leave the merged company with too much debt. Alex Fitch, partner and portfolio manager for Harris Oakmark, which held about 96 million shares, or 4 percent of Warner Bros, as of September 30, agrees with the board. “The value still isn’t clearly superior to what has already been agreed to with Netflix. A tie goes to the incumbent,” Fitch said in an email to Reuters. Though Paramount’s offer, on its face, is higher, Warner Bros said it does not cover the $2.8bn breakup fee it would have to pay Netflix, $1.5bn in fees it would owe its bankers and another $350m in financing costs. A smaller investor, Yussef Gheriani, chief investment officer of IHT Wealth Management, which has about 16,000 Warner Bros shares, said in an email that the board’s decision to reject Paramount’s offer makes sense as the increase in total value may not be worth breakup fees and borrowing costs. The deal would leave the combined company with $87bn in debt, Warner Bros said. But Matthew Halbower of Pentwater Capital Management, which said it owns more than 50 million shares, feels differently. He told Warner Bros Chairman Samuel DiPiazza in a letter sent on Wednesday that the board “breached its fiduciary duty” to shareholders by rejecting Paramount’s offer out of hand, saying it was a better deal and had a better chance of clearing regulatory scrutiny. Warner Bros’s board “is choosing not to inquire about what improvements Paramount is willing to make to its offer,” he said in the letter, which was reviewed by Reuters. If Paramount does eventually further improve its $30-per-share offer, the Warner Bros board should at least talk with the suitor, or his firm will not support any Warner Bros directors at their next election, Halbower wrote. Mario Gabelli, whose Gabelli Funds holds about 5.7 million shares of Warner Bros, according to LSEG data, said he is “likely” to sell his shares to Paramount. He said its all-cash offer is more straightforward and would have a faster path to regulatory approval. “At the moment, Paramount has a superior bid,” Gabelli told CNBC. “Netflix has to simplify their bid.” Harris Oakmark, which is Warner Bros’ fifth-largest shareholder, remains open to changing its position. “If they [Paramount] come back to the table with a clearly superior offer, we have full confidence that the WBD board will engage,” Fitch said. It is not often that a marquee media asset like Warner Bros, which owns HBO Max, comes to market, sparking a bidding war. Its extensive content library includes Harry Potter and the DC Comics universe. Its HBO Max streaming service recently acquired the US and Australian distribution rights to the runaway hit, Canadian hockey romance, Heated Rivalry. Warner Bros’s top three shareholders are the large passive fund managers Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock, together controlling some 22 percent. All three are also among the top 10 investors in Paramount and Netflix. On Wall Street, Warner Bros stock is down 0.7 percent while Paramount stock is up 0.7 percent in midday trading. Netflix is trending downwards at 0.2 percent below the market open. Follow Al Jazeera English:

CalPERS, which faces an estimated $166 billion shortfall, insists the position won't influence financial choices.

CalPERS, which faces an estimated $166 billion shortfall, insists the position won't influence financial choices. Shari Slate was hired for the job with base compensation of $221,580, though neither her Linkedin profile nor the news release indicate she has any experience in the finance industry. CalPERS’ May 2025 state paperwork for the position says responsibilities include “integrating DEI principles into CalPERS’ investment practices, where the Chief DEI Officer collaborates with the Investment Office,” and “collaborating with investment groups to integrate DEI into financial decision-making, advocating for equity-driven investment strategies, and ensuring that CalPERS’ investment portfolio reflects its commitment to sustainability, social responsibility, and equitable outcomes.” (Excerpt) Read more at thecentersquare.com ...

Title: Some of Warner Bros' biggest investors are split on Paramount offer

Business Paramount and Warner Bros logos are seen in this illustration taken December 8, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Jan 8 : Some ‌of Warner Bros Discovery's biggest investors are split on Paramount Skydance's sweetened offer for the storied movie studio owner, giving the smaller media company a fighting chance at winning over shareholders. Investors have until Jan. 21 to accept Paramount's latest $108.4 billion proposal, paying them $30 a share, an offer the Warner Bros board says is inferior to its agreement to sell to Netflix. Though the creator of "Stranger Things" is offering just $27.75 a share or $82.7 billion, Warner Bros says the financing is more solid and that Paramount's deal would leave the merged company with too much debt. Alex Fitch, partner and portfolio manager for Harris Oakmark, which held about 96 million shares, or 4 per cent of Warner Bros, ‌as of Sept 30, agrees with the board. "The value still isn’t clearly superior to what has already ‌been agreed to with Netflix. A tie goes to the incumbent," Fitch said in an e-mail to Reuters.

Loading Though Paramount's offer, on its face, is higher, Warner Bros said it doesn't cover the $2.8 billion breakup fee it would have to pay Netflix, $1.5 billion in fees it would owe its bankers and another $350 million in financing costs. A smaller investor, Yussef Gheriani, Chief Investment Officer of IHT Wealth Management, which has about 16,000 Warner Bros shares, said in an email that the board's decision to reject Paramount's offer makes sense as the increase in total value may not be worth breakup fees and borrowing costs. The ‍deal would leave the combined company with $87 billion in debt, Warner Bros said. But Matthew Halbower of Pentwater Capital Management, which said it owns more than 50 million shares, feels differently. He told Warner Bros Chairman Samuel DiPiazza in a letter sent Wednesday that the board "breached its fiduciary duty" to shareholders by rejecting Paramount's offer out of hand, saying it was a better deal and had a better chance of clearing regulatory scrutiny.Warner Bros' board "is choosing not to inquire about what improvements ​Paramount is willing to make to its offer," he ‌said in the letter, which was reviewed by Reuters. If Paramount does eventually further improve its $30-per-share offer, the Warner Bros board should at least talk with the suitor, or his firm will not support any Warner Bros directors at their next election, Halbower wrote. Mario ​Gabelli, whose Gabelli Funds holds about 5.7 million shares of Warner Bros, according to LSEG data, said he is “likely” to sell his shares to Paramount. He said ⁠its all-cash offer is more straightforward and would have a faster path ‌to regulatory approval.“At the moment, Paramount has a superior bid,” Gabelli told CNBC. “Netflix has to simplify their bid.”Harris Oakmark, which is Warner Bros' fifth-largest ​shareholder, remains open to changing its position. "If they (Paramount) come back to the table with a clearly superior offer, we have full confidence that the WBD board will engage," Fitch said.It's not often that a marquee media asset like Warner Bros, which owns HBO ‍Max, comes to market, sparking a bidding war. Its extensive content library includes "Harry Potter" and the DC Comics universe. Its HBO Max streaming service recently acquired ⁠the U.S. and Australian distribution rights to runaway hit, Canadian hockey romance "Heated Rivalry."Warner Bros' top three shareholders are the large passive fund managers Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock, together controlling some ​22 per cent. All three are also among the ‌top ten investors in Paramount and Netflix. All three fund firms declined to comment.

Title: BlackRock adds $900M BTC as Bitcoin long-term selling falls to 2017 lows
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-adds-dollar900m-btc-as-bitcoin-long-term-selling-falls-to-2017-lows

Full Content:
BlackRock added close to 9,000 BTC during the first week of January, rebuilding exposure after an end-of-year drawdown in 2025 and pointing to early signs of BTC accumulation. Cointelegraph in your social feed BlackRock’s fresh round of Bitcoin (BTC) buying takes place alongside a sharp slowdown in long-term selling, a combination that points to cooling downside pressure after the recent market pullback in Q4. Key takeaways: BlackRock added nearly $900 million worth of Bitcoin in the first week of January, rebuilding exposure after an end-of-2025 drawdown. Long-term Bitcoin holders are selling at their lowest rate since 2017, despite elevated prices. Onchain data pointed to a possible accumulation phase among certain wallet cohorts. Data from Lookonchain indicated BlackRock has accumulated Bitcoin for the past three days, adding 9,619 BTC valued at roughly $878 million. The asset management company currently holds about 780,400 BTC, worth $70 billion. BlackRock’s BTC holdings peaked on Nov. 30 at about 804,000 BTC. At the time, that position was valued at roughly $96.5 billion. Although holdings fell to 771,000 BTC by Jan. 1, BlackRock has swiftly added close to 9,000 BTC during the first week of January. The institutional buying coincided with a notable shift among long-term holders. Bitcoin’s Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric on Binance has fallen to its lowest level since 2017, signaling that older coins are barely moving onto exchanges. For context, long-term holder supply dropped to 13.6 million in November 2025 from over 15 million in July 2025. Over the past couple of months, the long-term supply has not decreased further. Onchain data from CryptoQuant helps explain this shift. The SOPR Ratio, which broadly compares whether recent buyers and long-term holders are selling at a profit or loss, has dropped to levels associated with market resets. Newer participants are selling at losses, while long-term holders remain profitable and largely inactive. This pattern reflects a clean-up phase after sharp rallies, where speculative positions unwind, and coins change hands at lower prices. With Bitcoin down roughly 20% to 25% from its highs, this dynamic can mark the early stages of accumulation, provided selling pressure from recent buyers continues to drop. Related: Morgan Stanley’s Bitcoin ETF could offer strategic value beyond inflows, analysts say Bitcoin’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) added another layer of context. The metric currently sits near the 0.3 level, a zone that has historically marked transitions from recovery into more constructive market conditions. Holders, on average, are back in moderate profit, but the market remains far from the excess seen near major cycle tops. This positioning suggests a cautious transition phase rather than a clear breakout. Confidence appears to be rebuilding, but broader confirmation on both onchain and market structure would be needed before a stronger move.

Title: Why BlackRock’s $1B crypto bet could shape markets in 2026
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/why-blackrocks-1b-crypto-bet-could-shape-markets-in-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-08T14:00:16Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s latest move signals a pivotal moment for the 2026 bull cycle – Here’s what you should know. BlackRock has officially ended its silence. After a period of strategic inactivity, the world’s largest asset manager has re‑entered the market, beginning a high‑conviction accumulation phase. On-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that over the last 72 hours, BlackRock has absorbed nearly $1 billion in digital assets. The firm transferred 9,619 BTC valued at $878 million and 46,851 ETH worth $149 million into its custody. This three-day blitz signals a decisive pivot from the choppy outflows of late 2025 into a concentrated ‘ETF 2.0’ era for 2026. To understand why BlackRock goes through long periods of flatlining followed by massive spikes, let’s view the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as a global liquidity grocery store. During mute weeks, the store isn’t empty; it’s simply operating off the inventory kept in the backroom. In technical terms, this is the secondary market buffer. Authorized Participants (APs) often hold a surplus of shares or Bitcoin [BTC], allowing them to satisfy buy orders without the ETF ever needing to interact with the underlying spot market. To the outside observer, BlackRock appears inactive. But, in reality, the backroom supply is being quietly absorbed by investors. This is when the accumulation week triggers as the shelves run bare. When internal liquidity is exhausted or when quarterly rebalancing cycles converge, BlackRock is forced to enter the spot market to restock. This creates the massive green bars we see in the data, not necessarily representing a sudden change in sentiment, but the visible fulfillment of weeks of pent-up institutional demand. Needless to say, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF also falls into the same analysis. This comes at a time when, after a surge of optimism kicked off 2026, the market has hit a technical speed bump. Despite the three-day accumulation streak, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded outflows worth $130 million, cooling off from the inflows seen in the first week of the New Year. Similarly, BlackRock’s ETHA also saw $6.6 million in outflows this week, following a strong opening week. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, the market was feeling the weight of this consolidation. Bitcoin was trading at $90,245.14, down by 2.41% in 24 hours, while Ethereum [ETH] has slipped to $3,118.03, a 4.99% drop during the same period. When such movements happen, these prices typically move sideways. The lack of aggressive selling from institutional giants prevents a total collapse, stabilizing the market at these higher valuations. For traders, this is the calm before the shock. History also shows that once BlackRock finishes this quiet accumulation, the resulting supply squeeze is often what pushes Bitcoin through major resistance levels, like the current $94,500 barrier.

Projections indicate this market will grow to $42.06 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 31.15%, ultimately reaching $154.0 billion by 2034 with a CAGR of 29.63%. Key growth drivers during the historical period included notable advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, the rising adoption of digital financial platforms, the expansion of the financial services sector, and greater awareness of investment planning. Challenges such as data security concerns and limited product customization hindered growth. Looking ahead, the growth of the robo advisory market will be fueled by the increasing penetration of smartphones, a heightened demand for personalized and goal-based investment strategies, and a surge in ESG and sustainable investing options. However, challenges such as trust issues, regulatory hurdles, and trade tensions might impede growth. In 2024, North America emerged as the largest region in the market, representing 47.37% or $5.13 billion of global revenue, followed by Asia Pacific and Western Europe. The fastest growth rates from 2024 to 2029 are expected in Asia Pacific and Eastern Europe, with CAGRs of 36.90% and 34.75%, respectively. The industry remains concentrated, with the top ten competitors commanding 49.69% of the market in 2024. Notable players include The Charles Schwab Corporation leading with a 21.65% market share, followed by The Vanguard Group, Inc., and Fidelity Management & Research Company. The market is sectioned into various segments, including service type, business model, end-user, and provider. The direct plan-based/goal-based segment dominated with 61.14% market share in service type, and hybrid robo advisors led in the business model category, accounting for 64.20%. High net worth individuals represented the largest end-user segment, capturing 52.89% of the market. Strategic opportunities are abundant, with the direct plan-based/goal-based segment poised to gain $17.27 billion in sales by 2029. The fintech robo advisors provider segment is expected to increase its annual sales by $14.29 billion by 2029, while high net worth individuals will contribute an additional $17.96 billion in sales. Hybrid robo advisors are anticipated to generate $21.81 billion, representing significant growth potential. Key strategies for market growth focus on advancing hybrid wealth management models, expanding integrated digital wealth platforms, and democratizing access to investment strategies. Companies are advised to tap into market opportunities by scaling hybrid advisory models, expanding digital ecosystems, and capitalizing on growth in both emerging and developed markets.

Share this article BlackRock, the global investment management firm, moved about 3,064 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $276 million, along with 26,723 Ethereum worth more than $83 million, to Coinbase Prime today, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The latest transfers come as ETF flows in early 2026 turned volatile, with strong inflows at the start of January quickly giving way to sharp outflows. After solid buying on Jan 2 and Jan 5, sentiment reversed sharply on Jan 6 and Jan 7, resulting in net outflows for the period, per Farside Investors. IBIT, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, posted $130 million in redemptions yesterday as US spot Bitcoin funds suffered $486 million in net outflows, their biggest daily outflow since late November.

Title: Ethereum – Will the $3,400-level hold after whales, institutions’ latest bet?

Key resistance tests await the world’s largest altcoin. On 07 January 2026, Ethereum’s price surged to a critical $3,200-$3,400 resistance zone, with the market teetering on the edge. With liquidity building up around this level, the question remains – Can ETH break through this resistance, or would a pullback be imminent? James Wynn is in the news today after his 25x leveraged Ethereum long position, securing $87,594 in Bitcoin profits before diving into ETH. His floating profit of $172k from his $PEPE position was a testament to his aggressive strategy. Source: Onchain Lens Wynn’s bold approach highlights his confidence in Ethereum’s potential, especially as the digital asset is challenged by its key resistance levels. His aggressive positioning at these levels is a sign of optimism among crypto traders about the altcoin’s future. Ethereum’s bullish momentum surged on the back of record $114M inflows into Ethereum [ETH] ETFs on 06 January. Institutional investments, led by BlackRock, have spurred its credibility over the past few weeks and months. Source: Ted Pillows The recent hike in interest could be the start of a larger market rally, with liquidity building up to potentially break through resistance levels. Soon after James Wynn’s whale rotation, World Liberty Financial also signaled the same kind of move with a significant purchase of Ethereum. They swapped $2.5 million in WBTC for 770 ETH, further demonstrating the growing shift of institutional capital towards Ethereum. World Liberty Financial’s strategic move to acquire Ethereum is a sign of broader market sentiment that ETH may be ready for further growth on the price charts. On the back of greater institutional participation, this can be seen as a very bullish sign for the altcoin. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price seemed to be at a critical point, with liquidity clusters forming around the $3,200-$3,400 resistance zone. Source: CoinGlass Failure to break this range could pull the price down back to $3,000. The RSI stood at 61.72, indicating overbought conditions, while the MACD’s readings highlighted positive momentum. Source: TradingView A breakout could propel Ethereum to $3,800, but a reversal is also possible if the resistance holds.

Posted on 01/07/2026 9:15:41 PM PST by SeekAndFind President Trump on Wednesday called for a ban on “large institutional investors” buying single-family homes in a bid to address the issue of affordability. “I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,” Trump said in a Truth Social post, adding that he will discuss the topic, including further Housing and Affordability proposals, at the World Economic Forum in Davos later this month. The proposed ban could prove to be a way in for Trump and Republicans to address the issue of affordability ahead of this year’s midterm elections. The president and his Republican allies have struggled to message on the issue as inflation persists and as Democrats have won a number of special and off-year elections by zeroing in on the topic. Several private equity firms and real estate trusts have swept-up up a considerable amount of single-family homes that are then turned around to rent. That has destabilized the homebuying market by reducing supply as well as how it has impacted home prices. In his Truth Social post, the president laid blame on former President Biden for current inflation, which have remained stagnant during Trump’s second-term so far. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” the president noted.

That has destabilized the homebuying market by reducing supply as well as how it has impacted home prices. In his Truth Social post, the president laid blame on former President Biden for current inflation, which have remained stagnant during Trump’s second-term so far. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” the president noted.

Title: War for Ukraine Day 1,413: A Brief Wednesday Night Update

Come for the politics, stay for the snark. by Adam L Silverman| January 7, 202611:41 pm| 17 Comments This post is in: Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Military, Open Threads, Russia, Silverman on Security, War, War in Ukraine I know it’s been a long, tragic, horrifying, day that has everyone one a fine edge, so I’m just going to run through the basics really quickly and call it a night. I do want to start with this excerpt from Lincoln’s speech at the Cooper Union: Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the Government, unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please, on all points in dispute between you and us. You will rule or ruin in all events. Back to the topic at hand. Imagine that: US did NOT SIGN the Paris “letter of intent” that describes how peace in Ukraine will be monitored by the US while Europe provides troops etc – distancing itself from the EU. In fact, US hasn’t signed anything that the coalition of willing has agreed to. [image or embed] — Olga Nesterova (@onestpress.onestnetwork.com) January 7, 2026 at 8:18 AM As I wrote last night: As with all of these leaks of what the US will do, might do, could do, etc, I’ll believe it when I see it. And as usual, we’re not going to see it. However we’ve not got Jared’s sex pest convicted extortionist father involved in trying to shake down the Ukrainians: Now Kushner Sr is part of these “discussions”? US hasn’t signed a single document that the coalition of the willing signed yesterday. In particular, the one where US is mentioned to be “overseeing” potential ceasefire. Come on. Too many words to say that you discussed Blackrock owning UA assets. [image or embed] — Olga Nesterova (@onestpress.onestnetwork.com) January 7, 2026 at 10:51 AM I’m pretty sure that if you could explain what the Kushner family has become and then ask the Bielskys whether it was worth the risk to rescue Jared’s grandparents, they’d say no. President Zelenskyy did not make a daily address today as he was again traveling. In this case to a meeting of the Council of Europe where he made an address to that body. Video below, English transcript after the jump. 7 January 2026 – 21:44 Thank you very much! Mr. President – Nikos, thank you for today’s visit, for the invitation, and our conversation. First of all, what I want to say, we are grateful to Denmark for its presidency. And we respect its territorial integrity and sovereignty. And we appreciate the beginning of the Cyprus presidency. And we respect its territorial integrity and sovereignty. We are Ukraine, please respect our territorial integrity and sovereignty. And dear Mr. President – Nikos, Ursula, António, our friends, thanks for today’s meeting! Dear Maia! Presidents and Excellencies! I’m glad to be here as Cyprus begins its presidency of the Council of the European Union. And this is a presidency we all expect a lot from. For Ukraine, this moment is really very, very meaningful – just as it is for Cyprus – a member state that, unfortunately, remains divided, but committed to lasting peace – and is fully equal in Europe. And a country that may be smaller in size but has an equal voice in European institutions. This says a lot about what Europe truly is – that every nation matters, and every free country in Europe deserves to be part of our shared European home. And that is what makes Europe stable and peaceful. Ukraine also deserves this – to be an equal part of our common European home. And we hope that your presidency will be productive in moving us forward on this path. Nikos and I discussed this today. It is very important that Ukraine is among the priorities of the Cyprus presidency. And we are grateful for what the President has said – that we should aim to open negotiation clusters at the same time during your presidency – for both, of course, for both, Ukraine and our friends – Moldova. And this is a strong and positive ambition. And during your presidency, we hope to see the start of the implementation of the €90 billion support package for Ukraine – funding that strengthens our resilience, and with it, the resilience of all of Europe. And thank you again, Ursula, thank you, António, thank you for your support, and all the European leaders, for the decision, a very important decision – how to save Ukraine, it means how to save Europe. We need a practical mechanism that will allow these funds to truly help Ukraine. This mechanism must be designed not to create problems, of course, but to reduce the challenges we already face. And we are doing everything required on our side in the negotiation process, and we expect that no additional or excessive demands will be placed on Ukraine. At the same time, as Cyprus begins its presidency, peace negotiations have reached a new level of intensity. We work very, very actively – Ukraine, our European partners, and of course, the United States, and all members of our Coalition of the Willing – from Canada to Japan, from the EU to Australia. And it is possible – and we sincerely hope – that this war could end during your presidency. And of course, only if enough pressure is put on the aggressor. And we all understand how wars like this one – Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, our people, our children – come to an end. And when pressure is strong enough to exhaust the source of the war, peace comes. That pressure exists now, and the EU plays a key role in maintaining it. And I thank you for your willingness to help. Sanctions on Russia, support for Ukraine, strengthening our defense together – all of this works for peace, of course. And we have discussed – at the EU level, within the Coalition of the Willing, and in our bilateral work with Cyprus – that sanctions need to be upgraded. A new package is being prepared. And many steps are being taken to target Russia’s shadow fleet, and this will work. Every dollar Russia loses is a dollar that does not fuel the aggressor. It’s extremely important that we continue receiving support – both for our defense and for our diplomacy – equally from all parts of Europe. That’s why your support matters to us – your recent visit to Ukraine, Mr. President, and the unity we’re showing now, at the start of the Cyprus presidency. This year, one of the new European initiatives, very important – the SAFE program – must also prove its effectiveness. If it succeeds, Europe will become stronger. And in many ways, this depends on your presidency, Mr. President. And we hope that together with you – with Cyprus and with every EU country – we can work productively, of course. And I wish you a very successful presidency. I truly hope that during these months, Europe will become stronger, of course, and that people across our continent will feel that tomorrow can be safer, more stable, and better than today. I also deeply believe that together, we can help deliver one of the most important guarantees of peace and security – for our nation and for the whole of Europe – Ukraine’s membership in the European Union.

He grew up within the overlap of the Cuban revolutionaries that emerged from the Bay of Pigs fiasco and then became central players in the narco-cartels. Rubio is where he is today because a carteled up local high net worth individual in Miami wanted his own state legislator and then US Senator. So Lil Narco was protected from the crimes he himself committed while others were sacrificed to the criminal justice system.

And everyone in NATO provided some form of support. Second, the reason that the Russians don’t own all of Ukraine is because of the efforts of the Ukrainians with assistance from many others, including, but not limited to the US. Assistance, however, that does not, has not, and will not include actual military assistance as in having allies send their forces to come and fight alongside the Ukrainians. Third, what US assistance had been provided, which was always too little and far too often too late, has now essentially been stopped by Trump and his natsec team. “No new air defense systems have arrived from the U.S.; missiles are coming in bit by bit, but we want to speed it up.” – Zelenskyy. — WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated.bsky.social) January 7, 2026 at 8:14 AM Trump has had a wild day and evening on social media, I’m not going to get into the rest.

AlaskaReader January 8, 2026 at 12:14 am Thanks Adam YY_Sima Qian January 8, 2026 at 12:22 am Trump also claimed on Truth Social that he wants the defense budget to go from US$ 1T to US$ 1.5T. Leaving aside whether Congress will agree to fund such a massive increase (& I hope the Congressional Dems will be united in opposing such an increase), most of the pathologies the US military & MIC suffer from cannot be solved by shoveling more units of exchange into the machine. More funding can increase pay, that could help w/ recruitment & retention. More funding can boost stockpiling of spare parts, & that could help w/ equipment availability. Beyond that, the US faces real constraints in industrial capacity & human capital. Unless those bottlenecks are eased 1st (which takes years, if not decades), more money just means faster price inflation for weapons & munitions. See cost of tertiary education in the US. Spending 5% of GDP while the PRC spends < 2%, from a position of significant disadvantage in industrial capacity (weapons manufacturing accounts for 25% of all US manufacturing, vs. 4% in the PRC) & human capital, is also a recipe for a Soviet like decline. The bond market might also balk at taking on so much more debt, though you can bet the reactionaries will also leverage the “necessity” of military spending to gut social welfare further. The late stage Soviet Union vibes keep getting stronger & stronger. Adam L Silverman January 8, 2026 at 12:26 am @Westyny: You’re welcome.

Along with whatever instructions he’s issued by EO to defense contractors. YY_Sima Qian January 8, 2026 at 12:34 am @Adam L Silverman: That’s the next rung up the escalation ladder. Also, I think the US still brings critical capabilities to monitor Russian naval & air activities going into North Atlantic, I am not sure Denmank or European NATO is ready to just take over those capabilities & responsibilities. Europe is indeed between a rock & a hard place, so we have the farcical situation of Europe desperate trying to keep the US engaged in Ukraine, but also desperately trying to keep the US out of Greenland. As you’ve written repeatedly, Trump does not want to engage in Ukraine. Perhaps it is time Europe comes to grip w/ that fact, & stop trying to placate Trump. If Trump is willing to continue to sell US made weapons & munitions to Europe, for Europe to then donate to Ukraine, that is probably the best that can be hoped for.

Title: Why WisdomTree pulled its XRP ETF just as institutional demand peaked
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/why-wisdomtree-pulled-its-xrp-etf-just-as-institutional-demand-peaked/
Time Published: 2026-01-08T02:00:41Z

WisdomTree used Rule 477 to avoid a public SEC setback, raising deeper questions about regulatory pressure. In the first week of 2026, XRP has taken center stage, becoming one of the most talked-about assets in the market. Analysts are calling it the “hottest trade” of the year, as it quickly outpaced Bitcoin’s early gains thanks to strong ETF inflows and its appeal as a less crowded alternative. But just as the momentum reached a fever pitch, a sudden regulatory U-turn has reminded investors that institutional adoption is rarely a straight line. According to an RW filing with the U.S. SEC, WisdomTree has formally withdrawn its registration statement for the WisdomTree XRP Fund (Form S-1). While “withdrawal” might sound like hitting a simple delete button, invoking Rule 477 serves as a strategic legal safeguard. Under the Securities Act of 1933, this rule lets an issuer pull a registration statement before it becomes effective and before any securities are sold. In this case, WisdomTree withdrew its Form S-1, originally filed on 2nd December 2024. By asking the Commission to withdraw “all exhibits and amendments,” WisdomTree has also reset its regulatory clock. This move also stops the SEC from issuing a formal “order of stop” or a public rejection, outcomes that could create a lasting negative precedent for the firm’s future crypto ambitions. It noted, “The Trust is requesting withdrawal of the Registration Statement because it has determined not to proceed at this time with the offering covered by the Registration Statement.” In the meantime, it can be said that WisdomTree’s retreat aligns with the standards set by BlackRock, though there’s no clear evidence to support that. Despite the frenzy of the 2026 altcoin ETF rush, BlackRock has remained absent from the XRP and Solana [SOL] race, appearing content to maintain its dominance solely within the Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] markets. This comes at a time when XRP ETFs are breaking records. On the 6th of January alone, XRP ETFs recorded $19.12 million in net inflows, with Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ recording $7.35 million in inflows, followed by Canary’s XRPC with $6.49 million and Bitwise with $3.54 million. Yet, despite a Cumulative Total Net Inflow sitting at a staggering $1.25 billion, the asset’s price action tells a different story. At press time, XRP slipped to $2.25, marking a 4.9% drop in just 24 hours. However, while some institutions are pulling back, others remain historically bullish. In a significant note to clients last year, Standard Chartered issued one of the most aggressive calls for the altcoin, setting a bold price target of $8 by the end of 2026. Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s Head of Digital Assets Research, put it best when he said, “Improving U.S. regulatory clarity has made it easier for institutions to take exposure and has given Ripple and the XRP ecosystem room to build without constant litigation risk.” With an $8 target implying approximately 300% upside from current support levels, the stakes for 2026 couldn’t be higher.

“Adde parvum parvo magnus acervus erit.” –Ovid Do you like the world around you? Are you eager to take another trip around the sun? Like it or not. Eager or not. The New Year is here… We intend to make the best of it. We suppose you do too. Where to begin? Silver delivered some excitement to close out the year. After skyrocketing past $80 per ounce, the grey metal (Ag) has been on a volatile ride between liquidity squeezes and midnight margin calls. Behind the scenes, naked shorting – the fraudulent move where big banks sell silver they haven’t even borrowed – pushed the financial system to the breaking point. When prices spiked, these paper bets got torched. To maintain solvency, it is suspected the banks took to the overnight repo market for instant cash to cover their short positions. This may have provided a temporary solution. But the Federal Reserve, via the overnight repo market, cannot print silver. It can merely extend credit. We believe the market disorder that hit the day after Christmas will return in the New Year. And it’s only a matter of time before one of the big banks will be caught swimming with its pants down. As we enter 2026, it’s quite evident that the global landscape stands at a precarious crossroads. From our vantage point in Southern Appalachia, we see the convergence of a bursting technological bubble, a seismic shift in geopolitical aggression, and a radical transformation of the very nature of money and securities. Through ongoing discussions with our friend Dick, we’ve distilled this down to roughly four themes we expect will dominate in 2026. These four themes are presented herein. And, as a special bonus for reading to the end, we’ve included a practical recommendation for off-grid survival. So put on your favorite work boots – the older the better – and grab a shovel. It’s time to dig into the New Year’s edition of the Economic Prism. First off… There will be a broad realization in 2026 that the rapid buildout of AI has been a giant waste of money. That the trillions of dollars in capital piled into data centers and chips has been set on fire. This realization will appear in the form of a mega, AI driven stock market crash and associated debt crisis and economic contraction. We’re not predicting the end of AI. We’re merely suggesting that AI is something much different than what’s been advertised. Without question, AI can and will support many useful applications. When integrated into processes and systems where outcomes are dependent on data and logically defined protocols, AI has demonstrated abilities to quickly complete tasks. However, returns from the development of AI enabled tools are nowhere near what’s needed to justify the capital being expended. A recent study from MIT, for example, found that 95 percent of enterprise AI pilots fail to deliver a measurable return on investment. AI tools and applications may ultimately become ubiquitous. But unless something dramatically changes with the technology, above and beyond addressing degradation and hallucinations, AI will never be a form of actual intelligence or a replacement for the human ability to ask questions, innovate, and invent. Robert Gore, at Straight Line Logic, explains: “At root, the problem is that although AI can answer a seemingly infinite number of questions, it can’t ask a single one. It can be programmed to spot and attempt to resolve conflicts within data, but it doesn’t autonomously ask questions. From birth, the human mind is an autonomous question generator; it’s how we learn. […]. Curiosity and questions are the foundation of learning and intelligence. Reading even a page of something interesting or provocative will generate questions. Generative AI ‘reads’ trillions of pages without an iota of curiosity. No one who either hails or warns of AI surpassing human intelligence (HI) has explained how it will do so while bypassing the foundation of HI.” This critical defect is why AI will not live up to the expectations placed upon it. Moreover, when the realization hits that AI isn’t the immediate productivity miracle promised, the $5 trillion valuations we’re seeing will evaporate. Since AI-related stocks drove nearly 80 percent of market gains in 2025, a tech correction will trigger a broad market crash. As capital dries up, companies will cut spending and jobs, leading to a sharp recession or depression. The central planners in government generally respond to economic depressions in three ways. Through printing massive amounts of money, starting or escalating wars, or fabricating a pandemic. The money printing serves to bail out the big banks while a burgeoning war or faux pandemic, with the right propaganda, distracts the population from the problems at home, while also justifying massive money printing. This leads us to our next theme for 2026… For years, the focus was on the Forever Wars of the Middle East. Then it was the ongoing proxy war with Russia via Ukraine. But as we head into 2026, the Trump administration has executed a massive strategic pivot. The new front line? Venezuela. White House advisor Stephen Miller recently set the tone for this new focus with intense rhetoric on the history of Venezuelan energy. He stated: “American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela. Its tyrannical expropriation was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property. These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs.” By highlighting the nationalization of oil as a direct theft from the American people, the White House makes a moral and legal case for more aggressive intervention and gunboat diplomacy. Under Operation Southern Spear, the U.S. has moved a massive naval force into the Caribbean, including the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group. Over the last few months, the U.S. has conducted dozens of maritime strikes against what it says are narco-terrorist vessels. In reality, this strategic focus on Venezuela has little to do with drugs and has everything to do with Venezuelan oil exports to China. President Trump has effectively declared a maritime blockade, with the Navy now authorized to seize sanctioned tankers. This is because despite heavy sanctions, China remains the primary buyer of Venezuelan crude, importing roughly 570,000 barrels per day. By blockading these waters, the U.S. isn’t just targeting the Maduro government of Venezuela. It’s cutting off a critical energy artery for Beijing. The administration’s Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine essentially warns that the Western Hemisphere is closed to Chinese strategic investment. The New Cold War is about more than semiconductors and TikTok. The waters off the coast of Venezuela are now the location of the global power struggle between Washington and Beijing. China isn’t just a casual observer in Caracas. It is the country’s greatest financier. Over the last two decades, Beijing has poured over $60 billion into Venezuela, much of it structured as ‘oil-for-loan’ deals. When Stephen Miller talks about the “tyrannical expropriation” of American assets, he’s also pointing to who moved in after the U.S. left (i.e., China). By keeping the Maduro government afloat with infrastructure projects and debt extensions, China secured a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere – in what the U.S. traditionally considers its backyard. Operation Southern Spear is a direct shot at China’s energy security. The U.S. is now physically seizing tankers like the Centuries, which was intercepted in late December carrying nearly 2 million barrels of oil bound for China. By stopping these shipments, President Trump is forcing Beijing to choose between backing Venezuela and risking a direct naval confrontation or losing billions in invested capital and an important source of oil. As this escalates in 2026, it will provide cover for the U.S. government to, once again, radically change the form and feel of money, which is our next theme for 2026. Several weeks ago, we talked about how the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law by President Trump on July 18, 2025, requires stablecoins to be backed one-for-one by U.S. dollars or other low-risk assets, primarily short-term U.S. Treasuries. We noted that this policy commences the next shift in American money. If you haven’t been keeping up with this development, join the club. The idea of stablecoins becoming a de facto digital dollar, and creating massive new demand for U.S. Treasuries, sounds enigmatic. Perhaps this is why hardly anyone is talking about it. Quite frankly, we don’t like the idea and would rather ignore it. But, alas, this is happening whether we like it or not. And it will be a major theme in 2026. Stablecoins, as we understand them, are issued by private entities not by central banks. They are not a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Their issuance is driven by market demand, not monetary policy. When stablecoin issuers back their tokens with Treasury securities, they own the Treasury asset. Any interest payments from those Treasuries go to the issuer because the issuer holds the asset. In fact, the GENIUS Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest or yield directly to stablecoin holders as part of the stablecoin product. The GENIUS Act also requires a stablecoin issuer to publicly disclose reserves each month certified by executives. Larger issuers face additional auditing requirements. To add confusion, there are stablecoins that operate outside of the jurisdiction of the U.S. and are not compliant with the GENIUS Act. Tether, for example, issues a popular stablecoin called USDT and maintains a stable value pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. Tether, at the same time, has essentially told Uncle Sam and its GENIUS Act to pound sand. Rather than backing its tokens exclusively with U.S. Treasuries, as required by the Genius Act, Tether keeps a chunk of its reserves in bitcoin and precious metals. In Q3 2025, Tether was the biggest buyer of gold, buying more gold than any central bank. Also, rather than providing audits, per the GENIUS Act, Tether prefers quarterly attestations. And, because it’s headquartered in El Salvador, it doesn’t meet the US-based requirement. Does that mean that USDT is better or worse than the USDC stablecoin issued by Circle, which is based in the U.S. and fully compliant with the GENIUS Act? Perhaps Tether’s existence as an offshore international digital dollar that operates outside of the U.S. government’s control, and with some of its reserves in gold, is an advantage. This, too, could be its demise. Remember, the Trump administration’s objective with the GENIUS Act is to create a new source of Treasury demand funded by private issuers so that America’s massive debt can be financed and an explicit default can be avoided. This is a power preserving adaptation. Tether is out of line with this objective. We believe the next shock event – economic recession, war escalation, or another pandemic – will serve as a midwife to stablecoin implementation. People rarely change their financial habits when things are going well. It takes a shock to compel them from an old system into a new one. Stablecoins, for instance, could be the perfect vehicle for sending and receiving government stimulus checks. They could also provide refuge during a banking crisis, where people can hold their cash outside the traditional fractional-reserve banking system. This will also come with countless hazards. Systemic risks of a run on stablecoin reserves and how this spills over into the Treasury market are still unknown. In short, as with all financial assets, and especially the new, untested variety, if stablecoin adoption accelerates, diversification across various stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, is advised. Lastly, stablecoins factor into another one of our themes for 2026… Asset tokenization has been in the works for many years. If you recall, during the covid pandemic mania of 2020-21, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) of art or collectibles became all the rage. The use of blockchain technology to record ownership allowed NFTs to be bought, sold, and traded. This technological application caught the attention of the big financial directors. Not for art and collectibles, but for major financial assets. Larry Fink, the chairman and CEO of BlackRock, said in January 2024: “We believe the next step going forward will be the tokenization of financial assets, and that means every stock, every bond … will be on one general ledger.” Asset tokenization, in short, is the process of turning a real-world building, a stock, a bond, or a gold bar into a digital chip. And stablecoins are the money used to play the game. Before the GENIUS Act, big banks were hesitant to touch tokenization because they didn’t have a legal version of digital cash to use for settlement. The GENIUS Act created Payment Stablecoins (like the compliant version of USDC). Now, a bank like JPMorgan can tokenize a US Treasury bond and feel safe accepting a compliant stablecoin as payment, knowing the coin meets federal reserve and audit standards. What’s more, a tokenized bond using stablecoins can be issued without a single human accountant being involved. Imagine a corporation wants to borrow money. Instead of a traditional bank loan, they issue a Tokenized Bond on the blockchain. First, the corporation sets up a Smart Contract for the bond. The contract could say: “I am borrowing 1,000,000 USDC. I will pay 5 percent interest annually. Payments happen every 30 days.” In the traditional banking world, a bank would have to manually calculate interest for thousands of bondholders and mail checks or process wires. In the tokenized world, at midnight on the payment date, the Smart Contract takes a digital snapshot of every wallet holding the bond tokens. It instantly calculates how much interest each person is owed. The contract then automatically pulls the interest amount from the corporation’s stablecoin reserve and pushes it into the bondholders’ wallets in USDC. As we said at the outset, we don’t like the idea of stablecoins becoming a de facto digital dollar. Its advancement via the GENIUS Act is for the purpose of allowing the federal government to keep running up massive deficits. We consider this to be deceitful. We’d rather ignore it. But we can’t. The legislative framework is in place, and the big banks are moving forward. At this point we have more questions than answers. Namely, by tokenizing assets, which can then be traded, and can act as collateral, won’t the growth of money explode? What will this do to consumer price inflation, and the value of dollars people hold in their traditional bank accounts? There are also issues of privacy. The complete digitization of money and tokenization of assets comes with full system surveillance and tracking. How will a person’s spending be tracked? Will spending be tied to a social credit score with preprogrammed allowances and restrictions? Will the loss of financial privacy destroy what’s left of freedom and liberty for American citizens? What are the systemic risks inherent to building such a complex digital financial world? What happens if there’s a major black sky event where power and communications are disrupted for an extended period of time, whether from a geomagnetic storm, cascading grid failure, or a coordinated cyber-attack? No doubt, we’ll be monitoring and tracking the greater adoption of stablecoins and development of asset tokenization as they take shape throughout the year. We’ll look to adapt accordingly, while also maintaining diversification across both old money and new money systems. Certainly, maintaining wealth that is completely off-grid and outside of the banking system, like physical gold and silver, is of critical importance. Before we close, we’d like to leave you with one practical action you can take to prepare for war, inflation, or the breakdown of an ever-increasing complex digital world. Assuming you have food storage, and some basic backup power such as a simple battery storage system that can charge with portable solar panels, there is the critical, and often overlooked need for micronutrients. After two weeks, no matter how much protein and carbs you have, you need micronutrients for your brain and body, or you start losing mental clarity, strength, and a well-functioning digestive system. The simple solution is sprouting. When the time comes, the ability to be a ‘jar farmer’ to sustain health via sprouts will be essential. To get started, take a look at Sprout People. There you will find a great education section and a large variety of nutrients you probably never imagined could be sprouted. We have no financial or business arrangement or affiliation with Sprout People. We’re merely passing on information we believe you will find valuable.

Title: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP ETFs Are Back: Over $800 Million Signal Investor Return
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-etfs/
Time Published: 2026-01-07T22:00:17Z
Full Content:
The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP ETFs are seeing renewed institutional interest to start the year, providing a bullish outlook for the crypto market. This development comes amid BTC’s rally above $90,000, with the flagship crypto now targeting new 2026 highs. SoSoValue data shows that the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP ETFs saw over $800 million in daily net inflows on January 5. The BTC ETFs took in $697.25 million, led by BlackRock and Fidelity’s fund. This inflow was notably the largest since the October 10 crypto crash, marking a huge positive for the Bitcoin price. Notably, BTC has reached a 2026 high above $94,000 amid these inflows, with sustained demand likely contributing to higher prices. Furthermore, the Ethereum ETFs recorded daily net inflows of $168.13 million, building on the $174.43 million inflows on January 2. The net inflows recorded on January 2 were the largest since December 9. These inflows of the ETH ETFs come as ETH staking demand rises, with the staking entry queue now over 200x larger than the staking exit queue. This is significant as the institutional and staking demand could both contribute to a supply shock for the ETH price. Meanwhile, just like the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the XRP ETFs also recorded significant inflows on January 5. These funds took in $46.10 million on the day, marking their highest flows in the last month. It is worth noting that these XRP funds have not recorded daily net outflows since they launched in November. This has likely contributed to XRP’s outperformance following Bitcoin’s rally above $90,000 to start the year. The altcoin currently boasts a year-to-date (YTD) gain of just over 20%, outperforming all crypto assets in the top 10 ranking except Dogecoin. In an X post, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the Bitcoin ETFs are coming into 2026 like a lion. This came as he noted that they had taken in over $1.2 billion in the first two trading days of the year, with every fund seeing considerable flows. Based on this, the Bloomberg analyst noted that they are on pace to take $150 billion in inflows in 2026. “If they can take in $22b when it’s raining, imagine when the sun is shining,” he added. Meanwhile, Balchunas stated that the total 2026 flows for these Bitcoin ETFs will depend on price. Although he noted it wasn’t a formal prediction, the Bloomberg analyst mentioned that they could take in between $20 and $70 billion in inflows if the BTC price underperforms. On the other hand, if BTC rises to around $130,000 and $140,000, Balchunas believes that the ETFs could record up to $70 billion in inflows this year.

Title: Trump to ban large institutional investors from buying up single-family homes

Posted on 01/07/2026 11:43:41 AM PST by ducttape45 Trump to ban large institutional investors from buying up single-family homes Trump said that he would discuss the announcement further at his speech in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is taking immediate steps to ban large institutional investors from purchasing additional single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has pushed homeownership out of reach for many Americans. In a post shared Tuesday afternoon, Trump said buying and owning a home was long considered “the pinnacle of the American Dream,” but claimed that record-high inflation under the Biden administration and congressional Democrats has made that goal increasingly unattainable, particularly for younger Americans. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,” Trump wrote. “But now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people.” Trump said he would move to prohibit large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes and urged Congress to codify the policy into law. “People live in homes, not corporations,” he wrote. Trump also noted that he would discuss the announcement at his speech in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. Large institutional investors now control a meaningful share of America’s single-family housing stock, a trend that has accelerated over the past decade. Research compiled from Zillow, Redfin, CoreLogic, and the American Enterprise Institute shows that institutional investors own roughly 3–4 percent of all US single-family homes, translating to more than 500,000 houses nationwide. While that may appear modest at the national level, the concentration is far higher in certain metro areas, particularly in fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Charlotte. Investor activity surged following the 2008 financial crisis and spiked again during the pandemic-era housing boom. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and Redfin data, investors accounted for 25–30 percent of home purchases in some markets during peak periods in 2021 and 2022. A significant portion of those purchases came from large corporate buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, many of which targeted lower-priced and entry-level homes suitable for conversion into single-family rentals. Housing analysts note that institutional ownership is disproportionately focused on the rental market, where growth has been strongest. CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is taking immediate steps to ban large institutional investors from purchasing additional single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has pushed homeownership out of reach for many Americans. In a post shared Tuesday afternoon, Trump said buying and owning a home was long considered “the pinnacle of the American Dream,” but claimed that record-high inflation under the Biden administration and congressional Democrats has made that goal increasingly unattainable, particularly for younger Americans. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,” Trump wrote. “But now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people.” Trump said he would move to prohibit large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes and urged Congress to codify the policy into law. “People live in homes, not corporations,” he wrote. Trump also noted that he would discuss the announcement at his speech in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. Large institutional investors now control a meaningful share of America’s single-family housing stock, a trend that has accelerated over the past decade. Research compiled from Zillow, Redfin, CoreLogic, and the American Enterprise Institute shows that institutional investors own roughly 3–4 percent of all US single-family homes, translating to more than 500,000 houses nationwide. While that may appear modest at the national level, the concentration is far higher in certain metro areas, particularly in fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Charlotte. Investor activity surged following the 2008 financial crisis and spiked again during the pandemic-era housing boom. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and Redfin data, investors accounted for 25–30 percent of home purchases in some markets during peak periods in 2021 and 2022. A significant portion of those purchases came from large corporate buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, many of which targeted lower-priced and entry-level homes suitable for conversion into single-family rentals. Housing analysts note that institutional ownership is disproportionately focused on the rental market, where growth has been strongest. CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

Trump also noted that he would discuss the announcement at his speech in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. Large institutional investors now control a meaningful share of America’s single-family housing stock, a trend that has accelerated over the past decade. Research compiled from Zillow, Redfin, CoreLogic, and the American Enterprise Institute shows that institutional investors own roughly 3–4 percent of all US single-family homes, translating to more than 500,000 houses nationwide. While that may appear modest at the national level, the concentration is far higher in certain metro areas, particularly in fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Charlotte. Investor activity surged following the 2008 financial crisis and spiked again during the pandemic-era housing boom. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and Redfin data, investors accounted for 25–30 percent of home purchases in some markets during peak periods in 2021 and 2022. A significant portion of those purchases came from large corporate buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, many of which targeted lower-priced and entry-level homes suitable for conversion into single-family rentals. Housing analysts note that institutional ownership is disproportionately focused on the rental market, where growth has been strongest. CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

While that may appear modest at the national level, the concentration is far higher in certain metro areas, particularly in fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Charlotte. Investor activity surged following the 2008 financial crisis and spiked again during the pandemic-era housing boom. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and Redfin data, investors accounted for 25–30 percent of home purchases in some markets during peak periods in 2021 and 2022. A significant portion of those purchases came from large corporate buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, many of which targeted lower-priced and entry-level homes suitable for conversion into single-family rentals. Housing analysts note that institutional ownership is disproportionately focused on the rental market, where growth has been strongest. CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

It’s a popular move that puts TDS uniparty memebers on the wrong side of another 80/20 issue ahead of the midterms. 😆 MonCommie of NYC is moving in the opposite direction and wants government and blackrock to buy up all the housing. and they’ll end up in the hands of muslims The Chinese have had their finger in this for a long time, in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and elsewhere. Although a great idea, only Congress can enact that law, not the President. So I am to be restricted as to whom I can sell my house; I am not to be allowed to seek the best offer I can get??? As much as I do think corporate buyers have “bid up” home values in some areas, by their buying coming in where private individual buyers might have been unwilling to pay the asking price, and that activity has, in some areas, “saved” some price inflation that had been going on (the corporate buyer has the resources to pay a higher price and hang on to the property until the natural market of private buyers is willing to pay that much; in part by just renting the property until then). However, I am still not in love with the law intervening on what we can and cannot do when choosing to whom we can sell our own property. I believe this is good. To get a good idea of the cost of housing I look at the median wage of the community and that will offer some idea of the housing prices. The large investors are able to bid the prices for SFR beyond that threshold resulting in a potential buyer being able to only rent for long periods. The on the ground issue will aways be that that large investors have much more capital and can bid the price of a property up beyond the ability of the local purchaser. The irony is that much of the capital used to price the homes out of market tolerance comes from retirement funds which some of might have come from the exact community. EXCELLENT! I’ve called for this for a long time. This will be MASSIVELY popular with younger voters as well as blue collar voters - across all ethnic groups. Dang! There goes my 2026 financial plan.../s worst idea ever, and would result in the complete collapse of the real estate market and wipe out the net worth of most in or near retirement that have all their networth tied up in their homes. Write to your congressman? Yeah, that's the ticket.

He says owning a home is part of the American Dream. Big real estate investors have bought many homes, pushing prices up. Trump will share more housing ideas at Davos.

Title: Trump says he’s banning institutional investors from scooping up single-family homes

Full Content:
President Trump said Wednesday he will seek to ban large investors from buying and then renting out single-family homes – in a bold attempt to tackle the US housing crisis. Trump did not say exactly how his plan would work, but it represents a major new initiative to lower the cost of homeownership after roughly a decade of large investors and private-equity firms buying up hundreds of thousands of single-family homes. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “It is for that reason, and much more, that I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations.” Trump said he would discuss the ban – along with other affordability efforts – at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. Shares in Invitation Homes, the largest renter of single-family homes in the country, plunged 6% after Trump’s announcement. Blackstone and Apollo Global Management also fell roughly 6% and 5%, respectively. Invitation Homes and Apollo Global Management did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. After the 2008 financial crisis sent home prices nosediving, major investment firms swooped in to buy up the leftover inventory – often purchasing properties in bulk at foreclosures. Housing advocates have argued that widespread corporate ownership can reduce supply and inflate prices, pushing homeownership even further out of reach. In early 2025, investors of all sizes – including a small sliver of larger firms – accounted for roughly 30% of single-family US home purchases, according to a report from CJ Patrick Co. But in certain cities, investment firms hold much larger chunks of what historically would be starter homes – accounting for more than 20% of all home sales in Houston, Miami, Phoenix and Las Vegas during the pandemic, for example. In 2024, institutional investors owned 25% of rental homes in Atlanta and 18% in Charlotte, according to a US Government Accountability Office analysis. Stephen Schwarzman’s Blackstone is among those hoovering up homes – last year controlling more than 230,000 units as the largest private-equity owner of US apartments, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group. A Blackstone spokesperson told The Post the company has been a net seller of homes for the past decade and its holdings are down by more than one-fifth. “That said, we believe our current portfolio is poised to continue to perform quite well and operate at the highest standards for residents,” the spokesperson added. These Wall Street bigwigs often come equipped with huge all-cash offers, making it difficult for first-time buyers to compete. These pressures – combined with falling construction rates and pandemic-era strains – pushed the national median single-family home price to $426,800 in the third quarter of 2025, according to the most recent data from the National Association of Realtors. It hit a record high of $435,300 over the summer. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily. In another troubling sign for America’s residential real estate market, the median age for a first-time homebuyer hit 40 years olds in 2025, according to the NAR. That’s up from 38 years old in 2024 and 33 in 2020. First-time buyers accounted for just 21% of all US home purchases in 2025 – a new record-low, the NAR said. It’s unclear if Trump’s ban on institutional investor homebuying is possible without congressional approval. “I understand the purpose is to remove corporate competition to keep home prices more affordable, and that is a good intention, but it will be very hard to execute,” Melissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage, told The Post. Trump has sought to blunt Democrats’ election-year criticism of his economic records with a number of other proposals intended to lower costs — including using tariff threats to pressure pharmaceutical companies to lower their prices and vowing to do the same with oil and health insurance firms. He has also pressured the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates at a faster pace and called for streamlining construction rules. Advertisement

Title: JPMorgan’s 5% Bond ETF Looks Like A Coiled Spring Right Now

Investing EMB delivered 13% returns in 2025 but is flat in early 2026 despite offering a 5.5% yield. Fed rate cuts make EMB’s yield more attractive relative to falling Treasury yields. Venezuelan bonds doubled since August after Maduro’s removal. This shows political risk premiums can compress quickly. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. If you’re hunting for yield in 2026, emerging market bonds just became more interesting. The iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:EMB) offers a 5.5% dividend yield as the asset class experiences a fundamental shift. The fund delivered 13% returns in 2025 but has gone quiet in early 2026, up just 0.07% year-to-date. That pause might not last. The catalyst? Venezuela’s defaulted bonds surged to 43 cents on the dollar after President Nicolás Maduro’s surprise removal in early January, more than doubling since August. While EMB holds 658 emerging market bonds across dozens of countries, the Venezuela situation illustrates a broader truth: political risk that seemed permanent can evaporate overnight, unlocking value income investors had written off. The biggest factor for EMB in 2026 is the Federal Reserve’s rate trajectory. Emerging market bonds historically rally when the Fed pivots dovish, and expectations are building for additional rate cuts this year. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)’s outlook suggests the central bank will bring rates down from the current 3.50% to 3.75% range, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a 50 basis point reduction to 3% to 3.25%. Here’s why that matters: when U.S. Treasury yields fall, EMB’s 5.5% yield becomes dramatically more attractive. Investors seeking income start looking beyond domestic bonds, and emerging market debt becomes competitive again. The fund’s 13% gain in 2025 coincided with the Fed’s initial rate cuts. If the easing cycle continues in 2026, EMB could see renewed inflows from institutions rotating out of lower-yielding developed market bonds. Watch the Federal Reserve’s FOMC statements and quarterly Summary of Economic Projections for rate guidance. These releases happen roughly every six weeks and directly influence emerging market bond pricing within hours. EMB holds USD-denominated sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds from emerging markets, eliminating direct currency risk for U.S. investors. With $15.7 billion in assets and a 0.39% expense ratio, it’s a liquid, low-turnover fund operating since 2007. The micro factor to watch is the fund’s country allocation and credit quality mix. Bond ETF compositions shift as countries issue new debt, ratings change, and geopolitical situations evolve. BlackRock publishes updated holdings files monthly on the fund’s webpage, revealing which countries are gaining or losing weight in the portfolio. If you see increased allocations to countries with improving credit ratings or reduced exposure to deteriorating situations, that’s a positive signal. Conversely, concentration in higher-risk issuers could indicate the fund is reaching for yield in a way that increases volatility. The Vanguard Emerging Markets Government Bond ETF (NASDAQ:VWOB) offers similar exposure with a lower 0.25% expense ratio and slightly higher 5.7% yield. With $5.8 billion in assets, it’s smaller than EMB but still highly liquid. VWOB pays monthly distributions, and Vanguard’s lower fee structure means more bond income flows to shareholders over time. For long-term holders focused purely on income efficiency, VWOB deserves consideration. EMB delivered strong 2025 returns but has stalled in early 2026, creating potential entry opportunity for investors seeking 5.5% yield with upside if Fed rate cuts resume and emerging market fundamentals continue improving. The Venezuela situation proves political risk premiums can compress quickly, and with the Fed likely to ease further this year, the macro environment favors emerging market bonds more than it has in years.

Title: Morgan Stanley Files for Spot Ethereum ETFs as TradFi Deepens Crypto Exposure

Written & Edited byCamila Grigera Naón Morgan Stanley filed for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday, becoming the latest American bank to do so. The move is designed to track ETH’s price while passing staking rewards through to shareholders. The news comes just days after Bank of America also expanded client access to crypto amid rising institutional demand. In addition to Ethereum, Morgan Stanley also submitted ETF applications linked to Bitcoin and Solana on Tuesday. A relatively late entrant to the crypto space, the bank’s move represents its first involvement in this segment of the ETF market. The announcement arrived about two years after crypto-focused ETFs in the US started to proliferate. Morgan Stanley’s S-1 filing marks a significant step in integrating cryptocurrency within traditional finance. Managing $1.6 trillion in assets, the bank is broadening client exposure to crypto via regulated investment products. Back in October, Morgan Stanley dropped restrictions on financial advisors recommending crypto ETFs…Now launching their own.Makes sense given Morgan’s massive distribution. Clearly they were seeing meaningful demand from clients for crypto ETFs. https://t.co/9vIroWf8y9 The submission reflects a broader shift among established Wall Street institutions toward greater involvement in digital assets. On Monday, BeInCrypto reported that Bank of America began authorizing wealth management advisors to recommend a portfolio allocation of 1% to 4% in cryptocurrency. Before that, firms including BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup also launched trading operations and tokenization services. While banks appear increasingly driven by a fear of missing out on crypto-related opportunities, the broader market has been underperforming, particularly in recent months. While Morgan Stanley’s endorsement supports broader mainstream acceptance, it arrives during a period of heightened volatility. Most spot Bitcoin ETF assets remain concentrated among retail investors, many of whom have faced recent losses. This environment has accelerated a shift toward professional holders, with institutional ownership rising from 20% to 28%, reflecting a gradual rebalancing of market participation. At the same time, the broader crypto market has shed roughly $600 billion in Bitcoin market capitalization since October. Small-cap indices have fallen to levels last seen in November 2020, while newly launched altcoin ETFs have quickly slipped into negative territory. Further uncertainty looms as US President Donald Trump is expected to announce his nominee for Federal Reserve Chair as soon as Friday. Kevin Hassett has emerged as a leading contender to replace Jerome Powell. If he is appointed, markets will anticipate a more dovish monetary stance.

Title: Terrified Investors Are Bracing for an AI Bubble “Reckoning”

By Victor Tangermann Published Jan 7, 2026 1:08 PM EST Fears over a growing AI bubble that could wipe out the entire economy if it were to burst continue to mount. For many months now, investors and even tech leaders have openly been discussing the possibility — but if or when such a collapse could take place remains a subject of heated debate. Nonetheless, investors are already preparing for that type of major tech sell-off, the Financial Times reports. The reporting shows that plenty of fear and uncertainty remain over the untold billions of dollars being poured into wildly unprofitable AI ventures — a dynamic that’s seen AI companies’ valuations skyrocket to record heights, despite dubious prospects of ever turning a profit. Some are pulling back on their investments in major tech stocks, while others are outright betting on eventual drops in share prices. “Whether there are excesses… in the equity market on AI is no longer questionable, but to figure out which exact companies will be the losers and when this reckoning will happen is difficult,” fund management firm Amundi chief investment officer Vincent Mortier told the FT. One investment fund, Blue Whale Growth, sold its Microsoft and Meta stock in the second quarter of last year, with chief investment officer Stephen Yiu telling the newspaper that “we are concerned about the return on investment in some cases, while some of the valuations are insane — especially in private markets.” GQG Partners chair Rajiv Jain added that “AI’s massive cash burn remains elevated with very little profitability in sight.” His fund sold all of its Magnificent Seven — investor shorthand for Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia — holdings. “Though we had less exposure to a few Mag 7 names throughout 2025, we exited our remaining positions by early November because the risks of an AI bubble blow-up are growing, in our view,” he said. At the same time, many remain unafraid of an imminent collapse. “We don’t believe that we are in a bubble,” BlackRock international chief investment officer Helen Jewell told the FT, “but investors should prepare for a bumpy ride in 2026.” Despite plenty of concerns among investors, banks remain optimistic about future growth. Wall Street has predicted double-digit gains this year. The S&P 500 has surged a whopping 92 percent since October 2022, posting double-digit returns for three years in a row now. “2026 should be another strong year for AI stocks, with capex likely to surpass expectations,” JPMorgan’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a memo. Others are far more muted about the outlook. Three years on from OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT, some are starting to wonder how long the enormous hype surrounding AI can continue to be sustained. In a 2025 retrospective posted on Monday, Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio warned that the tech market is “now in the early stages of a bubble.” But a crash, some argue, may still be some ways away thanks to plenty of remaining excitement. “A bubble likely crashes on a bear market,” Cetera Financial Group chief investment officer Gene Goldman told Bloomberg. “We just don’t see a bear market anytime soon.” More on the AI bubble: AI Investors Furious at Suggestion That There’s an AI Bubble I’m a senior editor at Futurism, where I edit and write about NASA and the private space sector, as well as topics ranging from SETI and artificial intelligence to tech and medical policy.

Title: Jamie Dimon’s bombshell on proxy advisory delivers a body blow to the firms he called ‘incompetent’
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-asset-management-proxy-advisory-iss-glass-lewis-what-it-means/
Time Published: 2026-01-07T17:30:01Z
Full Content:
In a break that shapes the architecture of shareholder power, JPMorgan Asset Management, which manages more than $7 trillion in client assets — severed all ties this week with proxy advisory giants ISS and Glass Lewis. It will now rely solely on an internal, AI-driven voting platform called Proxy IQ — the first such move by a major asset manager. It comes days after President Trump issued an executive order directing federal agencies to investigate proxy advisers, citing concerns that their influence on board votes, CEO pay, and ESG policies is driven more by political agendas than fiduciary duty. Together, Trump and JPMorgan waged a two-front assault on the proxy advisory industry — one political, one financial. Trump’s order adds regulatory firepower. Dimon’s decision delivers a market blow. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, relentless critic of proxy advisers, called these firms “incompetent” and their dominance “done with.” The bank’s full exit marks a direct challenge to a system many view as opaque and obsolete. Yet in dismantling the old gatekeepers, JPMorgan may be quietly installing itself as a new one. By replacing outside advisers with its own AI platform, it now controls the very machinery of shareholder voting it once condemned. What began as a crusade against centralized influence may be remembered as a corporate land grab. These developments underscore the rise of a more decentralized and digitally engaged electorate — part of a broader shift toward democratization of investing, as individuals gain real-time access to ballots and influence decisions once shaped by a handful of power brokers. This spring’s proxy season may not hinge on an activist’s letter, banker spreadsheets or hedge fund media blitzes … but instead on the quick, quiet clicks of individual investors — each with a few hundred shares — voting between Zoom calls and scrolling through message board threads. In March 2025, ExxonMobil moved to elevate individual investors — still shaped by its 2021 clash with Engine No. 1 — even without adopting default proxy instructions. In September, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a program that lets individual stakeholders automatically follow board recommendations, aiming to counter chronically low voting turnout and disproportionate influence of institutional and activist investors. And Exxon isn’t alone. Small investors blocked a share conversion at AMC in August 2023, triggering a lawsuit and court-approved settlement. The conversion and split took effect, revealing the persistence of a shareholder base once hailed as the company’s savior. At Disney in April 2024, Nelson Peltz’s proxy fight culminated in a vote that drew support from fans-turned-shareholders mobilizing around board accountability and creative direction. While Peltz lost, Disney revamped investor engagement. Main Street investors rallied behind Elon Musk’s billion-dollar pay package at Tesla in June 2024 and again in October 2025, circulating voting instructions and videos across social media. This outreach momentum carried into the subsequent vote. One important new mechanism drawing attention is pass-through proxy voting — allowing mutual fund and ETF investors to vote their shares directly instead of delegating authority to fund managers. It gives individuals direct control over votes attached to their assets. But it still only matters if they vote. Many independent shareholders skip proxy voting, as notices go unread. Engagement usually emerges in a contested election, as investors hold their ballots to see how the fight unfolds. As of March 2024, BlackRock expanded its Voting Choice program to U.S. individual investors in select funds, enabling direct proxy voting. This marked the first major rollout of pass-through voting within fund structures. Still, only 8% of BlackRock funds offer it, but it is increasing pressure across the industry as analysis grows around individual investor inclusion. But Waiting for Godot is a mistake. Regulation can tweak the system, but real change begins when investors are brought in early, understand the stakes, trust the process and choose to engage. Funds should … Implement full pass-through voting across all funds in 2026. BlackRock’s Larry Fink, Vanguard’s Salim Ramji, Fidelity’s Abigail Johnson, State Street’s Yie-Hsin Hung and J.P. Morgan’s Jamie Dimon can set standards now. Every individual investor’s capital carries its own vote. Boards in parallel should … Influence doesn’t begin with a proxy. It starts with a viral post that reframes a proposal in plain English, sharp YouTube explainer or social threads that turn legalese into a clear takeaway. This is where shareholder sentiment is formed and fortified. As proxy season approaches, the same question looms: Do we have the votes? This year, outcomes may hinge on stakeholders who rarely join investor calls. “Trust is like the air we breathe — when it’s present, nobody really notices. But when it’s absent, everybody notices.” — Warren Buffett The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.
