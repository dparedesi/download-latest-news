It may start as a casual aside, a wee-hours social media post or a much hyped announcement WASHINGTON -- It may start as a casual aside, a wee-hours social post or a much-hyped announcement. Whatever the delivery mechanism, President Donald Trump loves to toss out startling ideas aimed at dropping jaws, commandeering headlines and bolstering his political brand. Never in modern times has a president offered so many off-the-cuff statements with such a potential for wide, even global, impact. His sometimes implausible notions may become reality, or — through repetition — no longer sound so outlandish. At other times, Trump just moves on, either by fashioning a rhetorical off-ramp or finding a way to declare victory. Some ideas, though, just seem to fade away. Here's a look at some of Trump's showstopping utterances this term and where they stand. WHERE IT STANDS: Moving ahead. BACKSTORY: Trump has embraced the idea of getting a $400 million luxury plane as a gift from oil-rich Qatar for the U.S. to use as Air Force One until Boeing delivers long-delayed new planes to the government. The Pentagon said Wednesday it has accepted the jet for use as Air Force One, but retrofitting the plane to meet security requirements will be costly and take time. And ethics experts, Democrats, and even some conservatives have warned that accepting such a luxurious gift from a foreign government is unseemly and could violate constitutional provisions meant to avoid bribery. WHERE IT STANDS: In limbo. BACKSTORY: Trump posted on his social media site in early May that he wanted to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious former prison that has been closed for more than six decades — and he subsequently talked about it at the White House. The president hasn't said much on the subject since, nor addressed how lengthy, difficult and costly such a reclamation project would be. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, said he's ordered an “assessment to determine our needs and the next steps,” even as California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, dismissed the idea as a “distraction.” Some administration officials have endorsed bringing back the lockup known as “The Rock,” which operated from 1934 to 1963. Border czar Tom Homan suggested it could be used to house migrants awaiting deportation. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump first floated this idea of the “Great State of Canada” with a December post just after midnight. When new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently visited Trump at the White House, he made a point of saying that Canada “won’t be for sale, ever.” Trump responded, “never say never.” Carney said later that he told the president privately to quit talking about making Canada a state. He didn't divulge Trump's reaction, though, noting only that it was necessary to distinguish between “a wish and a reality.” Trump nonetheless insisted during the meeting that Canada joining the United States would be a “wonderful marriage.” WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump continues to insist that the U.S. could “get” Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark, despite Copenhagen saying that's impossible. Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland in March for a quick stop at the U.S. military base there after island residents rejected a broader visit. During that trip, Vance scolded Denmark but acknowledged that Greenland would control its own sovereignty — while still suggesting that it may want to make a deal with the United States. WHERE IT STANDS: Political off-ramp found. BACKSTORY: Trump for months decried growing Chinese influence over the Panama Canal and even refused to rule out a U.S. invasion to retake control of the waterway. The situation appeared to simmer down when the White House hailed a nearly $23 billion deal announced in March that would sell two canal ports run by a company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong to investors led by the U.S. firm BlackRock. The deal has since hit regulatory snags, and has yet to be finalized. In the meantime, the U.S. signed an agreement giving its troops access to Panamanian facilities. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. Days later, the president said at a conservative conference outside Washington, “I'm going to go with Elon.” He then drew sustained applause by asking, “Would anybody like to join us?” Nothing has come of it since. WHERE IT STANDS: Losing steam. BACKSTORY: Trump has repeatedly floated the idea that the U.S. would “take over” war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians who live there. He even suggested that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” once the war between Israel and Hamas has concluded. The president at one point posted a fake video of himself and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sunbathing in Gaza and featuring a glitzy resort dubbed “TRUMP GAZA.” During his trip to the Mideast last week, Trump offered a different iteration of the idea, saying the U.S. could “get involved” in Gaza “and make it just a freedom zone.” The issue remains a nonstarter with Arab nations. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump continues to suggest that an autopen was used to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents during the tenure of former President Joe Biden. It's an accusation designed to question his Democratic predecessor's mental capacity and presidential authority. Trump's repeated complaints about Biden's autopen continue to get attention among some far-right media outlets and have prompted a Republican proposal in Congress to ban using autopens on presidential pardons. Trump has even suggested an investigation could be coming related to Biden signing immigration actions via autopen. “We’re going to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation,” he said this week. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump used his social media site in March to share a British media outlet's suggestion that Britain's King Charles III was making a “secret offer” to allow the United States to become an associate member of the British Commonwealth. “I love King Charles,” Trump wrote. “Sounds good to me!” Trump might have been joking, but his post sparked pushback online from supporters who roundly rejected the idea. He has not gone back to it. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: In February, Trump labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections” in the midst of Russia's ongoing invasion of that country. Before Zelenskyy subsequently visited the White House, Trump backed off, saying, “Did I say that?” Trump still finds plenty to complain about with the Ukrainian leader, though, saying last week that U.S. aid to the country has been “pissed away.” WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: In February, Trump said his administration would begin offering $5 million “ gold cards ” that give “very high-level people” a “route to citizenship.” The cards would grant foreigners visas to live and work in the United States. In early April, he held up a gold card featuring his name and picture and said they would be available in “less than two weeks, probably.” The card still hasn't gone on sale, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently told the All-In podcast that he'd already personally sold 1,000 of them. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking — off and on. BACKSTORY: The Constitution's 22nd Amendment states no one can be elected president “more than twice.” That hasn't stopped Trump from talking about it — or the Trump Organization from selling “Trump 2028” gear, despite the president himself offering mixed signals. Asked about running for a third term during a recent NBC News interview, Trump replied, “I’m not looking at that.” But he added: “So many people want me to do it. I have never had requests so strong as that. But it’s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you’re not allowed to do. I don’t know if that’s constitutional.” That followed his saying in an interview with NBC News in March: “I’m not joking. There are methods which you could do it.” And he suggested to Time Magazine, “There are some loopholes.” ___ Will Weissert covers the White House for The Associated Press. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: ‘I burst out crying on referendum results day. I realised how exhausted and scared I had been’

Ten years ago this week, Ireland became the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage through a popular vote. More than 6,000 same-sex couples have been married in the decade since. Here, 10 of them share their wedding stories, reflecting on how the referendum changed their lives, and Ireland, and their concerns over a regression in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights. Independent politician and former government minister Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan first met in 1981 in Boston College in Massachusetts, where they were both theology doctoral students. “The programme only took two people that year,” says Katherine, recalling the fated first encounter with her late wife. “We were a little nervous that it was just ourselves initially, but that dissipated pretty quickly.” The pair instantly hit it off and became a couple, and in October 1982 they held an intimate life-partnership ceremony to celebrate their love and commitment to each other. Katherine “never ever anticipated living or working or being in a partnership with anybody other than an American in America”, but she gladly followed Ann Louise back to Ireland, where they built a life together – Ann Louise as a theologian and Katherine as a lecturer, chief executive of the National Women’s Council, and later an independent politician. [ From the archive: Ireland becomes first country to approve same-sex marriage by popular voteOpens in new window ] Speaking of the anxiety they experienced living and working in Ireland during the 1980s and 1990s – homosexuality was only decriminalised in 1993 – Katherine says: “There was always that fear that if we became public Ann Louise would lose her job.” Ann Louise taught at St Patrick’s College in Drumcondra, “a college managed by the Archbishop of Dublin, and she did suffer at different times because of that”. In 2003, Katherine and Ann Louise’s relationship was legally recognised when they married at “a beautiful small gathering” in Vancouver in Canada. The couple then “prepared to take on the State, the Irish government”, so their Canadian marriage could be recognised here as well. Their legal battle was a significant catalyst for the Irish campaign for marriage equality. “When we got the judgment in 2006 that we couldn’t get our Canadian marriage recognised because it was against the Constitution, it sparked an even greater momentum,” Katherine says. “This was holy Ireland. During this period too, some of the authority of the church was being challenged because of all the forms of institutional abuse, especially against children. So people were starting to step back and think, ‘we need to be critical Catholics and make some decisions on our own’.” Katherine believes the Yes campaign’s success was thanks to the “radical spirit” of the Irish people. “I don’t want to romanticise this, but I think there’s something extraordinary about the culture of the people here. Because of that lengthy oppression and willingness to say no and resist and find creativity and be kind, in spite of it all, and to be radical. I just think this tapped into all that. “It reinvigorated our democracy in a way we had never seen before,” she adds, remembering the striking displays of “solidarity across differences, across political parties, across generations” and “also that image of citizens that know that they have the power” as the Yes result was announced at Dublin Castle on Saturday May 23rd, 2015. Katherine and Ann Louise’s Irish wedding took place in Dublin in January 2016. “She looked remarkably beautiful and was so strong,” says Katherine of Ann Louise, who was recovering from a brain haemorrhage at the time. Ann Louise died in June 2017, following a short illness. The striking red and black dresses they married in were subsequently donated by Katherine to the National Museum of Ireland, and have been displayed at Collins Barracks as symbols of the historic referendum. There are “several outstanding issues that make it difficult to be fully free or equal in Ireland,” says Katherine now, reflecting on progress on LGBTQ+ rights 10 years on from the referendum. “The marriage equality win went a long way to normalise the identities of lesbian and gay people. Obviously we have another journey in relation to trans and non-binary [people] which should flow from the former, but doesn’t necessarily. There are challenges in terms of mental health and wellbeing. The terrible, non-existing state of trans healthcare, especially for young people. The fact that not all ‘rainbow families’ are able to get both parents recognised in law.” Buzz O’Neill met Peter Maxwell online 18 years ago. Buzz recalls his first date with Peter – “a pint in The Norseman, and then dinner across in Pintxo’s across the way in Crown Alley” – in Dublin’s Temple Bar. The couple moved in together four months later and now live with their German shepherd Eric in Amsterdam, where Peter works for Heineken. Buzz is a club promoter, and has been involved with campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights in Ireland from “day one”. “When you say you’re from Ireland and you’re in a gay bar, anywhere in the world, the first thing people say is, ‘That was the first place to vote same-sex marriage in,’” says Buzz, referencing a recent encounter with someone he met while visiting Cape Town in South Africa. “It wasn’t just the stroke of a pen by a progressive government, it was the actual people of Ireland. We had to go out there for months and months and months to get it across the line.” PantiBar on Capel Street was a hub of joy on that May weekend in 2015, and a place Buzz “just didn’t want to leave”. “I wanted to be there, more than Dublin Castle with all the celebs. A load of my friends came in, gay and straight, and I just broke down,” he recalls, welling up at the memory. On a family holiday celebrating his parents’ 50th wedding anniversary that year, Buzz proposed to Peter during a day trip to Florence. I guess we were activists in the soft sense of the word during the marriage equality campaign. We were part of all the networks that popped up. We went around the country knocking on doors A few months later, on December 28th, 2015, they married in the Dublin Unitarian Church. The reception took place in The Grand Hotel in Malahide, where Buzz’s parents had celebrated their own wedding 50 years previously. “Because we were the first same-sex couple to get married in the Unitarian Church, our solemniser was emotional, to say the least,” laughs Buzz. “So emotional, that she forgot half of the actual written service. “You can go in there now and view that registry, which me and Peter have done a few times, and it’s hundreds and hundreds of marriages going back hundreds of years and then you just see two boys’ names.” He is concerned at the “backwards” shift in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights in recent years. “If the campaign was run today, I don’t think we’d win.” Etain Kidney and Michelle Walls met at The George in Dublin 20 years ago. “We famously have been married three times, and every one was as good as the last,” says Etain. “In 2012, Michelle asked me to marry her, and I have such a God complex that I then asked her back.” The couple were joined by close family and friends in the small registry office on Grand Canal Street in Dublin and became civil partners in April 2014. “Then we went to Spain and had a big wedding over there,” Etain says. Around 150 guests were present at their “official wedding day” in the sunny hills of the Costa del Sol. Almost a year after the marriage equality referendum, Etain and Michelle’s story came full circle and they tied the knot once more on home turf, in the same registry office where they had their first ceremony. Etain works in education and Michelle in car rental, and they live together in Dublin city centre with their sons Tadhg (8) and Bobby (5). Remembering the mix of emotions on results day, Etain describes how she “just burst out crying” at the count centre “and then realised how exhausted and scared I had been”. “I guess we were activists in the soft sense of the word during the marriage equality campaign,” she says. “We were part of all the networks that popped up. We went around the country knocking on doors.” Ten years on, the euphoria of the campaign’s success is “a real juxtaposition” with reality. “It’s quite poignant now to reflect on marriage equality 10 years later, when we got such resounding support from the country, to be a little bit scared to walk down the street again,” says Etain. “In the same way we were brave and bold back then, we need to all be brave and bold again. We need to use this anniversary of marriage equality to remind people that it’s a fight, that we still need to protest, and that freedom doesn’t happen by accident.” Linda Cullen and Feargha Ní Bhroin live in Blackrock in Dublin with their 15-year-old twin daughters Tess and Rosa Cullen-Byrne. The couple have been together for 20 years. “We discussed having kids very early on,” says Linda, a TV producer and chief executive of production company Coco Content. She directed The 34th, a documentary telling the story of marriage equality in Ireland. Feargha is a social justice researcher. The couple became civil partners in 2012, and joined the board of Marriage Equality years in advance of the referendum campaign. I have always loved Ireland. And yet, I did wonder, gosh if it’s a no, can we actually stay? “One of the main drivers was to seek protections for our children. And we knew marriage would have to come first. It shouldn’t have to, but we knew it would, and it did,” reflects Feargha, highlighting that “there are families without those protections still”. Linda recalls a poster from the No campaign erected outside their daughters’ bedroom “saying every child deserves a mother and a father” in the months leading up to the referendum. “They were at that age where they could absorb stuff very easily … When you opened the curtains every morning, that was facing them.” The campaign was “hugely emotional”, Linda recalls. “I have always loved Ireland. I’m a real nester. I’m in the house I was born in, I’m a complete home bird. And yet, I did wonder, gosh if it’s a no, can we actually stay?” For Feargha, the conversations that happened between friends in the days and weeks following the result were particularly meaningful. “We were all talking about our stories of coming out and issues we‘d had at work – friends who’d lost their jobs because they were lesbian – and we were talking in a way that we hadn’t before about the things that had happened to us or we‘d encountered. You couldn’t look at them before because you just had to keep going.” After a busy night celebrating the Yes result in May 2015, Linda was talked into proposing to Feargha on BBC’s 5 Live Breakfast Radio show. The couple married at a small wedding ceremony on August 20th, 2019. “On a personal level, I’m finally beginning to get comfortable with referring to Linda publicly as my wife. I found it so hard saying that for the longest time,” Feargha says. “So many times, when our names were put together, they assumed Feargha was a typo and would put ‘l’ at the end. So it would be Fergal and Linda. It is funny how people do all sorts of mental gymnastics to be able to accommodate the idea of two women with children being married.” Pointing to rollbacks in LGBTQ+ rights in Italy, Hungary and the US, they share concerns for the legal and personal safety of queer couples around the world. Ireland’s vote for marriage equality has been “life changing” for them, Linda says. “Before we met, we didn’t know we could have a life like this.” Joey Kavanagh moved from Co Meath to London the year before the referendum, from where he led the emigrant voting campaign Get the Boat 2 Vote – “a spur-of-the-moment thing that then became a very big part of my life” – which saw tens of thousands of young Irish citizens travelling home from abroad to vote for marriage equality. “It was only in the 48 hours coming up to the referendum that it really became clear that it was a big deal. There were people coming from Australia and Canada and all parts of the world to cast their vote. It was a really cool thing to be part of.” He remembers “feeling ecstatic” celebrating the result at Dublin Castle. “It felt like a watershed moment, a breakthrough after decades of hard-won fights by people who had been campaigning for this and turning out for protests and rallies and marches … It forced a lot of really difficult but useful conversations, and from that emotion and sharing of stories came some catharsis.” [ Marriage equality a decade on: ‘Things have gone backwards’Opens in new window ] Just a few weeks later, he was in the queue for a nightclub in Soho when he met Australian Liam Karma, who was coming to the end of a two-year visa and getting ready to return home to Melbourne. After a few months together, the relationship became a long distance one until shortly before their Irish wedding day three years later. On June 29th, 2018 – “the hottest day of the year” – they tied the knot and held a prom-themed wedding party at the Commercial Rowing Club in Islandbridge in Dublin 8. “It wasn’t a traditional wedding,” says Liam, whose mother joined them from Australia for the celebrations. “Dublin Pride was on the 30th so that was essentially day two of our wedding,” adds Joey. “A friend was working on PR for Dublin Bus and she got me and Liam and 15 of our friends on one of the buses. So we got to be in the Pride parade.” While “it does feel like queerness has been normalised in Ireland and it feels different to when I was growing up”, Joey says, “we‘re not in as hopeful a place at the moment, like the pendulum has swung and we‘re seeing very regressive moves, particularly around trans rights.” The couple now live with their two cats, Mog and Dagen, in Dublin 7. “We have no plans to adopt human children but these are our babies.” Joey works for the Arts Council and Liam is a store manager; he was granted Irish citizenship in December. On their first date in 2016, after hitting it off during a night out in Belfast’s Union Street Bar, James McConville told Paul Corcoran “that we were going to get married”. Three years later they celebrated their wedding at Ballyvolane House in Fermoy, Co Cork, not far from where they now live. On August 17th, 2019, James, an entrepreneur from Belfast, and Paul, a Cork native who works in tech support, held their marriage ceremony in a barn. Paul is a solemniser with Pagan Federation Ireland. “For me, the word pagan is equivalent to being spiritually queer. It is having a sense of your own agency and autonomy, still working within a community, but you kind of get to make the rules up as you go along,” he says. When it was his turn to be on the other side of the altar, he wanted to incorporate some pagan traditions. “We had all the chairs arranged in two concentric circles, with a central altar. A circle was cast around the space and we consecrated the circle with water and fire. We both come from Catholic families so that sort of ceremony with smells and bells is something they’re all very comfortable with.” The couple want to start a family, but “it’s not as easy for us, as gay men,” says James. “We looked at the adoption route and we were told by someone in Tusla that it was near impossible, because of the legislation in place at the minute. To be told that because of who we are we wouldn’t be able to adopt, it did feel like we were second-class citizens.” Paul recounts the intensity of the period leading up to the referendum in 2015. “I remember the last two weeks, I was working in a cafe in Galway and we were surrounded by the No campaign posters. I walked to work with my head down.” Afterwards, he describes feeling huge relief; “There was a huge shift in my head because everyone that I looked at, I thought, you probably voted Yes.” Ten years later, emotions are still high. “I was in a shop the other day and that Snow Patrol song Just Say Yes came on, and I started crying.” Val Tataru and Max Plamadeala met at their local nightclub in Moldova 16 years ago and their relationship quickly blossomed. The couple moved to Dublin together six years ago. Having grown up in Moldova and worked for some time in Russia, both countries where same-sex marriage is illegal, Ireland’s new law was the deciding factor in their move. “What attracted us here was the referendum, to be honest … we were in need of that security,” says Val, who was encouraged by the 62 per cent Yes vote. “This says something about the country and the friendliness of the people here.” I was somehow shocked how normal it felt to be able to go to the registry office and do it officially When Val and Max moved to Ireland, they house-shared with another gay couple who encouraged them to attend Dublin Pride. Although apprehensive, they agreed to go to the parade. It was “a completely different experience” for Val, who was more accustomed to “something like a very small manifestation in a nightclub, which was not advertised” in Moldova. “I saw another side to the world where you don’t have to hide ... That was probably the moment when I felt liberated from my fears. And from then on, we were never afraid to hold hands in public.” On May 24th, 2019, the couple were married in front of friends and family in Dublin. “It was a nice ceremony, full of tears ... I was somehow shocked how normal it felt to be able to go to the registry office and do it officially.” For Val, marriage means safety and peace of mind. “You feel like you are protected. I know my husband will be able to visit me in hospital and have the possibility to make decisions for me, should I be unable to.” It also opens the door for other “steps that you usually take in your life, such as buying a house”, because they can do so as a couple here. “It empowered us to feel included in society. We have the same rights as everyone else.” Actors Shane O’Reilly and Paul Curley met while acting in a show together with Kilkenny Barnstorm Theatre Company in 2009. Shane is also a playwright and Paul is a children’s theatre maker. “I was playing a giant and Paul was playing Jack in a version of Jack and the Beanstalk, so Jack and the giant got together in this story,” says Shane. “Under the stars beside this astonishing lake, he asked me to marry him,” he adds, recalling Paul’s romantic proposal in New Zealand 16 years later. The pair opted to get married in City Hall, Dublin, on January 29th this year. As well as its association with the referendum celebrations, the location was meaningful for Shane’s father “who worked for Dublin City Council his whole life as a carpenter”. “He did his initial exams and his introduction to Dublin through that room in City Hall.” Shane’s parents are both deaf so there were a lot of sign language and visual elements integrated into the day. “Then we headed over to Fallon and Byrne and ate and drank and danced the night away.” [ ‘It’s better than a dig in the face’: LGBT employees on how the workplace became more accepting ] The day the Yes result was announced is one that remains “seared into your consciousness”, says Shane, who vividly remembers “driving out of the city with this enormous sense of celebration behind us as we headed towards Galway,” where they were going to see a friend’s show. At Paul’s family home in east Galway, there is a series of wedding photographs tracing lineage from his great grandparents to his parents. “It’s always been something I’ve looked at when having dinner there and thought, God, what a beautiful legacy of people who have gotten married. They are like totems of this family,” says Shane, who feels secure in the fact that he and Paul now share the same status. For Paul, his wedding ring is “more than a symbol, it’s a real recognition of our commitment and life together”, which he is reminded of every time he puts the ring back on after performing on stage. Ireland AM presenter Alan Hughes and theatre producer Karl Broderick met on the street in Dublin on September 20th, 1993. “We got on the same bus,” Karl remembers. “The number 28. Alan asked for my number and got off in Fairview, and I got off in Artane, and the next day he phoned and we met that night.” Their first date was in The Yacht in Clontarf, a few weeks after legislation was passed decriminalising homosexuality in Ireland. Karl recalls the discomfort they felt on the date, thinking they could bump into people they knew. “But there was a thriving gay scene in Dublin, even at that stage. There were bars like the South William and the Viking and the George,” Alan recalls. “People were protective and looked out for each other.” Twenty-three years later, Alan and Karl celebrated their civil partnership at the Unitarian Church on St Stephen’s Green in 2011. They threw a “lavish” wedding party in the Mansion House which attracted a lot of media coverage, including a cover story for VIP Magazine. “We felt a huge responsibility to every gay person out there,” Karl says. As a presenter on Irish breakfast TV, Alan has always been open about his sexuality. “From day one I always talked about Karl. I was on breakfast TV 25 years ago in Ireland as an openly gay man.” Following an on-screen proposal after the referendum, the couple were married on September 30th, 2016 at a “low-key” ceremony. Just Alan’s brother Kevin and Karl’s sister Ann – who also took the photographs - were present as witnesses. “The four of us went to the registry office in Bray, got lunch in Powerscourt Hotel and were in the spa by 4pm.” Reflecting on the decade anniversary of the referendum, Karl says “younger people need to know where we come from and never forget that we stand on the shoulders of giants. We’re lucky with the time we’re in. If we think of history as one line made up of pencil dots, we’re in that pencil dot where it became okay. That’s huge. People who went before us couldn’t live the life they were meant to live.” Alan believes there has been a marked shift towards acceptance overall, highlighting interactions with fans of the couple’s annual pantomime. “Thousands of people come to see our panto every year and they know me and they know I’m gay, they know Karl is my husband. That’s a lovely reflection on society, and acceptance.” But more needs to be done, he says: “Ten years on, we need to reset the focus. Things are getting bad again and we need to start spreading the word that love is love.” Sarah McDevitt was 32 when she came out in September 2013. The following St Patrick’s Day, she met Geraldine Stone, and exactly a year later the couple got engaged on Streedagh Beach in Co Sligo, near where Sarah grew up, the day after her mother‘s 60th birthday celebrations. It was March 2015, two months before the referendum. “At that point we were planning to get civil partnered; we weren’t getting married. That wasn’t even a possibility,” Sarah says. When they booked Kilronan Castle in Co Roscommon for their wedding reception that December, the couple “didn’t know Roscommon was going to vote No and that we‘d end up being the first people to get married there after marriage equality”, says Sarah. “The morning of the results, I went wedding dress shopping because I thought that was the best way to deal with the nerves.” Sarah and Geraldine and their four children – Lochlan, Grayson, Willow and Cooper – now live in Killester in north Dublin. Sarah works in advertising and Geraldine in telecommunications. They took it in turns carrying and giving birth to each child. Sharing this experience, Sarah says, has made them “stronger as a couple”. “You can be a lot more empathetic to your partner.” A prominent campaigner for LGBTQ+ parental rights, Sarah says the fight for equality is not over, as the Children and Family Relationships Act, passed in April 2015 to expand parental rights and responsibilities to non-traditional families, still excludes gay men with children. “When we had Lochlan, it wasn’t enacted,” she says, referring to the Children and Family Relationships Bill. “Before we even started IVF, we were writing to Simon Harris [asking] ‘When is it going to happen?’ [ LGBT families in Ireland still caught in legal loopholeOpens in new window ] “When he [Lochlan] was born, I was a single parent because there was no way that Ger could be on the birth certificate ... Ger couldn’t make any decisions for him. It was like she was a total stranger to him, even though she was raising him … that was really painful.” The scope of the legislation widened in May 2020 to include co-parenting legal recognition for certain same-sex female couples, says Sarah, though in her view it remains “very limited”. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The Istanbul kabuki – decoded
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/the-istanbul-kabuki-decoded/
Time Published: 2025-05-23T02:36:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Empire Pepe Escobar, Strategic Culture Foundation The endgame is clear: the US losing the entire Eurasian land mass. Ukraine, under these immense geopolitical imperatives, is only a sovereign-deprived pawn in the (Great) Game. Did President Putin really change the game by proposing the resumption of negotiations on the proxy war in Ukraine in Istanbul – over three years after the first ones were scotched by NATO? It’s complicated. And depends on which “game” we’re talking about. What the Russian move instantly accomplished was to throw into total disarray the European warmongering Three Stooges (Starmer, BlackRock chancellor, Le Petit Roi) Cocaine Express. Irrelevant Europe was not even at the table in Istanbul – except via extensive previous briefing of the low-rent, shabby-dressed Ukrainian delegation. That was compounded by the noisy barking threat in the sidelines advocating “more sanctions” to “pressure Russia”. In March 2022 in Istanbul, Kiev could have stopped the war. Every one of us who were in Istanbul at the time could foresee that Kiev would eventually have to be forced to the table all over again. So in essence we are back to the same negotiation – with the same top Russian negotiator, competent historian Vladimir Medinsky, heading a delegation composed by pros, but with Ukraine now facing over a million dead; deprived of at least four regions – more on the way; what’s left of its mineral wealth de facto controlled by the US; and a horrendous black hole that passes for an “economy”. We are talking about country 404 territory. During the negotiations on Friday, Medinsky went straight to the point: “We don’t want war, but we are ready to fight for a year, two, three – as long as it takes. We fought with Sweden for 21 years [the Great Northern War, 1700-1721, as it is known in Russia]. How long are you ready to fight?” That’s the geopolitical/military state of things for Kiev and their “to the last Ukrainian” warmongering backers: either you capitulate, or we’re going to hurt you even more. What’s the point of these negotiations? Turkiye under uber-opportunist Sultan Erdogan in fact hosted a P.R. meeting between Moscow, Kiev and itself – with the Ukrainians unleashing a blitzkrieg of infantile tantrums only designed to influence global public opinion. In sharp contrast, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, did his best to put a positive spin on the proceedings. Istanbul 2.0, Dmitriev asserted, achieved a large exchange of prisoners (1,000 on each side); ceasefire options to be presented by both sides; and a continuation of dialogue. That’s not much. Well, at least they discussed in the same language: Russian. Nothing was lost in translation. A serious case can be made that to propose the resumption of these negotiations, under this format, was meaningless. There’s no evidence in the horizon both parties might touch the fundamental issue anytime soon: the whole geopolitical strategic equation in Eastern Europe, from the Barents Sea to the Black Sea and beyond – leading to an “indivisibility of security” new deal with global repercussions. That implies that whatever track these negotiations may follow further on down the road, they are an objective impossibility. Meanwhile, the proxy war in Ukraine – and the SMO – will go on. That would also suggest that the Moscow security establishment considers the neo-nazi instrumentalized goons in Kiev at best as a re-enactment of the 6th Army of Paulus, with which you negotiate the end of a battle, but not the end of the war. Even NATO semi-realists as retired Commodore Steven Jermy have been forced to admit that “Russia is in the driving seat” and clueless Europeans “appear to believe that the losers should dictate the terms of ceasefire or surrender.” All the barking by the – European – chihuahuas of war cannot disguise the fundamental geopolitical/military fact: a massive NATO humiliation. Trump’s humongous problem is that he has to manage it – and sell it to domestic public opinion and the global public opinion as some sort of “deal” he struck with Putin. It’s enlightening once again to go back to Grandmaster Lavrov, always the uber-realist, back in September 2024: “In April 2022, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators reached agreement in Istanbul. If that agreement had been observed, Ukraine would have preserved part of Donbass. But every time another agreement, always accepted by Russia, is broken, Ukraine shrinks in size.” The (Great) Game, revisited Now back to the (Great) Game. Kiev negotiators eventually admitting Ukrainian capitulation means a NATO capitulation and an Empire of Chaos capitulation. That’s the ultimate anathema for the US ruling classes. Even an ultra-negotiated, carefully managed Ukrainian surrender will be an impossible sell – not to mention Washington under Narcissus Drowned Trump acknowledging a strategic defeat. Because that will mean the Empire of Chaos losing Eurasia for good: the ultimate Mackinder/Brzezinski nightmare. Coupled with the consequential solidification of the multi-nodal, multipolar world. The Russia-China stategic partnership is very much aware of every nook and cranny in this larger-than-life process. Beyond the current Turkish kabuki, they clearly understand the Big Eurasia Equation. Beijing is fully aware NATO’s real goal was always to confront it via Russia. Ukraine was NATO’s pawn to take down Russia then get to China from the West. The goal of the US ruling elites as they configured their thalassocratic empire remains to blockade China from the West by land and sea, using Russia; then use Taiwan as a staging area to blockade China from the East by sea. No wonder control of Taiwan is a Chinese strategic imperative. Enter Mackinder panic – all over again: the China-Russia strategic partnership can beat NATO hands down – and Russia, by itself, is already doing it. Xi and Putin once again discussed the chessboard in detail, in person, prior to the Victory Day parade last week in Moscow. The endgame, once again, is clear: the US losing the entire Eurasian land mass. Ukraine, under these immense geopolitical imperatives, is only a sovereign-deprived pawn in the (Great) Game. As for the tantrum-addicted clown in Kiev, he is merely an actor with no authority whatsoever, negotiations included. He is completely dominated by Ukrainian neo-Nazis who will kill him if and when the war is over. He merely fronts for them and gets paid off. And that’s why – enthusiastically supported by inconsequential London, Paris and Berlin – he’s obsessed to continue a Forever War destroying the very nation he claims to represent.

May 22, 2025 – San Francisco, United States As part of this collaboration, Libre, a regulated infrastructure provider for tokenized investment products will deploy its on-chain issuance and management framework on the XDC Network. Libre’s integration brings a regulatory-compliant mechanism for the distribution of tokenized financial products to institutional and accredited investors on XDC Network. Having enabled tokenization of a broad range of strategies like regulated hedge funds, money market funds and private credit including those managed by BlackRock, Brevan Howard, Hamilton Lane and Laser Digital, Libre’s infrastructure supports the full lifecycle of fund issuance, including on-chain subscription, redemption and transfer capabilities. This deployment marks a key step in extending access to regulated investment opportunities for institutional and accredited investors across the XDC ecosystem.

Title: Trump Admin Backs Red States’ Antitrust Suit Against Financial Titans To ‘Protect Coal’
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/05/22/trump-admin-backs-antitrust-suit-esg-protect-coal/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T18:38:19Z

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals on Thursday morning. The lawsuit, led by Paxton and backed by ten other state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street collusively used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby burdening consumers by causing the price of coal to skyrocket. The Trump FTC and the DOJ filed a statement of interest on Thursday supporting the attorneys general’s lawsuit, signaling the administration’s view that the firms’ so-called “environmental, social and corporate governance” (ESG) investing may fall afoul of antitrust law. “President Donald Trump understands the importance of coal for our energy security and has vowed to fight left-wing ideologues who seek to make us weaker and poorer under the guise of ESG,” said FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson. “Today, the Federal Trade Commission carries out this administration’s mission to unleash American energy dominance, protect coal, and stop the left’s attempt to corrupt financial markets with political and social objectives.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Attorney General Ken Paxton Sends Warning To Companies Using ESG Practices) Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock visits “The Claman Countdown” at Fox Business Network Studios on April 11, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy via Getty Images) “These companies allegedly blocked the production of American coal in the name of climate change scaremongering, all so they could take money out of the pockets of American consumers and put it in theirs,” Ferguson continued. The FTC and DOJ are taking action following Trump’s day-one energy emergency declaration and his April 8 executive order, which directed federal agencies to “encourage and support our Nation’s coal industry to increase our energy supply, lower electricity costs, stabilize our grid, create high-paying jobs, support burgeoning industries, and assist our allies.” “The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail A. Slater of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division. “American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions.” BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are three of the world’s largest asset managers. All three were members of the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative until Vanguard dropped out in December 2022 and BlackRock exited the coalition in January. The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson wrote to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production. Forcing asset managers to divest from coal companies will harm their ability to access capital and invest in their businesses and employees, likely leading to higher energy prices.” “These asset managers, which have been acting as an ESG climate cartel have not only deceived investors but also harmed millions of American families by raising costs and contributing to record inflation,” executive director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild wrote to the DCNF. “Not only does the FTC and DOJ agree that the investments made were driven by a radical, political objective, but go directly against President Trump’s energy goals.” The White House, the FTC, Paxton’s office, Vanguard and State Street did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

Back then, the price of the leading cryptocurrency stood at next to nothing, with the asset trading from $0.001 to a high of $0.29 at the end of the year, and was only available on a handful of niche exchanges. Fast-forward 15 years, and BTC just hit a new high of $111,770 Thursday afternoon, according to CoinGecko. That record price means 10,000 BTC today is worth over $1.1 billion, or 2,726,000,000% more than the $41 paid for the two Papa John's pies on Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitcoin Pizza Day celebrates the time that Hanyecz wrote on a Bitcoin forum asking if someone would send him food in exchange for 10,000 BTC. "I'll pay 10,000 Bitcoin for a couple of pizzas… like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day," he posted on May 22, 2010. "If you're interested, please let me know and we can work out a deal," he added. A fellow Bitcoiner responded to Hanyecz, taking him up on the offer. It's worth noting that the Papa John's restaurant did not accept cryptocurrency, and someone bought the pizzas and sent them to Hanyecz's house using dollars in exchange for the 10,000 BTC. But the story is marked every year for one of the first known times Bitcoin was used to buy something—and a startling reminder of how much the price of BTC has surged over the last 15 years. Since then, the price of the digital coin has endured several booms and busts, and is no longer just a tool used by people to buy drugs on dark web marketplaces or reimburse strangers for long-distance pizza orders. Crypto exchanges are now available across the globe, and institutions have jumped in headfirst, with Bitcoin exchange-traded funds managed by the likes of Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity allowing customers to get exposure to the cryptocurrency. The U.S. government even has a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the works, thanks to President Trump's recent executive order—with the idea to hold the cryptocurrency like it does with other assets, such as gold. Still, Bitcoin was created as an alternative to fiat currency and the traditional banking system, so one could send and receive money without going through a middleman. And despite the fast rise of the digital asset, it still isn't easy to spend Bitcoin on pizza or other real-world items. Things might be changing—albeit slowly—after American fast food chain Steak 'n Shake announced last week that customers could use the cryptocurrency to buy burgers. The move is unusual, though, and most restaurants still don't accept the big orange coin. While some businesses do accept BTC payments, many Bitcoiners are indeed reluctant to spend the money given its growing status as a store-of-value asset and its sizable long-term gains. Given how much the value of Hanyecz's BTC grew in the 15 years since he swapped 10K worth for a couple pizzas, it’s easy to see why Bitcoiners wouldn’t want to repeat his feat.

Title: Feds back GOP states in climate case alleging BlackRock, other fund giants conspired to lower coal output

Federal antitrust enforcers expressed support on Thursday for arguments wielded by Republican states that accuse asset managers BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street of conspiring through climate activism to decrease coal output. The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission filed a statement of interest in the case where Texas and 12 other states claim the companies used their substantial holdings in US coal companies to discourage competition. The agencies urged the judge overseeing the case in Tyler, Texas, to reject several of the arguments the asset managers made in their bid to dismiss the case, including that the alleged conduct falls under an exemption for passive investors. “This case is about precisely the sort of conduct, including concerted efforts to reduce output, which have long been condemned under the antitrust laws,” the agencies said in their court brief. BlackRock said that forcing asset managers to divest from coal companies would harm the companies’ access to capital and likely raise energy prices. State Street said it acts in the long-term interests of investors and that the lawsuit is baseless. Vanguard reiterated its prior comment that it would defend its history of safeguarding returns for investors. Reuters first reported earlier on Thursday that the agencies were expected to support the states’ arguments. The development marks a political setback for the top asset managers. With some $27 trillion among them, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have come under fire from conservative Republicans, many from energy-producing states, who say the firms wrongly put environmental and social concerns above maximizing returns for their customers. BlackRock, for instance, faces restrictions and outright bans on managing public assets in states including Texas and Indiana over its ESG policies. There were signs of thawing relations in February when the company led a consortium to buy ports near the strategic Panama Canal, a deal hailed by President Trump. The asset managers have called the case “half-baked” and say there is no evidence they pressed for reduced output. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle is scheduled to hear arguments on the asset managers’ bid to dismiss the case in June.

Title: Trump Admin Throws Weight Behind Lawsuit Alleging Wall Street Embraced ESG To Shut Down Coal

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/22/2025 9:30:27 AM PDT by george76 Brief represents the first time the Trump administration has weighed in on green investing issues.. The Federal Trade Commission is throwing its weight behind a high-profile federal lawsuit led by 12 Republican-led states accusing three of the world's largest asset managers—BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—of artificially constricting the coal market in violation of U.S. antitrust laws, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. The filing in the case is a remarkable move that represents the first time the Trump administration has waded directly into an issue or case related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies. Led by powerful asset managers and banks, the ESG movement broadly calls for investors to pull money away from traditional energy industries, like coal and oil, and divert it to green energy industries in the fight against global warming. "Competition in coal markets incentivizes companies to produce as much coal as the market demands," the FTC stated in its Thursday brief. "Allowing the marketplace to freely determine the intersection of supply and demand is thus critical to America’s energy security and economic dynamism." "This case is about alleged anticompetitive conduct that increased energy prices for ordinary American consumers and businesses," it continued. The case dates back to November when Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed a complaint alongside 11 other states, accusing defendants of violating century-old antitrust laws by collectively acquiring substantial ownership stakes in every major coal company in the country before using their newfound influence to pressure the industry to adopt climate goals like cutting coal output in half by 2030. Paxton said those actions have contributed to rising electricity prices. Coal-fired power currently generates less than 15 percent of the nation's total electricity, down from the 33 percent it generated a decade ago, according to federal data. In that same time period, the average price of electricity has steadily increased. In its brief Thursday, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the FTC made clear its interest in protecting Americans from anticompetitive behavior that "reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance." The brief clarified that antitrust laws allow for passive fund investing and that the federal government does not intend to argue otherwise. The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies. "The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

"Allowing the marketplace to freely determine the intersection of supply and demand is thus critical to America’s energy security and economic dynamism." "This case is about alleged anticompetitive conduct that increased energy prices for ordinary American consumers and businesses," it continued. The case dates back to November when Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed a complaint alongside 11 other states, accusing defendants of violating century-old antitrust laws by collectively acquiring substantial ownership stakes in every major coal company in the country before using their newfound influence to pressure the industry to adopt climate goals like cutting coal output in half by 2030. Paxton said those actions have contributed to rising electricity prices. Coal-fired power currently generates less than 15 percent of the nation's total electricity, down from the 33 percent it generated a decade ago, according to federal data. In that same time period, the average price of electricity has steadily increased. In its brief Thursday, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the FTC made clear its interest in protecting Americans from anticompetitive behavior that "reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance." The brief clarified that antitrust laws allow for passive fund investing and that the federal government does not intend to argue otherwise. The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies. "The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide.

The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies. "The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts.

In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

Title: Bitcoin Breaks Records as Market Value Hits Historic Peak – Here Are The Key Drivers
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hits-historic-peak/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T16:30:18Z
Full Content:
The crypto market recently witnessed a historic moment as Bitcoin, the largest digital asset, rallied hard to a new all-time high on Wednesday, triggering renewed optimism in the sector. After the milestone, BTC’s bullish performance has been analyzed and attributed to several key favorable conditions. Since gaining upward traction in April, the market value of Bitcoin has officially risen to a new all-time high of $111,867, surpassing its previous peak at the $109,241 level achieved during United States President Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. The notable upsurge to a new peak marks a major turning point in the cryptocurrency’s development as a widely recognized financial instrument. However, this spike is being driven by a combination of strong variables rather than speculative hype. According to Santiment, a leading on-chain data platform, this milestone was reached just six weeks after the news of Trump’s tariffs caused the crypto sector to display extreme FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). This is a clear example that crypto markets have often moved in the opposite direction of institutional whales’ capital and retail expectations. The on-chain platform has also taken a step to outline the key factors that supported the recent rally to a new all-time high. Aside from the tariffs being lowered and the 90-day truce between the US and China, a major factor behind the BTC’s rally highlighted by Santiment has been the increasing number of institutional investors. This heightened institutional interest has been observed among top asset management firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, and others. Santiment noted that BlackRock’s interest is evidenced by the expansion of its BTC holdings through its Spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, which currently breached the $20 billion milestone. During the period, Fidelity and Ark Invest have also reported record inflows. BTC’s notable surge has triggered bullish sentiment in the sector. Due to ongoing tariff uncertainties and widespread jadedness, there has not been much FOMO, therefore, the path was paved for BTC to finally create history. Over time, Bitcoin has swiftly transformed from a speculative asset to a vital part of diversified investments. This is because of its increasing inclusion in the portfolios of significant asset managers and hedge funds. With the growing presence and crowd’s greed, Santiment is confident that BTC might surge to the $115,000 and $120,000 price range in the near future. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst and trader, also predicted a continuation of the uptrend, claiming that BTC is entering price discovery. Given the robust performance so far, Martinez believes that the next key levels to watch include $116,000, $126,000, $136,000, and $148,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $110,834, demonstrating a nearly 9% increase in the past week. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that investors are capitalizing on the ongoing upward trend as BTC’s trading volume has risen sharply by more than 73% in the past day.

The offering, which covers more than 50 U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds, will be facilitated through a partnership with Backed, a firm specializing in tokenized securities, using the Solana blockchain to offer so-called xStocks, the company said. Tokenization refers to the process of taking real-world assets, whether stocks or bonds, and representing them on-chain using digital assets. Kraken said that stocks will be represented on Solana using SPL tokens, a token standard mirroring ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. xStocks, which will be issued on a public blockchain, are expected to trade around the clock. According to Kraken, the exchange and Backed chose Solana as the first chain for xStocks because of its “unmatched performance, low latency and thriving global ecosystem.” However, the company said it will explore tokenized securities on other networks as well. “We’re reimagining equities investing and ushering in a new wave of demand from clients seeking better alternatives to the status quo,” Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s global head of consumer, said. “Access to traditional U.S. equities remains slow, costly, and restricted.” In April, Kraken began offering U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs to U.S.-based customers. The company says it is eyeing similar expansion in the UK, Europe, and Australia. The push comes as the exchange reportedly prepares for an initial public offering this year. Among traditional financial institutions, tokenization has several backers. In 2022, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink hailed the concept as the future of markets, saying that blockchain-based plumbing could yield near-instantaneous settlement and reduced fees. In the U.S., firms like Securitize have emerged as leaders in the tokenization space. The company manages BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) fund, which has a market capitalization of around $2.8 billion, according to analytics firm rwa.xyz. Collapsed crypto exchange FTX waded into the tokenization space in 2020, when it began offering tokenized stocks for marijuana firms. Binance had dabbled in tokenized securities as well, including offering a version of Coinbase’s stock, at one point. Tokenized stocks have a relatively nascent footprint compared to stablecoins or products like BUIDL. According to rwa.xyz, around $373 million worth of tokenized requites exist on-chain, namely Exodus Movement’s stock, which is issued by Securitize on the Algorand blockchain.

Kraken plans to list tokenized shares of Nvidia, Apple, Tesla and over 50 other U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the Wall Street Journal reported. The tokens, deployed on Solana SOL$177.61, will be known under the name “xStocks” and will be available to trade 24/7 for investors all across the world. Some of the ETFs that will be available to trade include the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 index, and the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). The stocks will be represented by real shares held by Backed Finance and can be redeemed 1:1 for their cash value. Kraken had announced the initial rollout of over 11,000 U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs in April, starting with 10 U.S. states and offered through Kraken Securities. This latest announcement expands Kraken’s offering to include tokenized versions of over 50 stocks and ETFs to customers outside of the U.S., starting with Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. The move puts Kraken in direct competition to platforms like Robinhood (HOOD) and makes it the first exchange to successfully offer tokenized shares of major U.S. stocks. Binance attempted to launch tokenized U.S. stocks in 2021 but canceled their plans eventually due to regulatory uncertainty. A Kraken spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that the exchange is “actively working with various regulators” to ensure that xStocks can be offered legally in each jurisdiction as regulation varies. Tokenization, which turns real-world assets into blockchain tokens, has become the latest buzz word in crypto with more and more companies starting to enter the space. Some, including Ondo Finance, BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have long been pioneers in the area, pushing their overall tokenization market to a $65 billion market cap as of May.

Image Credit: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com HONG KONG, May 22 (Reuters) – CK Hutchison confirmed on Thursday that Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company is the main investor in a group seeking to buy 43 ports from the Hong Kong conglomerate. Hutchison co-managing director Dominic Lai was speaking at the company’s annual general meeting following weeks of scrutiny and criticism in China of its proposal to sell most of its $22.8 billion global ports business to a consortium led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock. When asked if the Swiss-headquartered MSC shipping empire, which is controlled by the Aponte family, was the major investor, Lai said: “Yes, it has been from the beginning.” CK Hutchison has not previously disclosed the exact ownership of each investor in the consortium. Shipping Giant MSC Set to Become World’s Largest Terminal Operator in Hutchison Ports Deal MSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lai’s remarks. The sale of assets, which would include two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, has become highly politicised at a time of intensifying U.S.-China trade tensions. In April, China’s top market regulator said it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison’s planned sale and that parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review. CK Hutchison, controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing, said this month that the deal would strictly adhere to all required compliance standards. The proposed sale has also drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed his desire to reduce Chinese influence around the Panama Canal and termed the deal a “reclaiming” of the waterway.

Title: Trump Admin Throws Weight Behind Lawsuit Alleging Wall Street Embraced ESG To Shut Down Coal
URL: https://freebeacon.com/energy/trump-admin-wades-into-esg-case-accusing-wall-street-of-shutting-down-coal-jacking-up-electric-prices/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T15:52:02Z
Full Content:
The Federal Trade Commission is throwing its weight behind a high-profile federal lawsuit led by 12 Republican-led states accusing three of the world's largest asset managers—BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—of artificially constricting the coal market in violation of U.S. antitrust laws, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. The filing in the case is a remarkable move that represents the first time the Trump administration has waded directly into an issue or case related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies. Led by powerful asset managers and banks, the ESG movement broadly calls for investors to pull money away from traditional energy industries, like coal and oil, and divert it to green energy industries in the fight against global warming. "Competition in coal markets incentivizes companies to produce as much coal as the market demands," the FTC stated in its Thursday brief. "Allowing the marketplace to freely determine the intersection of supply and demand is thus critical to America’s energy security and economic dynamism." "This case is about alleged anticompetitive conduct that increased energy prices for ordinary American consumers and businesses," it continued. The case dates back to November when Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed a complaint alongside 11 other states, accusing defendants of violating century-old antitrust laws by collectively acquiring substantial ownership stakes in every major coal company in the country before using their newfound influence to pressure the industry to adopt climate goals like cutting coal output in half by 2030. Paxton said those actions have contributed to rising electricity prices. Coal-fired power currently generates less than 15 percent of the nation's total electricity, down from the 33 percent it generated a decade ago, according to federal data. In that same time period, the average price of electricity has steadily increased. In its brief Thursday, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the FTC made clear its interest in protecting Americans from anticompetitive behavior that "reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance." The brief clarified that antitrust laws allow for passive fund investing and that the federal government does not intend to argue otherwise. The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies. "The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." State Street did not immediately respond to request for comment. "The DOJ and FTC’s support for this baseless case undermines the Trump administration’s goal of American energy independence," a BlackRock spokesman said in a statement. "As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production. Forcing asset managers to divest from coal companies will harm their ability to access capital and invest in their businesses and employees, likely leading to higher energy prices." "The underlying lawsuit contorts the law in a way that will hurt individual investors, and Vanguard will continue to defend our long history of safeguarding and promoting long-term investment returns on behalf of Vanguard-advised funds and their investors," added a Vanguard spokesman. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

Title: Mantle and Republic Technologies Forge Strategic Partnership to Pioneer Institutional mETH Integration
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/05/22/mantle-and-republic-technologies-forge-strategic-partnership-to-pioneer-institutional-meth-integration/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T14:04:54Z

May 22, 2025 – Singapore, Singapore Mantle, the largest sustainable hub for on-chain finance with over $3 billion in TVL (total value locked), today announced a strategic partnership with Republic Technologies, the Ethereum (ETH) treasury of publicly listed Canadian company Beyond Medical Technologies Inc. (CSE: DOCT) (IBKR: DOCT) (FSE: 7FM). This partnership marks a major milestone in institutional cryptocurrency adoption, positioning Mantle’s mETH as the first liquid staking token to be held on the balance sheet of a publicly listed company. Through the partnership, Republic Technologies plans to delegate a significant portion of its ETH holdings to Mantle’s mETH Protocol and will hold mETH as a yield-bearing, liquid staking token on its balance sheet. The collaboration underscores a structural shift in institutional digital asset strategy and growing investor conviction in Ethereum-native yield infrastructure, reflecting Republic Technologies’ deepening alignment with the Mantle ecosystem. Republic Technologies is establishing a new institutional paradigm by building a treasury strategy around Ethereum, seen as the foundational layer for smart contracts, tokenization and decentralized financial settlement. In contrast to Bitcoin-focused strategies employed by firms like Strategy and Metaplanet, whose reserves are largely Bitcoin-based, Republic Technologies’ approach is anchored in Ethereum’s role as the infrastructure layer powering both blockchain innovation and real-world enterprise integration. By accumulating ETH as a core balance sheet asset, Republic Technologies advances the growth of its underlying healthcare technology businesses while offering institutional-grade exposure to digital assets for all shareholders. This strategy attracts growing interest from traditional markets and accelerates institutional participation in the emerging technology sector. Daniel Liu, CEO of Republic Technologies, said, “We hold strong conviction that Ethereum is the institutional chain, with ETH serving as the digital fuel powering global financial systems. “Our initial entry through Mantle’s Scout program helped us gain early exposure to the broader Mantle ecosystem, where our alignment with mETH Protocol came as a natural next step. “More than 50 established incumbents – including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, PayPal and Visa – have already built services on Ethereum. Wall Street has made its decision. “Our role now is to extend the benefits of this macro tailwind to a broader base of institutional and retail participants worldwide.” Its leadership team brings decades of experience from top-tier financial institutions, including Apollo Global Management, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock and Canaccord Genuity. Republic Technologies operates under the publicly listed company Beyond Medical Technologies Inc., a technology firm integrating blockchain infrastructure to drive operational efficiency and improve patient outcomes across the medical ecosystem. In March 2025, Republic Technologies entered into a licensing agreement and launched its medical attestation platform, leveraging Ethereum-based distributed systems to power healthcare data integrity and regulatory compliance. The Ethereum treasury was established to support and scale this vision, marking a first-of-its-kind integration. Mantle’s mETH Protocol has quickly emerged as one of the leading platforms in Ethereum liquid staking and restaking. Within just 66 days of launch, it surpassed $1 billion in TVL – the fastest growth in its category – and has since peaked at over $2.19 billion. Designed with institutional-grade capital efficiency and composability in mind, mETH enables institutions to access Ethereum-native yield through a fully composable and capital-efficient framework. To date, over 170,000 mETH (approximately $455 million) has been restaked into EigenDA, securing Mantle’s modular data availability layer. Validator operations are distributed across leading infrastructure providers, including Stakefish, P2P.org, Blockdaemon, A41 and Veda, ensuring high availability and robust institutional reliability. Jonathan Low, growth lead at mETH Protocol, said, “Republic Technologies’ participation highlights mETH Protocol’s ability to support institutional strategies built natively on Ethereum. “As demand accelerates for ETH-native yield and utility, we remain focused on building resilient infrastructure that long-term allocators can trust.” The partnership precedes mETH’s inclusion in MI4 (Mantle Index Four), a tokenized, yield-focused index fund developed in collaboration with Securitize – the tokenization firm behind BlackRock’s BUIDL and Apollo’s ACRED. Backed by up to $400 million anchor investment from the Mantle Treasury, MI4 targets $1 billion in AUM and will offer regulated exposure to BTC, ETH, SOL, stablecoins and select staking assets, with mETH playing a central role in its ETH allocation strategy. In parallel, Mantle is preparing to extend mETH’s utility across TradFi (traditional finance) through Mantle Banking, an initiative that will integrate mETH into fiat rails, credit products and conventional payment systems. This integration will allow users to spend, borrow and invest with mETH across traditional payment rails, unlocking real-world utility for digital assets. A pioneering on-chain ecosystem dedicated to revolutionizing the future of finance and blockchain scalability, seamlessly bridging TradFi and DeFi (decentralized finance). Through innovative products like Mantle Network, mETH Protocol, Function (FBTC) and MI4, Mantle’s ecosystem empowers users and institutions with a unified financial services platform, redefining how the world spends, saves and invests in the Web 3.0 era.

Title: Renowned Data Analyst Warns Excess Deaths Are Surging ‘Off the Charts’ . Started Exploding after the Covid mRNA “vaccines” Roll Out in Early 2021″

World-renowned data analyst Ed Dowd has just dropped a chilling warning after uncovering evidence showing that the number of excess deaths of working-age Americans is skyrocketing. According to an alarming warning from Dowd, a leading Wall Street analyst, insurance industry data shows that excess deaths are soaring among people aged 18 to 64 years old. These deaths started exploding after the Covid mRNA “vaccines” were rolled out for public use in early 2021. However, the deaths appear to show no signs of slowing down, despite the pandemic being long over and vaccination rates dropping off. Dowd is a former executive at the world’s largest investment firm, BlackRock. He is considered one of America’s leading data experts. Through his expert analysis of insurance industry data, Dowd has become a prominent figure in investigations into the impact of the global Covid vaccination campaign. In January 2022, Life Insurance CEO Scott Davidson reported that death rates among working-aged people aged 18 to 64 were “up 40 percent over what they were pre-pandemic.” He explained that a 40 percent spike in deaths was completely unprecedented. Davidson compared a 10 percent rise in deaths to a once-in-200-year flood. According to Dowd, excess deaths are now “off the charts.” Davidson also noted that excess deaths that started surging in 2021 were non-Covid deaths. Speaking about the alarming spike, pathologist Dr. Ryan Cole said: “The majority of those deaths happened in quarters number three and four of… 2021. “What does that mean? “When did the mandate start? “Quarter number three and four, 2021.” Although the soaring deaths identified by Dowd are deeply concerning, they don’t show the whole picture, as the data only reveals figures related to working-age individuals with insurance policies. However, Dowd has previously identified major spikes in other age groups using different data sets. In December, Dowd issued a red alert after uncovering evidence that reveals excess deaths are continuing to skyrocket in children who received Covid mRNA “vaccines.” According to Dowd’s findings, excess child deaths are still accelerating and show no sign of slowing down. Dowd made the discovery while analyzing the official data from the UK government’s Office for National Statistics (ONS). “The UK has a problem,” Dowd warned during an interview on “The Jimmy Dore Show.” However, while the deaths were identified in UK data, the trend is most likely reflected in other nations with a similar mass vaccination protocol, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and much of Europe. Dowd’s data shows that excess deaths for children aged one to fourteen have surged higher each year since the Covid mRNA “vaccines” were rolled out in 2021. According to Dowd, excess deaths for children in this age group spiked by a staggering 22% in 2023 – the last full year of data available at the time. Dowd notes that this trend didn’t start until “the magic juice started to be issued to children later in 2021.” The data shows that deaths were actually lower than expected in 2020 but started surging in 2021. According to Dowd’s findings, each year’s data shows: As Dowd notes, while the “vaccines” were rolled out for public use in early 2021, they were authorized for children later in the year. Although the data for last year wasn’t complete at the time of his analysis, Dowd revealed that the available official figures showed that the surging death trend continued through 2024. “Figures from the Office for National Statistics show about 10% more deaths (across all age groups) than expected since April [2024],” Dowd adds. Yet, despite the clear correlation with the mass vaccination campaign, UK health officials insist that “circulatory diseases and diabetes are … behind the increase.” * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

He provides a comprehensive analysis of everything you need to know about the “pandemic” — from the medical dimensions to the economic and social repercussions, political underpinnings, and mental and psychological impacts. “My objective as an author is to inform people worldwide and refute the official narrative which has been used as a justification to destabilize the economic and social fabric of entire countries, followed by the imposition of the “deadly” COVID-19 “vaccine”. This crisis affects humanity in its entirety: almost 8 billion people. We stand in solidarity with our fellow human beings and our children worldwide. Truth is a powerful instrument.” Reviews This is an in-depth resource of great interest if it is the wider perspective you are motivated to understand a little better, the author is very knowledgeable about geopolitics and this comes out in the way Covid is contextualized. —Dr. Mike Yeadon In this war against humanity in which we find ourselves, in this singular, irregular and massive assault against liberty and the goodness of people, Chossudovsky’s book is a rock upon which to sustain our fight. –Dr. Emanuel Garcia In fifteen concise science-based chapters, Michel traces the false covid pandemic, explaining how a PCR test, producing up to 97% proven false positives, combined with a relentless 24/7 fear campaign, was able to create a worldwide panic-laden “plandemic”; that this plandemic would never have been possible without the infamous DNA-modifying Polymerase Chain Reaction test – which to this day is being pushed on a majority of innocent people who have no clue. His conclusions are evidenced by renown scientists. —Peter Koenig Professor Chossudovsky exposes the truth that “there is no causal relationship between the virus and economic variables.” In other words, it was not COVID-19 but, rather, the deliberate implementation of the illogical, scientifically baseless lockdowns that caused the shutdown of the global economy. –David Skripac A reading of Chossudovsky’s book provides a comprehensive lesson in how there is a global coup d’état under way called “The Great Reset” that if not resisted and defeated by freedom loving people everywhere will result in a dystopian future not yet imagined.

Title: R3 connects to Solana

Time Published: 2025-05-22T12:52:00Z
Full Content:
R3 and Solana Foundation today announce a strategic collaboration to bring regulated financial institutions and their real-world assets onto Solana. 0 22 May 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. It will deliver the first enterprise-grade, permissioned consensus service offered to the public directly on a Layer 1 network. This brings the institutional TradFi and DeFi worlds into true convergence, marrying the unparalleled reach of R3 into the TradFi ecosystem with the scale, liquidity, and innovation of internet capital markets. As the world’s most used public blockchain, the Solana blockchain offers unmatched performance, low fees, and a vibrant global ecosystem - making it the ideal foundation for the next generation of regulated digital finance.R3 has invited Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation, to R3’s Board of Directors, marking a strategic shift for R3 that unites the strengths of public and permissioned blockchains.Solana and R3 will bring regulated assets onto a public blockchain at a time when the RWA sector is at a pivotal juncture: regulatory tailwinds are spurring investor confidence in digital assets, financial institutions are becoming increasingly comfortable with leveraging public networks, and the DeFi sector is maturing. These forces are driving growing demand for high-quality, tokenized assets on public networks.As the world's largest collection of permissioned RWA networks, with over $10 billion in regulated assets on-chain across its platforms, the R3 ecosystem is ideally positioned to meet this demand. R3’s Corda has the most live, in-production use cases and millions of transactions processed daily by leading institutional players. Integrating with Solana’s blockchain will enable these assets to flow to meet the growing demand on public networks, and unlock new settlement options across these ecosystems, including using high-quality stablecoins. Unlike traditional interoperability approaches, this comprehensive integration means private transactions on Corda can be confirmed directly on Solana mainnet, inheriting the network's performance and security, and enabling true transactional atomicity.The collaboration will create a consensus service deployed on Solana to enable native interoperability between R3’s existing Corda platform - as well as other private networks - and Solana, bridging the gap between permissioned and public blockchain ecosystems for the first time. This will enable regulated financial institutions - including banks, financial market infrastructure providers, and asset managers - to fully harness the openness and efficiency of Solana without re-writing their applications or compromising on compliance, security, or asset control.R3 chose Solana as its public Layer-1 substrate and the basis for its new consensus service following an extensive evaluation and technical review of decentralized protocols, selecting Solana for its low transaction fees, speed, scalability, as well as the Solana ecosystem’s robust developer community, and relationships with numerous regulated financial institutions, including Blackrock, Franklin Templeton, and Hamilton Lane which have all deployed regulated assets on the network.Critically, this collaboration simplifies the complexity of managing RWAs on public blockchains - bringing Corda’s proven strengths in identity, privacy, and compliance to a public and permissioned environment. This allows traditional financial institutions to operate with the same control and clarity they expect from enterprise-grade infrastructure, while unlocking the scale and flexibility of a public network. “This is a major step forward for the institutional adoption of public blockchain," said Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation. "R3’s decision to bring its regulated financial network onto Solana is powerful validation that public blockchains have reached institutional readiness. With Solana's unmatched performance, enterprise-grade permissioning, and growing roster of regulated assets, we're not just witnessing convergence between TradFi and DeFi - we're enabling it. This collaboration signifies that the future of capital markets will be built on public infrastructure. We’re thrilled that the Solana ecosystem is leading the way."David E. Rutter, Founder and CEO of R3 commented: “We’ve never pursued blockchain for its own sake - our mission is to solve real financial problems. After years of laying the groundwork, R3 is ready to bring our experience and our network of regulated financial institutions towards a new public future with one of the best and most trusted public ecosystems - Solana. This is more than a milestone; it’s a strategic realignment for the entire industry. We know DeFi isn’t coming to TradFi, so it’s up to us to build the connective infrastructure that links these two ecosystems. This is about adapting to deliver real-world utility, institutional-grade readiness, and shaping the long-term future of regulated markets.”Clearstream, a leading post-trade infrastructure provider at the forefront of digitizing financial markets, is a long-standing user of R3’s Corda which underpins its digital collateral solution. Jens Hachmeister, Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream, commented: “Tokenization isn’t just about digitizing assets - it’s about building scalable, global infrastructure where real-world assets can interact directly and securely, no matter where investors are located. The convergence of public and private blockchains is no longer a future promise - it’s happening now. This is a generational shift in how value moves, and a compelling moment for any institution looking to enter the crypto space. We’re excited for what’s ahead.”

Title: Ant International Helps HSBC Hong Kong Offer Tokenized Deposits
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2025/ant-international-helps-hsbc-hong-kong-offer-tokenized-deposits/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T12:28:17Z
Full Content:
Ant International has teamed with HSBC on the bank’s tokenized deposit service in Hong Kong. The service is designed to support treasury management via real-time, “always-on” Hong Kong and U.S. dollar payments between corporate wallets held by an HSBC Hong Kong client, according to a Thursday (May 22) press release. In addition, the service is also Hong Kong’s first bank-led, blockchain-based settlement service, and follows a pilot test between HSBC and Ant International on Ant’s Whale platform. “We are very excited to work with an industry leader like HSBC, who shares the belief that tokenisation is the key to bridging the stability of traditional banking with the efficiency of blockchain, to enable real-time treasury management,” Kelvin Li, general manager of platform tech at Ant International, said in the release. “As a tech connector in the fast-evolving financial services industry, our banking partnerships are expanding from tokenization to AI-driven global FX and liquidity initiatives. We look forward to working with more public and private-sector partners to unlock more transparent, accessible and efficient treasury management solutions for businesses worldwide.” The partnership is happening at a moment when, as covered here last month, money and assets are experiencing a transformation thanks to tokenization on the blockchain. “On-chain tokenization is moving from concept to practice, with players like Visa, Mastercard, J.P. Morgan, and other commercial banks exploring or piloting real-world tokenized payment and financial systems,” PYMNTS wrote. “For chief financial officers and corporate treasurers, tokenization isn’t just a tech issue; it could represent a capital strategy shift.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also wants all assets to be tokenized and tradable online, telling shareholders: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” At its most basic level, tokenization refers to representing real-world assets like fiat currency, securities and investment contracts as digital tokens on a distributed ledger. From there, these tokens can be transferred, programmed, or settled in ways traditional systems don’t allow. Tokenization “isn’t a cryptocurrency play,” that report added, but rather a way for businesses and financial services stakeholders to move value faster, cheaper, and more securely across networks. It’s also a way to modernize money movement while democratizing investment access to institutional-grade products. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS. “Back in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” This Week in AI: The Agentic Web, AI-Native Devices and Search Tools Trump Threatens to Raise Tariffs on Apple and European Union The Digital Asset Primer: Why Equity Markets Are Being Tokenized Report: SBA Staffing Cuts Reduce Service to Entrepreneurs We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Hits 2-Week High as $BTC Nears $112K. BTC Bull Token to Follow?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-etfs-rally-after-135k-btc-prediction-btc-bull-token-next/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T12:06:54Z
Full Content:
BlackRock ETFs have experienced a two-week high while Bitcoin is pushing to its first-ever $112K price mark. Projects like BTC Bull Token could rally next. Farside Investors published the numbers, showing that IBIT’s net inflows peaked at $530.6M, the highest since May 5th $531.2M. The ETF tracking Trader T also highlighted BlackRock’s record Bitcoin intake, as it peaked at 4,931 $BTC, the highest volume since January 23. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas: ‘Classic feeding frenzy in effect, new ATHs will do that,’ referring to Bitcoin’s recent performance, which is nothing short of inspirational. What does this mean and, perhaps more importantly, how can you leverage this bull run through BTC Bull Token, which promises free Bitcoin? Let’s dig in! The BlackRock ETF rally tells a larger story—that of Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally, sprinkled with modest swings, but overall very bullish. $BTC hit its peak at $111,746 on May 22 at 7:00AM and, while it lost $1K in the meantime, it doesn’t seem that the bull run is anywhere near over. Titan of Crypto’s X prediction of a $135K $BTC for 2025 is more than reasonable, given the recent Bitcoin adoption trend among public and private institutions. However, it turns out that Titan’s $135K prediction is among the tamest ones, as technical analyst Gert van Lagen envisions a $320K Bitcoin by the end of 2025. Peter Brandt, veteran Bitcoin trader, shares Lagen’s optimism, stating: I think it is wonderful Bitcoin is making ATHs. I am long. […] On track maybe for top of $125,000 to $150,000 by the end of August? —Peter Brandt, X That being said, despite Bitcoin’s 30-day pump of 25%, investors should still show caution and patience, according to Joao Wedson, CEO of Alphractal: Public obsession with breaking the ATH matters more than risk management — setting the stage for traps targeting both bulls and bears. —Joao Wedson, X Caution or not, though, you should know that Bitcoin’s steroid-fueled chart run is bound to rally some of the best altcoins on the market today. One such altcoin is BTC Bull Token, one of the most promising meme coins in 2025. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a meme project that fuels its run by offering you free $BTC airdrops, so long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. The project was born from the idea that Bitcoin is an unstoppable force that will eventually breach the $1M price ceiling. Following the same line of thought, a $250K price point for 2025 isn’t out of the question either. The presale is understandably pumping, with over $6.1M raised since inception and a token price of $0.002525. According to the same projection, you should expect a more modest ROI of 160% by the end of 2025, if the $0.006467 prediction comes true. In this context, the airdrops are the cherry on top, as the project will reward holders with real $BTC every time Bitcoin breaches through predetermined price points ($150K and $200K) With such a low token price and the fact that the project is still in presale, BTC Bull Token appears to be a good investment opportunity, especially in a market where even Ethereum is witnessing consistent gains. If you decide to catch this bull by the horns, check out our ‘how to buy $BTCBULL’ guide today to streamline the acquisition process. We’ve no reason to think the Bitcoin bull is coming out of the china shop yet. It’s definitely resting, though, as Bitcoin appears to consolidate its position around $110,700-ish. But given the avalanche of Bitcoin-endorsing policies coming from the White House in Q1 2025 and the mass adoption over the last year, it’s safe to say that 2025 will be Bitcoin’s time to shine. So, don’t get blindsided by the King coin’s break, and don’t ignore potential honeypots like the BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL).

Title: Mantle Partners Republic Technologies to Pioneer Institutional mETH Integration
URL: https://zycrypto.com/mantle-partners-republic-technologies-to-pioneer-institutional-meth-integration/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T11:26:42Z

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Mantle, a pioneering on-chain ecosystem revolutionizing the DeFi space, has partnered strategically with Republic Technologies, the Ethereum (“ETH”) treasury of publicly listed Canadian company Beyond Medical Technologies Inc. According to an official announcement today, the partnership will see Republic Technologies integrating Mantle’s mETH Protocol to foster Defi innovation. Following this partnership, Mantle’s mETH will become the first liquid staking token to be held on the balance sheet of a publicly listed company, marking a major milestone in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Nonetheless, Republic Technologies has disclosed plans to delegate a significant portion of its ETH holdings to Mantle’s mETH Protocol and will hold mETH as a yield-bearing, liquid staking token on its balance sheet. While this move highlights growing investor conviction in Ethereum-native yield infrastructure, it reflects Republic Technologies’ deepening alignment with the Mantle ecosystem. With this partnership, Republic Technologies seeks to establish a new institutional paradigm by building a treasury strategy around Ethereum, which is seen as the foundational layer for smart contracts, tokenization, and decentralized financial settlement. Per the announcement, Republic Technologies adopts an approach anchored in Ethereum’s role as the infrastructure layer powering blockchain innovation and real-world enterprise integration. This is unlike Bitcoin-focused strategies employed by firms like Strategy and Metaplanet, whose reserves are largely Bitcoin-based. As such, Republic Technologies will be accumulating ETH as its core balance sheet asset, advancing the growth of its underlying healthcare technology businesses while offering institutional-grade exposure to digital assets for all shareholders. Daniel Liu, the CEO of Republic Technologies, commented on this,s saying; “We hold strong conviction that Ethereum is the institutional chain, with ETH serving as the digital fuel powering global financial systems…Our initial entry through Mantle’s Scout Program helped us gain early exposure to the broader Mantle ecosystem, where our alignment with mETH Protocol came as a natural next step.” “More than 50 established incumbents—including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, PayPal, and Visa—have already built services on Ethereum. Wall Street has made its decision. Our role now is to extend the benefits of this macro tailwind to a broader base of institutional and retail participants worldwide,” Liu added. The firm’s decision to establish an Ethereum treasury has fueled its decision to integrate Mantle’s mETH Protocol. This DeFi platform has quickly emerged as one of the leading platforms in Ethereum liquid staking and restaking. Designed with institutional-grade capital efficiency and composability in mind, mETH enables institutions to access Ethereum-native yield through a fully composable and capital-efficient framework. Jonathan Low, the Growth Lead at mETH Protocol has also commented on the partnership saying; “Republic Technologies’ participation highlights mETH Protocol’s ability to support institutional strategies built natively on Ethereum…As demand accelerates for ETH-native yield and utility, we remain focused on building resilient infrastructure that long-term allocators can trust.” Following efforts to boost mETH’s adoption while offering users the opportunity to spend, borrow, and invest with mETH across traditional payment rails, Mantle is making plans to extend mETH’s utility across traditional finance through Mantle Banking. This initiative seeks to integrate mETH into fiat rails, credit products, and conventional payment systems.

Title: Ethereum staking hits record high, ETF inflows turn bullish – Impact on market?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-staking-hits-record-high-etf-inflows-turn-bullish-impact-on-market/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T08:30:41Z
Full Content:
The return of positive ETF inflows and rise in depositing addresses for staking could pave way for a better environment of Ethereum products. Ethereum [ETH] ETFs produced a combined $64.8o million in net flows on the 20th of May 2025. This pointed to an extra religion from essential institutions and influential individuals known as ‘smart money’ who seemed to be positioning themselves. BlackRock’s ETHA fund led with a $45.0 million raise, while Fidelity’s FETH secured $19.8 million. Meanwhile, there were no net flow changes for Bitwise (ETHW), 21Shares (CETH), VanEck (ETHV), Invesco (QETH), Franklin (EZET), or Grayscale’s funds (ETHE and ETH). These inflows follow a period of mixed or lower flows, following the—$39.8 million outflow on the 15th of May, primarily from Grayscale and Fidelity. Source: X On the 20th of May, major institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity made significant purchases, contributing $152.9 million in inflows and $15.2 million in outflows since the 8th of May. Their actions suggest an attempt to position themselves ahead of potential price increases or key market triggers. If this trend continues, it could further solidify the bullish structure for ETH’s price soon. The sudden surge in new capital indicates a notable shift in how high-conviction investors allocate their resources. Moreover, there were now more than 225,000 depositor addresses taking part in Ethereum’s staking contract—a record high. The change climbed by 0.30% over the past week, 1.77% in the past month, and 5.76% in the previous three months. It appeared more consumers were joining the Ethereum staking feature, with steady rates starting from mid-2023. Although the market was volatile, the strong growth of staked ETH demonstrated that more people were joining the network. With the total staked ETH standing at 34,559,715, this growth highlighted rising network participation despite market volatility. As the conversation about ETH ETF staking accelerated, the rise in unique staking addresses indicated that more validators were now participating. Source: IntoTheBlock Though it did not connect to institutions, it showed that ETH was still in high demand as an asset providing high yields. Although these numbers could rise significantly more, regulatory approval was necessary for it to happen. ETH’s resilience could be key to its future price stability. BlackRock has continued to push for approval of ETH ETF staking, options, and tokenization, signaling growing investor interest in Ethereum’s products as the market recovers. The company’s discussions with the SEC Crypto Task Force could accelerate the creation of clearer cryptocurrency regulations. If ETH ETF staking is approved, large investors may shift toward Ethereum, boosting its adoption. In the long term, these developments could drive higher ETF inflows, especially as Ethereum leads efforts in tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure. However, the outcome ultimately depends on regulatory decisions and market response.

The ₹2,150-crore IPO is entirely a fresh issue by the company, with no offer-for-sale component. Against an offer size of about 17.71 crore shares, the IPO received bids for 11.82 crore shares, subscribing 0.67 times. The IPO will close on May 23. The price band for the offer has been pegged at ₹85-90 per share, and investors can bid for a minimum of 166 equity shares. The offer is being made through the book-building process, wherein not more than 50 per cent of the offer shall be available for allocation on a proportionate basis to qualified institutional buyers, not less than 15 per cent for allocation to non-institutional bidders, and up to 35 per cent of the offer to retail investors. While the quota for non-institutional investors, generally referred to as HNIs, was subscribed 1.44 times, the retail portion elicited 0.48 times subscription and the institutional quota 0.42 times. Ahead of the IPO, Belrise Industries on Tuesday garnered ₹645 crore from anchor investors. The company informed the bourses that it had allocated 71,666,665 shares at ₹90 per share to anchor investors. The investors who participated in the anchor book include foreign institutions such as BlackRock, Capital Group, M&G, and Pinebridge, and domestic institutions such as ICICI Prudential MF, HDFC MF, Nippon India MF, ValueQuest, and Bajaj Allianz Life. The proceeds from the fresh issue, to the extent of ₹1,618.13 crore, will be used for repayment or prepayment, in full or in part, of certain borrowings availed by the company, and for general corporate purposes. Belrise Industries Ltd (BIL) is an automotive component manufacturing company, offering a diverse range of safety critical systems and other engineering solutions for two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and agri-vehicles. Its product portfolio includes metal chassis systems, polymer components, suspension systems, body-in-white components, and exhaust systems, among others. BIL’s products are largely agnostic to vehicle powertrain types, reflecting its ability in catering to both electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, thus positioning it favourably to adapt to the growing electric vehicle market. The company specialises in precision sheet metal pressing and fabrication (i.e., the process of joining sheet metal components to create unified structures for assembling vehicle subsystems and bodies), and had a market share of 24 per cent in the overall two-wheeler metal components segment in India as of March 31, 2024, in terms of revenue (Source: CRISIL Report). Belrise has a long-standing relationship with OEMs such as Bajaj Auto Limited, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Private Limited, Hero MotoCorp Limited, Jaguar Land Rover Limited, and Royal Enfield Motors Limited, among others. Belrise Industries’ revenue from operations increased by 13.70 per cent to ₹7,484.24 crore for the financial year 2024, from ₹6,582.50 crore for the financial year 2023, primarily attributable to an increase in product sales and higher prices of raw materials and components. Profit after tax for FY24 stood at ₹310.88 crore. For the nine months ended December 31, 2024, revenue from operations stood at ₹6,013.43 crore, and profit after tax stood at ₹245.47 crore. Axis Capital Limited, Jefferies India Private Limited, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Private Limited, and SBI Capital Markets Limited are the book-running lead managers, while MUFG Intime India Private Limited is the registrar to the issue.

The rebound is buoyed by renewed risk appetite from investors as President Trump has toned down his trade war rhetoric, seeking deals with trading partners after slapping them with sizable tariffs. Still, Bitcoin has more room to run, according to the experts—with some industry observers predicting a $200,000 top. Others are predicting even higher jumps, whether they're expected later this year or beyond. Here’s a look at some of the massive targets that crypto experts have placed on Bitcoin lately. Adam Back, Blockstream CEO: $500,000 to $1 million this cycle Blockstream boss and Bitcoin legend Adam Back spoke to Decrypt last week, and predicted the biggest and oldest digital coin would hit $500,000 to $1 million this cycle. In an interview, the computer scientist said that the price of BTC was surprisingly low at this point after last year’s halving, considering all the institutional money involved. "I think if you get a new all-time high, it could quickly become a lot higher,” he said. Standard Chartered: $200,000 this year British bank Standard Chartered’s digital assets research team is bullish, to say the least. The bank’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research Geoffrey Kendrick has repeatedly said that the virtual coin would soar this year—despite Trump tariffs and other geopolitical factors—and is predicting a $200,000 high by the end of 2025. His reasoning? U.S.-based investors wanting a non-sovereign asset. "We expect a strategic asset reallocation away from U.S. assets to trigger the next sharp upswing in Bitcoin in the coming months," he said in April. Even more bullish is the analyst's outlook for the next few years: $500,000 per coin by the time President Trump leaves office at the start of 2029. Bernstein: $200,000 this bull run Investment firm Bernstein has also bet on Bitcoin's price hitting new highs, with analysts at the firm regularly saying that institutional money will be the main driver. The firm expects companies to snap up $330 billion in Bitcoin over the next five years. "The Bitcoin genie is out of the bottle, and it is hard to reverse this course," Bernstein analysts said last year before crypto-friendly President Trump won the U.S. election. Bernstein analysts in 2024 and this year have forecast that BTC's price will end 2025 at $200,000. Arthur Hayes: $150,000 in 2025 Billionaire entrepreneur Arthur Hayes is known for his outlandish predictions—even once referring to long-term forecasts as "pretty shit." Still, the former BitMEX boss knows his macro and has predicted intense central bank money printing to push BTC's price to the moon. Similar to Standard Chartered, he thinks investors will want to leave American assets behind. "Bitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere," he wrote in a recent blog post, predicting a $150,000 high this year. Tim Draper: $250,000 this year Billionaire investor Tim Draper recently went as far as to say that companies that didn't hold BTC on their balance sheets were being "irresponsible." The Silicon Valley venture capital investor and founder of Draper Associates said earlier this month that by the end of 2025, he believes Bitcoin will hit $250,000, noting a "gravitational pull toward Bitcoin." BlackRock's Larry Fink: $700,000… eventually BlackRock boss Larry Fink, who has massively helped institutions get involved in buying BTC with the launch of the popular iShares Bitcoin Trust, said that the coin could hit $700,000. Speaking in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the CEO of the world's largest asset manager said that if institutions like sovereign wealth funds continued to make even small allocations to the asset, the orange coin's price would rocket upwards. But the Wall Street titan did add that he wasn't promoting the cryptocurrency with his bullish bet. Brian Armstrong: Multi-millions… at some point The CEO of America's biggest crypto exchange Coinbase forecast in January that Bitcoin will be worth "multiple millions”—at some point in the future. Brian Armstrong, who founded the San Francisco, California-based exchange in 2012, said that nation-state adoption would help propel the asset that high. "I think over time we'll see Bitcoin get into the multiple millions price range," he said. Still, Armstrong, whose firm has contracts with the U.S. government, added that BTC has a long way to go before rising that high.

Title: Mike Novogratz Says Weakening Dollar, Widening Deficit and America’s Deteriorating Financial Situation ‘Very Good’ for Bitcoin and Crypto

The chief executive of crypto asset manager Galaxy Digital says America’s current financial situation is bullish for Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto. In a new interview with Bloomberg, Novogratz says that many factors have contributed to the rise of digital assets, including President Donald Trump and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s embrace of the sector. “It started with Larry Fink. When he got orange-pilled, the largest asset manager in the world said ‘this is a real asset,’ at least Bitcoin, that everyone should be a part of and lots of other companies… followed suit. And that was kind of round one of institutions coming in. But really it was the shift of approach from the Gary Gensler SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) to this Trump Administration which has just embraced our industry, and that freed up the animal spirit, both here and abroad.” However, Novogratz goes on to say that America’s current uncertain fiscal situation is ultimately good for the top crypto asset by market cap and the digital assets industry in general. He says the Trump administration’s failure to significantly lower the debt-to-GDP ratio has been a boon for the asset class. “We’re in a really hard position as a country… We have this kind of debt, yield curves are selling off everywhere, the dollar is under pressure, and that all is very good for Bitcoin and crypto assets as well.” BTC is trading for $108,961 at time of writing, just below a new all-time high.

As hedge funds trimmed their Magnificent Seven positions in the first quarter, they increasingly turned their attention toward some other stocks. In Goldman Sachs' Hedge Fund Trend Monitor published May 20, the firm highlighted 20 stocks that an increasing number of hedge funds added to their holdings in that period. That heightened interest could be a sign that the stocks are primed for strong returns in the months ahead, the bank said. "Historically, stocks with the largest increase in the number of hedge fund investors ('Rising Stars') have typically gone on to outperform sector peers during the quarters following their rise in popularity," said the note, authored by a team of strategists led by Ben Snider, a managing director. The utilities, financials, and consumer discretionary sectors each had five stocks on the list. Two have AI exposure: Sempra and Kinder Morgan. The average market cap of the 20 stocks on the list is $17 billion. We've listed the stocks below, along with their net gain in the number of funds that own them.

Title: Bitcoin ownership surpasses gold in the US as 50M Americans hold BTC
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-ownership-surpasses-gold-in-the-us-as-50m-americans-hold-btc/
Time Published: 2025-05-21T15:13:56Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin has officially outpaced gold in US ownership, marking a significant pivot in the country’s investment landscape. According to a new report released on 20 May by Bitcoin investment firm River, roughly 50 million Americans now own Bitcoin, compared to 37 million who own gold. This data underscores the rise of Bitcoin as a preferred store of value, reshaping traditional notions of economic security and reserve asset status. As Bitcoin ownership expands, it’s increasingly seen not just as a speculative instrument, but as a fundamental part of US financial infrastructure. The River report notes that the United States is the global leader in Bitcoin adoption, with 40 percent of all Bitcoin-related companies headquartered in the country. American firms also hold 94.8 percent of all Bitcoin owned by publicly traded companies worldwide, reflecting significant institutional backing. This dominance is supported by a robust ecosystem comprising crypto-focused startups, spot ETF launches, and policies promoting digital asset development. Regulatory momentum in Washington has further strengthened Bitcoin’s foundation in the financial system. Recent discussions around treating Bitcoin as a potential strategic reserve asset suggest growing political acceptance. Several politicians have floated the idea of the US government maintaining a Bitcoin reserve, signalling institutional confidence amid rising concerns over the US dollar’s long-term stability. The shift toward Bitcoin is occurring alongside broader macroeconomic concerns. Moody’s recent downgrade of the US credit rating—ending over a century of top-tier ratings—has reinforced the appeal of decentralised alternatives. Investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against fiscal instability and inflation, particularly given its fixed supply and decentralised governance model. Bitcoin also offers practical advantages over gold in the digital age. The ease of storage, cross-border transfer, and liquidity make it an attractive option for both individual and institutional investors. This is particularly relevant in an era where digital finance is becoming the norm and where traditional safe-haven assets like gold face logistical and accessibility limitations. While Bitcoin is gaining legitimacy as a reserve asset, it remains a volatile asset class. Unlike gold, which has maintained relatively steady valuations over time, Bitcoin has experienced frequent price swings—something that may deter more risk-averse investors. Nonetheless, the market appears to be increasingly tolerant of this volatility, especially as long-term returns continue to outperform traditional assets. Institutional support also plays a key role in this shift. Major asset managers such as BlackRock are incorporating Bitcoin into their portfolios, further validating its status. Meanwhile, crypto ETFs and custodial services are helping to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space, making it easier for Americans to gain exposure to Bitcoin without navigating complex self-custody solutions. As Bitcoin ownership grows, it reflects not just a shift in preference, but a broader transformation in how Americans perceive financial security and resilience. The trend is still developing, but the numbers now place Bitcoin squarely ahead of gold—at least in terms of how many Americans are betting on it.

Title: Welcoming Jon Xu and Andrew Miklas as YC’s Newest General Partners

Time Published: 2025-05-21T15:00:00Z

by Garry Tan5/21/2025 Over the last few batches, visiting partners Jon Xu and Andrew Miklas have become two of the most trusted voices in the YC community. They were both founders in YC’s Summer 2010 batch, and now, 15 years and two industry-shaping companies later, they’re back in a new role: General Partners at YC. As visiting partners, Jon and Andrew have already made a big impact, working closely with hundreds of founders across multiple batches. Now, as full-time General Partners, they’ll play an even bigger role in selecting, advising, and supporting the companies we back. They bring deep technical experience, firsthand startup grit, and a strong track record of helping early-stage companies grow – all of which makes them a perfect fit for YC’s mission to help ambitious founders build enduring companies from the earliest stages. Jon is the co-founder and former CTO of FutureAdvisor (YC S10), one of the first robo-advisors to make quality investment management accessible to a broader consumer audience. After the company was acquired by BlackRock in 2015, Jon continued to lead product and engineering, building an enterprise-grade robo-advisor platform for large financial institutions. His background gives him unique expertise both in building high-trust consumer products and B2B platforms for regulated industries. Andrew co-founded PagerDuty (YC S10, NYSE:PD), which became the backbone of digital operations for thousands of businesses. As founding CTO, he designed the original product and its high-availability architecture, and scaled the engineering team to 70+ people. After PagerDuty, he became an early-stage investor at s28 Capital, supporting companies like Clerk, CaptivateIQ, and Teleport. Andrew brings deep experience in building resilient systems and scaling engineering teams from zero to impact. At YC, we’re always looking for ways to meet the needs of the most ambitious founders. Adding Jon and Andrew to our team strengthens our bench of technical leaders who’ve built durable companies – and who know what it takes to turn early-stage ideas into something world-changing. We’re lucky to have them, and our founders will be even luckier. Categories YC News Other Posts Does co-founder matching work? It did for these YC companies.
