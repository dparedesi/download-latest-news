The cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider Blockchain.com has taken new steps toward a potential initial public offering (IPO) by appointing two seasoned executives with financial and operational expertise. Blockchain.com hired Justin Evans, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs, as its new chief financial officer, Bloomberg reported. It also appointed Mike Wilcox, previously CFO of Velocity Global and former Point72 portfolio manager, as its chief operating officer. Evans said that the exchange is “taking the steps necessary to be a public company, if and when the public markets are available.” The move comes amid a flurry of other cryptocurrency firms reported to be considering going public, including Circle, Kraken, Bullish Global (Parent company of CoinDesk), Gemini, Ripple and BitGo. Growing institutional adoption after major firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, launched exchange-traded fund (ETF) offerings in the cryptocurrency space and the more balanced approach the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to take toward digital assets are creating a potentially more favorable environment for these firms to go public. Blockchain.com has seen its valuation fluctuate over time. In March 2021, it raised $300 million at a $5.2 billion post-money valuation in its Series C funding round. In 2022, it closed a funding round that increased its valuation to $14 billion, while in Nov. 2023, it closed a $110 million funding round valuing the company at $7 billion.

Title: Trader Says Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokens Looking Better Than Most of the Crypto Market – Here Are His Top Picks

A crypto strategist known for accurately calling the 2021 digital asset cycle top says the real-world asset (RWA) sector is showing a lot of market strength. The analyst pseudonymously known as Pentoshi tells his 854,800 followers on the social media platform X that Chintai (CHEX), Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Clearpool (CPOOL) are three RWA altcoins poised for rallies. RWA crypto projects aim to tokenize traditional assets so that they can be traded on blockchains, enabling efficiency and accessibility, fractional ownership and other benefits. Says Pentoshi, “CHEX, ONDO, CPOOL: RWA play updates. CHEX actually made new highs after the big sell-off two weeks ago, and RWAs had the strongest recoveries of any sector. All structurally look better than most of the market currently with retests of nice high time frame levels.” CHEX is trading for $0.44 at time of writing, flat on the day. ONDO is trading for $1.32 at time of writing, down marginally in the last 24 hours. CPOOL is trading for $0.26 at time of writing, up 10% on the day. The analyst also says that he is bullish on the Ethereum (ETH)-based automated staking service Lido DAO (LDO), and he believes the token may get a boost from potential approvals of ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with staking. “LDO update: big move off the lows, probably a little local resistance here so potentially some consolidation but a great move so far… Next guess is that more staked ETF filings will come through. Then these ETFs will have to decide on infrastructure. So people will have to think about who the infrastructure will be. And companies like BlackRock will choose LDO (will be another too) and some of these will probably have to reprice a bit in theory of course because with markets you never know.” LDO is trading for $1.85 at time of writing, up 10% in the last 24 hours.

A regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that the SWIB now owns over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) fund, worth $335.9 million as of this writing. Last year, the SWIB disclosed it had bought shares from both the BlackRock and Grayscale Bitcoin ETFs collectively worth $163 million at the time, but Friday’s filing shows that its crypto exposure now is exclusively with IBIT. The SWIB is responsible for the citizens’ pension funds and other trusts in the Midwestern state. It makes all kinds of investments, from tech stocks to gold. The SEC last year approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing the products to trade on American stock exchanges after a decade of denials. Investors can now buy shares that track the price of Bitcoin and not have to worry about storing the asset themselves. Since their approval, investor capital has flooded the space and Bitcoin has broken new all-time price highs, most recently marking a peak just shy of $109,000 in January. Institutional investors are now able to access the crypto space via the regulated funds. Other American pension funds are also buying exposure to crypto. Last year, for example, the State of Michigan Retirement System disclosed that it had bought shares in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

Title: How Does Crypto Help Hedge Against Inflation?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/how-does-crypto-help-hedge-against-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-02-15T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Rising food prices are a harmful result of inflation. Can you use crypto to protect your pocketbook? Inflation is the systematic erosion of the purchasing power of money. Governments and central banks often attribute inflation to supply shocks, rising production costs or geopolitical instability. These factors may drive temporary fluctuations in inflation under specific circumstances, but they all stem from a deeper, underlying cause: the relentless expansion of the money supply. Persistent inflation occurs when the growth of the money supply outpaces economic output, reducing the purchasing power of each dollar. In simple terms, when more dollars are printed, each dollar buys less. Fiat currencies like the dollar are vulnerable to inflation because governments can create money at will, and often do so for political expediency. Even in times of economic stability, central banks deliberately try to balance inflation at a rate of 2% annually. This figure traces back to a short-lived policy adopted by the Central Bank of New Zealand in 1989. Somehow it took hold, and the entirely arbitrary 2% target has since been enshrined as economic orthodoxy. The stated reason that 2% inflation is desirable is because it “spurs growth,” though no clear mechanism for how inflation drives economic expansion has been identified. Meanwhile, expanding the money supply devalues government debt, enables unchecked deficit spending and imposes a silent tax on the public, all without the need for legislative approval. Inflation is a certainty, like death and taxes. The purchasing power of your dollars will decline over time; the only question is by how much and how fast. The rational response is to store wealth in assets that rise in price as new money enters the system. Stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities and even some cryptocurrencies serve this function, each with its own risk-reward profile. Investing, at its core, is about front-running inflation. But with every investment comes risk. The wrong bet could leave you worse off than if you had simply held cash. As Warren Buffett warned, “Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1.” If the goal is to hedge against inflation—not gamble on speculative upside—the priority should be asset stability. Historically, the “gold standard” of inflation protection has been, well, gold. It won’t make you rich, but its purchasing power has remained remarkably consistent. An ounce of gold today buys roughly the same amount of land as it did hundreds of years ago. Very few assets can claim that kind of track record. For the first time in history, there is a digital alternative, one that combines gold’s scarcity with superior portability, divisibility and censorship resistance. That asset is bitcoin (and to some extent other cryptocurrencies), and its role in inflation hedging is growing. Unlike fiat money, some cryptocurrencies have fixed supplies and are not controlled by central authorities, making them resistant to inflation. Bitcoin, viewed by some as “digital gold,” is the most prominent example. However, other cryptocurrencies are also sometimes used as inflation hedges. Let’s examine some of the ways crypto can serve as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin’s monetary policy enforces scarcity. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. This scarcity is enforced by its code and network consensus, making it immune to inflation. Historically, assets with limited supply have been effective inflation hedges. Bitcoin and gold share this quality, but bitcoin has several advantages: it’s more portable, easily verifiable and resistant to confiscation. When inflation accelerates, more investors seek hard assets, and bitcoin will continue to attract investment. Bitcoin operates outside of government and central bank control. No single entity can manipulate its supply or freeze transactions. This independence makes bitcoin especially appealing in economies suffering from currency devaluation or even hyperinflation, where people seek an escape from failing fiat systems. In countries like Turkey and Lebanon where local currencies have collapsed, bitcoin offers a crucial lifeline. Crypto’s borderless nature allows it to function as a global store of value, unbound by the inefficiencies of the traditional banking system. Unlike fiat currencies, which rely on fragmented financial infrastructure and jurisdictional restrictions, cryptocurrency moves seamlessly across the internet, unrestricted by national borders. As inflation accelerates and trust in fiat currencies erodes, people seek alternatives to safeguard their wealth. Gold has long served this purpose, but bitcoin presents unique advantages: it is digital, highly portable and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. For those looking to hedge against monetary debasement, bitcoin stands as a resilient defense against both inflation and currency devaluation. While some altcoins may offer short-term storage of value, their long-term reliability is questionable, making them far too risky to serve as a stable hedge over any meaningful time horizon. A major shift has occurred in recent years as institutional investors recognize bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. With the approval of bitcoin ETFs and firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and BNY Mellon integrating bitcoin into their offerings, institutional participation has surged. This growing demand from institutions adds credibility to bitcoin as a financial asset and strengthens its role as an inflation hedge. Large-scale adoption by hedge funds, corporations, and governments will dampen price volatility and reinforce bitcoin’s value proposition as a long-term store of wealth. Gold and real estate have long been considered inflation hedges, but they have limitations. Gold is difficult to transport and verify, while real estate requires significant capital and lacks liquidity. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer an alternative that combines the scarcity of gold with the accessibility of digital assets. While bitcoin is the primary inflation hedge, it is not impossible that other cryptos may one day offer alternative strategies to hedging inflation risk. While crypto presents a compelling alternative to fiat, it is not without risks. Investors must consider the following challenges before relying on digital assets as an inflation hedge. Cryptocurrency markets are known for extreme price swings. While bitcoin has appreciated significantly over the long term, it has also experienced sharp drawdowns, sometimes losing 50% or more of its purchasing power in short periods. For investors seeking stability, bitcoin’s volatility can a drawback. However, volatility is not equivalent to risk. One would expect prices to stabilize as bitcoin is widely adopted and liquidity deepens. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s most critical property—monetary integrity—is already established. Unlike fiat currencies, where inflation is a certainty, bitcoin’s fixed supply ensures that its inflation risk is effectively zero. Governments and regulatory agencies continue to grapple with how to classify and control cryptocurrencies. While some countries embrace bitcoin as legal tender or an investment asset, others impose restrictions or outright bans. Regulatory uncertainty can affect price stability and investor confidence. While bitcoin’s decentralized design makes it resistant to outright bans, policies affecting on-ramps (such as exchanges) can still restrict access to it. Bitcoin has, at times, shown correlation with equities, particularly during market selloffs. However, this correlation is situational rather than structural, driven by short-term liquidity crises. When investors need cash quickly, they sell what they can, and bitcoin, as a 24/7 liquid asset, is often included in that category. A study of bitcoin’s correlation with major financial assets from 2013 to 2021 found that it is correlated with risk assets over long time periods, with significant short-term deviations. Recently, this has begun to change. In 2024, bitcoin’s correlation with tech stocks was found to be moderate-to-strong on only 10 out of 262 trading days. Bottom Line Crypto, and particularly bitcoin, offers a unique hedge against inflation due to its fixed supply, decentralization and lack of correlation with other assets. While traditional assets like gold remain relevant, bitcoin is also used as an inflation hedge in the 21st century economy. As inflation continues to erode fiat currencies, bitcoin’s role as an inflation hedge is likely to grow, reinforcing its value proposition as "digital gold." Bitcoin is often compared to gold because it shares key characteristics: it is a bearer asset with widespread recognizeability and a limited supply. However, bitcoin also offers advantages over gold. It is more portable, easy to verify and resistant to censorship. Stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, meaning they do not hedge against the inflation of whichever currency they are pegged to. However, in economies with failing local currencies, people may choose to preserve their wealth using stablecoins pegged to stronger currencies, usually the U.S. dollar. Both assets serve as inflation hedges, but bitcoin offers advantages such as digital portability, ease of transfer and predictable supply. Gold has a longer history, but bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a store of value for the digital age. Bitcoin can be a useful hedge against inflation, but its price volatility means it should be part of a diversified strategy. Investors should conduct thorough research, assess their risk tolerance and may choose to invest carefully over time using dollar-cost averaging. One Community. Many Voices.

[+] sovereign wealth fund reveals a huge bet on bitcoin. Abu Dhabi’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund purchased $436 million worth of BlackRock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) during the final quarter of last year, according to a regulatory filing. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock’s $60 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), giving those holding it exposure to its near-600,000 bitcoin. In recent months, rumor and speculation has swirled that countries and their wealth funds are secretly buying bitcoin, helped by explosive comments from BlackRock’s chief executive in January. “Only scratching the surface, buckle up,” David Bailey, the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher Bitcoin Inc who advised the Trump election campaign on bitcoin strategy and organzied Trump’s July appearance at a bitcoin conference where he first promised to create a bitcoin strategic reserve, posted to X. “Abu Dhabi has gone in much bigger than today’s filing,” Bailey added. “There’s a couple other GCC members that are making moves too,” referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council that includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Abu Dhabi’s United Arab Emirates. “I told you the race was on,” bitcoin-backing U.S. senator Cynthia Lummis posted to X in response to Abu Dhabi 's filing. “It’s time for America to win.” Lummis, a Republican senator from Wyoming, last year introduced The Bitcoin Act to Congress, calling for the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve to reduce the U.S.'s spiraling, near-$36 trillion national debt by buying 1 million bitcoin over five years.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks has teased “important announcements are coming soon" after confirming the Trump administration is exploring the feasibility of a national reserve of bitcoin, similar to the U.S.’s oil and gold reserves. "That is one of the first things we’re going to look at as part of the internal working group in the administration," Sacks said of a potential bitcoin reserve at a press conference earlier this month. Sacks has posted to X that “the inter-agency working group on digital assets is working well together to implement the president’s agenda.” One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Letters: GAA players will abandon the game if they continue to be denied a fair share

It costs hurlers, and footballers, to play for their counties. Photo: Sportsfile The startling report by Frank Roche (‘Net zero cost for players is the GPA goal… or else GAA’s amateur status is at risk’, Irish Independent, February 13) is most alarming. An independent report commiss­ioned by the Gaelic Players Association (GPA) and produced by Indecon on their behalf found individual GAA players incur an average net expense loss of €4,602 a year to participate at inter-county level. GPA chief executive, former Mayo midfielder Tom Parsons, predicted that unless the Government and Croke Park step up to ensure inter-county players, male and female, no longer have to pay for the privilege, a growing number will turn their backs on the county game. It’s hard to blame them when they take such a serious hit to the pocket. Many counties are contracting ever-growing management teams on lucrative financial deals, while the GAA players run the risk of injury every time they tog out. When these county players see large management teams being richly rewarded for their time in an amateur sport while they lose thousands of euro on an annual basis, is it any wonder they are inclined to revolt. And who can blame them for looking for their fair share of the national cake? Tom Towey, Cloonacool, Co Sligo When news of the “Blackrock scandal” appeared, I wrote letters to three national newspapers asking a simple question: “What type of applicants for the priesthood were rejected?” Only one paper, the Irish Independent, published my letter and nobody provided an answer. I’m now asking again. Mattie Lennon, Blessington, Co Wicklow The provision of an adequate supply of new houses and apartments is going to be critical to this Government over the next five years. This administration has projected that 300,000 new units will be built over the next five years. There are many commentators who think this number will not be enough or that we will never get to that level of construction. I found the recent report from Mitchell McDermott Construction Consultants to be rather damning. In essence, this consultancy firm is asking what the chances are of getting to 300,000 builds over the next five years, especially if one were to base the number on what has been happening in the last couple of years. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Labour leader Ivana Bacik has come under fire from some quarters for her reasonable demand to solve the housing crisis by incurring debt. The fact is, since independence, this is how public housing has been provided and many more government services to the people. The Republic of Ireland has a very good record in international finan­ces, in particular with the IMF. It is totally misleading and erroneous to state each Irish citizen owes even one cent of national debt. The national debt of €224bn is minuscule compared with the UK at £2.7tn and US at $36tn. A government cannot be run like a household – if it was, many nations would not have clean water, proper sewage disposal, health services and much more. Empirical evidence trumps propaganda any day. Declan Foley, Melbourne, Australia If Ireland’s universities continue down a profit-driven path, students may soon graduate with more experience in corporate finance than in their actual fields of study (‘As colleges become cash cows, students get milked dry’, Irish Independent, February 14). The creeping commercialisation of higher education means degrees now come with price tags that overshadow their true value, while teaching staff are treated as disposable. At this rate, the best lesson students will learn is how to fend for themselves in an institution that increasingly resembles a business park rather than a place of learning. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran, Armagh On August 15, 1998, a beautiful day, I went for my usual daily swim off Tramore beach, Rosbeg, Co Donegal. On my way home to Glenties at around 3pm, I remember well listening to the radio and hearing the sickening news of bombs going off on Omagh’s main street. Now, 26 years later, I’m listening every day to the horrific stories from various people who were caught up in that evil act. How impossible it is to hold back the tears. What more can one say? Man’s inhumanity to man. Brian McDevitt, Glenties, Co Donegal I agree with your editorial that the Taoiseach’s visit to Washington and, presumably, to the White House, should be an opportunity to promote peace (‘Taoiseach can use St Patrick’s visit to US to promote peace’ – Irish Independent, February 13). I would avoid all mention of Trump’s beautiful word, “tariffs”, and focus on peace and how Ireland itself is the beneficiary of the great contribution of the US in achieving peace and prosperity. The G word, “great”, should be the trigger at every opportunity for our Taoiseach, should he meet with President Trump. First and foremost, it is an opportunity to congratulate Trump on his “great” victory. Micheál Martin should repeat that word “great” as often as possible, including his great efforts with the ceasefire in Gaza and his great efforts in pushing Putin and Zelensky to negotiate, even if Trump is trying to tie Ukraine’s hands. I sense a slight disappointment in Europe that Trump is acting the big man in all things Gaza and Ukraine. We should never forget that the US also needs Europe to secure its own prosperity and security. Ending the bloodshed is worth giving peace a chance. A great price has already been paid by both Ukraine and Russia. Should we not be happy if Trump can help achieve a way out for both parties?

Title: Meet The Peter Thiel Acolytes in Donald Trump’s 2nd Administration

Editor Tech Derrick Broze, Independent media alliance, The Last American Vagabond As we approach the third week of Donald Trump’s 2nd presidential term, it is once again clear that Peter Thiel is having an outsized influence on the administration. Peter Thiel is the infamous co-founder of Palantir, the “private” surveillance firm with a long history of involvement and collaboration with the CIA. Thiel is also a Steering Committee Member of the Bilderberg Group, the infamously secretive group which represents the interests of the hidden ruling class. Now, in the second Trump administration, Thiel’s influence is more visible than ever as numerous associates and acolytes of his are set to play various influential roles. I’ve previously reported how Thiel and others in the right-wing of Big Tech decided to go all-in on Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. They argued that this was a defensive move to protect their industries from the encroachment of the Biden/Harris administration. However, despite the hesitance of many of the Silicon Valley CEO’s to embrace Trump in 2016 and 2020, Thiel has a long history of supporting the two-time president. In 2016, Thiel donated $1.25 million to Donald Trump’s first presidential campaign. Despite claiming to have tired of politics and not publicly supporting Trump in 2020 and 2024, Thiel was absolutely a behind-the-scenes advocate for a 2nd Trump term. While speaking at the All In Summit in early October 2024, Thiel claimed that while he was not donating money to any political candidate, he was still supporting Donald Trump and now-Vice President JD Vance “in every other way possible”. “I am still very strongly pro-Trump, pro-J.D.,” Thiel said. Peter Thiel States He Is Still Supporting Donald Trump and JD VanceWhile speaking at the All In Summit, Peter Thiel claimed that he is not donating money to any political candidate in 2024, but is still supporting Donald Trump and JD Vance "in every other way possible". pic.twitter.com/Gt4ak1OIag Despite his years long embrace of Donald Trump, it is also worth noting that Thiel collaborated with the Biden administration. In 2021, I reported on how the Biden administration was receiving criticism for continuing Trump’s plans for a border wall in the form of a “virtual” or biometric wall. One of the contractors for the virtual wall was Anduril Industries, founded by Trump donor Palmer Luckey with funding from Peter Thiel. The message was clear — whether with Trump, Biden, or Harris the U.S. is getting a biometric surveillance state with Digital IDs. Fast forward to 2025, and now that Trump and Vance are occupying the White House, numerous Thiel-affiliated companies are expected to see a big boost in financial revenue. For example, recently Thiel’s Palantir and Anduril, as well as SpaceX and OpenAI, announced a partnership on U.S. military contracts. The move marks the latest efforts by the Technocrats to replace the old guard of the Military Industrial Complex — companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing. This article is a brief look at the many Thiel-connected members of President Donald Trump’s 2nd cabinet. This list is not exhaustive and should be updated with time as more disciples of the Thielverse come into play. Despite not giving directly to the 2024 Trump campaign, Thiel has gained well-deserved scrutiny for his role in financing the rise of Vice President J.D. Vance. Vance, the 40-year-old former Ohio Senator, was in attendance at David Sacks’ June 2024 fundraiser for Trump. Sacks is the partner of Craft Ventures, the former Chief Operating Officer of PayPal. According to “two people with knowledge of the exchange”, during the June event Trump “informally polled the room” regarding who he should choose for his Vice Presidential running mate. David Sacks, Chamath Palihapitiya, and others all told Trump he should choose Vance. Elon Musk also reportedly encouraged Trump to pick Vance. A few weeks later at the Republican National Convention that’s exactly what Donald Trump did. Thiel and Vance have an extensive relationship. Vance claims that after hearing Peter Thiel deliver a speech at Yale Law School in 2011 he was inspired to pursue a career in big tech firms. He started as a junior investor with the Thiel-backed Mithril Capital in 2016. Vance briefly worked at biotechnology firm Circuit Therapeutics, a move which then-CEO Frederic Moll told the NY Times was a “favor to Peter.” In 2019, Vance would found his own venture firm, Narya Capital, with financial backing from the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, the billionaire investor Marc Andreessen, and, of course, Peter Thiel. When Vance announced his run for Ohio Senator, Peter Thiel was there and gave $15 million to the campaign. With this money Vance was able to secure a victory and within two years he was on the way to the White House with the full support of Thiel and other technocrats. While Musk is a powerful and influential technocrat in his own right — choosing to maintain a more public personality than that of Thiel — he and Thiel have their own history of collaboration. Elon Musk and Peter Thiel have been friends for more than two decades and both men received massive financial wealth from their co-founding of PayPal. Thiel has also been a prominent investor in Musk’s various ventures, including Neuralink. People keep saying that X is a "Free Speech" space.Everyone should know that Elon and X are completely inundated within the Peter Thiel Capital Web. Elon Musk, first involved with Peter Thiel when his online banking site https://t.co/01wzux4BwW (not this platform!) was… pic.twitter.com/QzmZXUh2Xz Musk and Peter Thiel also co-founded “America PAC” as their vehicle to support Trump’s return to the White House. In July 2024 it was initially reported that Musk would invest $45 million a month into the Trump campaign. In the end, Musk would give nearly $75 million to the PAC. As promised, Trump nominated Musk to lead the “Department of Government Efficiency”. While the idea of reducing government waste and increasing efficiency is an appealing proposition, it should also be noted that Musk’s talk of efficiency is reminiscent of the little known Efficiency Movement which predated the more well-known Technocracy movement. The Efficiency Movement sought to identify and eliminate waste in all areas of the economy and society, and to develop and implement “best practices”. Supporters of the movement included Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller was a proponent of efficiency, stating, “To help an inefficient, ill-located, unnecessary school is a waste …it is highly probable that enough money has been squandered on unwise educational projects to have built up a national system of higher education adequate to our needs, if the money had been properly directed to that end.” Is the goal of Trump and Elon to make government more efficient to serve the people? Or, is the goal to finally fulfill the dream of the original technocrats and eliminate the political and business classes in favor of “machines” (Artificial Intelligence), centrally planning, and managing society? Time will tell. David Sacks is most well-known for his involvement in the early days of PayPal, serving as the COO with Thiel as the CEO. He is considered a member of the so-called “PayPal Mafia”, a name given to the founders of PayPal who later founded numerous tech companies, including Tesla, LinkedIn, Palantir Technologies, SpaceX, YouTube, and Yelp. In 1998, Thiel and Sacks co-authored the book, The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus, arguing that political correctness has harmed the college education system and academia in general. The book expanded on the pair’s writings in The Stanford Review, a student-run newspaper founded by Thiel and Sacks in 1987. Peter Thiel and Sacks would later apologize for statements made in the book which belittled rape. In June 2024, Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya hosted a fundraiser for Trump at Sacks’ home in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. The meeting netted the Trump campaign $12 million after Trump reportedly said he would be “the crypto president”. It was this dinner where the billionaires told Trump he should choose Vance as his running mate. Shortly after his victory in the 2024 election, Trump rewarded Sacks for his loyalty by appointing him as the “AI and Crypto Czar”. In this position Sacks is expected to greatly influence the U.S. government’s policies on cryptocurrency, and the advancement of AI. Howard Lutnick is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald investment firm and has become a vocal proponent for Bitcoin in the last couple years. Lutnick is also an investor in anti-ESG Strive Asset Management, which was founded by Vivek Ramaswamy. Peter Thiel, the Founders Fund, and J.D. Vance’s Narya Capital also contributed to Strive’s $30 million funding round. Lutnick is also a part owner of video platform Rumble, founded by Chris Pavlovski. In December 2021, Pavlovski announced his intention to take Rumble public by combining forces with CF Acquisition Corp, a division of the Lutnick’s Cantor Fitzgerald. The deal was completed by September 2022 with CF Acquisition Corp providing “approximately $400 million in gross proceeds” to help “build out Rumble’s independent infrastructure”. “With its massive growth in users and engagement, this is an exciting time for Rumble to become public. I am excited to see ‘RUM’ shares trading in the marketplace,” Lutnick said at the time of the deal. Following Rumble becoming a publicly traded company, the top institutional share holders include Cantor Fitzgerald, Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Rockefeller Capital Management, among others. In August 2024 I reported on Howard Lutnick’s appearance at the 2024 Bitcoin Nashville event and his involvement in the Bitcoin community more broadly. During his own speech at Bitcoin Nashville, Trump called Lutnick “one of the truly brilliant men of Wall Street”. That Trump sees Lutnick — one of the most high profile traders of U.S. debt and a Wall Street regular — as a brilliant man is likely a sign that Wall Street banks will continue to influence U.S. financial policy under Trump’s 2nd administration. Lutnick was also formerly a neighbor to Jeffrey Epstein in NYC and raised millions for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential campaign. Lutnick has spoken at the World Economic Forum’s various meetings as far back as 2016 and as recently as January 2023. At the 2023 WEF meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Lutnick participated in a panel titled, Real Estate at a Turning Point. Another interesting facet of Lutnick’s personal story is that Cantor Fitzgerald’s offices were located in the 101st to the 105th floors of One World Trade Center. The firm lost 658 of its 960 employees due to the terrorist attack. However, Lutnick happened to be accompanying his wife as she took their son to his first day of kindergarten. Donald Trump has appointed Jim O’Neill as deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). O’Neill has extensive connections and collaborations with Peter Thiel. O’Neill worked at two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Clarium Capital and Mithril Capital Management from 2012 to 2019. In 2010, he co-founded Peter Thiel‘s Thiel Fellowship. He also worked as the CEO of the Thiel Foundation from 2009 to 2012. From 2019 to July 2021, O’Neill was the CEO of SENS Research Foundation, an organization focused on “rejuvenation”. The SENS received its initial funding from Peter Thiel in 2006 and 2008, a fact that should come as no surprise given Thiel’s own interest in fighting aging using the blood of the young. Whitney Webb recently wrote a detailed investigation further outlining O’Neill’s connections to Thiel and how his appointment might be used to stifle Robert F. Kennedy Jr. if his nomination is confirmed in the coming weeks. Trump named Ken Howery as his pick for U.S. ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark. Howery previously served as a U.S. ambassador to Sweden, and Trump wrote that he “served our Nation brilliantly” in that role. The connections between Howery, Peter Thiel, and the World Economic Forum run deep. Apparently, Trump sees those connections as a net positive. Howery was another PayPal co-founder with Thiel. The pair also co-founded the venture capital fund Founders Fund. In March 2012, the WEF named Howery a member of the Young Global Leader program. He is also a member of the Selection Committee for the World Economic Forum Technology Pioneers Program. Howery may have been selected for the role of ambassador to Denmark to help Trump fulfill his goal of annexing Greenland. Denmark has administrative control over Greenland as part of its kingdom. Interestingly, Trump’s calls for purchasing Greenland and making it part of the United States mirrors the original Technocrats plan for the “Technate of America”, including Canada and Panama as well. Jacob Helberg was appointed to be undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment. Helberg donated $2 million to Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. He is an ardent supporter of Israel and a former supporter of Democrats who has said his shift to Trump was a result of Democrats becoming “anti-Israel”. While the Democrats also support Israel and generally vote to give the nation unlimited funding and weapons stockpiles, Helberg believes they are not sufficiently obedient. Helberg is also a senior adviser to Palantir Technologies, the private surveillance firm co-founded by Peter Thiel. Helberg also is also senior advisor to Alex Karp, Thiel’s co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. Donald Trump has named Michael Kratsios to serve as science adviser and director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios also served in the role in the first Trump White House and the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. Kratsios led the 1st Trump admin’s policy specialist on artificial intelligence, drones, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. Kratsios worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital. Although Vivek Ramaswamy is no longer involved in DOGE, he is still in Trump’s orbit and has announced a run for Governor of Ohio. It would not be surprising to see Peter Thiel invest in his political campaign. Thiel previously invested in Ramaswamy’s fund, Strive Asset Management. Trae Stephens is a partner at venture capital firm Founders Fund, which was organized by Peter Thiel, Ken Howery, and Luke Nosek in early 2005. Stephens is also the co-founder and chair of Anduril Industries, which was funded by Peter Thiel. Finally, Stephens worked for Thiel’s Palantir Technologies. According to Bloomberg,Trump and his team have consulted with Trae Stephens. Politico has also previously reported that Shyam Sankar, current Palantir chief technology officer, has been considered for the Pentagon’s top research and engineering job. Finally, Blake Masters, who worked for Thiel Capital and for the Thiel Foundation, was reportedly up for nomination as Trump’s head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) at one point. Alex Karp is the co-founder of Palantir Technologies Inc. Karp co-founded Palantir with fellow technocrat Peter Thiel with the assistance of two rounds of investment from CIA’s venture capital firm In-Q-Tel. Karp is also a steering committee member of the Bilderberg Group. While Karp has mostly stayed out of politics in the public sphere, in 2024 he told the NYT that he was now supporting Kamala Harris. While Karp has traditionally supported Progressive politicians and described himself as a radical leftist, and Thiel has supported Conservative politicians, both men are now united in the support of the Trump administration. While there may be real political differences between Karp and Thiel, there is not daylight between the two when it comes to Technocratic solutions. Karp recently told Fox Business how Palantir is ready and willing to help make the U.S. government “more efficient”. Karp is also an open advocate for supporting the Zionist movement. Researcher James Corbett recently noted that, “in November of last year, Palantir issued a letter to shareholders that stressed the company’s support for Israel’s quest to ethnically cleanse Palestinians.” “We are one of a few companies in the world to stand up and announce our support for Israel, which remains steadfast,” Karp wrote in the letter. “Palantir stands with Israel.” Thiel has also made it clear he will not interfere in Israel’s crimes and has no qualms supplying technology which leads to civilian deaths. First, in January 2024 Palantir announced that it had signed a “strategic partnership” with the Israeli Defense Ministry to supply technology for the genocide. In May 2024, protesters accused Thiel of complicity in ‘genocide’, blocking his vehicles for over an hour while he was speaking at the Cambridge Union. Over two hundred students gathered outside the Cambridge Union attempting to “drown out” Thiel’s talk. When Thiel was directly questioned about his support of Israel and their use of AI technology to murder humans, he gave a rambling non-answer. “Look again . . . I’m not . . . I’m not . . . you know, you know . . . with . . . without, without going into all the . . . you know I’m not on top of all the details of what’s going on in Israel, because my bias is to defer to Israel. It’s not for us to to second-guess every, everything. And I believe that broadly the IDF gets to decide what it wants to do, and that they’re broadly in the right and that’s, that’s sort of the perspective I come back to.” When Thiel was asked about #Palantir using its artificial intelligence to help the IDF commit genocide: https://t.co/UCnXCNIu4h pic.twitter.com/BhPh9LVBca Given that Karp and Thiel are willing to turn a blind eye to the crimes of Israel, it should come as no surprise that Trump’s 2nd cabinet is stacked with former and current associates of Thiel’s who also share this zeal for Zionism and Technocracy. Now that we understand the depths at which Peter Thiel’s influence can be seen and felt in the Trump administration, we must ask — who exactly is influencing Peter Thiel’s actions and thinking? In my next article I will dive deeper into the role that Curtis Yarvin aka Mencius Moldbug has played in influencing Peter Thiel and the MAGA movement in general. While the majority of Trump supporters and mainstream Republicans might not be aware of the philosophy of this man, his thinking continues to inspire and inform the actions of the Technocrats like Peter Thiel, J.D. Vance, and Marc Andreesen. Tech Tech Tech Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

During the fourth quarter of last year, Mubadala scooped up $436 million worth of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, according to a quarterly report disclosing U.S. equity ownership filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Totaling 8.2 million in shares of the Nasdaq-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, it appeared that Friday’s disclosure represented a fresh investment by Mubadala in the product. A filing from the previous quarter did not disclose holdings in BlackRock’s $56.3 billion spot Bitcoin ETF. Mubadala did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt. As President Donald Trump’s administration mulls the prospect of a so-called strategic crypto reserve, which may include Bitcoin alongside other cryptocurrencies, some market participants described Mubadala’s move as indicative of an emerging race on a global scale. “Other countries have started moving,” Swan’s Head of Private Clients and Family Offices Steven Lubka said on X (formerly Twitter). Several governments already hold Bitcoin, including the U.S., China, the United Kingdom, and El Salvador, according to CoinGecko. However, the crypto data aggregator noted in an August report that the $32.7 billion sum largely stems from seizures related to criminal activity. As one of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi is part of a growing crypto sector in the Middle East. Last summer, the Blockchain Center in Abu Dhabi launched, saying it “will focus on creating a thriving ecosystem that supports startups, enterprises, and academic institutions through a range of comprehensive services and initiatives.” Though the U.S. may assert itself as a Bitcoin backer through Trump’s proposed stockpile, plenty of states have pushed for investing in cryptocurrencies on their own. While two states have rejected Bitcoin reserve bills, similar legislation is either pending or actively being considered in 21 states, according to Bitcoin Reserve Monitor.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Get $2 Million Boost From National Bank Of Canada

The National Bank of Canada has ventured boldly into the realm of cryptocurrencies. The bank has made $2 million investments in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), changing the way conventional finance views digital assets. This choice emphasizes the evolving scene of controlled crypto investments and the increasing institutional curiosity in Bitcoin. The National Bank of Canada decided on ETFs instead of directly purchasing Bitcoin, following a pattern among financial institutions looking for controlled access to the digital asset. By means of Bitcoin ETFs, one can invest in Bitcoin free from the complications of direct ownership, including security of private keys or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. This investment also coincides with a period of erratic BTC prices, which have lately ranged between $95,000-$97k. 🚨 National Bank of Canada Invests $2M in Bitcoin ETFs 🇨🇦💰 Canada’s sixth-largest commercial bank ($462B in assets) just made a bold move into Bitcoin, purchasing $2M worth of Bitcoin ETFs. 🏦 Institutional adoption is accelerating, with traditional financial giants deepening… pic.twitter.com/aLuBGjUbed — Blockchain North (@BlockchaiNorth) February 13, 2025 Regarding the reception of Bitcoin ETF, Canada is setting the benchmark. The action of the National Bank of Canada is in line with those of other big multinational companies like as BlackRock, which lately started the iShares BTC Trust in the US. The growing participation of conventional banks and asset managers suggests that Bitcoin is starting to acquire popularity as a choice of investment. Despite the surrounding buzz, detractors of ETFs contend they do not provide the advantages of direct Bitcoin ownership. Although ETFs depend on outside custodians, direct ownership of the cryptocurrencies gives investors total control over their money. ETF investments often come with management fees that could cut possible returns. Still, the National Bank of Canada seems to consider ETFs as a safer, more readily available way to expose to Bitcoin free from direct ownership and related legal concerns. Bitcoin’s increasing engagement with the financial sector suggests that digital assets are gradually becoming a part of traditional finance. If additional businesses follow suit, crypto acceptance might increase even more, which would improve its price and market dynamics. The National Bank of Canada’s $2 million investment, albeit tiny at the moment, reflects a broader trend of mainstream financial actors adopting Bitcoin as a long-term asset. As interest in Bitcoin ETFs grows, it is uncertain whether other banks will follow suit, potentially bridging the gap between traditional banking and the cryptocurrency market.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: AIL previews: Clontarf and Cork Con clash could affect course of season

Turning into the homeward straight of this season’s AIL, the meeting of third-placed Clontarf and leaders Cork Con at Castle Avenue is a meeting of two heavyweights that will probably have a significant impact on the playoff picture. Clontarf (43 points) trail Con (47 points) by four points with a game in hand and rarely lose two in a row. They’re also strengthened by the return of two frontrow stalwarts of recent years in loosehead Ivan Soroka and prolific hooker Dylan Donnellan, both of whom missed last week’s defeat in Young Munster, as well as the Connacht and ex-Ireland Sevens flyer Andrew Smith at fullback. However, the champions are unbeaten in eight. They also welcome back experienced centre Niall Kenneally after his seasonal reappearance off the bench last week. Rob Jermyn shifts to the wing, and Matthew Bowen returns at fullback, while lock Eoin Quilter and flanker Seán Duffy are recalled. Another game of major significance is between sixth and seventh, namely Lansdowne and Young Munster (each on 36 points) on the Aviva back pitch in what looks like a must-win tie for both to retain their playoff hopes. Lansdowne, who’ve won three of their last four, are unchanged, whereas Young Munster are without three of their Munster contingent – Shay McCarthy, Jake O’Riordan and Evan O’Connell – and Adam McBurney. That said, they do have Ruadhán Quinn, who scored two tries last week. The Terenure exodus continues, with Conor Phillips rejoining the Ireland Sevens and Chris Cosgrave going to Japan as a medical joker. Spanish under-20 centre Yago Fernandez makes his first start, with Jules Fenelon recalled on the wing, while Adam La Grue reverts to fullback and Aran Egan to outhalf as Caspar Gabriel is on Leinster duty this weekend. Sitting second on 45 points and unbeaten in seven, Terenure travel to City of Armagh, who are without two casualties from last week in goal-kicking fullback Kyle Faloon and centre Matthew Hookes. Armagh’s results haven’t reflected their competitiveness. Last week’s 31-19 loss away to Con was actually their heaviest of the season and they haven’t lost a home game by more than four points and beat Terenure away in October A very settled St Mary’s will look to return to winning ways at home to UCD, who will be without the Leinster trio of Ben Brownlee, Diarmuid Mangan and James Culhane this week. Mikey Yarr starts at hooker as Bobby Sheehan, with nine tries this season, moves to number eight. Garryowen have picked Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks at fullback, while Kelvin Langan starts at No 10 at home to playoff chasing Ballynahinch, who welcome back Ulster and Ireland Sevens winger Zac Ward. Old Belvedere (59 points) can take a giant stride towards the 1B title and automatic promotion at home to third-placed Old Wesley (43). Similarly, an experienced Instonians (53 points) can tighten their grip on 2A and a fourth successive promotion at home to the youthful Corinthians (49), who have played a game more in second. Last October Corinthians inflicted one of only four defeats on Instonians in their last 48 AIL matches, in which they have registered 46 offensive bonus points. Saturday (kick-off 2.30 unless stated) Energia All-Ireland League Men Division 1A: City of Armagh v Terenure College, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v Cork Constitution, Castle Avenue; Garryowen v Ballynahinch, Dooradoyle; Lansdowne v Young Munster, Aviva Stadium back pitch; St. Mary’s College v UCD, Templeville Road.

Title: ‘AI may become judge, jury and executioner’ – global risks expert to RT
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/612575-ai-may-become-judge/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T18:55:24Z

Last week, Google revised its artificial intelligence principles, removing the company’s stance against using AI to develop weapons or technologies or directly facilitate injury to people, or for surveillance that violates internationally accepted norms. Google’s AI head Demis Hassabis said the guidelines were being overhauled in a changing world and that AI should protect “national security”. RT has interviewed Dr. Mathew Maavak, a senior consultant for Malaysia’s National Artificial Intelligence Roadmap 2021-2025 (AI-Rmap), scholar on global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and AI, on the potential consequences of Google’s new policies. RT: Does this mean that Google and other corporations will now start making AI-powered weapons? Dr. Mathew Maavak: First and foremost, Google was largely the creation of the US national security apparatus or simply, the “deep state”.The origins of many, if not all, Big Tech entities today can be traced to ground-breaking research undertaken by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its predecessor the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). So, the quasi-private entity called Google is inextricably beholden to its “national security” origins, as are other Big Tech entities. Weaponizing AI and creating AI-powered weapons is a natural progression for these entities. Microsoft has long established its own “military empire”. Furthermore, Big Tech platforms have been extensively used for data and intelligence-gathering activities worldwide. This is a reason why China has banned many US Big Tech software and apps. A nation cannot be sovereign if it is beholden to Big Tech! As for Google changing its guidelines on AI, this should not come as a surprise. Big Tech was actively promoting universal AI governance models through various high-profile institutional shills, United Nations agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), think tanks and national governments. Through my recent work in this field, it became abundantly clear that the US government sought to stifle the development of indigenous AI worldwide by promoting half-baked and turgid AI Governance models that are riddled with contradictions. The gap between lofty aspirations and longstanding realities are simply unbridgeable. The same playbook was deployed to push Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) schemes worldwide – imposing heavy costs on developing nations and corporations alike. Now, the US and Big Capital are ditching the very ESG schemes they had devised. Unfortunately, many nations fell for these ploys, investing significant money and resources into building fanciful ESG and AI frameworks. These nations risk becoming permanently dependent on Big Tech under what I call “AI neo-colonialism”. Alphabet’s Google and YouTube, Microsoft’s Bing and Elon Musk’s X have long weaponized their platforms before this recent change in AI policy. Big Tech’s search algorithms have been weaponized to erase dissenters and contrarian platforms from the digital landscape, effectively imposing a modern-day damnatio memoriae.I have to use the Russian search engine Yandex in order to retrieve my old articles. RT: Why is this change being made now? Dr. Mathew Maavak: All weapons systems increasingly rely on AI. The Russia-Ukrainian conflict alone has seen AI being used in the battlefield. The extensive use of drones, with possible swarm intelligence capabilities, is just one out of many anecdotal examples of AI usage in Ukraine. You cannot create next-generation weapons and countermeasures without AI. You cannot bring a knife to a gunfight, as the old saying goes. It must be noted that one of the most profitable and future-proof sectors, with guaranteed returns on investments, is the Military-Industrial Complex. Weaponizing AI and making AI-powered weapons is just a natural course of action for Big Tech. It is also quite telling that the leaders of the two AI superpowers — the United States and China — skipped the recent Paris AI Summit. The event devolved into a scripted talk shop orchestrated by Big Tech. Alongside the United Kingdom, the United States also refused to sign the declaration on making AI “safe for all.” Clearly, this event was staged to suppress AI innovation in developing nations while legitimizing the weaponization of AI by major powers. RT: Google’s ‘principles’, to begin with, are set by Google itself, are voluntary and non-binding under any law. So theoretically nothing was preventing the company from just going ahead with any kind of AI research it wanted. Why did it feel the need to make it “official”? Dr. Mathew Maavak: Google’s so-called “principles” were never determined by the company alone. They were a mere sop for public consumption, perfectly encapsulated by its laughably cynical motto: “Don’t be evil.” Its parent company Alphabet is owned by the usual suspects from Big Capital such as Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street etc. – all of whom are private arms of the US deep state. An entity like Google cannot conduct “any kind of AI research” as its activities have to conform to the diktats of its primary stakeholders. Google formalized its new weaponization policy because the public’s stake in its ownership pie is virtually nonexistent. RT: Is it time to come up with international laws regarding military AI – like Google’s principles before the recent change, but enforceable? Dr. Mathew Maavak: As I have alluded to earlier, various international AI Governance models – all of whom are pretty much a facsimile of each other – were surreptitiously-formulated by the likes of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and other members of the so-called Tech Bros. Nations were just given the illusion of having a stake in this global AI legal and ethics matrix. Bureaucrats merely rubber-stamped whatever Big Tech promoted through various actors and avenues. At the same time, dissenters to this travesty were systematically ostracised. They may however end up having the last laugh in a coming AI-linked SHTF event. (I will save this line of inquiry for another day). There are other vexing issues to consider here: How does one define “AI war crime” within an international legal framework? Is it even possible to come up with a universal consensus? The operator of an armed drone responsible for wiping out scores of civilians might pin the disaster on an AI glitch. The software running the drone itself may have algorithms sourced from various private entities across the world. Who should shoulder the blame in the event of a war crime? The operator, the vendor responsible for software integration or the entity whose algorithm was used or adapted for targeting? Realistically, it should be the antagonist nation but never bet the farm on restitution if the culprit happens to be the United States or a close ally like Israel. Last but not least, governments worldwide acted as co-conspirators in Google’s use of AI to censor dissenting scientific viewpoints and contrarian research findings during the so-called COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, they have effectively handed Big Tech permanent leverage to blackmail them. Furthermore, what do you think facilitates a welter of bioweapons research across 400-odd US military-linked laboratories worldwide? Gain-of-function microbial experimentation is not possible without AI. RT: AI tools in non-military areas of life, such as generation of texts or images, are still far from perfect. Isn’t it a bit early to rely on them in warfare? Dr. Mathew Maavak: The generation of AI texts and images can absolutely be used for warfare, and this is already becoming a significant concern in modern conflict scenarios. AI-generated content can be weaponized via AI-generated texts (propaganda, disinformation etc); AI-generated images/deepfakes (e.g. to subvert national leaderships/consensus); fake intelligence (e.g.create casus belli) and spoofing communications (e.g. subverting chain of command), among others. The possibilities here are simply endless! AI is evolving at an exponential rate. Yesterday’s science fiction is tomorrow’s reality! RT: As reported recently by the Washington Post, Google appears to have been providing AI tools for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since the start of their Gaza campaign. Could the change in the company’s AI principles be linked to that? Dr. Mathew Maavak: I highly doubt it. The IDF’s use of Google’s cloud computing services and related tools (Amazon was teased as an alternative) may arguably be portrayed as the canonical starting point for the weaponization of AI. But why would the IDF want a multinational civilian workforce based in the United States to have access to its military operations? If Google provided AI tools to the IDF, it would have done so under directives from the US deep state. A nominally civilian entity cannot unilaterally supply sensitive AI tools for wartime use to any foreign power, allied or otherwise. Logically speaking, Google’s participation in the Gazan carnage should result in a massive boycott by member states of the Organization of Islamic States (OIC). But this will never happen as too many politicians, “technocrats” and academics in the OIC are beholden to US patronage. (The ongoing USAID scandal is just the tip of the iceberg, revealing the extent of international subversion at play). The rail guards of merit, bias and non-discrimination are also virtually non-existent in the OIC bloc, although they form the pillars of AI governance. All in all, AI principles as they currently stand, whether in civilian or military spheres, are nothing more than a paper tiger. RT: Again concerning the IDF, it has beenrevealed that a lot of the civilian deaths in Gaza were apparently not a result of poor AI tools, but of negligent human oversight. Perhaps military AI, when employed properly, could actually lead to more humane warfare? Dr. Mathew Maavak: Honestly, I don’t think AI had played a significant role in the genocidal war in Gaza. The use of AI would have led to a targeted military campaign; not a mad, blood-stained blunderbuss of terror. This was no “oversight”; this was intentional! Compare Israel’s recent actions in Gaza to the relatively-professional military campaign it conducted in the same area in 2014 – when human intelligence (HUMINT) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) played a bigger role vis-a-vis AI. Did AI dumb down the IDF or is AI being used as a scapegoat for Israel’s war crimes? The bigger question however is this: Why did the IDF’s AI-coordinated border security system fail to detect Hamas’ military activities in the lead-up to the October 7 2024, cross-border attacks? The system is equipped with multiple sensors and detection tools across land, sea, air, and underground — making the failure even more perplexing. In the final analysis, AI is being weaponized across all facets of human life, including religion, and US Big Tech is leading the way. Ultimately, under certain circumstances in the future, AI may be used to act as the judge, jury and executioner. It may decide who is worthy to live, and who is not.

Wisconsin’s investment board saw fit to significantly add to its bitcoin (BTC) bet in the last three months of the year. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) disclosed ownership of just over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of the Dec. 31, per a 13F filing on Friday, up from roughly 2.9 million shares three months prior. The position is valued at $340 million at IBIT's current price of $56.10 and would be worth about $588 million at bitcoin's current price near $98,000. The fund in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a bitcoin ETF purchase, initially buying 94,562 shares of IBIT and some shares of Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which it later sold. The State of Michigan Retirement System later also reported owning shares of bitcoin ETFs, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and two of Grayscale's bitcoin products. SWIB, established in 1951, oversees more than $156 billion in assets including funds from the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and the State Investment Fund (SIF). The board manages investments on behalf of state employees and other trust funds. Today marks the deadline for institutional investors managing at least $100 million in assets to report quarterly holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The market is closely monitoring these filings to gauge whether large traditional finance firms have been adding bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios since their launch last year. UPDATE (Feb. 14, 18:49 UTC): Updates current valuation of State of Wisconsin's stake in IBIT.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/14/2025 8:30:11 AM PST by SeekAndFind Donald Trump was the first president in modern U.S. history to take office without holding a prior public office or serving in the military. This non-traditional path to the White House came with a distinctly corporate approach to economic and fiscal policy, one that both excited and unnerved investors in equal measure.Key PointsTrump’s focus on tax cuts, deregulation, and tariffs boosted domestic industries but disrupted global trade, benefiting sectors like energy, infrastructure, and defense.Rising national debt and aggressive fiscal policies under Trump could fuel short-term market gains but increase long-term risks and volatility.Trump’s pivot toward crypto and rapid-fire policy changes could create opportunities in digital assets and industries favored by his administration.A Business-Oriented White HouseFrom the moment he entered the political arena, Donald Trump presented himself as a businessman whose background in real estate and media would translate into a savvy dealmaking approach in Washington. During his first presidency (2017–2021), that style permeated discussions on tax reform, international trade, and budget negotiations.Trump’s administration sought to pair substantial corporate tax cuts with extensive deregulation to stimulate economic growth. These policies were credited by some for boosting corporate earnings, although detractors questioned whether they would deliver long-term, sustainable gains.Investors observing a potential second Trump presidency, or even the memory of the first, note the lasting influence of Trump’s worldview on business and trade.The belief that renegotiating trade deals and encouraging domestic manufacturing could strengthen the U.S. economy shaped Trump’s policies. For instance, the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum briefly boosted certain domestic industries but also invited retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, complicating global supply chains.Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond.

When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. Trump’s administration sought to pair substantial corporate tax cuts with extensive deregulation to stimulate economic growth. These policies were credited by some for boosting corporate earnings, although detractors questioned whether they would deliver long-term, sustainable gains.Investors observing a potential second Trump presidency, or even the memory of the first, note the lasting influence of Trump’s worldview on business and trade.The belief that renegotiating trade deals and encouraging domestic manufacturing could strengthen the U.S. economy shaped Trump’s policies. For instance, the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum briefly boosted certain domestic industries but also invited retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, complicating global supply chains.Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production.

Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players.

Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs.

For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation.

Trump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players.

When Reagan got elected, we entered a recession—as it took some time to get inflation down and the economy growing. After a few years, when his policies took the stock market and the economy boomed. But in 1987, there was a short market crash that no one could really explain. Sometimes groupthink in the markets make no sense. Sometimes groupthink in the markets make no sense. ....policies took effect... But in 1987, there was a short market crash that no one could really explain. ************* I still can’t explain the 1987 crash. The market is historically very expensive now based on PE’s (lagging and forward) so it will take some time for earnings to catch up. It will certainly take some time for Trump’s policies to take hold. I’ve predicted the market will crash, and the media pundits will blame that on Trump and his policies, such as tariffs. *********************** Wall Street will try to blame tariffs, but their support of sanctions because of the Russia Ukraine War, were far more damaging to trade & the international economy. The Federal government collected $77 billion in tariffs in 2024, they might collect $90 billion in 2025. “Big Whoop.” Perhaps the left-wing loonies in the financial sector were hoping to crash the economy to sabotage Reagan; just like they are trying to do with Trump. Food prices are rising every week. Restaurants are even adding a surcharge for each egg ordered. Expect the North Virginia real estate market to take a hit. With 75,000 federal employees accepting a buy out, there could be an unusually large number of homes hitting the market in a fairly short time-frame. Yes there isn’t anywhere else to go. Lots of money chasing overvalued assets RE: Food prices are rising every week. Restaurants are even adding a surcharge for each egg ordered. So, what does that do for the Stock market? No idea. I was just calling attention to some economic data. The S&P went up 100% over the last 4 years. No it didn’t. The markets have been going up for the past 4 years. I guess they can keep going up. Gold is taking a major hit today! My poor portfolio! It’s not feelin’ the love this Valentine’s Day. Kemp and Reagan reluctantly accepted a compromise deal on the tax cuts, phasing them in over 3 years. This was a huge mistake, because businesses held off major capital transactions and investments until the final phase of the cut was in effect. Instead of a supply side stimulus, the economy ground to a halt for three years. Below is a piece of interesting trivia I’m putting here since it is economy-related: “In the 25 days since Trump’s inauguration, CNN has mentioned “egg prices” 45 times. But in the 25 days before the inauguration, CNN NEVER mentioned “egg prices.” Over on MSNBC, in the 25 days since Trump’s inauguration, they mentioned “egg prices” 80 times. But in the 25 days before the inauguration, MSNBC mentioned “egg prices” just 1 time.” They are absolutely SHAMELESS! When the Trump tax cuts are extended in the near future, they need to be made PERMANENT this time!

Johnny O’Sullivan’s double was decisive as defending champions Blackrock College marched into the Leinster Schools Senior Cup semi-final at Energia Park on Friday afternoon with a comfortable win over St Michael’s in a repeat of last year’s decider. Despite the greasy ball, these schools looked to go wide early, trading crossfield kicks and the ambition to play at speed. Rock exposed space on the right, the feet of James Browne doing the trick and clean passing put Paddy Clancy on the ball, but his grubber just eluding the reach of Rhys Keogh. Blackrock narrowed their focus to go through the middle, with tighthead Sam Bishti showing surprising speed to test out St Michael’s centre Charlie McConnell. A knock-on was gratefully accepted by St Michael’s and their maul took them out of trouble and into enemy territory. Bernard White’s drive took him over the top of Cathal Lydon’s tackle where Owen Twomey’s groundwork enabled Ethan Black to strike the lead penalty in the 19th minute. Rock’s decision to keep the ball worked wonderfully, replacement Aiden Vetjens’s late line unlocking the defence to send Johnny O’Sullivan into the right corner for a 5-3 lead in the 19th minute. In a flash, sweet passing put Browne clear down the right where St Michael’s captain Duinn Maguire and Dan Ryan shunted the wing into touch. When the decision was taken to go wide, fullback Ryan was in place to intercept in another example of St Michael’s survival to the half-time whistle. . A sustained St Michael’s attack winkled out a penalty for Black to guarantee a 6-5 edge in the 39th minute, but they strayed offside to offer Paddy Clancy a shot at goal to make 8-6 in Rock’s favour in the 43rd minute. Blackrock struck for their second try after centre White’s hard line exploited a gap at the tail of the lineout. Clancy’s lob was then collected by Vetjens for the try, brilliantly converted by Clancy. Then, Clancy’s delicate ball over the top was collected by Joe Reddan and moved to White for the third try, converted by Clancy to make it 22-6 in the 57th minute. St Michael’s centre Black saw a pass slip forward for White to grab the intercept and Johnny O’Sullivan controlled the ball to speed away to the posts for his second try, which Clancy converted to put the game away. St Michael’s were quick to show character late on, implementing a maul strategy for Cian Walsh to drive over, with Black converting. SCORERS – Blackrock: J O’Sullivan 2 tries; A Vetjens, B White try each; P Clancy pen, 3 cons. St Michael’s: C Walsh try; E Black 2 pens, con.

Title: Elon Musk aims to remake the federal government by breaking it

UPDATED 11:12 EST / FEBRUARY 14 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof This week, it was all Elon, all the time. Let’s see: Musk offers to buy OpenAI (translation: gums up the works for Sam Altman’s attempt to turn OpenAI for-profit, since OpenAI’s board Friday rejected the offer). Makes Trump look like a babysitter for Musk’s four-year-old son prop at a press conference. Tries to cement his government coup via DOGE as judges remind him and Trump we’re (supposed to be) a democracy. Creates a cybersecurity nightmare in the process. Gets a $400 million federal bailout for his failed Cybertruck (for a few seconds). Did I miss anything? It’s now “Do whatever you want” with AI, for better or worse, at least in the U.S., as Biden’s AI rules got nixed and the U.S. refused to sign an international agreement on safe and inclusive AI. Meantime, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pledges more openness (we’ll see), and news organizations get more aggressive on copyright in a lawsuit against Cohere and note continuing problems with hallucinations. Paul Gillin dug into how venture capitalists view the AI investment environment post-DeepSeek, and guess what? It actually looks way more promising than some doomsayers suggested. AI chips are getting very hot. As OpenAI steamrolls ahead on new models, it’s also close to making AI chip in-house. And Arm is now reportedly looking at designing chips to sell itself, with Meta Platforms the likely first customer. Meanwhile, Intel stock rose more than 20% this week after U.S. pushed TSMC to operate its factories, but it’s far from a done deal. Hardware’s not dead, as HPE, Cisco and Juniper release new gear. Dell also could sell $5 billion worth of AI servers to Musk’s xAI. Oh, and Meta reportedly is about to go deep into robotics. Another big earnings week: Cisco, Supermicro, Confluent, Coinbase and Robinhood beat. Informatica sure didn’t, and its stock fell by a third. Palo Alto Networks fell on a disappointing outlook too. Overall it was a mixed bag — full results below. More cyber consolidation is coming, with Trend Micro on the block and CyberArk acquiring Zilla. You can hear more about this and other news on John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod, out later today on YouTube. And don’t miss Dave’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, out early next week. Here’s all the news we could fit from SiliconANGLE and beyond, in another busy week: Venture investors see DeepSeek accelerating AI market growth Consortium led by Elon Musk makes $97.4B offer for OpenAI Late-breaking Friday: OpenAI’s board rejects the bid Sam Altman pledges more openness as OpenAI works toward AGI Paris AI Summit: US, UK refuse to sign agreement on ‘safe’ and ‘inclusive’ AI as JD Vance sends warning Report says companies ‘playing with fire’ as AI chatbots fail when trying to summarize news Major publishers launch copyright lawsuit against AI startup Cohere At Developer Week, Mark Albertson dug into how intense interest in AI agents is colliding with AI security concerns: Building AI with AI: Developers scramble to keep pace with new applications as security concerns grow France announces €109B investment plan to boost AI ecosystem DataRobot buys Aqnostiq to advance AI agent development with dynamic compute orchestration Meta considers acquisition of Korean AI chip startup FuriosaAI (per Forbes) Tines nabs $125M for its AI-powered workflow automation platform Harrison.ai raises $112M for its AI medical diagnosis tools Legal AI startup Eudia launches with $105M to bring AI agents to legal teams Sardine raises $70M to expand AI risk platform Latent Labs raises $50M to develop new proteins with AI SpotDraft raises $54M to help legal teams manage contracts with AI Integrail raises $10M in seed funding for no-code agentic AI delivery platform OpenAI to launch GPT-5 in a matter of months, GPT-4.5 within weeks Workday unveils AI agent workforce management system Snowflake partners with Anthropic to release its first AI agents Baidu to open-source its Ernie large language model series Glean Technologies jumps into no-code agentic AI development with Agentworks Adobe launches commercially safe AI video model for creative professionals Amplitude integrates in-app surveys into its behavioral analysis platform F5 targets AI-era IT challenges with ADC 3.0 reference architectures Zilliz enhances AI cloud offering with enhanced ‘Bring Your Own Cloud’ capabilities Enterprise-sized implementations, bite-sized AI agents at ZohoDay25 There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Breaking Analysis: Investors cool on cloud but CEOs double down Report: Arm to build its own chips, and Meta is first in line to buy them Intel stock rose more than 20% this week after U.S. pushes TSMC to operate its factories, but it’s far from a done deal.

Title: Garry Ringrose looking forward to challenge of fighting for Irish centre spots

Having signed a new contract with Leinster and Ireland that will take him to the end of the 2027/28 season, Irish centre Garry Ringrose says that his plans are to become an even better player. The 30-year-old, who has won 65 Test caps since making his debut in 2016, establishing himself as an ever-present in Ireland’s midfield, said it was a privilege to stay in Dublin for another three years. Performance Director David Humphreys said at the announcement that he believed Ringrose’s better days were ahead. “That’s always what you’d be trying to aim to do,” said the outside centre. “I’m just delighted and feel privileged to be able to sign on for three years. It’s an unbelievable opportunity to work with some amazing coaches and then players that are keen to get better and improve. I’d be the same as that so massive opportunities ahead.” The competition for starting places in the Irish midfield with Bundee Aki, Robbie Henshaw, Ringrose and others has forced management into some rotation of the players with Ringrose having to be content with a starting from the bench against Scotland last weekend. “I think certainly as centres we’d be pretty open and relaxed amongst each other,” he said. “Over the last couple of years, we’ve all been challenged to play on any given week, either it’s rotation, injury, form, and what’s brilliant is it’s really competitive in training but then at the end of the day, certainly as a centre group, we just want to do our best to help the team win. “I don’t know if you ask myself, Bundee or Robbie at the moment that are rotating, and there’s a few guys that haven’t been in yet. That would be their answer as well. We’re all kind of on the same page from that perspective.” The former Blackrock College player was pleased with Ireland’s haul of 10 points from two matches against England and Scotland with Wales in Cardiff the team’s third challenge of the championship next weekend. “I mean to come away with 10 points from the first two games, we’re delighted from that perspective,” said Ringrose. “What’s been great is there’s been loads of good in the games, but then things we’re reviewing and looking back at and trying to get better at so we’re getting the best of both worlds I guess. To have 10 points in such a competitive group of teams, yeah we’re delighted.” Johnny Watterson is a sports writer with The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: How To Safely Spend Your Retirement Savings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevevernon/2025/02/14/how-to-safely-spend-your-retirement-savings/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T16:00:00Z

Develop a realistic plan to safely spend your retirement savings Many retirees plan to spend their retirement savings quite frugally, according to a few recent reports and studies. For example, a recent survey report, To Spend or Not to Spend from Blackrock, shares that retirees prefer to keep their assets untouched and that just one in four survey respondents feel they need to spend the principal of their savings in retirement. According to the report, “For most, retirement is not a time to live it up, it is more important to feel financially secure.” Similarly, the 2024 Retirement Confidence Survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute reported that more than one-third of retirees (38%) have a savings mindset, meaning they want to spend less and save for the future. If this mindset continues throughout life, some retirees might end up passing away with a lot of money in the bank, money they might have been able to spend and enjoy while they were alive. The Blackrock study identifies a few potential reasons for this phenomenon, including the possibility that retirees haven’t yet shifted their mindset from accumulating savings for retirement to spending money in retirement, that they’re afraid of outliving their money, or that they have a deep-seated fear they’ll experience a serious financial or health shock. While I don’t intend to chastise pre-retirees and retirees for being frugal, I do want them to know there’s a straightforward strategy they can use to safely spend their retirement savings. Appropriately, the strategy is called the Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy, and it’s based on robust research that I led at the Stanford Center on Longevity, in collaboration with the Society of Actuaries. We systematically analyzed and compared 292 retirement income strategies, using sophisticated analytical techniques. Two key metrics we used were the amount of lifetime retirement income you can expect as well as the amount of savings you can access at any point in time. Using these metrics, the Spend Safely Strategy (for short) compared favorably to the other 291 strategies we analyzed, many of which are much more complex. The Spend Safely Strategy is designed to withstand stock market crashes, and indeed, the financial turmoil caused by pandemic successfully stress-tested the strategy. The Spend Safely Strategy suggests developing sources of retirement income that will last the rest of your life, no matter how long you live. Then, it recommends you limit your monthly and annual spending to the amount of retirement income you expect to receive. To generate sources of lifetime retirement income, follow these three steps: If you want to preserve your retirement savings, the conservative RMD withdrawal rates might appeal to you. The rates are currently under 3% until age 66, under 4% until age 75, and under 5% until age 81. The Spend Safely Strategy is really a decision-making framework. You can customize it meet your own goals and circumstances. For example, you can make adjustments to achieve these goals: You can implement the Spend Safely Strategy in most IRAs or 401(k) plans, with or without the help of a financial advisor. If you work with an advisor, understanding the strategy can help you have an informed discussion with your advisor. The Spend Safely Strategy offers a realistic balance between frugality on the one hand and spending too much money and outliving your savings on the other. It may take some time and effort on your part to build your lifetime retirement income portfolio, but it’s a very good use of your time, considering that you should be planning to enjoy a retirement that lasts for 25 years or more.

Title: How To Find The Best Sector Mutual Funds 1Q25

Concept of mutual fund investment, showing with hands placing coins inside the piggy bank with ... [+] mutual fund sticker. With an ever-growing list of similar-sounding mutual funds to choose from, finding the best is an increasingly difficult task. How can investors change the game to shift the odds in their favor? There are at least 147 different Technology mutual funds and at least 588 mutual funds across eleven sectors. Do investors need 53+ choices on average per sector? How different can the mutual funds be? Those 147 Technology mutual funds are very different from each other. With anywhere from 26 to 317 holdings, many of these Technology mutual funds have drastically different portfolios with differing risk profiles and performance outlooks. The same is true for the mutual funds in any other sector, as each offers a very different mix of good and bad stocks. Consumer Non-cyclicals ranks first for stock selection. Utilities ranks last. I think the large number of sector mutual funds hurts investors more than it helps. Manually conducting a deep analysis for every fund is simply not a realistic option, exposing investors to insufficient analysis and missing profitable opportunities. Analyzing mutual funds, with the proper diligence, is far more difficult than analyzing stocks because it means analyzing all the stocks within each mutual fund. As stated above, there can be as many as 317 stocks or more for one mutual fund. Figure 1 shows the top rated mutual fund for each sector. Figure 1: The Best Mutual Fund in Each Sector Best Sector Mutual Funds 1Q25 * Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNAs less than $100 million for inadequate liquidity Amongst the mutual funds in Figure 1, BlackRock Energy Opportunities Fund (BACIX) ranks first overall, Fidelity Advisor Financials Fund (FIKBX) ranks second, and Fidelity Advisor Consumer Staples Fund (FIJCX) ranks third. Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (HGASX) ranks last. Why do you need to know the holdings of mutual funds before you buy? You need to be sure you do not buy a fund that might blow up. Buying a fund without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances. No matter how cheap, if it holds bad stocks, the mutual fund’s performance will be bad. PERFORMANCE OF FUND’S HOLDINGS – FEES = PERFORMANCE OF FUND BlackRock Energy Opportunities Fund (BACIX) is not only the top-rated Energy mutual fund, but is also the overall top-ranked sector mutual fund out of the 588 sector mutual funds that my firm covers. The worst mutual fund in Figure 1 is Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (HGASX), which gets an Unattractive rating. One would think mutual fund providers could do better for this sector.

Title: The New Dawn Of Tokenization

Time Published: 2025-02-14T14:30:00Z
Full Content:
Charles Morey, CEO, MobilEyes Inc. In a world where technology is reshaping finance, tokenization emerges as a transformative force, enabling companies to raise capital without sacrificing equity. Through my work with tokenization strategies, I’ve seen its power to unlock non-dilutive IPOs and revolutionize taxation, equity structures and wealth distribution. By turning customers into stakeholders, tokenization is reshaping industries and redefining ownership. As this innovation paves the way for an inclusive financial future, we must address challenges before AI and robotics reshape the job landscape. At its core, tokenization converts real-world assets or rights into digital tokens on a blockchain. Tokens represent ownership or claims on assets, offering unmatched liquidity, transparency and security. Unlike traditional shares or bonds, tokenized assets are programmable for governance, revenue sharing and compliance. Here are some examples of tokenization in action: • Real Estate: Instead of purchasing an entire property, investors can buy fractionalized tokens that represent a share of ownership, earning proportional rental income and capital appreciation. According to ScienceSoft, "By 2030, the global market for tokenized real estate will reach up to $3 trillion and represent 15% of the real estate assets under management." • Art And Collectibles: High-value art and collectibles are being tokenized to allow broader participation by fractionalizing ownership. • Tokenization Of Capital: Companies can monetize future revenues or assets without issuing additional equity, avoiding shareholder dilution. For example, Janus Henderson’s Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund tokenized $11 million, allowing real-time trading and improved liquidity via blockchain. With major firms like BlackRock adopting this approach, tokenization is unlocking new market access, reducing costs and enhancing transparency. Traditionally, an initial public offering (IPO) involves selling shares of a company to the public, diluting existing shareholders' equity. Tokenization enables a new approach: • Tokenized Revenue Streams: Companies can tokenize future revenues to provide liquidity without sacrificing equity, a revolutionary approach that allows startups to preserve founder stakes while attracting long-term investors. The World Economic Forum (via HSBC) predicts that up to 10% of global GDP, or $24 trillion, could be transacted via distributed ledgers by 2027, underscoring tokenization's immense potential. Additionally, firms can tokenize assets like intellectual property, patents or renewable energy credits, creating collateralized growth opportunities and unlocking innovative funding mechanisms. • Tokenized Assets For Collateralized Growth: Firms can tokenize intellectual property, patents or even renewable energy credits to secure funding. Consider a tech startup with exponential growth potential but is wary of diluting its visionary founders’ stakes. By offering tokenized revenue participation rights, the startup can access capital while incentivizing long-term investor engagement. Tokenization combats predatory lending practices that burden startups with high-interest loans. In a press release published last year, the FTC described two separate cases that show how deceptive lending costs small businesses millions of dollars. The FTC settled $59 million in claims against companies exploiting the Paycheck Protection Program. Tokenization provides a fair, transparent alternative. In a different example, the FTC took decisive action against a company operating under the name "Seek Capital," which falsely marketed itself as a provider of business loans. Tokenization does more than reshape fundraising; it redefines taxation and compliance frameworks: • Transparent Taxation: Blockchain technology streamlines tax compliance by enabling real-time, automated tax calculations and reporting, reducing errors and compliance burdens. PwC highlights how blockchain can automate business rules, expedite VAT refunds and enhance audit efficiency, significantly cutting costs. • Tokenized Tax Credits: Industries like renewable energy and agriculture could tokenize tax credits, creating liquid markets for businesses to buy and sell these benefits efficiently. In a tokenized world, opportunities for wealth creation become more equitable and accessible. Tokenized structures can: • Democratize Access To Investments: Tokenization enables everyday investors to access asset classes once limited to the wealthy. According to Boston Consulting Group, tokenized assets under management could reach more than $600 billion by 2030, unlocking opportunities and fostering inclusivity in financial markets. • Enable Crowdsourced Public Goods: Governments could issue tokenized bonds linked to specific infrastructure projects, allowing citizens to invest directly in community improvements. • Empower Underserved Communities: Imagine Native American tribes tokenizing land rights to secure capital while preserving sovereignty. Through tokenization, I aim to create a new paradigm where businesses harness non-dilutive capital solutions and where individuals reap the financial benefits of assets previously beyond their reach. For example: • Pre-IPO High-Yield Accounts: Companies meeting specific tokenization standards could offer high-yield investment accounts that grow in value over five to 10 years, rewarding investors while increasing enterprise value. • Dividend Tokens: Token holders receive dividends linked to crypto or real-world profits, incentivizing long-term participation and stability. • Automated Compliance/Wealth-Building Mechanisms: Smart contracts tied to tokenized revenue streams could manage compliance, automate dividends and even distribute carbon credits. Tokenization’s impact will extend beyond finance into societal transformation: • Public Safety: Systems like my patent-pending MobilEyes platform could tokenize compliance data, creating incentives for transparent law enforcement and real-time public accountability. Research from SoundThinking shows that 42% of Americans believe a lack of transparency harms trust in law enforcement. • Music And Creative Economies: Tokenized royalties could ensure artists are paid instantly and fairly, cutting out intermediaries. The revolution of tokenization is here, and its potential to reshape sectors, industries and individual prosperity is limitless.

Title: Bitcoin's 2024 Return Against Equities
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/02/14/bitcoins-2024-return-against-equities/

2024 Returns and Volatility Bitcoin fared quite well in 2024 against traditional assets like bonds, gold, real estate, and the equity market as a whole. But how does it compare to individual stocks? This matters for stock pickers, and for framing Bitcoin in terms of other major technological movements in the economy. Bitcoin had an annual 2024 return of 114%. The return and volatility are both much higher than the asset classes of bonds, real estate, gold, and the entire equity market. However, the risk-adjusted winner of 2024 was Palantir (PLTR), which captured a return of 353% and a slightly higher volatility than BTC. MicroStrategy (MSTR) came in close second, finishing out at a return of 338%, but at a much higher volatility. MicroStrategy would have handily beaten PLTR in November when its return YTD was 497%, but MSTR shed much value in the last six weeks of the year from aggressive bitcoin buying, powered by equity dilution. Even Nvidia (NVDA) offered a higher risk and return, with an annual return in 2024 of 187%. The major tech companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta) all offered lower risk and lower returns to Bitcoin. You can see that Bitcoin generally sits on the capital market line of risk and return, with MicroStrategy on one end and government bonds (GOVT) on the other. PLTR is an outlier, but so are companies like Tesla, Coinbase, and Marathon, which all offered lower returns and greater risk. Even the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) roughly matched Bitcoin’s return, but it was more volatile. Now, let’s take a look at a broader universe of equities. Let's sample the companies in the S&P 500 above a $10 billion market cap. A random sample of these companies on the risk and return chart looks like: 2024 Returns and Volatility Again, notice the pattern. Some companies have higher returns than Bitcoin in 2024, but also higher risk, like Nvidia and Palantir. Other companies have less return and less risk, like Disney and Nike. Some are strictly worse, with greater risk but lower return, like Tesla and Micron Technology. There was one company in the S&P 500 that offered a better deal than Bitcoin, with lower risk and greater return. To find it, here's a sample of the companies from the S&P 500 without the $10 billion minimal market capitalization threshold: 2024 Returns and Volatility Here you can see that Sea Limited had an annual return of almost 200%, and a volatility just shy of Bitcoin’s. Have you heard of Sea Limited? Neither have I. So, indeed there may be a better investment than Bitcoin in any one year. But the chances of finding this one company among 500 is small. This proves my point that Bitcoin really is an asset class, not just another single investment. And its risk and return should be compared to other asset classes, not just to other single stocks.

The fee reductions are expected to save investors more than $350 million this year alone,” it said in a statement. Lower costs leave more money in investors’ hands and raise their potential returns. Indeed, across the industry, lower-cost funds have historically outperformed higher-cost funds on a net-of-expenses basis, Vanguard reasoned. The average asset-weighted expense ratio would be just 0.07 per cent for Vanguard across its $10 trillion under management — a sliver of the industry average of 0.44 per cent, said a Bloomberg report. It’s going to be a catch-22 situation for its rivals such as Blackrock, Invesco and State Street Corp on whether to follow suit at the cost of their profits. Between 2004 and 2023, the asset-weighted average expense ratio fell from 0.87 per cent to 0.36 per cent, according to Morningstar Inc, that tracks the performance of mutual funds globally. In India, SEBI allows slab-based total expense ratios for various categories of schemes, such as equity, debt, hybrid, and solution-oriented funds. Accordingly, equity funds can charge up to 2.25 per cent, non-equity schemes can charge up to 2 per cent as the base expense ratio. SEBI has been working hard to bring down expense ratio. It, in fact, had suggested calculating TER including brokerage fee and GST on management fee at the asset management company level rather than at the scheme level. “This approach was aimed to provide a more holistic view on expenses incurred by mutual funds,” SEBI had then said. The regulator, however, put this proposal on hold after feedback from MF industry body AMFI. The consultation process is currently going on. As per SEBI study, the industry average TER, including additional expenses charged by the regular plan of different open-ended schemes during the financial year 2021–22, stood at 2 per cent for equity schemes, 0.77 per cent for debt schemes, 1.88 per cent for hybrid schemes, and 0.11 per cent for ETFs. This ratio has further slipped currently. For instance, the TER has slipped to 1.4 per cent in January. According to SEBI, retail investors invested more than 57.18 per cent of their investment in equity schemes and 17.49 per cent in hybrid schemes and the remaining 25.33 per cent in debt schemes, ETFs and other schemes such as index funds, solution oriented schemes, fund of funds, and so on. The AUM of the Indian MF industry has grown from ₹11.81 trillion as on January 31, 2015 to ₹67.25 trillion as on January 31, 2025 more than 5-fold increase in a span of 10 years. According to SPIVA Global (S&P Indices Versus Active), the first half of 2024 proved to be a particularly challenging market environment for active managers across global equity markets, as the outperformance of the very largest companies resulted in a high proportion of index constituents underperforming the benchmark return. In India, 77 per cent of actively managed Indian Equity Large-Cap funds trailed the S&P India LargeMidCap’s total return of 17.4 per cent at the end of June 2024. At 52 per cent, It is relatively better for mid/small-cap funds underperformed the S&P India SmallCap’s and 94 per cent of Indian Composite Bond funds and 74 per cent of Indian Government Bond funds lagged the 5.3 per cent return of the iBoxx ALBI India. However, it is interesting to see, in the current downtrend, how many mid and small-cap schemes have managed to outperform the respective indices. The probability of a greater number of schemes underperforming the indices is higher given the constant selling pressure in that space. In this scenario, lower expense ratio would no doubt enhance the return for the investors. With more and more players such as Jio BlackRock, Capitalmind, Choice International, Cosmea Financial Holdings, Angel One and Unifi Capital entering the AMC space, one could hope for further lowering of cost due to competition and growth in AUM.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/14/2025 4:53:51 AM PST by MtnClimber U.S. electric rates are going up. In Missouri, Ameren increased residential power bills by 11% less than two years ago, and now it is seeking another 15% increase, per the Public Service Commission (PSC). According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), rate increases were experienced in 43 American states between 2023 and 2024. The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change.

The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change.

And we are doing all we can to hold our usage down. The 9 degrees temps we had a couple of weeks ago did not help!! Bama ain’t use to 9 and 12 degree temps. Ave in Jan is usually 53 high and 32 lows. Highs of 31 and lows of 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 22, are NOT usual here. 5 posted on 02/14/2025 5:05:24 AM PST by RetiredArmy (The Bible speaks truth! Don't believe it, you do so at your own peril.

Title: Goldman Sachs Is Quietly Betting Billions On Bitcoin—Is Ripple’s XRP Next As Its Price Surges?

02/14 update below. This post was originally published on February 13 Bitcoin and ethereum have diverged in recent months, with the bitcoin price soaring as ethereum struggles—helped by U.S. president Donald Trump’s predicted plans for bitcoin. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price is hovering just under $100,000 per bitcoin after coming within touching distance of $110,000 around mid January while ethereum has fallen sharply from its recent December peak as “dangerous” bubble fears emerge. Now, as a Coinbase executive claims Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity may already be known, Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has quietly confirmed its bought around $2 billion of bitcoin and ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and ethereum ... [+] exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares as the bitcoin price surges. Goldman Sachs loaded up on bitcoin and ethereum ETFs in the fourth quarter, increasing its ethereum ETF holdings by 2,000% and growing its bitcoin ETF holding to over $1.5 billion, according to a regulatory filing. The funds bought by Goldman Sachs included BlackRock’s bitcoin and etheruem ETFs, as well as funds controlled by Fidelity and Grayscale. 02/14 update: Crypto prices have climbed over the last 24 hours, with small gains for bitcoin and ethereum being dwarfed by Ripple’s XRP, which has surged 10% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged filings from crypto asset manager Grayscale to list spot XRP and the memecoin dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “While this doesn’t guarantee approval, it begins a process for public feedback,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “Grayscale’s XRP ETF, filed in January and amended in February, is now under review with up to a 240-day approval period. The SEC's acknowledgment is seen as a positive shift from its previous stance, as it shows openness to these products.” The race for the next U.S. spot crypto ETF is now between bitcoin offshoot litecoin, ethereum rival solana, XRP and dogecoin, with Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predicting earlier this month that XRP and dogecoin ETF bids have a 65% and 75% chance of being approved before the end of 2025. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) which now has just over $60 billion in assets under management. However, the importance of Goldman’s bet on bitcoin and ethereum via ETFs has been played down one analyst. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last year, helped by Wall Street adoption and Donald Trump's ... [+] embrace of bitcoin, ethereum and crypto. “This position by Goldman Sachs, similar to many other banks and hedge funds, is not a net long position,” said Coindesk senior analyst James Van Straten. "This is a strategy that reflects the basis trade, also known as the cash and carry trade, balancing potential profits and risks for bitcoin price fluctuations. The ETFs recently had options approved on them so this is most likely directional hedging." Last month, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealed he’s had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin. "If everyone adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per bitcoin," Fink, who led the Wall Street rush into bitcoin and crypto last year via a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), told Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The UK-based bank now holds 2,473,064 shares of IBIT, valued at $131 million as of December 31, as per the Thursday filing. The purchase took place during the fourth quarter, spanning October to December, and coincides with the post-election surge in the Bitcoin price, which is now trading at a price of $97,030.17, up 0.8% over the past day, per CoinGecko data. The filing shows that Barclays’ move follows a trend in institutional adoption of crypto-related products, with banking giants such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan also raking up Bitcoin ETF holdings in recent months. As BTC surged to a record high of $109,000 just before the U.S. presidential inauguration, big players are seized the opportunity to capitalize on the crypto’s rise without directly owning BTC itself. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made it easier for these institutions to get exposure to BTC, while sidestepping some of the volatility and regulatory concerns surrounding direct crypto ownership. Goldman Sachs, for instance, reported a 121% jump in its Bitcoin ETF holdings, bringing its total stake to $1.57 billion. Banking giant JPMorgan recently reported an increase in its BTC fund exposure in its latest filing, which now totals $964,322. In January 2025, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive $5 billion in inflows, a trend expected to continue in 2025 with forecasts of over $50 billion in inflows, as per Farside Investors data. BlackRock’s IBIT saw the largest net inflows during January, pulling in $3.2 billion, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $1.3 billion. In January alone, IBIT pulled in $3.2 billion, making it the top-performing Bitcoin ETF of the month, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with nearly $1.3 billion in inflows. Analysts are predicting more gains for BTC in the coming years, with projections suggesting it could reach as high as $200,000 by late 2025. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Gold IRA February 14, 2025 We research all the brands mentioned and may receive a fee from our partners. Research and financial concerns may impact how brands are presented. Not every brand is included. Learn more. Let’s not waste any time. I’ll be covering the different ways you can invest in gold. As an American, you have several options for investing in gold, depending on your goals, risk tolerance, and whether you prefer physical or paper gold. Here are the main ways you can invest. But first: Looking to protect your investments from inflation? Diversify your portfolio with a Gold IRA. Secure your assets by investing in gold coins, bars, and bullion. Starting is simple – click on your state now and take the first step toward a more secure financial future! Look, if you’re investing in gold, you’re doing it because you understand one fundamental truth: paper money is a joke. The government prints it like Monopoly cash, inflation robs you blind, and the banking system? A house of cards waiting to collapse. You want something real, something tangible—gold. Bullion is just a fancy word for gold bars and coins, and this is where serious investors park their money. Why? Because bullion holds its value when everything else crumbles. What’s the catch? Great, you’ve got some gold. Now what? You can’t just stuff it in a sock drawer and hope for the best. Step one: don’t be an idiot. There are a lot of scammers out there preying on people who don’t do their research. You don’t just sit on gold forever. At some point, you’ll want to cash out. Gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are basically the participation trophy of gold investing. You don’t actually own gold—you own a paper representation of gold. It’s like saying you have a pet lion because you watched a National Geographic documentary. But hey, some people don’t want to deal with safes, security, or actually holding real gold. If that’s you, then ETFs are the easiest way to get in on the gold game. A Gold ETF is a fund that tracks the price of gold. You buy shares, and those shares are supposed to represent actual gold that some financial institution (probably one you don’t trust) is holding in a vault somewhere. The most popular ones: The idea is simple: Instead of buying and storing gold yourself, you buy shares in a fund that does it for you. Sounds great, right? Well… not so fast. ✅ Easy to Buy & Sell – Unlike physical gold, you can trade ETFs instantly on the stock market. No haggling with dealers. No waiting for delivery. Just click and you own (sort of) gold.✅ No Storage Hassles – No safes, no vaults, no worrying about someone breaking into your house and making off with your stash.✅ Lower Transaction Costs – No dealer markups, no shipping fees, no getting ripped off by pawn shops when you sell.✅ Can Be Held in an IRA – If you want to hedge your retirement savings with gold, ETFs are an easy way to do it inside a tax-advantaged account. So yeah, ETFs give you exposure to gold without the headaches. But now let’s talk about the ugly side of ETFs—because there’s plenty. 🚩 You Don’t Actually Own Gold – Let’s be crystal clear: Owning a Gold ETF is not the same as owning physical gold. If the system collapses, you’re holding a digital number on a screen, not something you can barter with. If you don’t hold it, you don’t own it. Period. 🚩 Counterparty Risk – When you own gold in your hands, you don’t have to trust anyone. With an ETF, you’re trusting banks, fund managers, and custodians—aka, the same people who mismanage money, rig markets, and gamble with your savings. If something goes wrong, guess who gets left holding the bag? (Hint: It’s not them.) 🚩 Redemption Is a Joke – Most Gold ETFs do not let you redeem your shares for actual gold. That means even if the fund does hold physical gold (which you’re just taking their word for), you’ll never see a single ounce of it. Instead, when you sell, you get paid in cash—which, again, is just paper money. 🚩 Fees Eat Into Your Gains – GLD charges an expense ratio of about 0.40% per year. Doesn’t sound like much, but over time, that adds up. And unlike physical gold, which just sits there gaining value, ETFs bleed a little money every year just for existing. 🚩 Government Control – Here’s a fun fact: The government can freeze your brokerage account anytime it wants. Think it can’t happen? Ask the Canadians who had their bank accounts locked for donating to the trucker protests. If things get bad enough, your Gold ETF won’t save you. Look, I’ll be fair—Gold ETFs aren’t useless. They’re a decent option if you:✅ Just want short-term exposure to gold prices without dealing with physical storage.✅ Are a trader looking to capitalize on gold price movements.✅ Want a gold hedge inside your stock portfolio. But if you’re investing in gold because you actually care about protecting wealth, hedging against collapse, or securing your financial future, physical gold is the only real option. Gold mutual funds are bundles of investments related to gold, usually a mix of mining stocks, gold ETFs, and sometimes actual gold bullion. You put your money in, and some fund manager—who takes a cut, by the way—decides how to invest it for you. Examples: Why do people buy these? But Here’s the Problem: 🚩 You Don’t Own Gold – Again, you own paper assets linked to gold. When the system breaks down, what good is a mutual fund statement? 🚩 Fees & Middlemen – The fund manager gets paid whether you make money or not. If gold skyrockets, they profit first. 🚩 Stock Market Exposure – These funds are tied to mining companies, which means they rise and fall with the stock market, not just gold prices. If the economy tanks, mining stocks can crash even if gold goes up. 🚩 Government Regulation – The SEC, the IRS, and every other three-letter agency has their hands all over these. If things go south, mutual funds can be frozen, taxed, or “restructured” (a nice way of saying you get screwed). Now, if gold mutual funds are for passive investors, gold futures are for the adrenaline junkies who think betting their savings on short-term gold prices is a good idea. A gold futures contract is a legal agreement to buy or sell gold at a future date at a set price. You don’t have to own gold—you’re just betting on whether the price will go up or down. ✅ Leverage – You control a large amount of gold with a small amount of money.✅ Short-Term Profits – If you time it right, you can make a lot of money fast.✅ Liquidity – Futures are heavily traded, so you can buy and sell quickly. Why Gold Futures Are Insane for Most People: 🚩 Extreme Risk – Gold futures are a zero-sum game. If you win, someone else loses. If you lose, you lose big. Most retail traders get wiped out. 🚩 Margin Calls – If the market moves against you, you have to put up more money. Fast. If you can’t, your position is liquidated, and you’re left with nothing. 🚩 No Physical Gold – Once again, this is just numbers on a screen. If the financial system collapses, do you really think your futures contract is going to protect you? 🚩 Big Players Control the Market – Hedge funds, banks, and institutions dominate the futures market. They have insider knowledge, algorithms, and the ability to manipulate prices. You don’t. If you’re investing in gold because you want real security, neither of these options should be your first choice. Gold Mutual Funds and Gold Futures are just Wall Street’s way of keeping you trapped in their system—where they get their fees and take their cut, while you hold an IOU for gold that you’ll never see. Real gold? That’s what kings, governments, and smart people hold.Paper gold? That’s what they sell to the masses. So ask yourself: Do you want to own gold, or do you want to play Wall Street’s gold games? Alright, let’s talk about Gold IRAs—because if you’re planning for retirement and you don’t have some of your money in gold, you’re doing it wrong. Here’s the reality: The U.S. dollar is a ticking time bomb. The government prints money like a drunk teenager with a credit card, inflation is eating away at your savings, and politicians—both parties—have no interest in fixing the mess. So, what do you do? You put your retirement savings into something that actually holds value. And that’s exactly what a Gold IRA does. A Gold IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is a self-directed IRA that lets you hold physical gold instead of just stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Instead of trusting Wall Street with your future, you invest in something real—gold, silver, and other precious metals. You’re still getting the tax advantages of a regular IRA, but instead of hoping your stocks don’t crash right before retirement, you own actual gold that holds value no matter what happens. ✅ Hedges Against Inflation – While your dollars become worthless, gold keeps its purchasing power. 50 years ago, $35 bought you an ounce of gold. Today, that same ounce is worth nearly $2,000+. That’s how you keep wealth intact. ✅ Protects You from Government Stupidity – If the economy crashes, if banks fail, if another bailout happens (and it will), your 401(k) full of stocks could get wrecked. A Gold IRA keeps your savings in a real asset that politicians can’t just print more of. ✅ Tax-Advantaged Growth – Just like a traditional IRA, you can defer taxes on your gains. With a Roth Gold IRA, you pay taxes now but never again—so when gold skyrockets, your profits are 100% tax-free. ✅ Diversification That Actually Works – Wall Street tells you to “diversify” by buying 30 different stocks… all of which can crash at the same time. Real diversification means owning something outside of the stock market—like gold. ✅ You Own It, Not Some Bank – Unlike Gold ETFs or mining stocks, where you’re trusting paper contracts, a Gold IRA holds physical, tangible gold stored in a secure, IRS-approved depository. It’s yours. No counterparty risk, no Wall Street nonsense. It’s actually easier than you think—and if you already have a 401(k) or IRA, you can roll it over into gold. 1️⃣ Find a Gold IRA Custodian – You need an IRS-approved company to handle the paperwork and store your gold. Good options include: 2️⃣ Fund Your Account – You can roll over an existing IRA or 401(k) tax-free or make new contributions (subject to IRS limits). 3️⃣ Buy Approved Gold & Silver – Not just any gold works—IRS rules say you need to buy specific coins and bars, like: 4️⃣ Secure Storage – The gold is stored in a highly secure, IRS-approved depository. No, you can’t keep it under your mattress (IRS rules), but it’s your gold, sitting in a vault, completely safe. 5️⃣ Watch It Grow – Gold doesn’t pay dividends, but it appreciates in value while the dollar dies. And when you retire? You can either take a cash payout or have the gold shipped directly to you. 🚩 “Gold IRAs have storage and custodian fees!” ▶ Yeah, and so does a regular IRA or 401(k)—you just don’t see the hidden fees you’re paying to Wall Street. At least with a Gold IRA, you’re paying to store something real instead of gambling on stocks. 🚩 “Gold doesn’t generate income like stocks.” ▶ Gold’s job isn’t to pay dividends—it’s to preserve wealth. Stocks rise and fall, but gold holds its value for centuries. 🚩 “What if the government confiscates gold like in 1933?” ▶ If that happens, trust me, the economy is so far gone that nothing will be safe. But Gold IRAs are still a smarter bet than hoping Wall Street takes care of you. Alright, let’s get something straight right now—if you don’t hold the gold in your hands, you don’t own it. Period. End of discussion. And yet, we’ve got this new trend—Digital Gold. It sounds fancy. It sounds modern. But let’s call it what it really is: a digital IOU for gold that you’ll probably never see. Let’s break this down. Digital Gold is a system where you buy fractional ownership of gold stored in a vault somewhere—but instead of getting the actual gold, you get a digital certificate or balance that says you “own” it. Popular platforms include: The idea is simple: Instead of dealing with the “hassle” of storing real gold, you just trust some company to hold it for you while they give you a number on a screen. Sounds familiar? Yeah, that’s because it’s basically a glorified bank account. ✅ Fractional Ownership – You can buy tiny amounts of gold, even a few dollars’ worth, which makes it accessible. ✅ No Storage Hassle – You don’t need a safe, a vault, or a hidden compartment in your house. The gold is “securely stored” for you (so they say). ✅ Fast Transactions – You can buy and sell instantly, unlike physical gold, which takes time to sell and ship. ✅ Can Be Used for Payments – Some digital gold platforms even let you “spend” your gold like cash. Because apparently, gold is too “old-fashioned” now. Alright, sounds nice, right? Yeah, until you realize the entire thing is built on trust. 🚩 YOU DON’T ACTUALLY OWN THE GOLD – Let’s get one thing clear: Digital Gold is not the same as holding physical gold. You’re trusting some company to store it for you, and if they go bankrupt, get hacked, or decide to freeze your account, good luck getting your gold. 🚩 COUNTERPARTY RISK – When you own real gold, you don’t have to trust anyone. When you own digital gold, you’re trusting a company, a vault, and a bunch of middlemen to not screw you over. And if history has taught us anything, middlemen always screw you over. 🚩 WITHDRAWAL RESTRICTIONS – Many digital gold platforms make it incredibly difficult to actually take physical delivery of your gold. There are minimum withdrawal amounts, high fees, and long wait times. In other words, they’ll sell you “gold” all day long, but when you ask for the real thing? Suddenly, there are rules. 🚩 GOVERNMENT CONTROL – What’s stopping the government from regulating or seizing digital gold platforms? Nothing. Your account can be frozen, your assets can be taxed, and suddenly, your “gold-backed” investment isn’t so secure anymore. 🚩 CENTRALIZATION DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF GOLD – The whole point of gold is freedom from the financial system. Digital Gold just locks you back into it. It’s basically a digital fiat currency dressed up as gold. Let’s be real—if the economy crashes tomorrow, Digital Gold is just another number on a screen. You know what people will actually trade? Real, physical gold. Look, I get it. Digital Gold sounds convenient. It’s easy, it’s fast, and it feels like “owning gold” without the “hassle.” But that’s exactly the trap. The whole reason you invest in gold is to get out of the system—not to get trapped in another version of it. If you want to actually protect your wealth, here’s what you do:🚨 BUY REAL GOLD. 🚨 STORE IT YOURSELF. 🚨 DON’T TRUST THIRD PARTIES. It’s that simple. Don’t fall for the Digital Gold illusion. Because when things go south, the only gold that matters is the gold in your hands. If you have zero faith in the U.S. government, the Federal Reserve, or the financial system, congratulations—you’re paying attention. A Gold IRA is one of the smartest ways to protect your retirement from inflation, stock market crashes, and the reckless policies that are destroying the dollar. Gold is real. Gold is lasting. Gold is what nations, billionaires, and smart people invest in when they see economic chaos coming. So the only question left is: Are you protecting your future, or are you gambling it on a system that’s already failing?

Title: Costco and investors could pay big time for its DEI policies

Time Published: 2025-02-14T10:00:45Z

Americans from Texas, Michigan and New York react to Costco's refusal to adhere to President Trump's private sector suggestion to band DEI hiring policies. By now, many companies have learned the hard way that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs aren’t the business panacea they were once sold to be. In recent weeks, Google, Amazon, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s and many other major corporations, facing backlash and declining employee morale, have backtracked from DEI, shifting gears in the face of mounting legal and financial risks. But Costco, against the tide, has doubled down on its DEI initiatives — at the peril of its bottom line, and now, its legal standing. Costco’s DEI program isn’t just a set of lofty ideals. It is embedded in the company’s operations at every level, with a Chief Diversity Officer at the helm and employees dedicated solely to diversity goals. This program informs hiring decisions, with race and gender as key factors in determining who is hired. Moreover, the company favors racial minorities and women-owned businesses when selecting suppliers, and its donations go to controversial activist groups — some of which have been accused of illegal racial discrimination themselves. FORMER COSTCO EXECUTIVE DEFENDS ITS DEI POLICIES, SAYS CRITICS DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY'S CULTURE In a bid to halt Costco’s DEI trajectory, a shareholder proposal was recently brought forward, urging the company to evaluate the risks associated with its diversity policies. This proposal pointed to the legal case of Starbucks, which was forced to pay a $25 million verdict for a single instance of discrimination against a White employee. While that case involved only one individual, the financial fallout for Costco could be catastrophic. While many companies move away from DEI, Costco continues to stick to its outmoded strategy. FILE: In an aerial view, the Costco logo is displayed on the exterior of a Costco store on July 11, 2024, in Richmond, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) If even a small fraction of Costco’s up to 200,000 non-minority employees decided to sue, the company could face judgments running into tens of billions of dollars. But when confronted with this data, Costco didn’t retreat; instead, the company’s board rejected the proposal and defended its DEI program. The company claimed that its focus on diversity wasn’t just about improving financial outcomes, but about "enhancing our culture and the well-being of people whose lives we influence." CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Despite the risks outlined, the three biggest asset managers — BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street — were complicit with the board in driving Costco’s DEI push. With significant stakes in the company, these investment giants control nearly a fifth of Costco’s shares. Their votes likely provided the critical mass necessary for the proposal’s overwhelming passage. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have continued to champion DEI, even as its legal implications grow clearer. Costco’s blind commitment to DEI is now drawing the attention of legal authorities at the highest levels. In late January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing federal agencies to scrutinize companies that maintain illegal discriminatory practices, including DEI initiatives. Each agency is tasked with identifying companies — such as Costco — that may be violating federal laws prohibiting discrimination. On top of this, a coalition of 19 state attorneys general has stepped up, urging Costco to reevaluate its DEI policies. They argue that Costco’s programs may be in violation of anti-discrimination laws, and the company has just 30 days to comply with their demands or face further legal action. Costco’s decision to dig in its heels on DEI is a bold one and could prove to be disastrous. The mounting legal challenges and the ever-growing body of evidence showing that DEI programs increase workplace hostility and fail to yield the promised business benefits should give pause to anyone still holding out hope for their success. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As more states and federal agencies take a closer look at the legal ramifications of DEI policies, companies like Costco may soon find themselves on the wrong side of the law, facing penalties that far outweigh any short-term cultural benefits. For investors, this should be a wake-up call. Costco’s stock has tripled over the past five years and is sitting at an all-time high. Pushing for divisive, race-based policies could alienate customers and increase legal exposure, impacting the share price. The tide is turning for most firms. Companies across America are waking up to the dangers of DEI. Disney, Target and Anheuser-Busch all saw their stocks plummet after DEI controversies and are trying to make amends. Costco might be next to learn that diversity at the expense of the law and customer preference is a bet that doesn’t pay off.

A few months ago Mary Lovegrove was at the gates of her son’s primary school talking to other parents about how they felt forced into giving their children smartphones once they moved on to second level. “Everyone was just resigned to it,” says Lovegrove, whose son (12) starts first year in September. “We were really dreading it, but felt we’d little choice because all their classmates would have one.” From Glasthule in Dublin, she decided to set up a WhatsApp group last November for parents of other children due to start at her son’s secondary school in the hope a handful of other like-minded parents might join. Within days 100 parents had signed up. As of this week, a total of 124 parents – about 75 per cent of the class’s parents – have joined the “delay smartphones and/or social media” group. The second-level school her son is due to attend is one of about a dozen, mostly in the South Dublin area, where similar parent-led WhatsApp groups have emerged in recent weeks. They include St Andrew’s College and Coláiste Íosagáin in Booterstown, Newpark Comprehensive School and Sion Hill College in Blackrock, Loreto Foxrock, Loreto Dalkey and others. There are early signs of others sprouting up among parents of soon-to-be first-year students in Cork, Galway and elsewhere. Parents are, in a way, conducting a large-scale social experiment: can they hold out in the face of their children’s self-proclaimed wants and needs, the might of social media’s addictive algorithms and what many see as a failure by successive governments to regulate the dangers of the online world. [ Can a school smartphone ban work? Here’s what principals and anti-bullying researchers thinkOpens in new window ] “Intuitively, we know that giving them a smartphone at that age is just too early,” Lovegrove says. “But I feel like the tide is turning. It’s about strength in numbers. If parents know their child won’t be the only one without a smartphone, it makes it much easier to delay.” Eoghan Cleary sees the impact of children’s unfettered internet access among his students on a daily basis. He is an assistant principal, English teacher and coordinator of SPHE (social, personal and health education) at Temple Carrig, a mixed secondary school in Greystones. In discussions with his students, he says it is clear they are being bombarded with an array of highly inappropriate and damaging content – with serious consequences. “As soon as the internet realises you’re a teenage boy or girl, you are flooded with stuff which their research shows will keep you scrolling,” he says. “For guys, it’s all the misogynistic content. All of the narratives that men are being falsely accused of rape; that if you don’t have a father you’re more likely to be a rapist, a criminal and a drug addict – all this comes up in the classroom,” he says. “And then for girls, they’re just bombarded with fake Ozempic nasal sprays, tanning injections, teeth filing, fake Botox supplements – all the stuff that’s based on their appearance and more so about their sexualisation.” The proliferation of pornography is everywhere online, he says, and across all social media platforms. “If you’re a female student, you get direct messages regularly asking for nude selfies. I had a first-year group ... who had a WhatsApp group which was primarily used for porn sharing.” The impact of all this, he says, is deeply troubling. Cleary has received disclosures of sexual assault from students who were at parties; evidence of students being blackmailed online after sharing sexual images of themselves; reports of self-harm in school bathrooms; worryingly high levels of anxiety and school refusal. Research shows mental health problems have soared since smartphones became ubiquitous well over a decade ago. There have been numerous warnings, too, of weakened social bonds, increased loneliness, sadness and social anxiety among children. [ McEntee to push ahead with €9m smartphone pouches as study casts doubt over their meritsOpens in new window ] While some large-scale studies are slow to solidify a causal relationship between social media usage and these problems, Cleary has no such reservations. “To me, it’s so bloody obvious that it’s smartphones ... but I’m also at pains to state that it isn’t really about smartphones alone; it’s giving the internet access to your child, through any device. It is not so much what your child does online; it’s what the online world does as soon as it realises who your child is ... this wasn’t so much of a problem before algorithms.” Hilda Hamilton is one of the parents signed up to the “delay smartphones” campaign. A mother of three from Sandymount in Dublin, she is determined to hold off getting a smartphone for her eldest son (12). “My gut feeling is there is something fundamentally wrong with giving a smartphone at that age,” she says. “I know how much I use it and I’m 44. It is so addictive – yet we’re expecting them to have the emotional intelligence to handle it.” She feels parents are being failed by government, regulators and social media companies, but is cheered by the fact that parents are taking action. Like many in the WhatsApp groups, she is thinking of giving her son an old-style Nokia or Balance phone, designed to block addictive content and apps, instead. “I’m pro technology and being able to communicate, but want to delay his access to social media ... It would purely be a means of contacting him. You can still have independence with a normal phone.” Gill Hurley from Dalkey has told her 12-year-old he will not be getting a phone. “Is he delighted? No, but he understands my view ... they don’t have to like it, but if they understand your reasons, I think they will get more on-board ... “I’m not naive and I know the pressure will be on when he starts second level ... but I also know that if I gave him a smartphone, I’d be arguing all the time about apps and screen time. So, this really is the lesser of the two evils.” For some parents involved in the initiative, it is a second chance to take a different path. Ross Staunton gave his daughter in second year a smartphone when she started second level on the basis that all her class would have one. Having seen the impact of it, he wants to delay doing the same for his son who starts secondary school in September. “The crunch time will come in the summer,” he admits. “We’re all talking a good game at the moment and most, I think, are planning to press ahead with it. Even if some do cave in, I’m hopeful there will be enough. It will require bravery from parents. I think if we can hold off until 14 or 15 years of age, you’re doing well.” Eoghan Cleary regularly gives talks to parents at schools about staying safe online. He has been doing it for about eight years but only recently felt a “tipping point” in the level of interest. “Back then there might have been 10 or 14 people in the room turning up. Now, the rooms are packed with hundreds of parents. Parents are more aware. They can see what’s going on with their children and don’t know what to do about it.” One of his key messages, he says, is that parents have power – even if they don’t realise it. “Otherwise, governments are not going to do anything. Yes, there’s a large corporate tech lobby out there. But as soon as the parents come together and say, ‘you need to protect our children online’, they will have to act.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: 5 Low-cost Altcoins with Millionaire-Making Potential

As the fabled altcoin season draws closer, investors have started positioning themselves for the expected growth. Even so, knowing which top crypto coin is primed for an extended rally among the thousands of altcoins available on the market is challenging. Based on expert research and analysis, this piece highlights five top altcoins under a $4 valuation that have the potential to trigger a parabolic surge in the coming weeks. These assets include XRP, Cardano, Tron, Sui, and the ChowWow (CHOW) meme project. Here’s why investing in these altcoins in February could yield significant ROIs for investors in 2025. The last quarter of 2024 was eventful for the XRP token, given the legal victory against the SEC and the token’s significant value growth in the market. Similarly, XRP seeks to consolidate its momentum in Q1 of 2025 and beyond. For context, market stats show that XRP’s price gained over 380% since the start of the last quarter, growing from $0.52 to a price peak of $3.4 in January. Prospectively, XRP is on the right path toward an extended bullish trajectory. That is because of the growing real-world adoption of the project, as evidenced by a partnership between XRP and Unicâmbio to facilitate cross-border transactions between Brazil and Portugal. Similarly, the pursuit of XRP ETF approval from multiple asset management firms like BlackRock, Grayscale, and recent Nasdaq ETF applications all point toward a bullish sentiment that the token harbors. With Bank of America using XRP for all their transactions, the market will likely witness parabolic growth for XRP in 2025. As such, XRP is one of the best altcoins to buy, and HODL for future gains. Despite seeing about an 18% decline within the last month, Cardano (ADA) is on a bullish trajectory. That is because the Cardano blockchain has undergone a revolutionary upgrade, and a possible collaboration with global tech leader Microsoft is on the horizon. For context, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson hinted at a possible collaboration between Cardano and Microsoft, a move that could trigger a chain of bullish uptrend. Also, following Cardano’s latest Plomin Hard Fork upgrade, the network is now fully decentralized, allowing stakeholders the power to vote on the native blockchain. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s filing for a Cardano ETF has elevated the bullish potential of the Cardano token to new heights. Given the heightened bullish sentiment of altcoin since the start of the year, the token is likely to set a new ATH in 2025. Market stats show that the Cardano price is still above the $0.70 support level. As such, a rise above $1 could push the ADA price to a new level. This makes it one of the top altcoins to invest in 2025. The Tron token has witnessed a significant uptrend in value with a 10% price growth within the past month, as per stats from CoinMarketCap. Having recorded an all-time price high of $0.44 on December 4th, the Tron crypto coin declined with the market-wide bearish trend of January. However, investors may gear up for another round of bullish momentum especially considering the positive market trends on the Tron Blockchain. For context, Cointelegraph reports that over $2.02 billion worth of stablecoins have been issued on the Tron network within the first week of February, only second to Ethereum ($2.43 billion). Notably, the Tron network has outpaced Ethereum in revenue inflow over the past months, signaling an increasing transaction volume. As the Tron network continues to see more volume, the value of the TRX token is expected to grow, pushing more market demand and higher growth potential. Although the Tron trading volume is down, the altcoin price is expected to rally when the market recovers. Overall, Tron is one of the top altcoins that is poised for significant growth in 2025. Undoubtedly, the Sui token is undergoing a major price retracement that has seen it lose about 23% in value within the past month as per market stats. However, the retracement could be an opportunity to buy the Sui coin before a likely bullish breakout. It should be noted that Sui’s price recorded an all-time price high of $5.35 on January 6th before the recent market correction. However, the increasing expansion of Sui in the market could trigger a rally for the top altcoin in no time. For context, traders can now buy the Sui token directly in the Phantom wallet. Also, the move to roll out internetless transactions on the Sui network via SMS is another game-changer that will boost the blockchain’s accessibility and volume, increasing Sui’s use case and value over time. While several altcoins have dipped in the past weeks, Sui’s price has maintained support above $3. Crypto analyst Momin, in a tweet on X, expects the Sui crypto price to surge once the market gains clarity, with a high possibility of retesting the $4 mark. Given Sui’s massive potential, the price might surpass $10 in 2025, making it one of the altcoins to watch in the year. Even while in presale, investors have recognized the exponential bullish trajectory of the ChowWow (CHOW) meme coin project. That is why thousands of investors have already purchased the ChowWow presale ahead of launch. With up to 260% ROI projection before launch, ChowWow harbors an even bigger growth potential post-launch. For context, ChowWow is a community-driven meme coin project inspired by the Chinese Chow Chow dog breed. As such, the ChowWow project is a decentralized embodiment of the Chow dog that will provide strong community engagement, intuitive features, and the opportunity to generate fortune on the platform. ChowWow comes with elaborate utilities, such as the play-to-earn feature, which rewards players with gifts that can be converted to real-world value. The stake-to-earn feature is another use case where users can stake their $CHOW tokens and earn up to 8 – 15% in APY, which will be paid monthly. Other exciting community engagements include airdrops, social media campaigns, and competitions. Built on the Solana network, ChowWow will inherit the network’s low fees and faster transaction processing, ensuring that users have a seamless gaming experience. The native token CHOW is used for in-game purchases on the P2E platform. Outside that, it is a means of distributing rewards, cashback, and more. Like Shiba Inu, the CHOW token is deflationary with a buy-and-burn mechanism designed to stabilize the price. All these are likely to boost the price in the long term. Sold for just $0.008, now is the best time to accumulate the meme coin which is picked as the next 100x Solana coin. Visit ChowWow Presale All the top crypto assets reviewed in this piece harbor significant bullish potential and should be considered for investment. However, for investors with limited funds that can’t be invested in all the tokens highlighted, prioritizing the ChowWow presale is likely the best bet. That’s because ChowWow is still in its presale phase and hasn’t witnessed the massive rallies that come with a project launch or crypto exchange listing. Also, the low price entry advantage and high utility offering make ChowWow one of the best altcoins to invest in for investors looking for projects that can easily hit 10x in the coming weeks.

Title: The rumors about the reshuffle at M.M. (and what is true), Nikos, the Sorbonne and Google, the 9-million-euro café, the Sklavenitis-Panteliadis battle

Hello, so as expected, the videos submitted to the investigator regarding the Tempi accident do not show any undeclared cargo in the wagons. Today or tomorrow, the forensic report from the Hellenic Police laboratories regarding their authenticity will be released, and we move on. And I say “expected” because only a suicidal person would voluntarily submit fake videos in such a case. Now you might say, “Can public opinion be convinced that there is no cover-up, as 70%-80% of all polls indicate?” The answer is “no,” but just as people roughly understood that the government didn’t care much about the Tempi issue after the elections, now they will slowly begin to realize that the little system set up against it is not about delivering justice for Tempi. And, of course, part of that system is the trio “Androulakis-Velopoulos-Zoi,” along with the many others who have vested interests, exploiting pain and anger. Patience is needed to watch this whole play unfold. Reshuffle I asked my source about the reshuffle, and you might ask why I ask…on a permanent basis. Well, because when we enter a reshuffle period, it’s good to ask often, as the situation changes very quickly. My reliable source tells me that the reshuffle is set for March. There are no changes at the M.M., Pavlos Marinakis stays there, Kostis Hatzidakis is also not going to be vice president at M.M. (these rumors have been circulating lately), and if there is an addition, it will be the truly significant one of Gerapetritis, which, however, has not yet been decided by the Prime Minister. The Sorbonne at Maximos This afternoon, the officials from the Sorbonne University, who arrived in Athens yesterday evening, will be at Maximos Mansion to present Mitsotakis with their application for establishing the first Greek branch under the Pierrakakis law. Earlier, they will have gone to the Ministry of Education to submit the relevant application. At M.M., there will be the vice president of Sorbonne, Olivier Houdart, the dean of the School of Political and Social Studies, Anne Fossone, the president of the French College of Greece, Stelios Amargianakis, and the director of International Relations, Alexandros Despotopoulos. The five-year operational plan submitted for approval to the competent authorities includes €15 million in investments for a campus, €3 million for cutting-edge research, and over €7 million in scholarships. The plan initially includes three faculties: Law, Economics-Management, and Physical Education, with a prospect of increasing to six faculties within five years, including a School of Media and Communication. Google it, chief! Now, regarding the Sorbonne, we had another comedy episode yesterday with PASOK, especially with its leader Nikos, who mocked Pierrakakis, claiming that this so-called Sorbonne University coming here is fake. Pierrakakis didn’t do much in response, don’t think otherwise, he just wrote a reply telling him that with a simple Google search, Androulakis could find the public French university Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, which is one of the 13 institutions that succeeded the famous University of Paris and has 26,000 students and 1,200 professors. He also responded that this university’s planned investment in Greece is €15 million for a campus and another €10 million for research, scholarships, etc. So, I ask, as good-naturedly as I can, honestly, how hard is it, man, to pick up a phone and ask someone more specialized in education (PASOK had dozens) to give you the right perspective on such a simple issue? But no, Nikos is busy dealing with butchers… At M.M. for Attica’s garbage The government and the Prime Minister himself must immediately make crucial decisions regarding the role of the Unified Waste Management Association, which manages Attica’s waste. After two audit reports on the previous administration’s projects and actions, direct awards, and rodent control contracts, as well as the disciplinary referral for misconduct of five elected officials who participated in the EDSNA administration under Patoulis, the association’s file is being prioritized for evaluation. Reports indicate that a meeting is scheduled at Maximos Mansion today regarding the waste association and the bold decisions the government must make for the future and how it will operate. The agenda of the meeting is unknown, but sources suggest that Mitsotakis’ office has a plan to dissolve EDSNA and temporarily transfer its responsibilities to the president of PEDA (Regional Association of Municipalities of Attica) and mayor of Galatsi, Giorgos Markopoulos. The goal for the new entity is for the Region to have no involvement, with only the municipalities participating, while all major Public-Private Partnership (PPP) waste management projects for Attica will be centrally handled by the Ministry of Environment. What I genuinely don’t understand is, first, how it is possible to dissolve an organization like EDSNA, which is currently under the scrutiny of inspectors and prosecutors following reports of mismanagement? If nothing else, there is a serious ethical issue, and perhaps its dissolution could even be interpreted as a cover-up. And second, are municipalities really being called upon once again to solve Athens’ garbage problem after twenty years? And who guarantees us that there is less corruption there? Petralias’ Concern for Santorini If there is one person who these days has an additional concern about the situation in Santorini, as a competent source tells me, it is the Deputy Minister of Finance Thanos Petralias, who “holds” the treasury. Petralias knows well that last year Santorini accounted for 2.5% of GDP, as the season was booming, and the cruise industry also performed very well. In absolute numbers, Santorini contributed approximately 6 billion to GDP. An additional reason for concern is the stability of the island’s port. So, as you can understand, in the state treasury, they listen with great concern to the scenarios of an extended seismic sequence (and the emergency measures). Duel Between Sklavenitis-Panteliadis and Vardinogiannis’ Entry Competition in wholesale sales for professionals, companies, etc., is heating up. The Sklavenitis group, which owns the The Mart chain, has decided to strengthen its wholesale network to increase its market share, which places it in second place. Sklavenitis’ decision threatens Panteliadis, who has established himself in first place in the market with Metro Cash and Carry. The Mart currently has 14 stores, and the next move from Sklavenitis is expansion into the islands, as it currently has a presence only in Chania and Heraklion. In 2023, The Mart had a turnover of 432 million and net profits of 11 million. I should note that both Sklavenitis and Panteliadis are closely monitoring the move by G. Vardinogiannis to enter the small retail market by acquiring the Smart Shop chain through Motor Oil, which also has stores outside gas stations. Smart Shop does not directly affect the supermarket customer, but it can compete with convenience stores, grocery stores, etc., that are wholesale customers. After 9 Years and 9 Million (for a Bakery) And since we are on the topic of chains and their plans, let me tell you the final cost for Veneti-Jackson Hall on the Milioni pedestrian street in Kolonaki, which is the flagship store of the Veneti network. The store is now operating, and from the moment Veneti took over until it opened to the public, nine years had to pass. During this period, the initial budget of 2 million euros reached 9 million. As you can imagine, amortization is very difficult if not impossible. Capital Increase of 56 Million in Europe Holdings The capital increase being planned by Europe Holdings (the entity resulting from the merger of KLM–Intracom Properties) will be at the level of 56 million euros as part of the strategy that has as its next stage the already agreed acquisition of Europe Insurance for the creation of a business hub with a presence in insurance as well as real estate management. On 6/3, the extraordinary General Assembly for the capital increase is expected to take place, and if the timeline is followed, the process is expected to be completed by the end of April, so that the shareholder changes can then be finalized, through which Nikos Makropoulos, the current owner of the insurance company, will become a shareholder with 10.3% of the new entity, the second largest after Intracom Holdings. The entire venture for Europe Holdings will be completed before Easter. Komarek with McLaren Allwyn, the parent group of OPAP, has signed an agreement that ensures it global exposure to further strengthen its international development. In combination with the long-term partnership it is initiating with Formula 1, it has entered into an official collaboration with the McLaren team, the F1 Constructors’ Champion for 2024. This partnership has a clear goal of strengthening the group’s activities and brand worldwide, and as an official partner of McLaren Racing, the Allwyn logo will appear on the cars and the team’s driver suits. Karel Komarek, owner of Allwyn, has long-standing ties with the world of F1 and, together with David Coulthard—former world champion—has founded, funds, and supports the initiative “More Than Equal” with the goal of preparing for the emergence of the first female Formula 1 World Champion Driver. The Stoiximan boosts OPAP And since we are in a gambling environment, on the sidelines of yesterday’s Stoiximan event that brought the UEFA Europa League and Conference League trophies to Athens, the company’s executives emphasized the excellent performance recorded in the previous year’s financial figures. Stoiximan recorded double-digit growth, driven primarily by the sportsbook, which was strengthened by the major sporting events of the year, especially Euro 2024. This rise, as stated by the executives of the new management team led by Managing Director Nikos Fligos, was also accompanied by a significant increase in new customer registrations, forming a strong base for this year as well. These performances will naturally be reflected in the results of OPAP, which holds an 84.49% stake and maintains exclusive control of Stoiximan and its operations in Greece and Cyprus. OPAP will announce its 2024 financial results on March 19, followed by the annual shareholders’ meeting on March 29. Earlier, the dividend amount will be disclosed, which is eagerly anticipated by the market, as a pre-dividend of 0.60 euros has already been issued. The entrepreneurs aiming to become the country’s largest winemakers A new company has been established by the Georgiadis brothers of Sterner Stenhus, who—beyond their other investments—have set a goal to become the largest winemakers in the country. As is known, they have already incorporated the historic “Boutari” winery under their group’s umbrella (with Semeli joining just a few days ago). The new company, headed by George Rentià, Chief Financial Officer of Sterner Stenhus Greece, is titled “Scalarea Crete Single-Member S.A.” and is based in Fantaxometocho of the Skalani settlement. Its purpose ranges from wine production to holiday accommodations and many other activities, while its initial share capital is 200,000 euros, which “Boutari Wineries S.A.,” represented by Thomas Georgiadis, has undertaken to cover. However, behind this matter lies an interesting backstory. It concerns the Boutari estate in Crete, which includes 73 acres of vineyards, its most modern winery, and even a boutique hotel. The newest and most modernly designed “Boutari” winery was completed in early 2004 and is built outside the village of Skalani, on the Fantaxometocho estate, just 8 km from the center of Heraklion and 4 km from the archaeological site of Knossos. Fantaxometocho, the Georgiadis brothers, and the Logothetis family The Fantaxometocho estate, also known as the “Ghost Estate,” owes its name to the efforts of its first owner to protect it from pirate raids by spreading rumors that ghosts inhabited the property. Beyond the winery, however, a decade ago, through the Scalarea IKE company, founded in June 2014, a plan was initiated to create a small complex with three luxury rooms. Shortly after, a partnership was formed with Aria Hotels, a subsidiary of the Logothetis family (Libra Group), a well-known chain of boutique hotels and independent residences across numerous island and mainland destinations in Greece. At the time, it was stated that “in the spring of 2015, the Boutari winery, through its partnership with Aria Hotels, created the Scalani Hills Boutari Winery and Residences,” which includes three luxury residences named Kotsifali, Malvasia, and Liatiko, housed in the fully renovated old estate. In 2022, Scalarea IKE was renamed “Blue Rock Suites MIKE” and remains part of Aria Hotels. Now, whether the Georgiadis brothers’ new company intends to open another accommodation facility in addition to the winery at Fantaxometocho or take over the existing one, we will see in the coming period. Fais Group’s Prospectus to the Capital Market Commission in Early March Barring unforeseen circumstances, the submission of the Fais Group’s Prospectus is expected within the first ten days of March, aiming to raise 50-60 million euros and list its shares on the Main Market of the Athens Stock Exchange. The management is anticipating a “pleasant surprise” from the 2024 results to complement the Prospectus. In 2023, revenue reached 191.3 million euros (up from 163.2 million euros in 2022), and net profits amounted to 4.7 million euros, up from 2.7 million euros. Sales for 2024 have already exceeded 200 million euros. The Group’s secret weapon lies in its wide range of activities, spanning from the distribution of sportswear and wellness equipment to luxury footwear and accessories, premium & lifestyle fashion products, cosmetics distribution, and, of course, commercial real estate development. The Stock Market Celebrated the “Peace Party” Since March 28, 2011 (during the government of George Papandreou), the General Index of the Athens Stock Exchange had not reached 1,600 points. Fully aligned yesterday with the “peace party” of major European markets, with an impressive increase in transaction value to 212.7 million euros (only 22.11 million in packages), the General Index abandoned its sideways upward movement of recent weeks and surged with a +2.49% increase to 1,600.97 points. The Athens Stock Exchange seems poised today to complete its eighth consecutive week of gains, while the total market capitalization has reached 112 billion euros. To be absolutely precise, the majority of yesterday’s rise in the General Index is undoubtedly due to the Coca Cola 3E stock, which reached a market capitalization of 14.3 billion euros, with an impressive +7.9% increase to 38.5 euros, driven by the excellent financial results announced in the morning and the promise of a 1.03 euros per share dividend, up 11% year-on-year. If half of the index’s rise is attributed to Coca Cola, half of the transaction value is owed to the banks. Piraeus stood out with a 3.9% rise to 4.66 euros, closely followed by National Bank (+3.61%) at 8.6 euros, Alpha Bank (+3.21%) at 1.847 euros, and Eurobank (+2.5%) at 2.46 euros. Not many expect interest rate cuts in the immediate future (which has implications for bank profits), and this sentiment was reflected in the bond market. The 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond yields 4.55%, the German Bond 2.41%, the French Bond 3.10%, and the Greek Bond follows closely at 3.25%. Metlen, which has been on a strong upward trend in recent days, closed at 35.96 euros (+1.87%) and, with a market capitalization nearing 5 billion euros, has secured its entry into the FTSE 100 index in London. TITAN halted its recent decline following TITAN America’s entry into Wall Street and rose +1.17% to close at 43.1 euros. Motor Oil is aiming for its 10th consecutive positive session today, having closed yesterday with a +1.56% increase at 22.2 euros. Not a single stock in the FTSE had a negative sign yesterday. The Largest Artificial Intelligence Data Center in Europe Europe is searching for its own champion in Artificial Intelligence, but developments in the field have come from the United Arab Emirates, which announced an investment of 30 to 50 billion euros for the creation of the largest AI data center in Europe. The project will be built in France and will be the heart of a new “AI campus,” with power reaching up to one gigawatt. This announcement was made during the meeting between French President Emmanuel Macron and UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The French government had already identified 35 locations for the development of AI data centers, emphasizing the country’s strategic importance in the global AI race. The battle for Europe’s AI champion has already begun. The Whole World Is Buying Stocks on Wall Street In the past 12 months, non-U.S. investors have purchased 520 billion dollars’ worth of stocks on Wall Street. This means that foreign investors now control 59% of financial assets in the U.S., surpassing even the levels of the Dot-Com bubble in 2000. For comparison, in the past 12 months, net inflows into emerging markets totaled 220 billion euros, 57% less than the inflows into the U.S. market. Developed markets outside of Wall Street attracted only 20 billion dollars in investment capital inflows. Every day, the entire world is focused on New York. Especially in recent times, with Trump’s daily “surprises,” a massive buying spree has begun among hedge funds, which were net buyers of U.S. stocks for five consecutive days last week, at the fastest pace since November 2024. They selected eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, excluding only financial companies (banks, investment firms, etc.) and the real estate sector. The champion in attracting hedge fund capital was, unsurprisingly, the Information Technology sector. The Planet Is Adopting Cryptocurrencies 43% Faster Than Mobile Phones Cryptocurrencies have now surpassed 300 million users and dedicated followers in just 12 years. According to BlackRock, the planet is adopting cryptocurrencies 43% faster than mobile phones and 20% faster than the internet. Younger generations, inflation fears, and Trump’s pro-crypto stance are fueling the steady upward trend. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to reach 250 billion dollars. Every day, particularly in the U.S., the cryptocurrency market gains “institutional conquests” and popular acceptance. Explore related questions

U.S. electric rates are going up. In Missouri, Ameren increased residential power bills by 11% less than two years ago, and now it is seeking another 15% increase, per the Public Service Commission (PSC). According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), rate increases were experienced in 43 American states between 2023 and 2024. The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. are also the top shareholders of Con Edison, PG&E, and the WEC Energy Group. American Electric Power is the parent company of various local electric companies that serve Americans living in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. According to the Nasdaq, this parent company’s top shareholders are Vanguard Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. as well. When cross-referencing every electric company that is a member of the Edison Electric Institute, one pattern is easily recognized: BlackRock and Vanguard are the top shareholders of the majority of American electric companies. And like their shareholders, these energy companies support the business of “clean energy.” Ameren, Con Edison, PG&E, WEC Energy, and American Electric Power have all committed to “clean energy” solutions, without offering a long-term plan on how these sources will be maintained for the future. “Clean Energy” waste has yet to be addressed by companies investing in “renewables.” It is a new concept even for the United States Environmental Protection Agency. On their website they note that “some end-of-life solar panels contain enough metals, like lead, to meet the definition of hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.” The EPA website also notes the need to update standards for lithium-ion solar battery waste, because “though lithium batteries are generally safe when used, stored, and charged appropriately, these batteries can cause fires when improperly discarded or otherwise mismanaged at the end of their lives.” The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), a division of the American Chemical Society, estimated in 2022 that just 5% of lithium-ion batteries were recycled, adding yet another waste problem for “clean energy.” Add in ecosystem disruption and wildlife loss, and “clean energy” waste is growing into a big problem. Unfortunately, solar power especially has another dirty record: according to the Heritage Foundation, “Roughly 80% of solar components are manufactured in China using slave labor.” Even the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of International Labor Affairs states on its website, “Nearly half of the world’s polysilicon, a key material used to produce solar panels, comes from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR or Xinjiang), a region of China where members of ethnic and religious minority groups are forced by the government to work against their will.” What’s more, Congress held a hearing exploring China’s role in enslaving children and other people in the Democratic Republic of Congo to mine cobalt, a key element in creating lithium-ion batteries. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) highlighted key points of the hearing: Around 70% of the world’s cobalt supply comes from the DRC, and 41% of all batteries containing cobalt are imported from the People’s Republic of China. CECC chairman Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) stated, “From dirt to battery, from cobalt to cars, the entire system is fueled by violence, cruelty, and corruption. ... By ignoring these rights and by treating people including children as expendable, China is committing gross violations of human rights and is seeking to rewrite the international order.” Journalist Stavros Nicolas Niarchos testified, “I have seen how landscapes have been destroyed, water polluted and air filled with dust and carbon as mining companies rush to extract minerals like copper, cobalt, lithium, and phosphates. Oftentimes, human rights abuses go hand in glove with these environmental catastrophes. ... We must also not forget the very real human rights abuses that attend the extraction of battery metals in the DRC. Children are brutalized, women are violated, and men are subject to wage slavery.” “Clean energy” investments and human rights violations surrounding Chinese industry are undeniable, and top American energy investors BlackRock and Vanguard are no strangers to China. In 2023, BlackRock and another global investment company, MSCI, were investigated by the House Select Committee on the CCP and found to have profited from “fueling China’s military.” The committee noted, “BlackRock and MSCI invest or enable the investment of Americans' savings into dozens of blacklisted Chinese companies that threaten US national security or support the Chinese Communist Party's human rights abuses.” Last year, the House Select Committee on the CCP reported that BlackRock had invested at least $1.9 billion in red-flagged and blacklisted companies that fund the military capabilities of the People’s Republic of China and aid its human rights violations. The Coalition for a Prosperous America released a Case Study in 2023, which reported that Vanguard and another investment company, FTSE Russell, invested billions in the CCP. The report found that Vanguard specifically funded dozens of Chinese military subsidiaries and eight Chinese companies that had been blacklisted due to their violations of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). The top shareholders of publicly traded American energy companies have been linked to funding the nation’s largest adversary and its human rights violations. Meanwhile, Americans have been unknowingly footing the bill. But there is another way. Electric Co-Ops are being formed all over the nation. These give residents the power. Instead of publicly trading American energy to any globalist CCP-supporting hedge fund, co-ops are owned by the residents who pay into them. No globalist interference, no slave labor products. Right now, most of us have only a single electricity option, and these publicly traded monopolies are working against us. But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can form more energy co-ops and escape the technocratic globalists preying on publicly traded electric companies, and we can power our homes our way without compromising American values.

Title: Franklin Templeton’s money market fund launches on Solana – Is BlackRock losing ground?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/franklin-templetons-money-market-fund-launches-on-solana-is-blackrock-losing-ground/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T03:00:40Z

With $1.6 trillion under management, why is Franklin Templeton doubling down on blockchain? Franklin Templeton has expanded its tokenized money market fund, Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX), to the Solana [SOL] blockchain, further strengthening its presence in the digital asset space. With $1.6 trillion in assets under management, the firm announced this move on the 12th of February, building on FOBXX’s multi-chain strategy. Originally launched in 2021, the fund has already integrated with Ethereum [ETH], Coinbase’s Base, Aptos [APT], and Avalanche [AVAX], while Stellar [XLM] remains its primary blockchain. Thus, as the third-largest tokenized money market fund, FOBXX is nearing a total asset value of $600 million, highlighting its growing adoption. Additionally, it also holds the distinction of being the world’s first mutual fund to leverage blockchain technology for transaction processing and share ownership recording, with each share represented by a BENJI token. Remarking on the same, Franklin Templeton took to X (formerly Twitter) and said, “New chain unlocked. BENJI is now live on solana! Solana is a fast, secure and censorship resistant Layer 1 blockchain encouraging global adoption via its open infrastructure.” Needless to say, institutional interest in the Solana network has been on the rise, signaling a shift beyond its reputation as a hub for memecoins. In Q3 2024, investments in decentralized applications built on SOL surged by 54%, reaching $173 million, reflecting growing confidence among wealth managers and hedge funds. The token itself has staged a remarkable recovery from the bear market lows of under $10 following FTX’s collapse. It recently hit a 52-week high of $265.10, partly fueled by excitement surrounding former U.S. President Donald Trump’s memecoin launch on the network. Additionally, Solana has emerged as the dominant platform for launching new tokens, particularly within decentralized trading. A report from Pantera Capital revealed that SOL now accounts for over 90% of new tokens listed on decentralized exchanges—an extraordinary jump from just 1% at the end of 2023. Echoing similar sentiments, Cosmo Jiang and Eric Wallach in the same report noted, “Even when innovation doesn’t start on Solana, it eventually finds its way there.” However, as the firm strengthens its foothold, it faces growing competition from BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which has surged past Franklin’s BENJI token in market capitalization, reaching $637 million. With tokenized treasury products now totaling $3.6 billion, the race for dominance in this emerging sector is intensifying. Beyond its money market fund, Franklin Templeton has been actively expanding its crypto offerings, launching Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs while seeking SEC approval for a Crypto Index ETF. Its latest move—a Delaware-based trust linked to a Solana ETF—further highlights its strategic push into blockchain-based investment products. Therefore, as institutions embrace tokenized assets, Franklin Templeton’s innovation could help shape the future of digital finance.

Druid Hunter Mage Priest Rogue Shaman Warlock December 9, 2024 Season of Discovery December 10, 2024 Season of Discovery December 11, 2024 Season of Discovery December 9, 2024 Season of Discovery The hotfix above was implemented to make it so that the Mixology benefit (where an Alchemist could create 2-5 flasks if they had completed the required quest) now works correctly. It was not working before, due to the stack limitation. Your local Alchemist was not holding out on you, they just weren’t getting procs until the fix above was implemented.
