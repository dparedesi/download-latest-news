Full Content:
Margarita Olegovna Louis-Dreyfus. This is the first name that stands out in the shareholder structure of the company Leonidsport, which submitted a public offer for 21% of the shares of the Thessaloniki Port Authority (OLT). She is the widow of Robert Louis-Dreyfus and head of the French giant Louis-Dreyfus, one of the most powerful conglomerates on the planet. “Tsarina,” is the nickname used for her by the French and American press due to her Russian origins, even though she does not come from a noble family or ultra-wealthy oligarchs from Russia, as one might imagine. The fourth wealthiest woman in Europe and one of the wealthiest in the world today, with a fortune exceeding 5 billion euros, the woman who controls global agricultural product trade and has powerful businesses in every sector of the economy one can think of, was once a poor orphan from the Soviet Union, educated thanks to the sacrifices of her grandfather. From Leningrad to the top of the world Her grandfather, Leonid Bogdanov, also raised her after her parents were killed in a train accident in 1969, when Margarita was just 7 years old. Bogdanov believed that the greatest wealth he could give Margarita was education and did everything he could to provide it. After graduating from school, she left Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and studied law at Moscow State University. Immediately after, she pursued a master’s degree at the Institute of Soviet Trade in Leningrad, where she obtained degrees in economics. After completing her studies, Margarita left the Soviet Union, where opportunities were limited. Armed with her high educational level, sharp mind, and impressive appearance, she secured a job as a salesperson at the German microchip and electronics company Laytron AG. Her grandfather, Leonid, whose name was given— as one can easily guess— to the company that is “entering” OLT, lived to see his beloved granddaughter “settled,” with a good job and prospects. Not family-wise, though, since in the mid-1980s Margarita married a Swiss student, with whom she divorced a year later. However, he did not live to see her become a powerful woman, as he passed away in 1985. In 1988, Margarita was on a flight from Zurich to London. Fate had her sitting next to Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the French businessman with an MBA from Harvard, who was constantly “in the air” because he managed the companies of the commercial giant founded by his great-grandfather in 1851. Margarita didn’t know this when she asked him what time it was. Nor did she know when they “clicked,” because, aside from telling her the time, he showed her a picture of his fluffy British shepherd dog (Bobtail) to attract the attention of the striking blonde sitting next to him. Something he succeeded at, as well as getting her phone number. A few days later, Robert called Margarita, asking her to translate a document into Russian. “You know, you could have asked me to go out to dinner without needing any translation,” she responded. “Alright,” he murmured, and their love story inevitably led to their marriage in 1992. After the marriage, Margarita acquired Swiss citizenship and became a full-time mother, caring for the three children she had with Robert: Eric and the twin boys, Kiril and Maurice. Meanwhile, Robert Louis-Dreyfus had created a new business empire without using a single cent from the conglomerate he was about to inherit—he was not involved in it anyway. He had made a fortune from poker (!) and was about to build an even greater fortune by rescuing failing businesses like the sports giant Adidas and the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi. Among the dozens of companies he managed in Europe, Australia, Asia, and the Americas, he became more and more involved in sports. In 1996, he made headlines by purchasing the historic French football club Marseille (Olympique de Marseille). His joy at becoming involved in European professional football would not last long. A year later, he was diagnosed with leukemia. The disease was very aggressive, and as his battle became more intense, he gradually entrusted Margarita with more and more responsibilities. In 2000, he returned to the family agricultural giant, the Louis-Dreyfus Group, which his great-grandfather had founded in 1851. In 2008, he founded Akira Holding to transfer 61% of Louis-Dreyfus, which he would gather, to her. Robert sensed that his end was near and anticipated what could happen to other giants: The board might “throw out” his wife to take control and transfer the company to another conglomerate. Thus, in 2008, he locked the shares for 99 years and appointed Margarita as the family trustee, ensuring that the aforementioned scenario could not happen. When he died in July 2009, at the age of 63, he left her in the strongest position on the three-member board, overseeing the largest share of the company, headquartered in Amsterdam, the third-largest agricultural products company in the world. But Margarita, after her husband’s death, did everything she could to fulfill his last wish, as he expressed it to her shortly before he passed away. “Do what I did. Maintain and grow the company to pass it on to our heirs,” their children. The new life It wasn’t an easy task. Yes, Robert had “locked” the shares so that no other shareholders or members could remove her from the board, but Margarita had to fight to earn respect, not just in the business world but even in the companies she controlled. “It’s a man’s world, and most of the time, men don’t take women seriously,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg, speaking about her business career. Margarita didn’t settle for the (more than comfortable) life of being the widow and heir of one of the wealthiest people in the world. She took action as president of Louis-Dreyfus companies and also Marseille, where she recently managed to fend off an aggressive takeover attempt by Saudi Prince Al-Waleed. And she made remarkable changes in the group. She sold the energy trading company and acquired more shares in Louis-Dreyfus, strengthening her position in it. At the same time, she was “building” the future for her three sons. She sent the twins to a school in Singapore “to expose them to new cultures and broaden their horizons,” as she said in an interview, while Eric studied in the USA and began his career as an intern at another commodity giant, Glencore, to gain the necessary experience. Margarita never stayed in the shadows. She earned the prestige and respect of the most powerful business circles on the planet and… inevitably began mingling with Europe’s elite. In the stands of the Stade Vélodrome (the home of Olympique Marseille), she was often photographed with French Presidents, such as Nicolas Sarkozy and the now-powerful head of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. From 2013 onward, in these photos, she would often appear with the former head of the Swiss National Bank and later vice-president of BlackRock, Philippe Hildebrandt. Their joint appearances would become the subject of discussion since, that year, Hildebrandt would divorce his wife, Kasia, after becoming involved in a trading scandal. This scandal also cost Hildebrandt his job, as Kasia is said to have made a significant profit with insider information about Switzerland’s monetary policy. Although there isn’t much information about Margarita Louis-Dreyfus’ personal life, in 2021, Louis Dreyfus Group confirmed journalistic reports that Margarita gave birth to twin girls, with the statement “the mother and babies are in excellent health,” without any mention of the father. How big is the Louis-Dreyfus Group? But how big and powerful can Louis Dreyfus be, for Margarita to be called “Tsarina”? If annual sales of 120 billion (net revenue of around 50-60 billion dollars yearly), operations in 100 countries, and 22,000 employees don’t say much to you, then perhaps the “ABCD” can. The four companies that dominate global agricultural product trade and primarily grains—Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus—are known as “ABCD.” These four companies were also involved in the 2011 scandal about grain price manipulation and tax evasion in Argentina. The French company represents about 10% of global agricultural trade flows, is the world’s largest cotton and rice trader, and the second-largest sugar trader. It is also the third-largest trader of copper, zinc, and lead concentrates globally, only behind Glencore and Trafigura. Louis Dreyfus is not just involved in agriculture and food processing. It also operates in international shipping with a fleet of oceangoing vessels, freight transportation, banking (owning the French bank Louis Dreyfus and shares in other banks), telecommunications infrastructure development, real estate management, and trades everything from minerals to Brazilian coffee, also owning several hedge funds. LD was founded in 1851 by Leopold Dreyfus, an 18-year-old Alsatian Jew, who became wealthy from his adolescence by buying and reselling grain from farmers to more distant regions. Leopold Dreyfus thus created one of Europe’s strongest dynasties. To this day, the company he founded is owned and managed by descendants of the same family. OLT and the Shareholders Margarita Louis-Dreyfus is now poised to take a leading role in Greek business life after submitting an optional public offer to acquire up to 2,116,800 shares of OLT, representing 21% of the company’s capital, through the company “Leonidsport B.V.” The company, which bears the name of Margarita’s grandfather, began the process yesterday, informing the Capital Markets Commission and OLT’s Board of Directors, submitting the information prospectus to them. The offered cash price for acquiring each share in the Public Offer is 27 euros. It should be noted that OLT’s stock closed at 22.88 euros yesterday, which is a premium of more than 17% compared to the price of the company’s shares. Explore related questions

Title: Curve Finance network activity doubles in 2024 – Will it fuel CRV value in 2025?

Is strong network growth enough for CRV to reverse its recent losses? Curve Finance’s user base more than doubled in 2024, reinforcing the nearly 500% gains logged by its native token, CRV, during its November pump. According to an exclusive 2024 report shared with AMBCrypto, the decentralized exchange (DEX) saw its unique users grow from 30k in 2023 to 60k in 2024 – A whopping 105% increase on a YoY (year-on-year) basis. The TVL also soared from $1.7B in early November to $2.4B in early January. This indicated improved trust and investor confidence in the DEX as more capital was locked in its smart contracts. Source: DeFiLlama The report cited new product features and institutional interest as key drivers of the user base. In fact, in late November, BlackRock chose Curve for liquidity and trading of its tokenized asset BUIDL. This indicated institutional interest in the DEX, which has also been evident on the price charts. Despite the weak market sentiment at press time, CRV still held about 280% of the gains logged during the November pump. The recent pullback eased at the demand zone of $0.6-$0.7 (cyan), and the price action chalked a triangle pattern. A bullish breakout from the pattern could make the $1.5 target feasible. However, a bearish breakout could erase more November gains and push the price to $0.26. Source: CRV/USDT, TradingView That being said, the weak sentiment and negative 30-day MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) suggested that CRV was relatively cheap at its press time price. The 30-day MVRV was down 10% while the 60-day MVRV was positive at 12%. This indicated that those who bought the coin in the past one and two months had, on average, an unrealized loss of 10% and a profit of 12%, respectively.

Mel (and, I :) agree ... vid, at link ... Mel Gibson drops a bombshell on Fox News, accusing the California state government of possibly starting the fires on purpose.

The lost interest payments can be added to the principle of the loan. It would protect both the bank and the borrower. Also, they stopped maintaining the firebreaks and let them get full of flammable biomass. There are J6 political prisoners who have nowhere to go after Trump’s frees them in a few days. Lara Loomer apparently has an organization set up to help house them. They cancelled the insurance because California prevented them from raising their rates. They didn’t want to operate at a loss. Watch for questions about ‘lithium batteries’ when the investigations start. Where to go? If you are a die hard Fascist Demoncrat, and wish to stay in California, go squat on Newscum’s mansion. If you desire to leave the state, move to NY or other Red State so as not to incur culture shock. Not only did they cancel insurance coverage, in our case, they increased our rates from $100 a month to $600 a month with no explanation. We live in Northern California and are nowhere near a catastrophic fire zone. There are orchards and rice farms and other agricultural fields nearby but nothing like the canyons and mountains like they have in SoCal. “There really should be a law that mortgage payments are paused on a mortgage for 6 months after a total home loss in a federal or state disaster zone. ” Lenders will work with homeowners in this situation. Lotta lawyers are gonna get A LOT richer! Insanity. Sounds like you might be near the area where we had family, years ago. Lots of orchards and rice farms. Not when the value of the empty lot exceeds the value of the mortgage they won't. The lender will squeeze the destitute and homeless homeowner until they can foreclose on the property and make a windfall. It’s all part of the plan. The land was expensive and TPTB want it for cheap. Time to put the squeeze on the rightful owners to get them off. Deny them insurance, Deny them grace periods for mortgage pymts. And deny them FEMA help. We’ll give you 5 cents on the dollar and time for you to move on.

Title: Is Imperial Oil Limited (IMO) the Best Canadian Dividend Stock to Buy For Income Investors?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imperial-oil-limited-imo-best-023553093.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy For Income Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) stands against the other Canadian dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are favored by investors not only in the US but also internationally. Canadian dividend companies, known for their robust cash flows, steady dividends, and solid balance sheets, have been particularly popular. However, these stocks lost some appeal in recent years as investors shifted their focus to other asset classes. According to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, there is now a renewed interest in Toronto's dividend-paying stocks, which had been overlooked for over two years. This resurgence is expected to grow as short-term interest rates in Canada continue to decline. An analyst at the bank, Ian de Verteuil, noted in a research report that the shift back to high-yielding equities, such as utilities, REITs, and communications, is just beginning. If interest rates continue to decline, the team anticipates that Canadian investors will redirect approximately $220 billion (US$161 billion) into dividend-paying stocks, moving away from fixed-income products. During periods of higher interest rates in Canada, dividend-paying equities were largely overlooked as investors sought better returns in term deposits, high-interest savings account ETFs, and technology stocks. As a result, the S&P/TSX Composite High Dividend Index has underperformed compared to the broader Canadian and US markets in both 2023 and the early part of 2024, in terms of both price appreciation and total returns. Also read: Early Retirement Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Live Off Dividends The recent underperformance of dividend stocks contrasts with their historical resilience. According to a report by Morningstar, following the 2008 financial crisis, investors gravitated toward income-focused strategies, valuing the perceived safety they offered. In 2008, funds in the Canadian Dividend and Income Equity category experienced a 24% loss, significantly less than the 33% drop in the Canadian benchmark index. Similarly, in 2011, when the TSX fell over 8%, the average fund in this category declined by only 0.8%. The report further mentioned that since 2008, dividend-focused funds have excelled at protecting investors' capital during market downturns, capturing just 65% of the downside. These funds have also performed well during market upswings, capturing 75% of the gains. From January 2008 to June 2015, this category outperformed the broader market, delivering an annualized return of 4.7% compared to 3.7% for the TSX. Concentrating on higher-yielding Canadian stocks would involve increasing exposure to sectors already heavily represented in the index, particularly financials. To achieve high yields, analysts recommend directing investments toward utilities, REITs, telecommunications, and financial sectors. Ian de Verteuil advised that Canadian investors should maintain this shift into these sectors in the future. However, he pointed out that securing high yields in Canada is challenging, as the high-yield bond market is quite restricted. Here are some other remarks from the analyst: “Canadian investors have always struggled to find yield. Unlike the US, there are very few options for ‘high’ nominal yield – there is no Canadian municipal bond market and the high-yield bond market north of the border is extremely narrow.” While Canadian dividend equities present an attractive option for investors, analysts consistently recommend diversifying across various regions to optimize returns. Due to the tendency of dividend investing to result in a heavier concentration of financial and energy stocks—common in the domestic market—income-focused investors should ensure their portfolios are well-diversified and aligned with their income objectives. That said, we will take a look at some of the best dividend Canadian stocks for income investors. Our Methodology: For this article, we scoured the list of S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes Canadian companies with at least five years of dividend growth track records. From that list, we selected stocks that are traded on American stock exchanges and sorted them by the number of hedge fund holders in our database that also had positions in those companies at the end of Q3 2024. This means that these Canadian companies are the most famous among hedge fund investors. The companies mentioned below also have strong dividend histories and healthy balance sheets, which make them reliable investment options for income investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them as of Q4. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) A close-up of an oil rig in motion with the ocean shining in the background. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22 Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO), a petroleum refining company based in Calgary, is primarily owned by ExxonMobil, which holds a 69.7% stake in the company. Over the past five years, the stock has significantly outperformed the TSX, soaring nearly 175% compared to the benchmark index's 44% return. This performance was fueled by the company's strong operational performance. In the most recent quarter, it reported the highest upstream production in over three decades and ongoing reductions in upstream unit cash costs. Additionally, the company achieved robust downstream utilization while successfully carrying out major planned turnaround activities at its Nanticoke and Strathcona refineries, all while maintaining safety standards. In the third quarter of 2024, Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) reported that Kearl achieved a production rate of 295,000 total gross oil-equivalent barrels per day, with the company's share amounting to 209,000 barrels, matching its highest-ever third-quarter output. Cold Lake's production reached 147,000 gross oil-equivalent barrels per day, driven by a strong initial ramp-up of the Grand Rapids project, showcasing impressive performance. Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) also remained resilient in terms of its cash position. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at approximately C$1.5 billion. It also returned C$322 million to shareholders through dividends. On November 1, 2024, Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) declared a quarterly dividend of C$0.60 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. Overall, the company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 30 consecutive years, which makes IMO one of the best dividend Canadian stocks. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.49%, as of January 10. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) grew to 22 in Q3 2024, from 18 in the previous quarter. These stakes are worth over $186.3 million in total. Among these hedge funds, First Eagle Investment Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall IMO ranks 9th on our list of the best Canadian dividend stocks for income investors. While we acknowledge the potential for IMO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Meta and Amazon axe diversity initiatives joining US corporate rollback
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmy7xpw3pyo?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D

Meta and Amazon are axing their diversity programmes, joining firms across corporate America that are rolling back hiring and training initiatives criticised by conservatives, citing legal and political risks. The move comes just days after Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans. In a memo to staff about its decision, which affects, hiring, supplier and training efforts, Meta cited a "shifting legal and policy landscape". Walmart and McDonalds are among the other companies to have made similar decisions regarding diversity efforts since Trump won re-election. In its memo to staff, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by the BBC, Meta cited a Supreme Court ruling concerning race in college admissions, while also noting that the term "DEI" (diversity, equity and inclusion) had become "charged". The tech giant said it would continue to look for diverse staff, but end its current approach, which seeks to make selections from a pool of diverse candidates. In a December memo to employees, Amazon said it was "winding down outdated programs and materials" related to representation and inclusion, aiming to complete the process by the end of 2024. "Rather than have individual groups build programs, we are focusing on programs with proven outcomes — and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture," Candi Castleberry, Amazon's VP of inclusive experiences and technology, wrote in the note which was first reported by Bloomberg on Friday. Financial firms JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, also pulled out of groups focused on risks from climate change this week. The moves are a sign of the acceleration of a retreat that started two years ago, as Republicans ramped up attacks on firms such as BlackRock and Disney, accusing them of "woke" progressive activism and threatening political punishment. Big brands such as Bud Light and Target also faced backlash and boycotts related to their efforts to appeal to LGBTQ customers. Many of the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives were put in place after the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in 2020 following George Floyd's murder at the hands of police. Recent court decisions have bolstered critics of the programmes, who said that they were discriminatory. The Supreme Court in 2023 struck down the right for private universities to consider race in admissions decisions. Another court of appeals ruling invalidated a Nasdaq policy that would have required companies listed on that stock exchange to have at least one woman, racial minority or LGBTQ person on their board or explain why not. Meta said it was also ending its efforts to work with suppliers who are "diverse" but will instead focus on small and medium-sized companies. It also plans to stop offering "equity and inclusion" training and instead offer programmes that "mitigate bias for all, no matter your background". Meta declined to comment on the memo, news of which was immediately met with both criticism and celebration. "I'm sitting back and enjoying every second of this," said conservative activist Robby Starbuck, who has taken credit for successfully campaigning against the policies at companies such as Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson. LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign said workplace inclusion policies help to attract and retain top staff and had been "directly tied to long-term business growth". "Those who abandon these commitments are shirking their responsibility to their employees, consumers, and shareholders" RaShawn "Shawnie" Hawkins, the senior director of the HRC Foundation's Workplace Equality Program said. Meta's move comes just days after the tech giant said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by Trump and Republicans and elevated conservatives to key leadership positions. In a nearly three-hour interview with podcaster Joe Rogan Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said he had always been concerned about being the arbiter of "truth" and was "ill-prepared" when the issue first heated up after the 2016 election. He said the demands to take down information became unreasonable under the Biden administration. For example, he said the company faced pressure during the pandemic to remove content like statements about vaccine side effects. That helped to generate a wider political backlash, he said, including his own. "I feel like I have much greater command now of what I think the policies should be," he said, adding that he felt the US government "should be defending its companies ... not be the tip of the spear attacking". "When the US does that to its tech industry, it's basically just open season around the rest of the world," he added. His exit comes amid a dispute over his report into Donald Trump's handling of classified documents. In an exclusive interview, Ian Russell tells the BBC that he believes there is "no real movement" within government on online safety. The US companies join other major firms donating funds for the ceremony on 20 January. Donald Trump will still take office as the first US president with a felony conviction.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 S&P 500 Stocks on Jim Cramer's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stands against the other S&P 500 stocks. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently discussed the current state of the market and also discussed both the leading and lagging stocks within the S&P 500. He posed an intriguing question: What if Trump's tariffs are more negotiable than expected? Instead of a hard-line approach, Cramer suggested they could end up being more like a "steak knife" than a "meat axe," meaning less harmful to trade and international relations. READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently and 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar While a more reasonable tariff policy might not be ideal for global trade, it would be a positive development for stocks, particularly if it results in lower prices for American consumers or if multinational companies move their manufacturing to more favorable countries. Cramer emphasized that, for stockholders looking for growth, hopes should be placed on negotiable tariffs. “If you own stocks and you want them higher, you have to hope for negotiable tariffs that could cause countries to lower prices to us or make multinational companies move their manufacturing base here to a more friendly country.” Cramer also discussed the S&P 500's performance this year, noting that, while it is clear which stocks have thrived in the Nasdaq, the winners and losers in the broader S&P 500 have been more difficult to pinpoint. Additionally, Cramer mentioned that several of the stocks in his Charitable Trust, which are reliant on a rebound in China, are ones he’s not excited about at the moment, especially considering the disappointing Chinese economic data. He mentioned that his dismay for such stocks will only last until “they annualize the crummy Chinese numbers and then they'll probably bounce back.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 2. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33 Cramer started the list of S&P 500’s losers in 2024 with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) and said: “How about the S&P’s biggest losers? Wow, they are powerful, powerfully bad. Starting with Walgreens, down 64%. Here's a company that needs a buyer or buyers, maybe some for the front of the store, decimated by Amazon, some for the back, which could be used as a dispensary for all sorts of drugs. CEO Tim Wentworth, he's real good. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), while a major player in the retail pharmacy industry, has faced considerable financial challenges in recent years, with its stock plummeting by over 80% in the past five years. This decline has largely been driven by heightened competition from tech-driven retailers like Walmart and Amazon. The company is undergoing a turnaround plan that includes considering asset sales, implementing cost-cutting measures, and closing 1,200 underperforming stores. CEO Tim Wentworth pointed out that despite these difficulties, around 6,000 of its 8,000 stores are still profitable. Additionally, in early 2024, the company made a significant move by cutting its dividend yield by 48%, with a focus on better capital allocation. After The Wall Street Journal reported in December that Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is in discussions to be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners, Morgan Stanley analyst Erin Wright stated that while the firm understands the context of a potential sale amid a challenging pharmacy environment, a buyout is difficult to envision due to Walgreens' significant debt and low cash flow, which complicates the value creation potential. Wright has assigned an Underweight rating to the stock. Overall WBA ranks 6th on our list of the S&P 500 stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of WBA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WBA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 29 Stocks Ahead Of Major AI Event. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. In his appearance on Squawk on the Street the day CES took place in Las Vegas, Jim Cramer commented on the stock market division that persisted throughout 2024 and is present in 2025 as well. The division has seen technology stocks perform well, while other rate-sensitive sectors such as industrial and materials stocks have languished. Cramer commented on the reasons behind it: “I think that’s because people perceive that the rest of the market is hostage to rates. And that tech is not hostage to anything. So I’m aware of that and I’m just concerned that you have this speech tonight, nine-thirty Jensen Huang, everyone’s, we’re really kind of, whatever he says, is going to move things.” In fact, this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared that it commented about “private equity and private equity trying to get into the 401(k) business.” He added and mentioned, “Marc Rowan CEO of Apollo says, I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement [inaudible] to NVIDIA’s performance! So [inaudible] we’ve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand, there’s these stocks are, they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them!” However, even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates, they might falter in some circumstances. One of these can be bond yields, and if the thirty-year yield spikes to 5%, then Cramer believes “that will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time, there’s now reacceleration in tech spend.” The CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day. He stated “I think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases. This is tonight’s CES talk. It wouldn’t surprise me if we start hearing about robots. It wouldn’t surprise me if we didn’t hear a lot about Tesla. Tesla and self-driving cars. Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA!” Along with industrial and material stocks, another sector that’s caught Cramer’s attention is banks. Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that “one of the groups that I think we have to focus on, there’s a really interesting, uh, Barclays piece on the banks. Darkest before dawn. Raising the group for the first time since 2019, emphasis here on Citi.” Cramer also outlined that while technology valuations might appear to be overstretched, this isn’t the case with banks. He shared “This is a group that when you look at it, they’re selling at 11 times 2026 numbers. So the idea that you have this valuation problem in the market, well look at these stocks! There’s no valuation problem with materials. Or with banks.” He added “The valuation problem is with the stuff that keeps getting upgraded, which is enterprise software. So there’s a little duplicitous nature among the top people who work at these firms because they should be saying look, there are two markets. There’s the inexpensive market and we’re warming up to it, and the expensive market, and we don’t know what to do.” To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on Monday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 72 Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is a mega-American media company with a presence in the broadband, broadcasting, and production markets. Like its peers, the firm has struggled in an era where the Internet has allowed streaming companies like Netflix to prosper and steal customers from traditional media. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)’s shares are down 14% year-to-date amidst a flurry of news such as a potential spin-off of legacy television networks such as CNBC. Here’s what Cramer had to say about Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA): “Now, we have a deal with Starlink in the Italian government. Well, we have Starlink when it comes to WiFi, when do we have Starlink when it comes to cable and telco in this country? There was an article in Barron’s about the parent company that we work for Comcast. And they threw the book at it. The proverbial cyber book since there’s no phonebook anymore. But the one thing I would say is they didn’t talk about Starlink. And the existential crisis that’s coming given the fact that Starlink, at least in Italy, presents a rate card that’s so below the normal rate card that you just have no choice but to take it. And the payback is in three months. So we have to be recognizing that Musk, and I think the next thing you’re going to hear about, is Starlink versus ATT, Verizon, T-Mobile, which had two downgrades today, and the wireless companies. Overall, CMCSA ranks 10th on our list of stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of CMCSA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why SoundHound AI, Inc. (SOUN) Skyrocketed in Q4

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 AI Stocks That Skyrocketed in Q4. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) stands against other stocks that skyrocketed in Q4. AI has been dominating the news, market, and basically almost everything we come across for the last two years, since the launch of ChatGPT. In 2024, AI made significant strides, especially in agentic systems and smaller, more efficient models. In addition to that, advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (a method that combines information retrieval with text generation) improved data accuracy and reduced AI errors, while smaller models became faster and more energy-efficient, making AI more accessible. However, the year also saw a rise in AI-driven cybercrime, with deepfakes used in scams and election interference. As these risks grew, governments and regulators began to implement measures to control AI’s development and use. However, opinions on the balance between innovation and safety remain divided. While AI continues to evolve and shows immense long-term potential, it still faces challenges such as data limitations, model reliability, and the need for revenue-generating applications. With the maturity of this technology, it will be crucial to address these obstacles in order to meet investor expectations and unlock its full potential in the coming years. Julie Biel, chief market strategist and portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick, discussed the current state of AI investments in a CNBC interview and noted that while significant capital has been poured into developing the technology, much of it is still at the infrastructure stage. She pointed out that AI’s efficiency improvements are beneficial, but the lack of revenue-generating use cases is preventing broader enthusiasm. Biel also raised concerns about a potential AI bubble, as she mentioned issues such as hallucinations and data limitations that could become a hurdle in short-term progress. Despite the strong long-term outlook, she suggested that investors’ patience may wear thin if immediate returns do not materialize. In another CNBC interview, Anastasia Amoroso, iCapital chief investment officer, highlighted the continued growth of AI as a major theme in 2024, especially its expansion into AI software and power. She noted that while the last two years focused on semiconductors, this year should focus on AI software monetization and the energy demands of AI infrastructure, like data centers. Amoroso believes that AI will remain a key investment opportunity into 2025 and that the sector’s broadening scope, including AI software and its supporting power needs, presents solid prospects for growth. For this article, we listed 15 best-performing stocks from Insider Monkey’s database of AI stocks with at least over 100% share price returns in the fourth quarter of 2024. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their share price performance. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 database of 900 elite hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A software engineer focused on a computer screen, writing code to create a conversational assistant. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 11 Stock Price Performance in Q4 2024: ~326% SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) provides voice AI solutions that help businesses create conversational experiences. Its offerings include platforms for building voice assistants, tools for real-time data integration, and AI-powered customer service solutions. The company also provides technologies like speech recognition, natural language understanding, and text-to-speech to enhance functionality. The start of 2025 has not been so good for SoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) but it had quite the run in the fourth quarter of 2024. It achieved some notable milestones in the quarter including its Amelia conversational AI platform winning the XCelent Advanced Technology 2024 Award from Celent for its exceptional functionality and generative AI capabilities in retail banking. Moreover, the company’s AI was integrated into Lancia Ypsilon vehicles’ S.A.L.A. infotainment system, enhancing driver experience with conversational AI features across several European countries. In November, SoundHound’s (NASDAQ:SOUN) voice technology was integrated into Kia vehicles in India, offering Hindi language support and advanced conversational capabilities for a personalized in-car experience. The company also announced in the same month that its Amelia AI agents have helped Apivia Courtage handle over 100,000 customer calls, reducing direct inquiries by 20% and enhancing employee productivity. In December 2024, SoundHound AI launched its Smart Ordering system at all 130 Torchy’s Tacos locations, enabling customers to place accurate, natural voice orders. Additionally, SoundHound’s Dynamic Drive-Thru solution was deployed at Church’s Texas Chicken, enhancing order accuracy and reducing wait times through AI-powered, real-time feedback. Meanwhile, SoundHound’s Amelia Conversational AI Platform was recognized as a leader in Frost & Sullivan’s 2024 Radar for Enterprise Conversational AI in Healthcare, showing its innovative solutions that improve patient engagement and streamline healthcare operations. However, it is important to note that despite posting record third-quarter 2024 results, including an 89% revenue increase to $25.1 million, on November 12, the company stock dropped around 17% by the next day. Analysts had mixed views about the stock. For example, Wedbush remained positive on the stock, while Ladenburg Thalmann downgraded the stock to Neutral due to concerns about the Amelia AI acquisition’s impact on margins and higher expected losses. Overall, SOUN ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that skyrocketed in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of SOUN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SOUN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

While it was one of the first firms to benefit from investors’ interest in AI stocks, the momentum has cooled off since July 2024. Investors are in a wait-and-watch mode for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s stock as they evaluate whether the billions of dollars it has spent on OpenAI will lead to profitability for its Azure Cloud computing division. Cramer’s comments for the firm surrounded a recent AI blog post by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s vice chair and president Brad Smith: “Brad Smith’s, his blog entry, it’s really much more than that. He’s talking about an AI manifesto. And the reason why I say it’s important is cause a lot of people say listen he’s talking about $80 billion in spend, so what. No he’s not. He’s talking about the new industrial revolution. Which is what you should be hearing tonight from Jensen. The new industrial revolution is such that you can’t afford to not spend. Not because you’re worried about what other people are doing, but because it’s so bountiful.” Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Cramer is also appreciative of Agentforce as he commented on a bearish Guggenheim note: “And interesting[ly], the Salesforce [bearish analyst note] you mentioned, is the, one of the few where there’s not to be acceleration. I think that is dead wrong. I think that analyst has missed the whole move, I think Agentforce is incredible. It’s starting to really make for my work. Agentforce is coming on very strong. [inaudible] post this morning by Marc Benioff, saying it’s really going after healthcare. And the easy one there is Viva. And I think Viva is a really high multiple stock, I think Marc sees a lot of opportunity in that. Agentforce represents an acceleration of sales at Salesforce, and I’m saying that my research is necessarily better than that analyst. I am saying that I’m close enough to recognize it. Agentforce ads are working. And that Agentforce is doing quite well in different verticals that have eluded Salesforce.” Overall, CRM ranks 4th on our list of stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: ‘A Huge Win’: Woke ‘Cartel’ Of Financial Giants Dealt Death Blow 11 Days Before Trump Takes Office

Asset management behemoth BlackRock wrote a letter to institutional investors Thursday announcing its exit from an emissions-focused investor group, according to the Financial Times (FT). The firm, which manages over $10 trillion and has been a leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, has left the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) coalition — a United Nations–sponsored collection of financial services companies that have pledged to achieve net-zero portfolios by 2050 or sooner, the FT reported. The move comes less than two weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, who plans to embrace fossil fuels in his second term, takes office, and follows the exits of a slew of other corporations, including Goldman Sachs Group, Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (RELATED: UN Reportedly Moves To Unlock Tens Of Millions In Climate Funding For Country Run By Terrorists) In the letter to investors, vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand wrote that the asset manager’s membership in NZAM had “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” according to the FT. This is a huge win for consumers and a decent start for @BlackRock rolling back their destructive influence on our economy. However, they still need to undo a lot of horrible incentives they put in place for corporate executives via ESG. Not just NetZero targets, but demanding… https://t.co/aUlQ28OIcs — Will Hild (@WillHild) January 9, 2025 The firm began its ESG initiative in 2020, with CEO Larry Fink stating that “climate risk is investment risk” and that climate change would spark a “fundamental reallocation of capital.” However, the world’s largest asset manager exit has been backpedaling on its ESG efforts as of late, only supporting about 4% of the 493 environmental and social investment proposals shareholders put forward between the end of June 2023 and the end of June 2024, down from a rate of 47% in 2021. BlackRock has also walked back some of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, editing their DEI language to be less racially oriented. Fellow investment firm Vanguard left NZAM in 2022, while financial services firm State Street remains in the environmental coalition. “The news of BlackRock’s departure from NZAM should be music to the ears of every American consumer,” Will Hild, executive director of conservative nonprofit Consumers’ Research, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “NZAM is an illegitimate cartel of asset managers pushing harmful and costly net zero policies across the entire economy. The activities of NZAM and its members raise prices on Americans everywhere from the gas pump to the grocery store.” When reached for comment, BlackRock referred the DCNF to a report confirming their departure from NZAM.

Title: Meta axes diversity programmes joining US corporate rollback
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmy7xpw3pyo
Time Published: 2025-01-10T21:32:57Z
Full Content:
Meta and Amazon are axing their diversity programmes, joining firms across corporate America that are rolling back hiring and training initiatives criticised by conservatives, citing legal and political risks. The move comes just days after Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans. In a memo to staff about its decision, which affects, hiring, supplier and training efforts, Meta cited a "shifting legal and policy landscape". Walmart and McDonalds are among the other companies to have made similar decisions regarding diversity efforts since Trump won re-election. In its memo to staff, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by the BBC, Meta cited a Supreme Court ruling concerning race in college admissions, while also noting that the term "DEI" (diversity, equity and inclusion) had become "charged". The tech giant said it would continue to look for diverse staff, but end its current approach, which seeks to make selections from a pool of diverse candidates. In a December memo to employees, Amazon said it was "winding down outdated programs and materials" related to representation and inclusion, aiming to complete the process by the end of 2024. "Rather than have individual groups build programs, we are focusing on programs with proven outcomes — and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture," Candi Castleberry, Amazon's VP of inclusive experiences and technology, wrote in the note which was first reported by Bloomberg on Friday. Financial firms JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, also pulled out of groups focused on risks from climate change this week. The moves are a sign of the acceleration of a retreat that started two years ago, as Republicans ramped up attacks on firms such as BlackRock and Disney, accusing them of "woke" progressive activism and threatening political punishment. Big brands such as Bud Light and Target also faced backlash and boycotts related to their efforts to appeal to LGBTQ customers. Many of the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives were put in place after the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in 2020 following George Floyd's murder at the hands of police. Recent court decisions have bolstered critics of the programmes, who said that they were discriminatory. The Supreme Court in 2023 struck down the right for private universities to consider race in admissions decisions. Another court of appeals ruling invalidated a Nasdaq policy that would have required companies listed on that stock exchange to have at least one woman, racial minority or LGBTQ person on their board or explain why not. Meta said it was also ending its efforts to work with suppliers who are "diverse" but will instead focus on small and medium-sized companies. It also plans to stop offering "equity and inclusion" training and instead offer programmes that "mitigate bias for all, no matter your background". Meta declined to comment on the memo, news of which was immediately met with both criticism and celebration. "I'm sitting back and enjoying every second of this," said conservative activist Robby Starbuck, who has taken credit for successfully campaigning against the policies at companies such as Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson. LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign said workplace inclusion policies help to attract and retain top staff and had been "directly tied to long-term business growth". "Those who abandon these commitments are shirking their responsibility to their employees, consumers, and shareholders" RaShawn "Shawnie" Hawkins, the senior director of the HRC Foundation's Workplace Equality Program said. Meta's move comes just days after the tech giant said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by Trump and Republicans and elevated conservatives to key leadership positions. In a nearly three-hour interview with podcaster Joe Rogan Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said he had always been concerned about being the arbiter of "truth" and was "ill-prepared" when the issue first heated up after the 2016 election. He said the demands to take down information became unreasonable under the Biden administration. For example, he said the company faced pressure during the pandemic to remove content like statements about vaccine side effects. That helped to generate a wider political backlash, he said, including his own. "I feel like I have much greater command now of what I think the policies should be," he said, adding that he felt the US government "should be defending its companies ... not be the tip of the spear attacking". "When the US does that to its tech industry, it's basically just open season around the rest of the world," he added. His exit comes amid a dispute over his report into Donald Trump's handling of classified documents. In an exclusive interview, Ian Russell tells the BBC that he believes there is "no real movement" within government on online safety. The US companies join other major firms donating funds for the ceremony on 20 January. Donald Trump will still take office as the first US president with a felony conviction. All five living presidents appeared together at the funeral service of former US President Jimmy Carter. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: Jim Cramer on Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH): ‘I Think It’s Amazing That Enphase Was Only Down 48% For The Year’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 S&P 500 Stocks on Jim Cramer's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) stands against the other S&P 500 stocks. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently discussed the current state of the market and also discussed both the leading and lagging stocks within the S&P 500. He posed an intriguing question: What if Trump's tariffs are more negotiable than expected? Instead of a hard-line approach, Cramer suggested they could end up being more like a "steak knife" than a "meat axe," meaning less harmful to trade and international relations. READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently and 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar While a more reasonable tariff policy might not be ideal for global trade, it would be a positive development for stocks, particularly if it results in lower prices for American consumers or if multinational companies move their manufacturing to more favorable countries. Cramer emphasized that, for stockholders looking for growth, hopes should be placed on negotiable tariffs. “If you own stocks and you want them higher, you have to hope for negotiable tariffs that could cause countries to lower prices to us or make multinational companies move their manufacturing base here to a more friendly country.” Cramer also discussed the S&P 500's performance this year, noting that, while it is clear which stocks have thrived in the Nasdaq, the winners and losers in the broader S&P 500 have been more difficult to pinpoint. Additionally, Cramer mentioned that several of the stocks in his Charitable Trust, which are reliant on a rebound in China, are ones he’s not excited about at the moment, especially considering the disappointing Chinese economic data. He mentioned that his dismay for such stocks will only last until “they annualize the crummy Chinese numbers and then they'll probably bounce back.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 2. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A solar panel array stretched across a large open field, its glimmering panels reflecting the sun. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Dissecting Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), Cramer remarked: “Finally, there's Enphase, which is a solar equipment company that has the misfortune of making some of its equipment in China. Given that Trump won over solar advocate Vice President Harris, we can expect that much higher tariffs are looming on Chinese goods. I think it's amazing that Enphase was only down 48% for the year. But hey, there's always 2025.” Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) is a company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells energy solutions, particularly for the solar photovoltaic sector. It has been expanding its presence globally, particularly in Latin America. Recently, the company launched the IQ8P Microinverters in Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica, aimed at supporting high-powered solar modules for both residential and commercial applications. At the same time, Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) is operating in an environment shaped by broader geopolitical events. According to The Washington Post, President Trump's economic advisers are working on a plan that would include universal tariffs of up to 20%, focusing on industries considered essential to national security, such as defense, energy, and critical medical supplies. This approach aims to prevent countries like China from circumventing tariffs by rerouting goods through third-party nations. However, Trump has denied this report. He continues to advocate for sweeping tariffs of 60% to 100% on imports from China and a 25% tariff on all products coming from Mexico and Canada. This stance has been a part of his campaign promises and remains a topic of discussion in his economic policies. Overall ENPH ranks 10th on our list of the S&P 500 stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of ENPH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ENPH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General
URL: https://press.un.org/en/2025/db250110.doc.htm
Time Published: 2025-01-10T20:04:02Z
Full Content:
The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today’s briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General. **Climate Good afternoon, it is happy Friday indeed. Let me start off with climate. As you all know, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) today confirmed that the year that just passed -2024- was the warmest year on record, and that it is at about 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels. This is based on six various international datasets. It also said that the past 10 years, from 2015 to 2024, were the ten warmest years on record. The Secretary-General said that today’s assessment makes it clear that global heating is a cold, hard fact, adding that governments must deliver new national climate action plans this year to limit long-term global temperature rise to 1.5°C and support the most vulnerable, as well as deal with the devastating climate impacts. That statement was shared with you earlier today. **Deputy Secretary-General Our Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, is in Nigeria, in Abuja, in fact, the capital city of that country. She met today with the President of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as well as with the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development [Nentawe Goshwe Yilwatda]. They discussed Nigeria’s role in regional cooperation, peacebuilding and advancing inclusive development. She also met with Omar Touray, the President of the Commission of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to discuss recent developments, regional peace and security dynamics, as well as sustainable development in the Sahel. Yesterday, she also met with the UN country team and discussed how to strengthen the United Nations’ work in Nigeria for greater impact and delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ms. Mohammed also had discussions with the Minister for Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, [Wale Edun]. They discussed the country’s ongoing economic reforms. Leonardo Santos Simão, the Head of our Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), is also in Nigeria and accompanied Ms. Mohammed for parts of her programme. She will return to New York on Sunday. **Sudan Turning to a devastating humanitarian crisis that we are desperate to keep in the headlines, and that is Sudan. Today, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is sounding the alarm, saying that an estimated 3.2 million children under the age of five are projected to suffer from acute malnutrition this year. Of these children, over 700,000 will likely suffer from severe acute malnutrition. Sudan, as you know, has the world’s largest child displacement crisis, with 5 million children displaced because of the hostilities. Most of these children leave with their families with only the clothes on their bodies. Mothers often walk for days, sometimes up to 20 days, to reach a camp, looking for safety, looking for food and just looking for basic shelter. And as the conflict rages on, families and communities trapped in the middle of it and in hard-to-reach areas are continuing to bear the brunt of the violence and the suffering. The lack of access to sufficient food and basic services in these hard-to-reach areas inside Sudan is likely to swell and the risk of destitution and death increases. UNICEF, in collaboration with humanitarian partners, will continue to do its utmost to deliver safe and clean water and integrated health and nutrition services, including immunization, treatment of childhood illnesses, as well as do whatever they can management of acute malnutrition in children. And as you know, famine conditions are currently present in Zamzam, Al Salam, and Abu Shouk camps for internally displaced people, as well as the western Nuba Mountains of Sudan. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) committee has projected that famine could spread to five additional regions of Sudan, including El Fasher, by the middle of this year, with 17 other areas at risk unless urgent intervention is managed. Immediate and unimpeded humanitarian access is essential in order for us and our partners to deliver humanitarian assistance. And we continue to urge Governments to prioritise funding, ensure safe relief routes, and press all parties involved to just stop fighting. **Syria Moving to Syria: Our Special Envoy, Geir Pedersen, will travel to Riyadh in the Kingdom Saudi Arabia this weekend to engage with senior officials there. He continues to emphasize the importance of an inclusive, Syrian-led and Syrian-owned process, supported by the international community. Meanwhile, his Deputy, Najat Rochdi, remains in Damascus, where she is actively engaging with a broad range of interlocutors as part of our ongoing outreach efforts. On the humanitarian front, our humanitarian coordination colleagues tell us that a convoy of 23 trucks carrying about 200 metric tons of medical, health, hygiene and education supplies, provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, crossed from Türkiye through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing into Idlib. This is the first UN cross-border aid delivery of the year crossing from Türkiye. The supplies will support at least half a million human beings, enable 8,000 emergency surgical procedures, and provide enough medication to treat infections and support mental health for about 10,000 people for the next three months. We also continue to conduct regular cross-border missions from Türkiye to Syria, through other points, with 13 missions having taken place over the past five days, including roads and civilian infrastructure assessments. Our staff has also met with people to assess humanitarian efforts and needs in different locations in the country. We and our partners continue to support the response across the country as security and logistical conditions permit. However, the needs are massive and now, as the winter season is upon us, the humanitarian situation is even more dire especially for the millions of people who remain displaced in the country. More than 620,000 people were forced to flee their homes in November and December 2024, on top of the over 7 million people who had previously been displaced. We call on donors to support the humanitarian response, especially during this transition period. **Lebanon Turning to Lebanon, the Humanitarian and Resident Coordinator for Lebanon, Imran Riza, today announced a $30 million allocation from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund to support the response in the country. The funds will enable our partners, including local NGOs [non-governmental organizations] and community-based organizations, to deliver assistance in the areas of food security, shelter, nutrition, protection, healthcare, water and sanitation, as well as education. Mr. Riza said that the new allocation will provide a vital lifeline, enabling support to both those returning to damaged infrastructure and those who remain displaced. **Occupied Palestinian Territory Turning to the situation in Gaza, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) tells us that Israeli authorities continue to deny UN-led efforts to reach [North] Gaza governorate with vital aid. This includes our most recent attempt today. Across the Gaza Strip yesterday, only 10 out of the 21 UN planned humanitarian movements were facilitated by the Israeli authorities. Seven were denied outright, three were impeded, and one was cancelled due to security and logistical challenges. Meanwhile, OCHA is deeply concerned about the impact that dwindling fuel supplies are having on essential services in Gaza. Palestinian telecommunication providers are now warning that their services may start to shut down tomorrow due to fuel shortages, which they need to run the generators for their equipment. The World Health Organization said today that Al Awda Hospital — which is, as you know, the last partially functioning hospital in North Gaza Governorate — is critically low on fuel and essential medical supplies. WHO has been working to access Al Awda to resupply it and to assess the situation at Kamal Adwan Hospital, which is completely out of service. However, damaged roads — as well as insufficient facilitation of access by the Israeli authorities — has made it impossible to safely reach those facilities. Our WHO colleagues urgently call for immediate action to make roads passable and to facilitate access to Al Awda [Hospital] to keep it up and running. And turning to the West Bank, new reporting from OCHA indicates a pretty violent picture. In the first week of this year, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians, including a child, and injured 38 others across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Meanwhile, armed Palestinians shot and killed three Israeli settlers and injured eight others near Qalqiliya. OCHA also tells us that during the first week of the year, Israeli settlers injured 18 Palestinians across the West Bank, including nine in Silwad village in Ramallah Governorate. Meanwhile, more than 50 Palestinians in the West Bank were displaced by home demolitions, the majority in Silwan in East Jerusalem. We also have an update on the impact of the operation by Palestinian security forces in the Jenin refugee camp, where those forces have clashed with armed Palestinians for more than a month. OCHA says that since the operation began, access to the camp has been heavily restricted. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) estimates that some 3,400 people remain in the Jenin camp, in dire conditions — and more than 2,000 families have been forced to relocate to Jenin city. OCHA mobilized partners to respond to the needs of the affected families both inside and outside the camp. **Myanmar Turning to Myanmar, the Humanitarian Coordinator ad interim, Marcoluigi Corsi, said today that the humanitarian community is deeply alarmed by recent reports of civilian casualties in Rakhine State. On Wednesday, an aerial attack in Kyauk Nima village reportedly killed over 40 civilians, including children and women, and injured more than 20 people. Five hundred homes were allegedly destroyed. We reiterate our call on all parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians, including humanitarian workers, as well as hospitals, schools and humanitarian assets. We also stress the need to facilitate unimpeded humanitarian access to the most vulnerable people. **Venezuela An update for you on Venezuela. I can tell you that the Secretary-General continues to follow the situation in Venezuela with great concern. A peaceful way out of the political crisis requires full respect for human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without any interference, and to peaceful assembly. The Secretary-General strongly condemns the detention of a large number of persons, including opposition figures, journalists and human rights defenders, since the 28 July presidential election. He urges the authorities to guarantee and respect their human rights and to release all the people who have been arbitrarily detained. **Honour Roll We have another welcome member of the Honour Roll. I just want to make sure you have been listening to the quiz last year. This European country is small in geographical size but, of course, big in every other way. It is one of only two double landlocked nations in the world. Yes. Liechtenstein. Very good, Amélie. We thank very much our friends in Vaduz for taking Liechtenstein to become the sixth Member State to pay its dues for 2025. There is still time for others to pay and to make it for the Honour Roll. **Questions and Answers Question: Yeah. About, Secretary-General's visit to DC, has the Secretary-General yesterday talked or met with the president-elect, [Donald J.] Trump? Spokesman: No. There was no opportunity to… Question: Even no small talk? Spokesman: Yeah, let me just finish my sentence. There was no opportunity to do it, given the geography of where everybody was sitting. He did shake hands and greet President [Joseph R.] Biden, who walked past where the foreign dignitaries were sitting. Question: On 30 November 2020, Secretary-General had a phone call with then President-elect Biden. Yesterday, you said that your team had actually contact with the president-elect’s team. Why this kind of phone call conversation did not happen yet? Spokesman: No doubt it will happen. As I said, we have been in contact with the incoming team. Question: Okay. Last Trump question. Does the Secretary-General have any opinion that the soon to be US president now is a convicted felon? Spokesman: We have no comment. Okay, señor. Question: Hi. Thank you, Steph, I have a follow-up on the situation in Venezuela, but this is not primarily on the humanitarian issues, but the political side of this situation. So, the SG on different occasions called for the Venezuelan people to commit to a political process that would lead to elections and to try to solve all of their issues through this kind of political process. They did. And then that takes us to the present, where there is a side that is sustaining power. There's another side that is being recognized by the international community as legitimately elected. So, I wonder if there is any message to the Venezuelan people on a day like today, especially when there's, like, a new government or a new face of government in the country, since there is such an erosion in the trust of the political process and what is the road ahead for them. Spokesman: No. I mean, I think, as I said, the Secretary-General is following the situation closely. I think he understands the frustration of a large part of the Venezuelan public. As he said, the way forward for a peaceful Venezuela requires full respect for human rights, for human dignity. And I think that's why he's so concerned about the arrests that we have seen since July, but also especially in the last few days. Question: Just an additional quick one. Has any of the sides reached out to the SG at any level? Have you received any letters? Spokesman: I'm not aware. I'll double check, but I'm not aware of any recent communication in the last few days. Okay. Sir? Question: Thank you, Stéphane. President-elect Donald Trump has stated that a meeting is being set up with the Russian [Federation] President, Vladimir Putin. So, is the UN aware of any details on this meeting? Spokesman: No. I mean, we've seen the press reports, both, I think, coming from the US and from the Russian [Federation] side. Obviously, once in office, any dialogue between the United States and Russia is to be welcomed. Question: Is the UN ready to be a part of the negotiation process? Spokesman: Well, I mean, negotiations on what? Correspondent: Yeah. Because, they are expected to have negotiations on Ukraine and, in the past UN was a part of that. Spokesman: I mean, on Ukraine, let's be clear. First of all, in terms of the UN's role, Secretary-General's good offices have been available since the beginning, should both parties, Ukraine and the Russian Federation, ask for it. Our view on the conflict in Ukraine remains the same — that we want to see an end to this conflict in line with General Assembly resolutions, international law, and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. I'm going to go online. Michelle? Question: Hey, Steph. Thank you. A couple of questions, if you don't mind. First of all, just a quick follow-up, when you were talking again about the contacts with the Trump transition team. What have they been in contact about or what have you been in contact with them about? Spokesman: I've not nothing else to share with you than what I've just said. Question: Okay. And then the US House of Representatives passed some legislation that is making its way through the US system on sanctioning the ICC [International Criminal Court]. If you got any response to that? Spokesman: Well, first of all, as you know, we don't like to comment on potential laws or on bills that are making their way through a legislative process. That being said, we do have a principled position on the International Criminal Court. And that is, while it is independent from the Secretariat, the Secretary-General has great respect for the Court and for the work of the International Criminal Court, which is in itself a very important pillar of international justice. Question: And would the UN expect the US to abide by the Headquarters Agreement, should any sanctions be…? Spokesman: You know, we expect every Member State to abide by treaties and agreements they have signed. Question: And then one last quick one. BlackRock left the… sorry. What's it called again? The Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative yesterday or announced that they're leaving it. Would the SG like to comment on that? Spokesman: Yeah, I mean, we've seen that. Obviously, the Net-Zero Alliance is an alliance, which means it is voluntary and companies are free to do and make the decisions they make. But, however, the decision taken by BlackRock to leave the alliance is disappointing, especially given the critical role that the private sector and especially asset managers have in combating climate change and mitigating the risks and the impact of climate change. You know, we encourage those companies that remain in the Net-Zero Alliance to continue with their work, or if they're in other groupings or just individually, using the assets that they manage, using their investments smartly in a way that helps with the transition, the energy transition, which helps to mitigate climate change, which helps to fight climate change. We encourage those companies to continue to do so. Climate change… we say climate change is an existential threat, and it's not just words. I mean, we're seeing the impact of it, and the devastation of it, around the world. Countries rich and poor are being impacted. No one is safe, and it is incumbent obviously on governments, as the Secretary-General said in his statements today, but also on the private sector and the money and the investments that they manage. Any other questions online? And then we'll go back to the room. Correspondent: Yes. I put my name. Spokesman: Okay. Go ahead, Abdelhamid. Question: Thank you. Yeah. There was a trilateral attack on Yemen by UK, US and Israel, and they destroyed lots of infrastructure. Now Hudaydah Port is not functioning. Ras Isa Port is not functioning. Civilian infrastructure has been attacked. Do you condemn that? And why the US and UK had to join that war? It's between Yemen and Israel. Why two countries had joined the war? Spokesman: Well, listen. You know, you have to ask those very countries. I can't speak for any country. I can barely speak for the UN. So, you'll have to ask those countries. There is in fact, as is clear for everyone to see, great tensions and violence between the exchange of fire, not so much between Yemen and Israel, but between Israel and the Houthis. And we're obviously very concerned by the renewed air strikes that we've seen in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen by those countries that you mentioned. And these air strikes were done, as we note, in response to the continued Houthi launching of indiscriminate missiles towards Israel and to attacks on the Red Sea and shipping on the Red Sea, which is critical to the global economy. We emphasize that international law, including international humanitarian law, as applicable, must be respected at all times. And we recall the Secretary-General, as he said many times, for the need to protect civilians and to protect civilian infrastructure. It is critically important for all to show utmost restraint and to cease all military activities. Further escalation could exacerbate regional tensions and pose great risk to the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen, which we often talk about. We're obviously very focused on the issue of Yemen. As you know, Mr. [Hans] Grundberg just left the country a few days ago. Your next question? Question: Two civilians in South Lebanon were killed this morning by an Israeli air raid. Are you aware of that, and what do you say to that? Spokesman: Yes. We have seen the reports of a fatal drone strike in southern Lebanon. We checked with our peacekeeping colleagues, who were not able to verify the report at this time. But obviously, we urge everyone to avoid any action that could undermine the cessation of hostilities which is in place and to use the mechanism that exists to address any concern that they have and to resolve any issues between the parties. And I think we've also seen there were statements made by Prime Minister [Najib] Mikati today about Lebanon's efforts to remove unauthorized weapons from Southern Lebanon, which is to be welcome, given that this is a centrepiece of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). And we, of course, our peacekeeping colleagues are ready to work with the Lebanese Armed Forces, the Lebanese Security Forces to implement that resolution. Question: My last question, if you don't mind. Do you have any comment on the US Congress imposing sanctions on ICC? Spokesman: I just answered that question, by Michelle. She asked the same question about two seconds ago, and I answered it. Dezhi? Correspondent: Sorry. Just two regular question. First one… Spokesman: As opposed to? Question: As opposed to, like, I brought these up, like, from time to time. The first one is about the ceasefire deal in Gaza. Does the UN have any update on this? Spokesman: No. Nothing that you have not seen or read. Question: The second regular question would be the Yemen. I mean, the oil tanker, the plan of the oil tanker? Spokesman: Nothing new to report, but we'll see if there's anything else. Question: So it's still… It's still there. Spokesman: Yeah, I mean it’s still safe. Yeah. Okay. Thank you all. Have a wonderful weekend. If we speak, that is not a good sign. If we don't speak, it will be a good weekend.

Title: American Airlines broke the law by focusing on ESG in 401(k) plans: judge

A federal judge in Texas on Friday said American Airlines violated federal law by basing investment decisions for its employee retirement plan on environmental, social, and other non-financial factors. The ruling by US District Judge Reed O’Connor appeared to be the first of its kind amid growing backlash by conservatives to an uptick in socially-conscious investing. O’Connor said American had breached its legal duty to make investment decisions based solely on the financial interests of 401(k) plan beneficiaries by allowing BlackRock, its asset manager and a major shareholder, to focus on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors. “The evidence made clear that [American’s] incestuous relationship with BlackRock and its own corporate goals disloyally influenced administration of the Plan,” wrote O’Connor, an appointee of Republican former President George W. Bush. The judge ruled after holding a four-day non-jury trial in June, in a class action by American pilot Bryan Spence on behalf of more than 100,000 participants in the retirement plan. American did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BlackRock was not involved in the lawsuit.

Mobileye (MBLY), which is retreating 5% today, has tumbled 30% since its appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on Tuesday. Mobileye creates and markets advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and offerings related to autonomous driving. A fleet of autonomous vehicles driving down a sun-drenched highway. Disappointment With Mobileye's CES Appearance After Mobileye at last year's CES announced multiple design wins, the company failed to announce any new deals at this year's conference. The lack of such news appears to have sparked the large decline in MBLY stock this week. However, Mobileye this week did disclose progress in the area of innovations related to autonomous-driving technology. What's more, after attending the company's Capital Markets Day in December, RBC Capital was more bullish on the firm's ability to sell automakers its Level 2+ and Level 3 autonomous driving offerings. Moreover, the bank was upbeat about the company's demonstration of its products. However, RBC kept a Sector Perform rating on the shares, although it did raise its price target on the name to $14 from $11. The shares are currently trading around $16. In the third quarter, Mobileye's revenue fell 8% versus the same period a year earlier to $486 million. But that was 11% above Q2's top line. The Recent Price Action of MBLY Stock In the last month, MBLY stock has dropped 9%, but it is still up 31% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of MBLY, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MBLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Daniel Wiessner (Reuters) -A federal judge in Texas on Friday said American Airlines violated federal law by basing investment decisions for its employee retirement plan on environmental, social and other non-financial factors. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor appeared to be the first of its kind amid growing backlash by conservatives to an uptick in socially-conscious investing. O'Connor said American had breached its legal duty to make investment decisions based solely on the financial interests of 401(k) plan beneficiaries by allowing BlackRock, its asset manager and a major shareholder, to focus on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors. "The evidence made clear that [American’s] incestuous relationship with BlackRock and its own corporate goals disloyally influenced administration of the Plan," wrote O'Connor, an appointee of Republican former President George W. Bush. A BlackRock spokesperson said: "We always act independently and with a singular focus on what is in the best financial interests of our clients. Our only agenda is maximizing returns for our clients, consistent with their choices." The judge ruled after holding a four-day non-jury trial in June, in a class action by American pilot Bryan Spence on behalf of more than 100,000 participants in the retirement plan. O'Connor said he would decide later on whether class members suffered financial harms and American must pay them damages. American said in a statement that it was reviewing the decision. Lawyers for Spence did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BlackRock, which on Thursday said it was leaving an environmentally focused investor group under pressure from Republican politicians, is not involved in the lawsuit. In November, BlackRock and two rival asset managers were sued by 11 Republican-led states who claim the firms violated federal antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and caused energy costs to increase. BlackRock called the claims baseless. Spence sued American in 2023, saying it had violated the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by failing to remain loyal to 401(k) plan participants and to prudently oversee their assets. O'Connor last February rejected American's claims that the lawsuit should be dismissed because Spence could not show that the 401(k) plan had underperformed, paving the way for a trial. On Friday, the judge said that American had breached its duty of loyalty to retirement plan participants. But the company's decisions did not violate its duty of prudence, O'Connor said, because it was acting according to prevailing industry standards. O'Connor is known for frequently ruling in favor of conservative litigants challenging laws and regulations governing guns, LGBTQ rights and healthcare. The Biden administration in 2023 adopted a rule allowing 401(k) and other plans to consider ESG factors as a "tiebreaker" between financially equal investment options. The rule replaced a regulation adopted during Republican President-elect Donald Trump's first administration barring the consideration of any non-financial factors, which could be resurrected after Trump takes office for the second time later this month. A Texas federal judge is currently considering a legal challenge to the Biden administration rule by 25 Republican-led states and oil drilling company Liberty Energy.

California-based property and casualty insurer Mercury General (MCY) is tumbling 20% today after the insurer warned that its losses from California's wildfires would "exceed its reinsurance retention level of $150 million." However, the company's reinsurer is obligated to pay for $1.29 billion of losses for each natural disaster "after covered catastrophe losses exceed the Company's retention of $150 million," Mercury explained. If Mercury's reinsurer pays out the entire $1.29 billion, Mercury would have a "total reinstatement premium" of $101 million. 15 Best States for Homeowners Insurance in the US Mercury's Financial Data Mercury's market capitalization is $2.66 billion. The company generated $4.63 billion of revenue last year, while its operating income came in at $123.6 million. On the balance sheet, it had total investments of $6 billion as of the end of the third quarter, along with long-term debt of $574 million. Its total liabilities came in at $6.3 billion. Additional Background Information The insurer noted that, with the wildfires continuing to burn, " it will be some time before (it) has an estimate of the total losses caused by this event." AccuWeather now anticipates that the total damage from the disaster will come in at $135 billion to $150 billion. Other property and casualty insurers are also dropping, with Progressive (PGR) giving back 1.5%, Allstate (ALL) retreating 7.5%, and Travelers (TRV) sinking 4.5%.

Title: UK gilt selloff triggers pension cash calls in first big test since 2022 crisis

By Carolyn Cohn and Iain Withers LONDON (Reuters) - Some British pension funds are being told by asset managers to come up with more cash to support their hedging positions after a recent jump in borrowing costs, but pensions advisers told Reuters this week the market was behaving in an orderly way. XPS and Gallagher said some funds had been instructed to post more cash to maintain derivatives positions they hold through so-called Liability Driven Investment (LDI) strategies. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), a major LDI provider, said in a note to clients on Friday that although higher borrowing costs will have reduced pension schemes' collateral resilience, funds were better prepared than previously to withstand volatility. The market moves are the first big test of the pensions market since an industry overhaul of LDI usage to reduce risk and meet regulatory demands for more collateral and lower leverage. The derivatives will require more collateral against them to make up for the movement in price. LDI, which helps funds meet future payouts by hedging against moves in bond yields, was at the centre of a crisis in September 2022, when plans by the government of then-prime minister Liz Truss for unfunded tax cuts sent yields surging. Pension advisory firms XPS and Gallagher, along with six other industry players, said the market had responded to this week's sharp selloff in debt markets in an orderly manner. The Bank of England and The Pensions Regulator declined to comment on Friday. The yield on 30-year British government bonds, known as gilts, hit a fresh 26-year high on Friday as higher inflation expectations and worries about Donald Trump's imminent arrival in the White House prompted investors to sell. Ten-year gilt yields are up by 25 basis points, their biggest weekly jump in a year but far less than the nearly 70 bps weekly jump seen in 2022. BlackRock, a big player in LDI services alongside Legal & General (LON:LGEN) and Insight Investment, said in its note explaining the selloff that pension schemes were starting from a different place to previous years. It was nevertheless "vital" they continued monitoring their collateral, the firm added. The spikes in yields following the Truss government's "mini-Budget" in 2022 triggered collateral calls on funds' hedging positions, forcing operators to fire-sell assets to raise cash. "If yields did spike materially, then you could see things being stress-tested again. But we're certain the industry is in a much better place," said Carl Hitchman, chief investment officer at Gallagher Benefit Services UK. One client had received a cash call with a deadline of next week, but the fund had liquidity to meet this, he said. XPS said it has seen some capital calls, but CIO Simeon Willis said this was the market operating normally. The gradual rise in British borrowing costs this time had made it manageable, advisers said, with Insight Investment, Legal & General and Schroders (LON:SDR) all saying the LDI market was proving resilient and orderly. "Pension funds are well prepared and managing the volatility effectively," a spokesperson for BT pension fund manager Brightwell said.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Historic wildfires have destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in Los Angeles County. Many homes of the rich and famous in Pacific Palisades, Malibu, and Pasadena have been reduced to rubble and ash. Entire neighborhoods were completely destroyed, and the fires have been blamed for at least five deaths. The speed at which the fires spread caught firefighters and residents off guard. Fed by hurricane-strength Santa Ana winds, embers were flying through the air seemingly everywhere and with no let-up. Climate alarmists have pinned the blame on human-caused climate change, but that is not truth. On Episode #140 of The Climate Realism Show, The Heartland Institute’s H. Sterling Burnett, Anthony Watts, Linnea Lueken, and Jim Lakely welcome U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) and CFACT’s Chris Martz to cover the LA fires and some of the “Crazy Climate News of the Week.” There’s been some fascinating news since our two-week hiatus, some of it good. Blackrock and JP Morgan are the latest financial giants to drop out of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, Michael Mann experienced his first-ever setback in his lawfare against climate realists, and Biden tries to tie Trump’s hands on drilling while also trying to ban some tankless water heaters on his way out of the White House.

Title: JASON ISAAC: Wall Street Wants You To Believe It’s Backing Away From ESG. Reality Paints A Different Picture

Financial institutions across the world are engaging in the height of hypocrisy, publicly renouncing controversial groups while continuing to uphold its principles and objectives. BlackRock is the latest, and largest, to join a growing list of financial institutions like JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley that are withdrawing from the United Nations’ Net-Zero alliances. But while these institutions may appear to distance themselves from a controversial agenda, they remain steadfast in their commitment to the climate agenda — prioritizing political activism over fiduciary responsibility and economic growth. (RELATED: O.H. SKINNER: Will Joe Biden Slip Through One Last Dark Money Giveaway In His Closing Days?) A recent study shows coordinated efforts to defund politically disfavored industries, such as fossil fuels, may not only harm consumers, but also violate antitrust laws, according to the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Boyden Gray & Associates. Banks that publicly pledged to curtail funding for Arctic oil drilling or coal mining may have done so to pressure competitors to follow suit. Such actions, if left unchecked, could jeopardize the energy security of the United States while artificially inflating energy costs for businesses and families alike. The decision for BlackRock to leave the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI) and the banks to leave the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) might suggest these financial institutions are responding to growing scrutiny and political pressure over Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives. Legal challenges, such as the lawsuit filed by Texas and 10 other states against major asset managers, allege that ESG policies violate antitrust laws by colluding to constrain fossil fuel production and inflate energy prices. Public backlash against these policies has only intensified, particularly in regions where energy is becoming expensive and scarce. But actions speak louder than words — or, in this case, affiliations. Despite exiting the NZAMI and NZBA, these financial giants continue to pledge allegiance to net-zero goals, demanding divestment from essential energy sectors like coal and oil in an attempt to starve politically disfavored industries of capital. The result? Reduced energy security, higher costs for consumers, and a financial system that prioritizes activism over fiduciary duty and financial stability. Meanwhile, these policies give a competitive advantage to nations like China, which continues to expand coal production for cheap electricity and dominate critical mineral supply chains, further weakening the United States’ energy independence and global economic position. This contradiction exposes a deeper truth: the ESG movement is not about balance or responsibility. It is about control. By mandating adherence to subjective social and environmental metrics, ESG policies bypass the free market and erode the competitive principles that drive innovation and prosperity. The hypocrisy of these institutions is stark. On one hand, they tout their departure from these controversial UN alliances, likely hoping to avoid further legal and political backlash. On the other hand, they continue to uphold the same principles that have driven lawsuits and public criticism in the first place. This serves no one — not the ordinary Americans struggling to make ends meet, not the investors seeking strong returns, and certainly not the global economy, which depends on energy abundance and stability. If these institutions are serious about restoring trust and accountability, they must go beyond symbolic gestures. It is not enough to leave the NZAMI and NZBA while still practicing what they preach. Real change requires embracing policies that support energy innovation and accessibility for all. It means prioritizing economic growth and energy security over appeasing activist groups. Policymakers, too, have a role to play. They must hold financial institutions accountable — for the spirit of competition and fairness that underpins our markets. States like Texas have already taken meaningful steps to protect consumers’ rights, prohibiting taxpayer-funded contracts with companies that collude against the energy sector. Others should follow suit to ensure that banks and asset managers serve their customers, not narrow ideological agendas. The recent exodus from the UN’s Net-Zero alliances is not a victory; it is a half-measure. Until financial institutions fully abandon their net-zero commitments and embrace their responsibility to shareholders, clients and the broader economy, they remain complicit in an agenda that undermines energy security and economic freedom. Actions, not affiliations, define character. It is time for these money managers to prove they’re serious about serving the interests of the many — not the demands of the few alarmists — and abandon these radical political agendas.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘Maybe NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Actually Goes To A New All-time High’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 7 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the market’s movements this week, focusing on the economic data that’s shaping the outlook. He highlighted the upcoming nonfarm payroll report on Friday, noting its potential to sway market sentiment. Cramer pointed out that the market has been shaken by the persistently high 10-year treasury bond yields, which refuse to drop. “Friday’s employment numbers need to show lower wage growth and disappointing hiring. Now that could bring down the yield in the 10-year and therefore make people feel that the Fed will be back on schedule to start cutting the rates again. We gotta get them back into that groove, you know. On the other hand, if hiring and wages remain hot, well then anything good that happens next week could be repealed.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks The labor report is especially critical, according to Cramer, because despite the strength in sectors like autos, housing, and materials, the overall economy may still be running too hot for the Fed to slow it down as needed. He turned his attention to other economic indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which is offering strong signals of economic activity. Cramer mentioned a recent report, including Monday’s release of the PMI composite index, as an important barometer for the economy. This data, he explained, provides valuable insights into how the economy is performing across different sectors, with particular attention to manufacturing, which has shown particularly strong performance. In addition to these key reports, Cramer also mentioned the implications of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), specifically focusing on job openings. “I've been mulling over these job openings numbers and I keep thinking about how President-elect Trump might reverse the high levels of immigration we've seen under the Biden administration.” Cramer warned that mass deportations could create a labor shortage that would drive wages even higher, especially if the country cannot rely on enough workers to fill the gaps. In that case, Cramer mused, "robots may be our only hope," alluding to the role of automation in addressing potential labor shortages. “So here's the bottom line: It’s a light week, but still impactful, accept that people will be on edge ahead of Friday’s employment report. Still, I think you should do some buying if the market gets hammered. As we saw today, it’s not nearly as bad out there as so many think.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 3. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 During the episode, Cramer mentioned NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Jensen’s speech on Monday and said: “Tech was strong all day today, you know, it's the leader again in part thanks to the buzz around Nvidia, CEO Jensen Huang’s speech at CES on Monday night, Vegas. Right now, as I've stressed… I think we could be dazzled by the use cases for Nvidia's latest chips, especially the video component. Any company that buys the platform of GPUs and software can make a fortune from it. That's important because we keep hearing that Amazon wants to compete head-to-head with Nvidia. Something, by the way, I don't even believe. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a well-known name in the graphics, computing, and networking industries and its graphics processing units and the CUDA software platform have become crucial for AI infrastructure. At the CES 2025 event, the company revealed several new products. CEO Jensen Huang presented innovations targeting AI applications, including those designed to advance robot and vehicle training, along with new gaming chips and a debut desktop computer. One of the highlights of the event was the introduction of Cosmos foundation models, a new AI model. These models, which generate photo-realistic video, offer a more cost-effective method of training robots and self-driving vehicles compared to traditional data usage. Additionally, Huang unveiled the new RTX 50 series gaming chips, which incorporate NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell AI technology, a key driver behind the company's growth in data centers. Huang also provided a financial outlook for NVIDIA's automotive hardware and software division, forecasting revenue of $5 billion for fiscal 2026, up from an expected $4 billion in fiscal 2025. Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock, Ally, Microsoft, Washington Post and other US firms to lay off staff in 2025; check full list

Workforce reductions in the past two years have been a major concern across sectors, including tech, media, finance, manufacturing, and retail. However, according to a Business Insider report published on January 9, layoffs in major global firms, including Microsoft, BlackRock, and Ally, will continue in 2025. Among the multiple reasons the firms cite, they want to slim their staff as part of the cost-cutting measures against the backdrop of technological change, especially over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). A couple of days ago, the World Economic Forum released its 'Future of Jobs Report', in which it mentioned that as many as 41 per cent of companies want to reduce their workforce due to AI automation. The report added that 170 million new jobs would be created by 2030, and 92 million jobs would be displaced. Earlier, firms like Dropbox, Google, and IBM announced job cuts related to AI. BlackRock: According to Bloomberg, BlackRock told employees that it was planning to cut about 200 people from its 21,000-strong workforce. These reductions are more than offset by the addition of some 3,750 workers in 2024, and another 2,000 are expected to be added in 2025. The cuts would help realign the firm's resources with its strategy, Bloomberg quoted BlackRock's president, Rob Kapito, and its chief operating officer, Rob Goldstein, as saying. Bridgewater: On Monday, Bridgewater Associates cut 7 per cent of its staff, aiming to stay lean, reported Business Insider, quoting a source. With these layoffs, the world's largest hedge fund staff count comes to where it was in 2023. Earlier in 2019, The company's founder, Ray Dalio, said about 30 per cent of new employees were leaving the firm within 18 months. Washington Post: In an effort to cut costs, The Washington Post is eliminating less than 100 employees, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Stating that the changes wouldn't affect the newsroom, the spokesperson said, as quoted by Reuters, "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are." Microsoft: Taking a harder look at underperforming employees, Microsoft is planning job cuts. However, the firm declined to share details on the number of employees to be fired. "At Microsoft, we focus on high-performance talent," the BI quoted a spokesperson as saying. "We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action," the spokesperson noted. Ally: The digital financial services major Ally is laying off roughly 500 of its 11,000 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to BI. "As we continue to right-size our company, we made the difficult decision to selectively reduce our workforce in some areas while continuing to hire in our other areas of business," BI quoted the spokesperson as saying. The Ally made a similar level of cuts in October 2023, reported the Charlotte Observer. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: U.S. Job Growth Excels But These Companies Are Announcing Layoffs

Jobs growth is encouraging, but layoffs remain. Jobs and job growth in the U.S. beat expectations, as the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in December. Reuters says that the labor market “ended the year on solid footing” and called the report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics “upbeat”. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 256,000 jobs - which is the highest level since March of last year. Economists had predicted payrolls advancing by 160,000. The U.S. economy grew by 2.32 million jobs in 2024. But, as with any market snapshot, not every part of the picture is positive. Management jobs continue to disappear, and white collar workers have seen shrinkage over the past 12 months. The World Economic Forum says that over 40% of companies worldwide are expecting to reduce their workforces over the next five years, as part of the rising impact of artificial intelligence (AI). Several big-name companies are starting 2025 with announcements of layoffs and job cuts. Big tech companies like Google, IBM, Tesla, TikTok, Snap and Dropbox implemented job cuts in 2024, according to TechCrunch. These layoffs are, in part, result of leveraging new capabilities of AI. Here are some other major players with announcements already underway: Inside a robust job report, pockets of layoffs remain - especially in finance and technology-related fields. While AI is part of the reason for the job cuts, opportunities in AI remain (for workers with the right skills). Notice that job gains were concentrated in non-cyclical industries, such as healthcare, which added 46,000 jobs. The retail and leisure/hospitality sectors added 43,000 jobs, respectively, last month. While overall job growth remains strong, the strength of opportunity depends on industry. For knowledge workers in tech and finance, the job growth picture is changing for 2025. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Los Angeles Liz Wolfe | 1.10.2025 9:30 AM L.A. fires nowhere near contained: So far, at least 10 people have been killed by the wildfires in and around Los Angeles. More than 35,000 acres have been consumed, and more than 10,000 structures destroyed. Wind speeds had lessened last night, only to pick up again this morning, with gusts reaching 81 miles per hour in L.A.'s northern mountains. A new fire broke out last night, named the Kenneth fire, in the West Hills. The Palisades fire and Eaton fire are at 6 percent containment and 0 percent containment, respectively, both now ranking among the top five most destructive fires in California's history. ("Containment basically measures the fire's potential for growth, not how much of it has been extinguished," notes The New York Times.) The California National Guard has been called in by Gov. Gavin Newsom, and President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will cover the area's emergency response costs for the next six months. (There are only a few days left in Biden's term, so it remains to be seen whether President-elect Donald Trump will maintain this commitment.) The Pentagon has sent in Navy helicopters to help with the firefighting. You are reading Reason Roundup, our daily, morning newsletter. Want articles just like this in your inbox every morning?

Δ So far, at least one man has been arrested for trying to start fires in Woodland Hills, near Calabasas, riding around on a bike using a blowtorch trying to set Christmas trees and garbage cans on fire. He seemed like he was "on something," according to one resident who allegedly helped to detain the suspect. Los Angeles police have not confirmed that the Kenneth fire is attributable to arsonists, but the man has been taken into custody. ("If these fires are arson, how society handles this crime and punishment will have ramifications for decades to come," writes venture capitalist Katherine Boyle on X. "What's scary about 'new' forms of violence is that the societal narrative shapes whether they repeat or not. It's called a 'cycle of violence' for a reason; copycats valorize the original crime. Crimes come in waves and eras. School shootings are relatively new, whereas the age of the serial killer seems to have faded. We do not want an arson age.") Reports of widespread looting are also worrying residents; those whose homes survived fear that their possessions will be gone when they return. Los Angeles police have been making arrests, attempting to maintain a semblance of order amid a disaster situation. "Shame on those who are preying on our residents during this time of crisis," said L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger at a press conference yesterday. Curfews are being implemented in the areas most affected by the fires. The real red pill will come when people try to get permits to rebuild their homes and face multiyear waits. This might finally spell doom for the Coastal Commission, which should not even exist as an organization. https://t.co/LNIooLoTIX — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 10, 2025 Is BlackRock destroying America's housing markets? (No.) "Shadowy private equity giants are buying up the housing supply in communities across New York, leaving everyday homebuyers with fewer and fewer affordable options," said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) yesterday as she introduced a new law aimed at making it harder for hedge funds to buy up single-family homes in the state. Hochul's proposing legislation doesn't ban the practice outright, but rather forces a 75-day waiting period before such firms could place bids on homes hitting the market. The reason why Hochul is tackling this? Well, because progressives (and other random commentators) frequently—and erroneously—like to claim that BlackRock has gobbled up so much American housing stock that normal people can no longer buy houses. Take even the Associated Press's write-up: "Private equity firms own more than 500,000 homes nationwide, according to the governor's news release, with some estimates expecting the firms to own up to 40% of the single-family rental market by 2030. There were more than 145 million housing units in the country in 2023, according to U.S. Census data." I'm sorry, what? How would you go from currently owning 0.3 percent to owning 40 percent over the course of five years? Are BlackRock and others planning to buy 57.5 million housing units? "Experts" might say that this is the plan, but that's because this area in particular is rife with people not knowing what they're talking about. Later, that same article claims that "non-individual investors" own a quarter of single-family homes, per 2021 data. But this includes landlords who have formed limited liability companies (LLCs), which is…a quite common practice. It's true that, in some places, whole neighborhoods are sometimes sold to investors, such as a 124-home subdivision in Conroe, Texas, for which "the winning $32 million bid came from an online property-investing platform, Fundrise LLC, which manages more than $1 billion on behalf of about 150,000 individuals," per The Wall Street Journal. ("We certainly wouldn't expect every single-family community we sell to sell at a 50% gross margin," said the builder's finance chief, Bill Wheat, after the sale.) Places hit harder by this phenomenon include not New York but rather Houston, Miami, Phoenix, and Las Vegas—places with a low-ish cost of living and a fair amount of starter home housing stock. In some cases, investors buying up housing stock and then renting these homes out could even be a good thing: If you are a young family who does not have enough saved up to buy a home in a starter-home subdivision, this allows you to rent. (Long-term, of course, buying a home is a major means by which people start building wealth, so there are trade-offs here.) Still, this isn't even a widespread practice in New York, so it's unclear why Hochul believes this warrants state intervention. See this for what it really is: An attempt by Hochul to look like she's addressing the issues contributing to housing affordability, when in reality she's doing nothing of the sort. Making it marginally harder for BlackRock to purchase homes is a silly, bad fix. Putting pressure on city governance to end rent control and rent stabilization, slashing regulations that make it hard to build new housing, and loosening or abolishing zoning and land use requirements would all have a greater effect.

Title: December Jobs Report: Labor Market Grew Faster Than Expected As Unemployment Clocks In At 4.1%

Time Published: 2025-01-10T13:32:44Z
Full Content:
Job growth was stronger than economists anticipated last month, according to the Labor Department’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report released Friday morning, a key datapoint as investors and policymakers reassess the state of the economy ahead of the shift in power in the nation’s capital. Friday is the first major economic report of the new year. The U.S. added an estimated 256,000 jobs in December, smashing consensus economist estimates of a seasonally adjusted 153,000, according to FactSet. The unemployment rate was 4.1% last month, compared to forecasts of 4.2%, where it stood in November. Average hourly wages increased by 0.3% to $35.69, marking the 45th straight month of record pay for workers, though the 3.9% annual wages bump is a far cry from the more than 4.5% growth enjoyed by workers across Sept. 2021 through Sept. 2023 as record job switching fueled significant wage increases. The government also said it revised its prior estimates for October job growth upward by 7,000 and for November job growth downward by 15,000. Friday’s nonfarm payrolls is the “first big report of the year” for the U.S. economy, according to Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye, noting the jobs update is “even more important than it would normally be” given the fork in the road for U.S. monetary policy. That’s because the sharp interest rate cuts long yearned for by borrowers and equity investors may be drying up – the Federal Reserve recently indicated it expects far fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously forecasted – due to a combination of economic factors. Those include a relatively stable labor market, making the need for stimulatory cuts less pressing, and concerns about sticky inflation partially traced back to President-Elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs and broader economic gameplan. Conventional economics wisdom says higher interest rates lead to higher unemployment and lower inflation. “The cutting cycle might already be over” if the labor market proves resilient in coming months, cautioned Bank of America strategist Gonzalo Asis in a Monday note to clients. Though 2024 was a solid year for job growth – nonfarm payrolls grew by more than 1% from 157.3 million to more than 159 million from Dec. 2023 to Dec. 2024 – U.S. companies announced the second-most job cuts since 2009 last year, trailing only 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. High-profile corporations like BlackRock and Microsoft indicated this month they’ll perform small rounds of layoffs. This is the last jobs report before President-elect Donald Trump succeeds Joe Biden. The Biden labor market saw unemployment fall about 2.6 percentage points from Dec. 2020’s 6.7% and total employment grow by 12%, though those numbers are likely skewed positively as the U.S. recovered from the unprecedented effects of COVID-19’s sudden job losses.

Title: BlackRock Leaves Major Climate Group Amid Wall Street Exodus
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2025/01/10/807764.htm
Time Published: 2025-01-10T13:13:37Z

BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. The money manager has decided to leave the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative it said in a letter to clients on Thursday. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. And with President-elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, Wall Street is bracing for more attacks on climate finance. “BlackRock has hung in there as long as it could, but the pressure has become too great, and the reputational and legal risks too high, just before Trump takes office,” Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed comment. And it “won’t be the last financial organization to quit a net zero initiative,” she said. BlackRock was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. Wall Street’s Top Banks Just Quit a Once Popular Alliance Record Heat Pushed 2024 Above 1.5C Global Warming Threshold Over the past month, a climate coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing GOP pressure. And there are signs the strategy is working. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in Thursday’s letter, which was signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock said it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

Title: Retiring Early In The Age Of Longevity: Is It Even Possible?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesfinancecouncil/2025/01/10/retiring-early-in-the-age-of-longevity-is-it-even-possible/
Time Published: 2025-01-10T12:45:00Z

Tanmay Gupta is a seasoned executive in the insurance industry. The financial independence, retire early (FIRE) movement has gained momentum in recent years. The FIRE movement is based on the simple principle that your savings and passive income should be able to sustain your lifestyle (and inflation). One of the main requirements of this movement is to estimate how long you are likely to live. Since 2000, the average life expectancy across the U.S. has increased from 76.75 years to 79.25 years, and this is despite the pandemic. While living two and a half years longer doesn’t sound like a lot, it does create a massive financial challenge for many individuals, including those planning to retire at a traditional age. Think your pension can solve part of the problem? Think again! As people live longer, public pension systems are getting strained, and consequently, the retirement burden is slowly shifting from the state to the individual. And as you get closer to retirement age, the goalposts will keep shifting (Read: The source of cash flow and living expenses will keep becoming more complex). So, the simple question to ask yourself is whether retiring early is even possible if you are going to live longer than you might expect. This challenge didn’t suddenly arise. The pressure has been building for decades. Medical and technological advancements have accelerated these trends, bringing about a global longevity revolution leading to increased life expectancy. But this positive trend has also exacerbated the retirement challenge. Increased life expectancy has led to a rise in cognitive and degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's. Unlike the pandemic, this is not an unforeseen or unknown challenge. Several academic, business and government thought leaders have hypothesized potential solutions to this problem. Listed below are a few potential solutions that have gained traction: This strategy includes investing in a combination of stocks and bonds (or ETFs and mutual funds). In its simplest form, this common rule of thumb suggests an annual withdrawal of 4% (inflation-adjusted) of your initial investments, regardless of your portfolio returns. But this strategy has a few drawbacks: • Market risk • No lifetime guarantee • Does not account for personal circumstances, such as illness or spending preference While several fund managers and self-help gurus tout the historical performance of stock markets, one only has to look at the 2007 financial crisis to realize that “past performance is not an indicator of future returns.” A big market correction early on in the investments could take years to make up. Americans are facing the worst housing affordability crisis in decades, so if you can buy housing properties and rent it out until perpetuity, it should provide a steady stream of inflation-adjusted passive income, while the value of real estate also appreciates. Simple? Yes. But anyone who has owned multiple properties will tell you that managing rental homes and finding good renters can be a more challenging feat than your usual nine-to-five job. As these rental properties age, they will also require investments for maintenance, repairs and upgrades. And, above all that, this strategy requires that you find good properties in an inflated market while having enough saved up to buy multiple properties. Fixed indexed annuities, or FIAs, are a type of annuity contract whose interest is linked, in part, to the performance of a market index, such as the S&P 500, but the investor's principal is protected from losses in the index. This characteristic provides growth potential with protection from loss during volatile markets. FIAs, along with fixed-rate annuities, can help policyholders achieve retirement-oriented financial goals through tax-deferred buildup and product riders, which can give guaranteed lifetime income benefits. Fixed annuities provide fixed payouts, potential lifetime payments, tax-deferred build-up and protection for individuals and/or spouses. So, what’s the risk? The biggest risk is that the policyholder premiums may be tied up until the surrender period of the policy. As such, policyholders may not be able to access the build-up value in case of an emergency. While the key retirement industries—wealth management, asset management and insurance—have developed innovative products and services that enhance individuals' ability to address their savings, investment and protection needs, they have done so in an isolated manner. This approach has made it extremely challenging to assemble a comprehensive solution that addresses the multifaceted retirement needs of individuals, resulting in fragmented and suboptimal outcomes. The retirement conundrum presents the biggest challenge for the middle and affluent class (household assets of $100,000 to $3.5 million). The fear of outliving savings has led to a different problem—hoarding. According to BlackRock, 40% of retirees still have over 80% of their savings after nearly two decades of retirement. Both groups may benefit from retirement planning to: 1. Drawdown their existing assets 2. Manage retirement spending 3. Mitigate risks, including longevity risk Meeting retirement needs requires more than just products; it necessitates an integrated and comprehensive suite of solutions designed with specific outcomes and a seamless client experience in mind. Although this may appear straightforward, no industry participant has succeeded in delivering such a solution at scale. Until the retirement industry can figure this out, my recommendation would be to put off any early retirement plans and work toward a comprehensive solution that addresses all possibilities.

Title: BlackRock Continues Wall Street Exodus From Net Zero Alliances

More Info BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is quitting the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in the latest exit of a major financial institution from a climate finance alliance since Donald Trump was elected U.S. President in November. BlackRock has decided to leave the voluntary Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which launched in December 2020 and aims to “support the asset management industry to commit to a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximize long-term value of assets.” The world’s top asset manager has quit the initiative because its membership has “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand wrote in a letter to institutional clients seen by the Financial Times. BlackRock assured its clients that the exit from the initiative “does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios. BlackRock’s active portfolio managers continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks.” BlackRock and major banks have come under increased pressure from Republican politicians and Republican-governed states over their pledges to scale back funding for fossil fuel projects. Texas authorities, for example, have decided to withdraw $8.5 billion in assets of the Permanent School Fund from the asset manager. The Texas legislature passed a law in 2021 to penalize financial firms that, according to state authorities, discriminate against energy companies. At the end of November, a group of Republican states led by Texas sued BlackRock and fellow asset managers Vanguard and State Street, for alleged violation of antitrust laws. The states allege that the asset managers have been pressuring coal firms to lower output to cut emissions, thus driving up electricity prices in America. In pulling out of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, BlackRock became the latest major Wall Street financier to exit such groups. Since early December, the biggest U.S. banks – Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and JP Morgan – have all quit the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs celebrate 1st birthday with 1.13 million BTC under management

Fidelity and BlackRock lead as spot Bitcoin ETF investors turn $36 billion into $107 billion in 2024. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States reach their first anniversary tomorrow after over $35 billion in inflows and assets under management of 1.13 million BTC, according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock led the year with $37.85 billion, offset by Grayscale’s net outflow of $21.58 billion. Fidelity’s $12.14 billion is in second place, while Ark and Bitwise also broke $2 billion, with the rest bringing in between $200 and $800 million. Within three months of launch, IBIT’s assets under management stood at $15 billion, while FBTC reached $8 billion. Cumulative net inflows across all Bitcoin ETFs eventually rose to $36.3 billion, with total net assets at $107 billion or 1.13 million BTC. While the inflows represent new money entering the Bitcoin ETFs, the total AUM reflects the combined effect of these inflows, Bitcoin’s price appreciation, and the existing holdings of converted funds. The AUM can be significantly larger than the reported inflows alone. Spot Bitcoin ETF assets (Source: Bitbo) The broad acceptance of these ETFs has spurred speculation around additional crypto-focused offerings. Record-breaking Bitcoin inflows contributed to hopes for a future wave of digital asset funds, with analysts projecting $35 billion in potential Bitcoin ETF inflows in 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself has maintained a trading range near five figures ahead of the anniversary, moving between $91,000 and $102,000. When the ETFs launched in 2024, Bitcoin’s price was around $46,000, following a momentum-fueled surge from $25,000 in mid-August 2023. Tomorrow, spot Bitcoin ETFs as an asset class cement a historic first year, smashing perceived glass ceilings and challenging conventional ETFs in ways many in traditional finance did not see coming. In a mere 12 months, BlackRock’s IBIT has become the 33rd-largest ETF in the United States. It is also in the top 30 ETFs globally for the past year.

Title: What can blockchain do beyond crypto?
URL: https://qz.com/blockchain-uses-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-technology-1851735689
Time Published: 2025-01-10T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
If you’re familiar with cryptocurrency, you’ve likely come across the term ‘blockchain.’ Blockchain is the foundational technology behind cryptocurrency. Simply put, it’s a digital, decentralized ledger distributed across a network. Imagine it as a secure, publicly accessible database shared among all participants in the network. Blockchain’s potential goes far beyond cryptocurrencies. With countless use cases, this technology is poised to simplify and enhance various aspects of our lives. Let’s explore how blockchain technology operates in various fields beyond cryptocurrencies. 2 / 7 One of the standout features of blockchain technology is its ability to securely record data that cannot be altered. This immutability proves invaluable in supply-chain management. As businesses expand globally, ensuring transparency from the source to the end consumer becomes increasingly crucial. Blockchain enables manufacturers to create and maintain reliable, traceable records of material movements throughout the supply chain. Retail giant Walmart, for example, leverages blockchain technology to address food supply-chain challenges. This allows the company to efficiently track products and streamline its management, ensuring greater accountability and trust. Similarly, shipping giant FedEx (FDX) says it utilizes blockchain technology to enhance its delivery services. 3 / 7 It’s common to misplace important documents such as Social Security cards, birth certificates, vaccination records, and other essential paperwork. Now, imagine moving to a new city where you’re required to present these records for verification. The process of locating and sharing them can quickly become a nightmare, especially if they’ve been lost. Blockchain technology offers a solution to this issue by storing all your documents and identification records on a network. The tech can theoretically ensure such documents are securely stored, easily accessible, and protected from unauthorized alterations. Blockchain has already been used for identification in real-world scenarios. For example, during the Syrian refugee crisis, blockchain technology was used to record the identities of refugees securely. It also facilitated the management of financial aid and grocery purchases, enabling refugees to access necessary resources without any hurdles. 4 / 7 Keeping track of medical records from birth to the present can feel overwhelming, especially when relying on physical files for every doctor’s visit or treatment. Maintaining these records becomes even more challenging with frequent relocations or changes in healthcare providers. Blockchain technology offers a solution to enhance the management of patient records. By leveraging blockchain, medical data can be efficiently tracked and maintained, ensuring seamless access to critical information such as drug supply chains, treatment histories, insurance claims, payments, and more. This technology also bolsters data integrity, providing a tamper-proof system that safeguards sensitive information. 5 / 7 It is difficult to imagine how an intangible technology such as blockchain could transform the real estate sector. But it is arguably now a reality. Blockchain technology is enabling real-world assets, such as real estate and land, to be divided into smaller, transferable units. This process, known as tokenization, is revolutionizing the way these assets are owned and distributed. In simple terms, the tokenization of funds is the process of converting real-world assets (RWAs) or funds into digital tokens using blockchain technology. RWAs encompass tangible assets such as real estate, intellectual properties, art, currencies, commodities, equities, bonds, money markets, and more. These assets frequently encounter challenges related to liquidity, transparency, and accessibility within the traditional financial world. Blockchain technology enables RWAs to be tokenized into digital tokens that allow fractional ownership, potentially making physical assets more accessible to a wider audience. Tokenizing RWAs can increase liquidity, transparency, and accessibility, and is often described as a way to democratize the traditional financial markets. Financial giants such as BlackRock and Visa have jumped into the world of tokenization. If a report by McKinsey & Company is to be believed, the potential value of tokenized assets could reach almost $2 trillion by 2030. 6 / 7 You may have heard of non-fungible tokens, commonly known as NFTs. An NFT is a unique digital asset that can take the form of art, music, in-game items, videos, and other types of digital content stored on a blockchain network and traded using cryptocurrency as a means of exchange. NFTs such as CryptoPunks, created by Larva Labs on the Ethereum blockchain, are among the most expensive. One art piece, CryptoPunk #5822, sold for $23 million in 2022. At first glance, it may seem fun and also ridiculous to consider why someone would spend $23 million on a digital photo that can easily be downloaded for free. The answer is arguably the same as it is for Monalisa’s paintings. Monalisa’s paintings are so valuable because there is only one original, despite the fact that many copies were made by different artists. It doesn’t matter how many copies are made; the value of Monalisa will remain the same. NFTs represent an early and primitive application of blockchain technology, with significant potential for evolution. They demonstrate how artists can leverage blockchain to protect their creations and secure them as intellectual property. In the virtual world, where copyrights and intellectual property rights are often ambiguous, blockchain provides a potentially powerful tool for creators to assert ownership and safeguard their work. 7 / 7

Title: Automattic says it will reduce its contribution to WordPress core project to match WP Engine

Automattic, the company that runs WordPress.com, said that it would reduce its contribution to WordPress core, the open source project that acts as the backbone of most of Automattic’s products and ensures the longevity of WordPress as a technology and community. Automattic CEO and WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg has been in a kerfuffle with WP Engine since September last year over the very issue of contribution to WordPress as an open source and community project. In a blog post, the company said that it would reduce the number of hours it commits to the Five For the Future program to match rival hosting provider WP Engine’s contribution in terms of the number of weekly hours. “As part of this reset, Automattic will match its volunteering pledge with those made by WP Engine and other players in the ecosystem, or about 45 hours a week that qualify under the Five For the Future program as benefitting the entire community and not just a single company. These hours will likely go towards security and critical updates,” Automattic said in the latest blog post. The company added that it will redirect the resources to the ongoing legal battle against WP Engine. At an event last year, Mullenweg called WP Engine “cancer to WordPress,” pointing out a large stake owned by private equity firm Silver Lake in the company and a lack of contribution from the hosting provider to support sustainable growth. In the new blog post, Automattic called out this fact again. “WP Engine’s historically slim contributions underscore the imbalance that must be addressed for the health of WordPress. We believe in fairness and shared responsibility, and we hope this move encourages greater participation across all organizations that benefit from WordPress,” Automattic said. Automattic contributes around 2,560 hours per week, as per Five for The Future’s dashboard. This number is already significantly less than the 3,900 hours per week the company contributed in September. It’s not clear if this reduction is because of the company’s shrinking headcount or a general strategy shift. The company’s new blog post also sarcastically noted that members of the “community” have considered working on commercial products like WordPress.com, Pressable, WPVIP, Jetpack, and WooCommerce as contributing to WordPress. So engineers will focus on building those products instead of contributing to WordPress core. Automattic is also under pressure to perform better on a financial point of view. In December, BlackRock marked down its investment in Automattic by 10% — and this wasn’t the first markdown. Overall, the investment firm has devalued its investment by more than 50%. The new directive related to contributions to the community project wasn’t the only decision related to WordPress.org. Earlier this week, Thijs Buijs, a WordPress core contributor and the person who led the sustainability team, decided to step down as a representative. The sustainability team focused on the longevity of WordPress through social, economic, and environmental aspects. According to a Slack screenshot posted on Reddit, Buijs disagreed with Mullenweg’s approach to advancing WordPress. In response, Mullenweg disbanded the sustainability Slack channel while saying, “Today, I learned we have a sustainability team.” Notably, Mullenweg initiated this channel’s idea during an event in 2022. Mullenweg’s approach to the legal battle with WP Engine has attracted calls for a different kind of leadership in the WordPress world. Last month, Joost de Valk, the creator of Yoast, a popular WordPress SEO tool, outlined a plan to make a “federated” approach to the WordPress repository for decentralized access to assets like plug-ins and themes.

Title: BlackRock part ways with major climate group after being targeted by Republicans for its efforts on global warming

BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. The money manager said Thursday in a letter to clients that it decided to leave the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas, alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. BlackRock also was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in the letter signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock added that it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. Over the past month, an equivalent coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. And with President-elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, Wall Street is bracing for more attacks on climate finance. “BlackRock has hung in there as long as it could, but the pressure has become too great, and the reputational and legal risks too high, just before Trump takes office,” Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed comment. And it “won’t be the last financial organization to quit a net zero initiative,” she said.

(Reuters) -BlackRock has asked the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to extend its deadline to reach an agreement on how the agency would oversee the giant asset manager's investments in FDIC-regulated banking organizations from Friday until March 31, according to a letter the firm sent to regulators on Thursday and obtained by Reuters. The letter is the latest move in a months-long tug of war between the FDIC and the biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the rules governing their passive investments in FDIC-regulated banks. In late December, Vanguard Investments hammered out terms of such a passivity agreement with the FDIC, which immediately afterward asked BlackRock to sign a very similar agreement by the Friday deadline. Investors in the futures options market are betting the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is headed higher to 5% in the near term, reflecting worries that the incoming Trump administration's policies will increase an already bloated fiscal deficit and revive inflation. Higher interest rates in general also mean increased borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. In swaptions, or options on interest rate swaps, the market is also pointing to higher 10-year rates, although not as straightforward as those on Treasury futures.

Title: BlackRock Exits UN-Backed Net-Zero Climate Pact
URL: https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/blackrock-exits-un-backed-net-zero-climate-pact-5789222
Time Published: 2025-01-10T05:58:45Z
Full Content:
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager overseeing approximately $11.5 trillion in assets, has decided to withdraw from a climate pact backed by the United Nations (UN) that advocates for aggressive de-carbonizing of the economy. Membership in the climate pact did not affect the way BlackRock managed client portfolios, according to the spokesperson, but it did lead to confusion about the company’s practices and subjected it to legal inquiries from public officials. Despite the NZAM exit, BlackRock remains committed to sustainable investing. Republicans, particularly from energy-producing states, have criticized the participation of banks and asset managers in net-zero coalitions as part of a progressive agenda and have accused them of antitrust violations. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement. “This is a stunning violation of State and federal law.” BlackRock has rejected the allegations, stating that the lawsuit undermines investments in essential companies that consumers depend on. “If they want to invest in hydrocarbons, we give them every opportunity to do it–the same way we invest roughly $138 billion in energy transition strategies for our clients,” Fink wrote. “That’s part of being an asset manager. We follow our clients’ mandates.”
