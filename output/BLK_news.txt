By STEVE KARNOWSKI and MARC LEVY, Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota regulators voted unanimously Friday to approve an investment group’s takeover of a power company over the objections of the state attorney general, big industrial electricity buyers and consumer advocates. In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. The approval came as electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests the bills of some residential customers are increasing to subsidize the rapid build-out of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers and the boom in artificial intelligence. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center in Minnesota Power’s territory in the northern part of the state, a lucrative prospect for the utility’s owner. Opponents also expressed fear that the sale would encourage more such deals across the U.S. Under the planned buyout, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will take over the publicly traded company Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. The buyout price is $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium, and assuming $2.3 billion in debt. In its petition, Allete told regulators that Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change under BlackRock and that the deal’s cost wouldn’t affect electric rates. Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five of the utility commissioners, sided with Allete and BlackRock. The state Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power and the investors negotiated a package of modifications this summer that included additional financial and regulatory safeguards. The department’s attorney, Richard Dornfeld, told the commission the changes will protect the public interest. The commission’s chair, Katie Sieben, agreed. “Because of the collective work of partners, stakeholders, labor, environmental groups and others, we’ve made the overall package better for Minnesota Power customers,” Sieben said. Opposing the deal were the state attorney general’s office and industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other iron mine owners, Enbridge-run oil pipelines, and pulp and paper mills. Allete argued that BlackRock will have an easier time raising the money that Minnesota Power needs to comply with a state law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Previously, an administrative law judge recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence revealed the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with “a high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,” and “assumed the absolute worst in these investors.” But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest. Opponents said they were dismayed by the approval. “Private equity ownership of Minnesota Power will likely mean higher bills, less accountability, and more risk for Minnesotans,” Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said in a statement. The national nonprofit says it seeks to bring transparency and accountability to the private equity industry. Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Title: BlackRock subsidiary buys up 78 data centers totaling 5 gigawatts in $40 billion deal — AI vendor Aligned added to company's portfolio

BlackRock is expanding its membership in the club of AI datacenter investors. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Another day, another blimp with billions flying the skies of AI. Today's currency transfer comes from BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), an investment fund set to write a big check to buy out Aligned Data Centers, a large AI datacenter company. Bloomberg cites sources with knowledge of the deal and pins the amount at a tidy $40 billion. Aligned may not be a household name in tech news, but according to its website, the company has 78 datacenters in locations around the U.S. and South America, totaling 5 GW of processing power capacity across current and future developments. Bloomberg remarks that Aligned got a $12 billion investment in January and was one of the companies that recently met with President Trump about speeding up the country's AI development. Aligned is also attracting attention from investor AGX (backed by Mubadala Investment Co.), which apparently wants to cut a separate deal with the datacenter provider. The report remarks that the deal is set to be inked in a few days, but is not yet finalized. However, it's hard to imagine the agreement being called off in this age, where AI businesses' exponential growth has every investor under the sun tossing money at the prospect of massive short-term lucre. The $40 billion in play makes this deal one of the biggest this year, though it's still early October, and it wouldn't be surprising to see other large bets in short order. Upon completion of the deal, Aligned would be joining CyrusOne in GIP's AI datacenter portfolio. The fund's many-paged checkbook isn't going back in the drawer anytime soon, either; it's reportedly considering buying out power company AES Corp. If this news sounds familiar, it's because it's reminiscent of datacenter provider CoreWeave getting a $6.4 billion infusion from OpenAI just recently. As for Sam Altman's company, it's been cutting deals like crazy, the biggest ones a $300 billion contract with Oracle, and a $100 billion partnership with Nvidia for building 10 GW's worth of datacenters.

Sponsored By ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ST. PAUL — Minnesota regulators signed off on the final approval needed to sell Allete to a pair of private investment firms. The five-member Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on Friday voted unanimously to approve the sale of Minnesota Power’s Duluth-based parent company to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners. ADVERTISEMENT The $6.2 billion deal, announced in May 2024, drew concern over private equity’s ownership of a utility and the potential for rising electricity rates. “We are grateful to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission for their thorough review and approval of this important and strategic partnership, and recognition that this is in the public interest,” Bethany Owen, chair, president and CEO of Allete, said in a news release following the decision. “Today’s decision caps a comprehensive public process and positions ALLETE well to meet the significant infrastructure demands of the clean-energy transition without compromising the high-quality service and commitments to reliability and affordability that define our company,” Owen said. The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, a consumer advocacy group, several environmental groups and Minnesota Power’s largest industrial customers were opposed to the sale, and an administrative law judge in July recommended, in a nonbinding opinion, that the PUC reject the deal as it wasn’t in the public interest. The role of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, came under particular scrutiny. Groups opposed to the deal feared Minnesota Power would favor deals that would benefit other BlackRock-owned companies at the expense of ratepayers. But Commissioner Hwikwom Ham disagreed, arguing that the fiduciary responsibility of CPP and BlackRock-owned GIP would prevent that and that the PUC itself could protect ratepayers from this in future rate cases. “The Commission’s confidence that they have the capacity, authority, and objectivity to regulate the likes of BlackRock — a financial behemoth that has tentacles in every part of the global economy — rings hollow, especially when they already oversee regular utility rate hikes that families struggle to afford,” said Maggie Schuppert, director of strategic intiatives for CURE, one of the environmental groups opposed to the deal. ADVERTISEMENT “It will fall on community and ratepayer advocates, utility watchdogs, and the public itself to hold these entities and the PUC to account and mitigate the harms of this decision,” Schuppert said. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, unions, a different consumer advocacy group and several clean energy groups supported the deal. Allen Gleckner, chief policy officer of clean energy group Fresh Energy, said the group lent its support for the sale of Minnesota Power when it decided the deal “would significantly mitigate risk to the transition to clean energy in Minnesota.” “We applaud the Commission for remaining focused on the substance of the issues at hand and what’s in the public interest of Minnesotans,” Gleckner said. Allete, which has long been publicly traded on the stock market, has maintained that going private under the ownership of GIP and CPP would allow it to more quickly and reliably access the money needed to fund its transition away from coal and carbon emissions and reach Minnesota’s law requiring 100% of the state’s electricity to be carbon-free by 2040. PUC Chair Katie Sieben said that while it “drove me nuts” to hear that the acquisition was needed to meet that law, she believed the PUC should approve the deal because investment was necessary to ensure reliability and affordability. “Whether Minnesota Power is publicly traded or privately held, it needs to comply with the laws of the state of Minnesota, including the state's 2040 carbon-free law. … Minnesota Power does need massive amounts of investment,” Sieben said. “That's not due to the state's carbon-free law necessarily, but also due to the fact that many of the utilities' assets are at end of age and need investment.” ADVERTISEMENT She added that support from commissioners came at different stages of the process, as parties involved in the proceedings reached agreements that got “it over the net benefit threshold of what would be in the public interest.” Throughout the nearly year and a half that the deal was in front of the PUC, and in particular the last few weeks, Allete, GIP and CPP have agreed to a series of commitments, including: Some PUC members said Friday that they had originally been skeptical about the deal, and Commissioner Joseph Sullivan said he had been opposed to the deal as recently as the Sept. 25 oral arguments but ultimately supported the sale Friday. “I still do have concerns in the out years … I’m concerned about what happens in the future, 10-15 years from now,” Sullivan said. “But I do think that the benefits in the near term and medium term clearly outweigh the status quo and clearly show that the partners, the parties, are taking very serious their commitment to the state.” He acknowledged the concerns residents of Northeastern Minnesota have about the deal and instructed Minnesota Power, GIP and CPP to build credibility with the public and customers. “If you don’t build that credibility,” Sullivan said, “that will redound unfavorably to everybody.” This story was updated at 2:40 p.m. Oct. 3 with details from Friday's meeting and reaction to the deal's approval. It was originally posted at 11:24 a.m. Oct. 3. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

Title: Vanguard Rivals Finally Get Hands On Its Tax-Busting Fund Design

Dozens of firms are on the verge of gaining acceptance to create an ETF as one of the share classes of a mutual fund. October 3, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- For more than two decades, US money managers have looked on enviously as Vanguard Group reaped the benefits of a unique structure that grafted the advantages of an ETF onto its biggest mutual funds. The design, protected by patent, saved its investors billions of dollars and helped the Jack Bogle-founded firm grow into an $11 trillion giant. Now, in what could be the most consequential shift in the American investment industry in years, Vanguard is finally set to lose that competitive edge. Dozens of rival asset managers are on the brink of adopting the same structure, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission indicated it will allow the quantitative firm Dimensional Fund Advisors to do so in the coming weeks. Roughly 80 more competitors are in the queue for approval, including nearly every major name in the business. The model they want to follow creates an exchange-traded fund as one of the share classes of a mutual fund, a move that ports the famous tax efficiency of the younger structure to the older vehicle. Assuming the approvals come, it will likely trigger a wave of new ETF launches, re-write the tax and performance of countless mutual funds, and potentially finally erode the barrier that has until now largely locked ETFs out of the American retirement system. Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes “We already feel like we’re attached to a rocket ship, moving as fast as we can to launch more products,” said Brittany Christensen, head of business development and senior vice president at Tidal Financial Group, which helps create and run ETFs. “When I think about putting more fuel on that fire, that’s absolutely what this does.” Technical challenges to implementing the new structure remain, so the landscape won’t alter overnight. And since most major money managers already offer ETFs — having long ago given in to investor demand for the easier-to-trade, often cheaper vehicles — some market watchers have questioned how many will actually deploy it. But the size of the waitlist — more than six-times the number of firms that were racing for approval to launch Bitcoin funds — suggests huge industry-wide enthusiasm to take up the Vanguard blueprint. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said it’s “like sitting on a bunch of CDs and here’s a chance to convert them all into digital.” Asset manager giants including BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price Group and Franklin Resources Inc. are among the firms seeking regulatory permission to deploy the hybrid structure. Some have been waiting for about two years, ever since Vanguard’s patent expired. Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) In a virtual meeting on Monday, the SEC told pending applicants they should conform their filings to that of DFA’s, but did not provide guarantees on when they would sign off on the next applications, according to four people familiar with the matter. BlackRock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley and F/m Investments are among those that have already updated their paperwork. “This is big for the T. Rowes of this world that don’t already have super well-established ETF businesses and they’re suffering outflows from their mutual funds,” said Adam Sabban, associate director, equity strategies at Morningstar Inc. While it’s unclear if it will help generate new inflows, “it could help them retain their current assets and slow the pace of outflows,” he said. Some firms, including F/m, are looking to create mutual fund share classes of ETFs, opening the door for those products to break into 401ks. The pension system was built around mutual funds, and most platforms are not equipped to handle the intraday moves and liquidity of an ETF. Unexpectedly, even the pioneer of the ETF-within-a-mutual-fund model is on the waitlist. Vanguard only has permission to use the structure on passive funds, so the firm is now seeking approval to deploy it in active products. Related:Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs “The multi-share class ETF structure has served Vanguard index investors well for more than two decades,” said a company spokesperson. “The structure has multiple benefits for both conventional mutual fund and ETF investors, and Vanguard looks forward to bringing the benefits of the multi-share class ETF structure to investors in active funds.” Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard first introduced the model in 2001, when ETFs were still in their infancy. Recognizing its potential value, the firm obtained a patent that restricted rivals from using it until 2023. Technically, the dual share class structure remained available for other issuers, provided they agreed a licensing arrangement with Vanguard and gained exemptive relief from the SEC. But in the years since granting Vanguard approval, the watchdog developed worries relating to conflicts of interest among share classes, and no other exemptions were given. The SEC said it intends to approve DFA’s relief application later in October, unless there is a request for a hearing on the matter. “For too long, the artificial divide between mutual fund and ETF share classes has limited investor choice, operational efficiency, and resulted in suboptimal tax treatment,” SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said in a Monday statement. The proposed approval will facilitate competition because “similar relief has been long held by a single asset manager,” he said. The regulator said on Wednesday that owing to the government shutdown it was unable to provide further comment. The level of maturity already reached by the ETF industry may blunt the impact of the widespread use of the dual share class structure. Dave Nadig, president and director of research at etf.com, believes that any issuer with a decent approach will have pushed into ETFs years ago. Ben Fulton, CEO of WEBs Investments Inc., sees potential for this to be a “Y2K moment,” where significant time and resources are spent to achieve very little. Firms planning to deploy dual share classes face plenty of practical hurdles. A May report from JPMorgan Chase & Co. argued that launching a successful ETF strategy “is not just as simple as adding a share class to an existing mutual fund and expecting it to gain assets.” “An issuer needs to focus on the addition of capital markets services, a specific ETF distribution plan, platform strategies, and operational impacts as part of a successful launch plan,” the authors wrote. One issue is how firms will handle investors who want to switch, tax-free, from the mutual fund share class into the ETF class, to benefit from the intraday liquidity in the latter wrapper. The process is not automatic and requires both the asset manager and the individual investor to take action. “There’s some work left to be done with the platforms in terms of making that operationally more efficient,” Gerard O’Reilly, DFA’s co-CEO and co-CIO, told Bloomberg TV on Monday. DFA is hoping to have ETF share classes for a number of mutual funds available in the first couple months of 2026, he said. Meanwhile, issuers launching an ETF for the first time will need to liaise with market makers, which play a key role in keeping fund shares trading through the day — something not needed by mutual funds. If mutual fund companies launch ETF share classes en masse, it could put huge demand on the market-making ecosystem. It’s also an open question whether broker-dealers, who have strict requirements to operate in the best interest of their clients, will need to shift assets into the ETF share class, or whether they will be required to allow both share classes of the same fund on their platforms simultaneously. In a survey by Cerulli Associates in May, more than half of ETF issuers polled said “broker-dealer reluctance to approve/make share classes available on platform” was a significant challenge. “Although we’ve been working with several asset managers on operational readiness, I still think there’s going to be work for some of them — especially with the distribution channel, with the broker-dealers — to ensure that everyone’s ready for this,” said Frank Koudelka, global head of ETF Solutions at State Street. Still, the direction of travel is clear, according to Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar. He said all concerns and obstacles facing the use of ETF share classes would be overcome within as little as three years. “ETFs are playing a starring role in life after mutual funds,” he said. “Their role is going to be elevated even further now.” Emily Graffeo Loukia Gyftopoulou You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Oct 1, 2025 Content Spotlight Navigate today's complex financial landscape with our comprehensive 2025 Midyear Outlook.

Title: Spiritans adding to suffering of survivors of sex abuse in their schools, says advocacy group

The Spiritan religious order has been accused of adding to the suffering of survivors abused in their schools through ongoing delays in announcing a redress scheme. The Restore Together group, which represents survivors of abuse in Blackrock College, Willow Park School, Rockwell College in Tipperary, along with St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College in Dublin, accused the order of a “lack of urgency” in the matter. By November last year, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published in September 2024. In a statement on Friday, Restore Together said the Spiritan order last June issued a public statement about making plans to commence a redress scheme for victims or survivors of abuse suffered at Spiritan schools. It said the order hoped to have an update by “the end of the summer”. The group said the Spiritans had not made any statement and since the end of the summer and it had been seeking a meeting with the Spiritans “to discuss urgently progressing the agreed restorative programme, but to no avail”. [ Spiritans’ promise of redress must be ‘substantiated by actions’, says abuse survivors groupOpens in new window ] This “lack of urgency is seen and felt as a further abuse of victims/survivors, one of control, by the order that abused them sexually decades ago”, the group said, adding that the Spiritans have had “more than enough time to properly address it”. In the meantime victims, survivors and their families “continue to suffer trauma daily”. This “ongoing lack of urgency” on the Spiritans’ part is “not acceptable to victims/survivors, their families and friends or Restore Together”. It called for the timely delivery of “the full programme the Spiritans have signed up” for. Otherwise, the groups said, its benefit “will be diluted, or even lost if people are made to wait too long and fight for every element of it”. [ Spiritans accused of putting own interests before those of abuse victimsOpens in new window ] The group said it has been more than four years since Restore Together first engaged with the Spiritans on this, while it is “three years since we launched the Restorative Process Framework with them”. It noted that most victims and survivors are “60 or older and have carried this burden for decades”. Last June, in an open letter to survivors of abuse by members and employees of the Spiritan congregation, Provincial Fr Brendan Carr announced “a restorative framework which we hope can help all to arrive at a different place in this painful and difficult journey”. It was his “sincere hope”, Fr Carr said then, that by the end of the summer he could “provide a further, more detailed update of the progress we are making in forging new paths to create a just redress scheme”. In response to queries from The Irish Times, a spokesman for the Spiritans said they would “not be comment” on the latest Restore Together statement.

Early flows are reported around 180-190,000 bpd, well below pipeline nameplate but significant enough to hit crude benchmarks. Turkey, long resistant over the ICC arbitration ruling that saddled it with $1.5 billion in damages, signed off once it secured leverage of its own: proposals to build four refineries in northern Iraq and carve out a role beyond transit. Ankara also benefits from restored fees and influence as a corridor state, while quietly betting that U.S. pressure to ease global supply tightness will insulate it from the legal overhang. The real drivers of the breakthrough were Baghdad’s fiscal need for revenues, Erbil’s economic desperation, and Washington’s insistence on de-bottlenecking northern exports. For now, the flows are real but not at capacity, the companies are only partially back on board, and the framework is fragile. Each 30-day renewal cycle will become a bargaining round, with arrears, revenue-sharing, and arbitration liabilities still hanging over the corridor. DNO and Genel have not fully re-entered the new Baghdad–Erbil export framework, leaving Kurdistan’s flows below potential. Both firms continue producing but are diverting much of their crude into the local market rather than nominating volumes to SOMO for pipeline export. Output is being throttled (some wells left under-utilized, drilling programs paused, and operational ramp-ups on hold) a deliberate tactic to preserve leverage. Their arrears, estimated near a billion dollars, remain unpaid, and the new contract terms cap returns at a flat per-barrel service fee, far below the profit-oil model they previously operated under. With the export agreement only running on 30-day renewals through year-end, DNO and Genel are signaling they won’t sink fresh capital or restore plateau volumes until arrears and terms are resolved. The net effect is that Ceyhan flows are restarting at ~180-190 kbpd instead of approaching the 400+ kbpd capacity, highlighting that without these two operators’ full participation, northern exports will remain constrained and the political settlement fragile. The Kremlin is pushing hard against EU plans to tap frozen Russian assets, calling it theft and warning of retaliation. Brussels is weighing whether to use only the windfall interest or move toward seizing principal, with Washington pressing for the latter. Moscow is framing this as a direct attack on the sanctity of reserve holdings, with obvious implications for non-aligned states watching how safe their own money is in Western banks. Countermeasures are already being floated — expropriation of European assets still inside Russia, financial restrictions, commodity leverage. The warning lands just as Brussels debates tighter enforcement on oil sanctions, which only sharpens Moscow’s line that Europe is shifting from financial freeze to outright confiscation. Discovery & Development BP just approved a $5 billion spend on its Tiber–Guadalupe deepwater project in the U.S. Gulf, marking one of its biggest bets there in over a decade. The hub will tie in discoveries, including Tiber (2009) and Guadalupe (2014), targeting ~80,000 bpd at peak with first oil slated for 2032. BP is positioning this as part of its Paleogene push, where Chevron (CVX), Exxon (XOM) and Shell (SHEL) are also advancing high-cost but long-life plays. The move reflects a renewed appetite for mega-projects in the Gulf just as global majors juggle capital discipline with extending oil output. Exxon is trying to revive its Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique, a ~$30 billion development stalled since 2020 by insurgent violence in Cabo Delgado. CEO Darren Woods met this week with President Filipe Nyusi to push for tighter security guarantees so Exxon can restart. FID has now shifted to 2026. Rovuma would export 18 mtpa, bringing Mozambique closer to the status of Qatar and the U.S. as a top LNG supplier if it moves forward. MidOcean Energy, backed by EIG and Saudi Aramco, just bought a 20% stake in Petronas’ upstream gas assets tied to LNG Canada, one of the biggest export projects under construction. The deal plugs MidOcean into a 14 mtpa development led by Shell (SHEL) and expected online in 2025–26. LNG Canada is already oversubscribed on volumes, with Phase 2 under study that could double capacity. For Aramco, the move builds exposure to North American LNG just as Asian buyers scramble to lock in long-term supply. India has revealed a natural gas discovery in the Andaman Sea basin, a frontier area long thought to hold sizable untapped reserves. The find is being called a potential game-changer for India’s energy security, with ONGC leading exploration and officials hinting that it could open a new gas province. India imports more than half its gas, so even modest output here could ease the bill and reduce reliance on LNG cargoes. Development will hinge on further appraisal drilling and whether infrastructure can be built to move gas to demand centers on the east coast. Deals, Mergers & Acquisitions Berkshire Hathaway just agreed to buy Occidental Petroleum’s OxyChem unit for $9.7B in cash, marking Warren Buffett’s largest acquisition in years. For Oxy (OXY), the sale trims debt after its $55B Anadarko buyout left the balance sheet stretched, while keeping focus on upstream oil and Permian growth. OxyChem is one of North America’s biggest PVC and chlorine producers, so Berkshire is getting a defensive cash-flow engine with long-cycle demand. The deal shows Buffett is still willing to swing big in energy, even as Oxy doubles down on crude. BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners is in late-stage talks to buy AES Corp. in a $38B deal including debt. It would be one of the largest utility takeovers in U.S. history. AES has been building out renewable generation and supplying power to hyperscale data centers, making it a prime target as AI-driven electricity demand soars. For BlackRock, it’s a chance to grab a regulated cash-flow engine with growth optionality in renewables. The deal isn’t final yet, but if sealed, it would underscore how AI is reshaping utility M&A just as fast as it’s reshaping power demand. Tamboran Resources is moving to acquire Falcon Oil & Gas in a ~$172M all-stock deal, consolidating control of Australia’s Beetaloo Basin. The basin is viewed as one of the country’s biggest undeveloped shale gas plays, with Tamboran pushing to unlock LNG export potential as Asian demand rises. Falcon shareholders will get about 10% of the combined group, giving Tamboran full operatorship across key permits. The move is aimed at accelerating drilling scale and positioning Beetaloo as a future competitor to U.S. shale and Qatar LNG. BKV Corp just closed a $370M deal to buy Barnett shale assets from BHP’s old North Texas portfolio, adding ~300 MMcfe/d of production. The Barnett is mature but still cash-flowing, and BKV (already one of the top U.S. private gas producers) is betting it can squeeze more value through efficiency and scale. The acquisition lifts BKV’s footprint in the play to nearly 500,000 net acres. It’s another sign that while big publics chase LNG-linked growth, privates are still finding bargains in legacy shale gas. To access this exclusive content...

Title: Bitcoin Supercycle? Jeff Park Says Gold’s $1 Trillion Gains Could Spark It

Time Published: 2025-10-03T10:15:14Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a wide-ranging interview with Anthony Pompliano published on October 2, Jeff Park, partner and Chief Investing Officer at ProCap BTC, argued that gold’s surging price and shifting global ownership patterns are not a threat to Bitcoin—but potentially the catalyst for its next structural leg higher. Park’s thesis centers on flows, geopolitics, and balance-sheet mechanics: if policymakers and large allocators learn to tap the paper gains embedded in sovereign gold holdings, they could redirect a meaningful slice of that liquidity into Bitcoin and ignite what he repeatedly framed as a supercycle. “The math is pretty simple,” Park said. “What if we find a way to unlock the ability to build leverage on the paper gains of gold to take a call option on Bitcoin? There’s something incredible here that could happen.” In his back-of-the-envelope scenario, “a trillion dollars of Bitcoin is actually hugely impactful for the bitcoin market.” He contrasted the magnitude of such an impulse with the size of the US fiscal problem, suggesting that while a trillion dollars is small relative to public debt, it would be outsized in a young asset with finite supply and thin free float. Park’s remarks were prompted by a simple question: why is gold ripping while Bitcoin has lagged on a relative basis? He did not dispute gold’s leadership—calling it “the story of the year”—but argued the drivers differ. Gold is presently the venue for acute geopolitical expression and central-bank rebalancing, while Bitcoin’s adoption curve hinges on institutional flows that are still ramping. “Ultimately [these markets] are driven by flows,” he said, adding that Bitcoin’s flows are “inevitable” so long as the institutional agenda advances with “focused deliberation.” A crucial plank of Park’s framework is the changing geography of gold. He pointed to two simultaneous realities: the headline that US gold reserves have reached a large notional value because of price—and the under-discussed fact that the US share of global official gold has sunk over decades. “At one point post-World War II the US had over 50% of the world’s global gold reserve supply as a central bank and now it’s less than 20%. So who’s making up for the compensation on their side? Likely China and many other BRIC countries in the lead.” That shift, Park argued, helps explain the persistence of gold’s bid. China, in his telling, is exerting influence not only through accumulation but also by building market infrastructure. He highlighted “the launch of the Shanghai Gold Exchange” and the rise of “the Shanghai Futures Exchange,” observing that “physical gold now actually trades in China” at a scale once associated with London. In a symbolic move earlier this year, “for the first time [they] opened up vaults in Hong Kong to allow offshore investors to put their gold in reserves,” a step Park sees as part of a longer-term strategy to enhance the creditworthiness of CNY-settled commodity trade. Park then connected this gold realignment to Bitcoin’s addressable demand. He referred to the scenario in which the US takes the massive unrealized gains on its gold if marked at market and either revalues or borrows against those gains to purchase Bitcoin for its strategic reserve under President Donald Trump. “Gold has been marked at the Treasury at $42 an ounce and we all know right now it’s trading at [roughly] 3850… There’s a trillion dollars of basically paper gains.” In that context, he argued that leveraging paper gains into a scarce digital reserve asset could be a high-beta upgrade to the sovereign balance sheet. Pressed on the political feasibility, Park distinguished between executive action and legislation. “The executive path is a great starting point to create a watershed moment,” he said, but “no democratic coalition is truly bought in until a legislative motion.” The former could demonstrate intent; the latter would make a Bitcoin reserve strategy “irreversible” and align it with the broader social mandate he associates with sound-money adoption. The crux of his “supercycle” framing is compounding. Park walked through return profiles to quantify why a large base allocation, even if financed, could matter over time. “If you own Bitcoin and you assume that it’s going to go up by 12% a year, you’ll make a 30x in 30 years… If you think it’s actually going to go up by 40% per year, which is what the [asset] has been otherwise annualizing, it’s 10 years.” He stressed that the point is not to promise those numbers, but to illustrate how modest annualized returns can cover meaningful fiscal gaps when the base is large enough and the asset is credibly scarce. Park also addressed why Bitcoin has not matched gold’s recent pace. Part of the answer, he suggested, is optics: Bitcoin is “living, breathing software” that evolves via open debate, whereas gold’s appeal is its millennia-long immutability. The transparency of Bitcoin’s governance can spook newcomers who only see the noise. “If I were outside and I was a BlackRock ETF buyer and I listened to the conversation that’s happening between the Bitcoin developers, I might say, ‘Hold on a second. This is crazy stuff.’” Even so, he framed current developer disputes—such as arguments over relay policy or spam-filter defaults—as hygiene issues, not existential ones. They matter for performance and propagation, but not for the core monetary assurances: “21 million or bust.” He invoked the lessons of the block-size war to explain why the system’s checks and balances are a feature, not a bug. “Ultimately, who is running consensus at Bitcoin?… The node clients are very valuable and they are in control versus miners and their self-interests. And that was a huge moment because it showed you decentralization was alive.” The line between hard-coded rules and socially enforced norms will always invite argument, he conceded, but in his view that process “future-proof[s] Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value.” Throughout, Park returned to flows. Gold’s flows, in his assessment, are being pulled by geopolitics and central-bank behavior—especially in Asia. Bitcoin’s flows will be pulled by institutional adoption and, potentially, by policy innovation that converts dormant balance-sheet strength into active demand. That is why he sees the assets as complements within the same macro problem set rather than rivals fighting for a single inflow. “Gold’s greatest cultural power is its impermanent fixture in our mindset and its durability for eons,” he said. Bitcoin, by contrast, offers sovereignty, portability, and programmability that younger cohorts find intuitive. “Young people are mentally more able to do things that older people can’t… the trend of young people understanding digital store of wealth… is the big picture.” I spoke with @dgt10011 on whether we should be worried about bitcoin lagging gold’s performance, durability of bitcoin vs gold, how to think about bitcoin as living software, and a new theme referencing the retardification of society. Enjoy! YouTube: https://t.co/kwCRnibemU… pic.twitter.com/0BckI7h7Eb — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) October 3, 2025 If that generational shift meets a government-level balance-sheet pivot, Park believes the market structure can change quickly. “A trillion dollars of Bitcoin is hugely impactful,” he repeated, not because it solves everything overnight, but because it reorganizes incentives for issuers, custodians, and policymakers around a credibly scarce digital reserve. In that world, the present period—where gold leads and Bitcoin consolidates—may be remembered not as divergence, but as staging. “Bitcoin will catch up,” Park said. “These are ultimately driven by flows.” And if those flows are seeded by the very gold rally now commanding headlines, the supercycle label he’s willing to use may not be hyperbole, but simply a description of how compounding works when new liquidity finally meets hard caps.

About us Copy link Seventy-seven crypto companies raised over $3.3 billion in September, according to DefiLlama data. That brings the total funding for crypto companies to over $17 billion so far in 2025, outpacing 2024’s total by over $7 billion. And analysts say investment in the space is only accelerating. PitchBook predicts that the industry will raise $18 billion this year. Investors from Galaxy Ventures and Codebase expect it to go even higher and that investors will plough over $25 billion into the industry in 2025. Here are the crypto companies that raised the most money in September. Blockchain lender Figure Technology pulled off one of the year’s biggest crypto-linked floats, raising $787.5 million in its Nasdaq debut valuing the company at about $5.3 billion. Founded in 2018 by former SoFi chief Mike Cagney, Figure builds blockchain infrastructure to power loans and exchanges. It has already funded more than $16 billion in loans and is expanding into crypto-backed lending and digital asset trading. Superstar investors including legendary trader Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office have lined up for the offering. Kraken recently closed a $500 million fundraising round at a $15 billion valuation, a final step before its planned IPO, Fortune reported. To be sure, Kraken has not publicly confirmed the raise. The raise was, according to Fortune, part of Kraken’s plans to go public. It hinted as far back as 2021 that it planned to debut on the stock market, but those plans were delayed due to market downturns and conflicts with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration. Yet, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi recently told DL News in an exclusive interview that the company doesn’t have any plans to follow rival exchanges Bullish and Gemini and file for an initial public offering. “If we were a part of what I call the pack of companies that have FOMO to go public, then we would have already filed,” he told DL News. He also said that Kraken did raise money as part of its drive to acquire NinjaTrade, a retail futures trading platform, for $1.5 billion in March. That raise, Sethi told DL News, put Kraken’s valuation at $15 billion. Rapyd, the global fintech platform for cross-border payments, has closed a $500 million Series F round backed by Wall Street titans including BlackRock, Fidelity, General Catalyst, and Dragoneer. The raise aims to bring deep liquidity pools, crypto-as-a-service, fiat on- and off-ramps, and custody solutions to Rapyd’s platform. Rapyd, meanwhile, is preparing new web3 offerings aimed at bridging digital assets and traditional finance across payments, DeFi and embedded finance.

Title: Iren: Company built by two Sydney brothers Dan and Will Roberts now worth more than ASX

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics Three years ago a computer company built by two Sydney brothers, Dan and Will Roberts, looked like it was going broke. On Friday morning shares in their datacentre business, Iren, hit a record high in the US, turning them into Australia’s newest billionaires. Iren is worth around $19 billion, or more than Qantas Airways or the Australian Securities Exchange, which wasn’t interested in the Bitcoin miner when it tried to float in 2021. Trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market instead, the stock has risen 678 per cent over the past six months, driven by demand for AI-specialist computer servers the brothers lease out to big technology companies. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters. Get the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox. Based on Thursday’s trading, the brothers are worth $1.06 billion each, placing 35-year-old Will among the richest ten Australians under 40. Daniel is 41. The brothers attended Sydney boys school Saint Ignatius’ College and studied business at University of Technology, Sydney. Both men declined to comment on their new wealth. A professional investor who follows the stock, Shaun Weick at Wilson Asset Management, said they had perfectly timed a shift from Bitcoin mining to Artificial Intelligence. “Some might say they’re lucky, some might say it’s skill,” he said. “It’s probably both, but they’ve been very clever pitching themselves with bitcoin and are now big beneficiaries of the AI story.” Three years ago it was unclear the company would survive. The shares had fallen 96 per cent. The business was bleeding cash and fighting off creditors who claimed they were owed more than $US100 million ($150 million). On December 28, 2022, the stock hit $US1.06. On Thursday it hit an intraday high of $US49.39. Before starting their own investment business, the brothers worked at investment bank Macquarie in Sydney, gaining experience across the capital market advisory, infrastructure, and renewable energy investment sectors, which their bitcoin and AI business now straddles. Daniel is a self-confessed bitcoin apostle. He regularly predicts the digital token’s price will hit a $US1 million by 2030. He’s also a keen skier, golfer, and AFL fan, who spends his time between the company’s data centre sites in Texas in the US and homes in Sydney, with a farmstead in regional New South Wales. He regularly flies between Sydney and Houston on Qantas, and doesn’t mind reminding Australians that he was rejected in his home town. “After the brown cardigans at the ASX rejected us due to their anti-technology stance, IREN - now ASX100 scale - was forced to list overseas. I know others haven’t even bothered trying locally as a result,” he wrote on LinkedIn a few months ago. In response the ASX said it doesn’t comment on individual companies, but has supported around 190 prior tech-specific floats and 11 are worth more than $10 billion. “We consider a range of factors when evaluating an entity’s suitability for listing, including the organisational structure and the nature of its business operations,” a spokesperson said. Iren’s ASX listing likely failed because it was a bitcoin miner, which was an alien quantity to regulators in 2021. The company was known as Iris Energy before changing its name in 2024. In November 2021, the brothers tied their company to bitcoin’s fortunes by listing it on the Nasdaq at the peak of a pandemic-era tech stock and crypto bubble linked to ultra-low interest rates and government money printing. The fastest interest rate hikes in a generation sent the business down 96 per cent into a near death spiral in 2022, before it recovered in line with rising bitcoin prices and a investor mania for companies linked to AI. Early investors included billionaire Atlassian co-founder and climate change activist Mike Cannon-Brookes via his Grok family office. Grok was attracted to Iris Energy’s initial business plan as a renewable energy powered data centre operator in Canada where hydro power is abundant. The brothers shifted from a clean energy data centre dream to zero-emission bitcoin mining in 2020 and shifted to leasing servers to AI operators in 2023. “They’ve just done a great job in pivoting the company,” said Wilson’s Mr Weick. “Bitcoin mining was first pitched as the key focus [to investors] and the [renewable energy] cost of compute would be their edge to generate profits and that’s another factor as we now move into AI. “They’ve also been appointed as an Nvidia preferred partner and that places them in a good position to access chips and build out capacity.” Their jaw-dropping success has drawn controversy. Creditors in the US sued them in Australian courts, claiming Iren owed $US107.3 million for bitcoin computers. The company got hit by a US short seller report last July. Culper Research labelled Iren “a painfully transparent stock promotion”. It called Iren’s claims that it could pivot into high performance computing (HPC) “nonsense” and pointed out the company had spent $US716 million since its inception. Iren has previously declined to answer questions about how a halving of the reward for mining bitcoins in April, 2024, affected its business. The short seller claimed the business would be “decimated” as it meant the same amount of computing power cost was needed for half the amount of bitcoin to be mined as a reward. Iren’s latest accounts show it earnt $US486.4 million from bitcoin mining last year at a cost in electricity of $US157.7 million. Net profit reached $US86.9 million. Share traders have largely dismissed the short seller’s claims and decided the Australian-led business is a potentially big AI beneficiary. Professional investors are largely on board too. On August 29, analysts at the brothers’ former employer, Macquarie Group, suggested their professional experience and expertise in conventional energy and infrastructure development gave them an edge. It noted they could use their experience to raise money to buy instal more servers with Nvidia computer chips for data centres that tech companies need to train their AI models on. The company has borrowed close to $US1 billon to fund expansion. Big investors include Blackrock, Fidelity and Citadel. Macquarie’s analysts say Iren is at risk from a fall in the bitcoin price. Both brothers are steadily cashing out of a business still largely tied to the fortunes of bitcoin. On September 11, they sold 1 million shares each for around $US66.4 million ($98 million) between them. In total both retain 13.99 million shares individually, worth $1.06 billion based on Thursday’s share price. Copy Link Copied Has relationship bliss finally ended Taylor Swift’s creative run?

Title: 'No excuse' as to why Spiritan redress scheme not started
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2025/1003/1536582-spiritans-redress/
Time Published: 2025-10-03T06:00:00Z

Ailbhe Conneely Social Affairs & Religion Correspondent The Spiritan Order has been accused of further traumatising victims and survivors of child sex abuse, by failing to implement the Independent Restorative Justice Framework it announced three years ago. The advocacy group Restore Together which represents many of victims/survivors of Dublin's Blackrock College and Willow Park School, Rockwell College, St Mary's College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College, has pointed to a lack of urgency by the order in completing the programme. The Spiritan Restorative Justice Framework has six elements including an apology, therapy, testimony (truth telling), redress, memorialisation and restorative justice. Just half of those have been activated in full according to Restore Together. The redress scheme and the truth searching process - to help the Spiritans and Irish society learn from the abuse scandal - has yet to be agreed and started. The last element (physical and other forms of memorialisation at Spiritan schools), will not be implemented until the other elements are activated and progressed. The restorative framework, which is independently managed, has the potential to be a ground-breaking development in Irish social justice if fully implemented, according to the group. It has described it as "progressively designed" to address the traumas of abuse in a holistic, collaborative and non-adversarial manner, to help people to heal and get justice, and to rebalance the power between victim and perpetrator. In a statement it said there was "no excuse" for not having all six elements implemented by now. Spokesperson Philip Freddis said the group "can't get a meeting" to discuss the status of the redress scheme and the other elements of the framework. He pointed out that those suffering are mainly in their 60s or older, "so we are deep into overtime". In June, the order said it realised that time was of the essence for those awaiting an announcement of a redress scheme. It acknowledged that the pace of putting the necessary framework for "overhauling and restructuring the assets of the Province" had been slow. It expressed hope that "a more detailed update of progress" would be issued by the end of the summer. Mr Freddis said the full Restorative Justice Framework "must be delivered in a timely way" or its benefit would be "diluted or even lost" if people had to wait and fight for every element of it. "Why after all these years, is there a lack of urgency and why must we be made to appeal, plead, fight and ultimately wait for justice like this? "We can only conclude that there is a lack of understanding, empathy and prioritisation by the Spiritans for their victims/survivors," he said.

Blackrock College in Dublin. Photo: Brian Lawless/PA Victims and survivors of child sex abuse at Spiritan schools are suffering “further trauma” due to ongoing delays in the delivery of a redress scheme, an advocacy group has said. The Spiritan schools involved are Blackrock College and Willow Park School, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College, all in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. The advocacy group Restore Together has said there is a “lack of urgency” in the setting up of an agreed redress scheme. Restore Together spokesperson Philip Feddis said the group was told in June that it would have an update by the end of the summer, but has not been able to hold a meeting to discuss the status of the redress scheme or other elements of a restorative framework. "We were told in June that we would have an update by the end of the summer, but currently we cannot even get a meeting to discuss the status of the Redress Scheme and the other elements of the Restorative Justice Framework that was announced no less than three years ago,” he said. "It is not acceptable to victims/survivors because justice delayed is justice denied. Blackrock College in Dublin. Photo: Brian Lawless/PA Today's News in 90 Seconds - October 3rd “It is over four years since we first engaged with the Spiritans on this scandal. The people suffering are mainly in their 60s or older, so we are deep into overtime. "The full Restorative Justice Framework must be delivered in a timely way or its benefit will be diluted or even lost if people are made to wait and fight for every element of it.” A restorative framework was first announced by the Spiritans in 2022, and according to Restore Together would be a “groundbreaking development in Irish social justice” if fully implemented. "Restore Together say there is no excuse for not having all six elements of the programme implemented by now considering it is decades after children were abused, over four years since Restore Together first met the Spiritans and three years since the Restorative Justice Framework itself was announced,” the group said in a statement. It said the delivery of a redress scheme, instead of individuals having to go to court, is a “particularly important element” of the promised programme, and just three of the six elements of the programme have been implemented. These elements include apology, therapy and counselling, and restorative justice services. Along with the redress scheme, Restore Together said a truth searching and gathering process is yet to be agreed, which would help the Spiritans and Irish society “learn from the abuse scandal”. The last element, physical and other forms of memorialisation at Spiritan schools, will not be implemented until the other five elements have been progressed. “There is no argument about the need to address the wrongs that continue to harm us or how it should be done,” Mr Feddis said. “So why, after all these years, is there a lack of urgency and why must we be made to appeal, plead, fight and ultimately wait for justice like this? We can only conclude that there is a lack of understanding, empathy and prioritisation by the Spiritans for their victims/survivors.” The Spiritans have been contacted for comment.

Title: Hyperliquid Still Best-Positioned Perp DEX Despite Aster’s Surge, DeFi Analyst Says
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/03/hyperliquid-still-best-positioned-perp-dex-despite-aster-s-surge-defi-analyst-says
Time Published: 2025-10-03T04:20:33Z
Full Content:
A new thesis from DeFi analyst Patrick Scott argues that despite losing market share to rivals, Hyperliquid remains the most investable decentralized exchange for perpetual futures. Perpetual futures — or perps — are crypto derivatives that allow traders to speculate on prices without an expiry date. The decentralized platforms that host them, known as perp DEXes, have surged in popularity as traders move activity away from centralized exchanges (CEXes) such as Binance. Scott noted that perp DEXes have expanded from less than 2% of CEX perpetual trading volume in 2022 to more than 20% last month. Hyperliquid, which issues the HYPE token, has been a key driver of that growth. Still, recent shifts have raised questions. Hyperliquid’s share of perp DEX volume fell from 45% to just 8% in recent weeks, while Binance-affiliated rival Aster ballooned to more than $270 billion in weekly trades. Other upstarts such as Lighter and edgeX also posted triple-digit percentage gains in activity. Scott argued that Hyperliquid’s fundamentals set it apart. The exchange continues to generate strong revenue, trading at what he described as a reasonable multiple compared to peers, with user stickiness reflected in open interest. “Unlike volume and revenue, which measure activity, open interest measures liquidity. It’s much stickier,” he wrote, noting Hyperliquid still commands about 62% of the perp DEX open interest market. Beyond trading, Scott highlighted expansion plans including the HyperEVM network, already hosting over 100 protocols and $2 billion in total value locked and USDH, a stablecoin backed by reserves held with BlackRock and Superstate. Another initiative, HIP-3, would allow builders to launch new perps markets by staking large amounts of HYPE, creating what Scott described as a “supply sink” for the token. Scott cautioned that his thesis would be invalidated if Hyperliquid’s open interest or revenue dropped materially, or if USDH failed to gain liquidity over the next year. But for now, he maintains Hyperliquid is better positioned than competitors running heavy incentive programs.

Title: Saudi considers removing foreign investor restrictions on stocks
URL: https://www.semafor.com/article/10/03/2025/saudi-considers-removing-foreign-investor-restrictions-on-stocks
Time Published: 2025-10-03T02:37:04Z
Full Content:
Saudi Arabia is preparing to lift restrictions on foreign investors buying local stocks, in the latest step by regulators to boost trading on the Tadawul exchange. The Capital Market Authority (CMA) launched a 30-day consultation on rules that, if approved, would scrap the so-called Qualified Foreign Investor (QFI) program, which forces international investors to meet certain criteria before they can trade. The proposal would also eliminate a swap program used by foreigners to access the market indirectly. The CMA said the move was part of a âgradual approach to opening the marketâ designed to attract âgreater flows of foreign capital.â It hinted that further measures would follow to increase international participation. In this article: Following on from moves announced last week, removing the QFI program signals that Saudi Arabia is getting serious about taking steps to attract foreign cash, even if the latest announcement sparked some confusion. The QFI program was introduced a decade ago as the kingdomâs first step to open its exchange to global money, initially requiring participants to have at least $5 billion of assets under management. At the time, regulators worried about an influx of âhot moneyâ entering and exiting quickly. No longer. Criteria have been eased several times since then as the kingdom increasingly sees the need to court foreign capital. Saudi Arabia has a big pipeline of companies planning to list on the stock market, many with government ownership. To digest all this new supply of shares the market will need to attract as many investors as possible. That should also help boost liquidity. Low volumes of trading has been a common bugbear for foreign investors looking at investing in Tadawul. There are now around 4,500 registered QFIs on the Saudi exchange, including some of the worldâs biggest fund managers: including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and JPMorgan Asset Management. Once the latest amendments to the rules are finalized anyone around the world will be able to quickly start investing in the Saudi market. Some investors were confused that the draft rules published Wednesday evening still contained references to a foreign ownership cap that was set to be amended. Dumping the QFI regime is the start. Next would be changes to foreign ownership limits, which are currently capped at 49%, two people familiar with the plans said. The CMA is reportedly working on a proposal to adjust that cap, though currently foreigners hold only about 11% of the market and no single stock is anywhere near the limit. Market reaction to the QFI consultation was muted, in contrast to the buying spree triggered by potential lifting of foreign ownership limits. But that was probably overdone. Saudi companies will still need to demonstrate strong earnings growth amid a public sector showing signs of slower spending if they are to truly attract more foreign capital.

Title: Meta Superintelligence Labs executives are pushing staff to ditch slow internal systems for faster engineering tools

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Meta's Superintelligence Labs is trying to speed up AI development by steering its teams toward new tools that allow developers to build and test products more quickly, according to internal memos obtained by Business Insider. The shift highlights the stakes of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's massive bet on AI. Over the past year, Meta has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into luring top researchers with nine-figure pay packages and reorganized its AI work under the new Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Now, its new leaders are revamping the internal engineering tools that those teams use — a shift that underscores the urgency with which Meta is moving as it races to catch up with rivals like OpenAI and Google. Internal documents show that MSL's Product and Applied Research (PAR) group, led by former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, is pushing staff away from Meta's slower, home-grown infrastructure toward mainstream developer platforms like Vercel. One memo from late September notes that Meta's existing systems, designed for billions of users and giant engineering teams, take "too long" to deploy changes and are "not conducive to vibe coding," making it harder for small, fast-moving AI teams to experiment. The practice of vibe coding, or having AI tools write code, is becoming more widespread among engineers in the tech industry. Meanwhile, Meta is also building an internal alternative called "Nest" that will integrate more easily with Meta's data for quick experimentation. Another internal post shows that Meta has paired Vercel with GitHub, a widely used code-hosting and collaboration platform owned by Microsoft, to give its PAR teams a faster way to work. Friedman and Alexandr Wang, Meta's new chief AI officer, are investors in Vercel. Vercel has become one of the biggest names in the market for building web and AI apps. In September, it raised $300 million at a $9.3 billion valuation from backers including Accel, Singapore's GIC, BlackRock, Khosla Ventures, and General Catalyst. The company's customers include giants like Netflix, Adobe, and Stripe. The memos offer a rare glimpse into how Meta is trying to accelerate its AI ambitions by relying on outside development and engineering tools, and sidestepping the limitations of its own systems that were built for a different era. Meta declined to comment. Vercel and GitHub did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. In one of the memos sent in late September, Aparna Ramani, head of infrastructure for MSL, told staff that the company's internal systems, which were built to support billions of users and massive teams of developers, don't work well for the small, fast-moving engineering teams inside PAR. "Deploying changes takes too long (hours vs. minutes), and the overall tech stack is not conducive to vibe coding," Ramani wrote. In other words, engineering tasks that would be quick and easy to deploy elsewhere often require more manual work at Meta, slowing teams down. Ramani's memo outlines a plan with two approaches to quickly build app prototypes and reduce deployment times from 99 minutes to two minutes or less. The first approach uses Vercel, which, Ramani wrote, is "widely used and can unblock MSL immediately." She wrote that Vercel is willing to work with Meta to mitigate some data and hosting restrictions. Ramani also wrote that Meta already has one tool running on Vercel, with multiple other projects in development. The second approach is to build an internal platform called "Nest" for hosting apps built with TypeScript — a popular Microsoft-created programming language widely used across the industry — on Meta's systems. Ramani wrote that a working prototype was expected within two weeks of the memo. Nest will eventually become the "de facto" option, and keeping Vercel available provides "an escape valve where there are capability gaps," the memo said. A second internal memo, published on September 17, shows how Meta used Vercel with GitHub to provide its PAR teams with a faster way to build and prototype apps. Meta is already running 10 projects on Vercel and GitHub, which could now be updated "in minutes," the post said. Meta has often turned to outside technology when its own tools fall short. Earlier this year, Business Insider reported that Meta rolled out an internal coding assistant called Devmate that uses AI models from rivals, including Anthropic's Claude, after employees said Meta's own Llama AI model struggled with complex tasks. Meta has also recently launched a feature called Vibes, which uses Midjourney, an external AI image generator, rather than its own image-generation technology. Friedman is an advisor to Midjourney.

Title: ‘I don’t know why I need to go to college’: Ford CEO says his Gen Z son worked as a mechanic and wondered if the 4-year degree was still worth it

Nick Lichtenberg is business editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Ford CEO Jim Farley gathered a host of experts this week to discuss what he calls “the essential economy,” the blue-collar backbone that he sees mired in crisis. AT&T CEO John Stankey and FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam talked about how AI is impacting manufacturing and how they’re hustling to stay ahead of the curve; Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a sober warning about how China could “dominate” if we’re not careful with our auto industry; and even JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon appeared via video to urge America not to become a “nation of compliance and box-checking.” But during the keynote discussion with Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and Mike Rowe of the Mike Rowe Works Foundation, Farley revealed how his own family is being impacted. “My son worked as a mechanic this summer,” Farley said while moderating. Then, Farley added, his son said something that stunned both of his parents: “Dad, I really like this work. I don’t know why I need to go to college.” Farley said he and his wife looked at each other and wondered, “Should we be debating this?” It’s something that’s happening in a lot of American households, he noted. “It should be a debate.” Rowe, a longtime vocational advocate, seized on data showing that while two skilled tradespeople enter the workforce, five retire each year. The imbalance, he explained, is “the math that’s catching up to us” as the baby boomer generation ages and birth rates fall. Rowe cited data from his own life. His own degree cost $12,200 in 1984, he said, whereas today it would cost something like $97,000. “Nothing in the history of Western civilization has gotten more expensive, more quickly,” Rowe said. “Not energy, not food, not real estate, not even health care, [nothing has been inflated more] than the cost of a four-year degree.” The Associated Press reported that, yes, many colleges were charging roughly $95,000 per year as of April 2024, but the financial aid system lowers that in practice. Still, it’s by and large true that inflation for college tuition, health care, and housing costs has far outpaced that for, say, televisions, toys, and software, showing Rowe is making a solid point. With costs this high, the value proposition of college is under serious scrutiny. Fortune has reported on several Gen Z entrepreneurs who dove straight into the trades instead of going to college. One, at 23, was already his own boss and making more than $100,000 per year, and the other, 19, was working his way up to it. Both of them had side hustles as social-media influencers, adding another revenue stream. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Arizona, said she often gives options to students that are different from a traditional four-year degree. “Our youth want to know why. Why do I need to go to college? Why do I want to get in debt? Why do I want to do these things?” She said that “because I told you so” doesn’t cut it anymore. Labor Secretary Chavez-DeRemer echoed this sentiment, saying government, educators, and industry must partner to make the skilled trades attractive to young Americans. “For far too long, we haven’t brought the right people to the table,” she said, emphasizing the need for collaboration so that “businesses are heard, and the American workforce is valued.” Chavez-DeRemer argued that if the average American wants to have a good-paying job and a mortgage, they should strongly consider the trades. She questioned: “Do you know that most of our 35- and 40-year-olds are not going to be able to buy a home anywhere near the future?” This is the time in people’s lives when they’re trying to grow their families, and the current U.S. economy does not set them up to do that, she said. She noted that trade school graduates often emerge earning more than $100,000 per year. The average tradesman will come out making about $11,000 more than a college graduate will, she said. The essential obstacle, said Rowe, is not just economics but stigma. “Stigmas and stereotypes and myths and misperceptions have conspired to keep a whole generation of kids from giving trades an honest look,” he said. Until the culture changes and people recognize the dignity and opportunity of these jobs, attempts to fill workforce gaps will be “quixotic or Sisyphean.” Asked about the fear AI and robotics might replace human workers, both panelists were optimistic. Chavez-DeRemer compared the transition to prior industrial and tech revolutions, stating: “We adapt. We are an adaptable people.” She emphasized AI should be seen as a tool that empowers, not replaces, the essential workforce. “Businesses are retraining their employees,” she said. “The R&D is showing us that [they’re] going to create new types of jobs.” Rowe added, “AI is coming for the coders, not yet for the welders,” reflecting the resiliency and growing demand in the trades. He argued every “frontline” vocation, from welding to pipe-fitting, is now seeing a boom, and AI won’t touch that. Rowe also cited remarks covered by Fortune from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang about the need for blue-collar workers to power the data-center infrastructure underlying the AI boom. He also mentioned BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s comments that his $12 trillion–plus portfolio was dependent on having enough electricians, a sector short of hundreds of thousands of workers. “The biggest CEOs in our country [are ringing] the metaphorical alarm bell,” Rowe said, calling it a “macro problem” the essential economy can solve. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: IBIT Surpasses Deribit to Become Largest Bitcoin Options Platform

Time Published: 2025-10-02T21:15:36Z

Written & Edited byLandon Manning BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is currently the largest venue for BTC options trading, reaching a whopping $38 billion in open interest. The product surpassed Deribit, a derivatives exchange owned by Coinbase, to achieve this goal. This record could serve as a bullish data point for crypto ETFs, as IBIT was better-equipped to deal with setbacks last month. Still, in the long run, a TradFi takeover could cut into crypto margins. With Bitcoin options traders preparing for Uptober, it’s important to remember just how huge this market really is. Four months ago, Coinbase agreed to a $2.9 billion deal to purchase Deribit, the popular derivatives exchange, and the firm’s stock rose 37% during the negotiations. Last month, Coinbase completed this deal to make bold expansions in the Bitcoin and crypto options markets. However, the BTC ETFs are apparently even more popular than this platform, with BlackRock’s IBIT reaching a mesmerizing $38 billion in open interest: $IBIT has surpassed Coinbase's Derbit platform as the largest venue for bitcoin options with $38b in open interest. I told y'all ETFs are no joke.. Fat crypto margins in trouble. Nice find by @sidharth_shukla pic.twitter.com/LUcnpW5g4I Experts already called IBIT the “greatest launch in ETF history,” but this really puts the asset’s prominence in perspective. Even while Bitcoin ETFs saw institutional outflows and deflated gains in September, this single product has still come to dominate the options market. To be fair, the graph clearly shows that Deribit’s open interest fell sharply in the last few days, which is an important component of this crossover. A record-breaking $21 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options expired last week, creating a huge stress-test for derivatives exchanges. Still, this evidently wasn’t a comparable problem for ETFs. This data point is a handy piece of evidence supporting ETFs’ growing stature. Both IBIT and Deribit faced important setbacks last month, but the ETF has apparently weathered them more effectively. Considering that a flood of altcoin ETFs may hit the markets after the US government shutdown ends, this could be very useful information. Regardless of which venue is more successful, this high open interest for Bitcoin options trading is a bullish signal. While BTC’s price continues to rise, the markets show a diversified appetite. Still, there might be some potential downsides to this approach. As TradFi institutions like BlackRock become the preferred vehicles for Bitcoin options trading, it may become harder to achieve the same rapid price gains that crypto is famous for.

Share this article BlackRock’s BUIDL fund has gained $600 million in assets under management over the past two weeks on Ethereum, according to Token Terminal, a crypto analytics firm tracking on-chain metrics for tokenized assets. The BUIDL fund is BlackRock’s tokenized USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. The world’s largest asset manager has distributed over $78 million in dividends through the fund since launch and now issues it natively on seven leading blockchains. Ethereum holds the majority of BUIDL’s assets under management. BlackRock actively expanded its tokenized fund offerings across multiple blockchains, including Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, and Solana. Securitize serves as the issuer, placement agent, and transfer agent for the BUIDL fund. The tokenization platform integrated with Ripple’s stablecoin in September 2025 to enhance liquidity for yield-bearing assets. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Δ “Tokenization is like a freight train. It can’t be stopped, and eventually it’s going to eat the entire financial system,” Vlad Tenev told a panel at a cryptocurrency conference in Singapore on Wednesday (Oct. 1). “I think most major markets will have some framework in the next five years,” said Tenev, whose comments were reported by CNBC. The CEO added that reaching 100% could take more than a decade. As that report notes, a tokenized asset is a digital representation of a real-world asset, such as stocks, bonds or commodities, that can be recorded and traded on a blockchain. Robinhood in June began offering more than 200 tokenized U.S. stocks to customers in the European Union, bringing the company’s stock to what was then a record high. “I think it will become the default way to get exposure to U.S. stocks outside the U.S.,” Tenev said, adding that he expects the practice to expand after there is more clarity around licensing and regulations throughout the world. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue “I think that will come, starting in Europe, but then expanding to the rest of the world,” he said. Beyond Robinhood’s launch of tokenized stocks, the CNBC report points out that there have been other indications of tokenization’s growing popularity, with financial sector titans Morgan Stanley and BlackRock expressing interest. “I actually think cryptocurrency and traditional finance have been living in two separate worlds for a while, but they’re going to fully merge,” Tenev said at the event. Tenev is not alone in forecasting the transformative effect of tokenization. As covered here last month, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has said tokenized money and assets could reshape monetary policy and payments. “A BIS study said a tokenized, unified ledger run by public authorities could replicate stablecoin benefits without private-coin risks,” PYMNTS wrote. “The BIS and Federal Reserve Bank of New York also co-authored experimental work showing how smart contracts might automate liquidity operations and policy transmission.” The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, has emphasized the need for interoperable standards on settlement finality, identity and dispute resolution to make sure tokenization scales responsibly. “Together, these projects underscore how public authorities aim to integrate tokenization into regulated infrastructures while private firms race ahead with commercial deployments,” that report concluded.

Title: Humphreys campaign trail: ‘Wee selfies’, spirit of Big Tom and Fianna Fáil voters

In Blackrock, Co Louth - reigning tidiest small town in Ireland, they’ll have you know - an older man snaps an errant piece of litter with his picker and shoves it into a bag. He glances down the frightfully clean path as the mobile melee that is a presidential campaign rolls into the seaside village The branded Heather Humphreys cars, bright yellow campaign jackets, the colourfully dressed candidate herself, and the not insignificant cohort of media orbiting her has roused the little village from its mid-morning slumber. A woman driving down the main street shrugs gamely at the camera crews and journalists, who stop traffic as they trail across the road after the candidate. Humphreys strides into The Village Garden cafe, a pretty coffee shop on Blackrock’s main thoroughfare, and brings the whole media kit and kaboodle with her. Spoonfuls of overnight oats and coffee cups hang in the air as the stunned patrons watch the national media overwhelm what had been, until moments ago, a peaceful coffee shop. In their surprised glee to meet her, husband and wife John and Catherine Pepper, natives of Blackrock, wrangle Humphreys for a chat. After a quick search in the depths of a handbag, a bit of paper is produced, and John insists that Humphreys sits down and signs a message to each of their children: Seán and Meábh who live locally, and Sienna who is out in Dubai. “And do one more,” he tells her, for a grandchild not yet born. “I wanted them to be the first in Blackrock and Dubai to have the president’s autograph,” John explains. Humphreys helped John, who is visually impaired, into the seat beside her along with his white cane. “It would be a terror if I collapsed beside the president,” he told her. [ On the canvass with Jim Gavin in Roscommon and Catherine Connolly in BallyfermotOpens in new window ] John, who is a lifelong Fianna Fáil supporter, assured Humphreys: “If I still had my faculties, I’d be out campaigning for you.” He explains to The Irish Times that he had canvassed for “Albert and for Charlie,” but would break the habit of a lifetime and vote for Humphreys instead of for Fianna Fáil. “And if I had my sight, I’d be campaigning for her. That’s what she means to me,” John said. Out on the prom, another Soldier of Destiny was pledging his support for Humphreys. Declan Breathnach, the former Fianna Fáil TD for Louth, has known Humphreys for years through local and national politics. They even danced together back in the day, though Breathnach says Humphreys had “two left feet”. But why would a former Fianna Fáil politician not support Jim Gavin? “I don’t know Jim Gavin, I suppose. And when you know somebody and know them on a very personal basis, I think it’s incumbent on you to say what you feel.” On Fianna Fáil’s presidential campaign in general, Breathnach says “there was a lot of dithering [that] went on within the organisation, and I’m sure that Billy Kelleher saw that as well”. Fine Gael couldn’t have crafted a canvass that suited Humphreys more. The visit to Blackrock revolved around the diligent Tidy Towns committee and, of course, the local credit union. Tidy Towns in Blackrock seems to be something akin to a local sport, or maybe a religion. [ Heather Humphreys denies Simon Harris pressured her to drop disability reformsOpens in new window ] The committee effusively thanked Humphreys for pushing for the competition to continue during Covid-19 when she was the minister responsible for community development. Blackrock manages a “voluntary” ban on election posters, which every candidate has known better than to breach. Mary Murtagh of Louth Tidy Towns together thanked Humphreys for her compliance. “It’s the cable ties,” Mary says, visibly wincing at the thought of them. Humphreys recalls how her grandmother would bring her to Blackrock on her holidays. “And we had the tea in a flask, and we had the sandwiches on the beach, weather permitting!” Someone produces a sprig of literal heather for her. “I’ve me bit of heather,” Humphreys says, as she fusses to pin it to her lapel, “heather for the Heather!” People are leaning out of passing car windows to pledge first preferences. There are “wee selfies,” everyone is citing whatever Monaghan relation they can think of (“your mother must have been good stock so!”) and the spirit of the late county and western star Big Tom is invoked more than once. “I knew him well,” Humphreys told a voter emolliently, “he was a gentle man, and a gentle giant”. As is compulsory any time Humphreys visits a town, she also goes into the local Connect Credit Union to approvingly survey it and its comparatively low rate of written-off loans. “Must be very decent people in Blackrock,” Humphreys, who used to work as a credit union manager, says. In nearby Ardee, Humphreys graciously makes impressed noises when shown around the town’s run-down, cobweb strewn castle; which the local community has been loyally trying to restore for over a decade. “It will be lovely when it’s finished,” Humphreys says, generously. She also calls into a Men’s Shed in Slane, where she tried her hand at working a circular saw. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Premium ETF Heads To Nasdaq In SEC Filing
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrocks-bitcoin-premium-income-etf-heads-to-nasdaq-in-sec-filing/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T13:30:04Z
Full Content:
Nasdaq has filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to list the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, a product designed to generate income by selling options on bitcoin-linked holdings. The proposal was submitted on September 30, 2025, and the SEC has opened a comment period as part of its review. According to the Nasdaq filing, the Trust will hold primarily bitcoin, shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), cash, and the premiums earned from written options on IBIT or on indices that track spot bitcoin ETPs. The product is described as an actively-managed exchange-traded product that the sponsor intends to be treated as a publicly-traded partnership for US federal tax purposes. The filing also sets a minimum of 80,000 Shares required to be outstanding at commencement, and lists trading hours from 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. BlackRock’s move follows a wider push by asset managers to offer income-style crypto products. Reports have disclosed that the new ETF would collect premiums by writing covered calls, a strategy meant to produce regular distributions for investors who want yield rather than pure price exposure. Analysts quoted in market coverage say the approach limits upside in strong rallies but can smooth returns when bitcoin moves sideways or down. Covered calls are straightforward in concept but not without risk. The Trust would hold IBIT and bitcoin while selling call options against those holdings to collect premiums. If the calls are exercised early, the filing says IBIT shares may be delivered out to the options clearer; certain OTC options would be cash-settled. That mix of physical holdings and options income is intended to create a yield-focused product that behaves differently from a spot ETF. Market watchers note this is not BlackRock’s first bitcoin product. Based on reports, IBIT has already become a major vehicle for US investors since its launch, reaching large asset levels quickly and helping to normalize bitcoin exposure inside regulated funds. That track record likely makes it easier for BlackRock to pitch a second, income-focused offering to both retail and institutional audiences. The next steps are procedural but important. The SEC’s notice solicits public comments and will consider whether the proposed listing satisfies Nasdaq’s Rule 5711(d) and investor-protection standards. If the SEC requires changes — for example on disclosure around OTC options or daily NAV dissemination — Nasdaq and BlackRock would have to respond before trading can begin.

About us Copy link Bringing stocks, bonds, and just about every other financial asset onchain is inevitable. At least according to Robinhood CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev. “Tokenisation is like a freight train,” Tenev told a captive audience at this year’s Token2049 crypto confab in Singapore. “It’s going to eat the entire financial system.” During a fireside panel in the Marina Bay Sands convention centre, the 38-year-old entrepreneur unpacked how the $127 billion stock trading app is positioning itself to tap the burgeoning tokenisation niche. In June, Tenev announced the launch of over 200 tokenised stocks on Arbitrum, a Ethereum layer 2 network, for its users in Europe. The launch also included tokenised equity in private companies, such as Tesla and OpenAI. But when will tokenised stocks become available in the US and then globally? “Most major markets will have some framework in the next five years,” Tenev said. “I think a hundred per cent? That might take a decade or more.” For years, turning traditional financial assets into cryptocurrencies has been pitched as a key upgrade to financial markets. The technology ostensibly eliminates intermediaries and streamlines back offices required for trading equities and other assets. Despite these perceived advantages, it has yet to take hold in a meaningful way. The entire tokenisation market is worth $32 billion, according to rwa.xyz. Meanwhile, the global public stock market is valued at more than $115 trillion as of 2023, according to the World Economic Forum. Still, companies — on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley — are working to close that gap. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Apollo, and other stalwart asset managers are actively tapping blockchain technologies to tokenise various fund products. Elsewhere, crypto firms, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Kraken are moving to offer tokenised stock trading, too. The enthusiasm comes amid key market structure legislation winding its way through the halls of the US Congress. Draft bills outline which financial agency will regulate newer asset classes, such as tokenised stocks and cryptocurrencies alike. The House Clarity Act passed in July, while the Senate version is still being debated. Ultimately, lawmakers will merge the two versions before executing a vote as early as the end of the year. Thanks to the European Union’s comprehensive crypto rulebook, known as Markets in Crypto-Assets, the continent has a slight lead in terms of crypto adoption — for now. “Unfortunately, but realistically, the US will probably be somewhat behind,” Tenev said. “The US will probably be the last economy to fully tokenise. But it’s inevitable. “ Liam Kelly is DL News Berlin-based DeFi Correspondent. Got a tip? Email at liam@dlnews.com.
