Blackrock diving tower, Galway Friday, 3 October Met Éireann has revealed that Storm Amy led to an October record for wind speed in Donegal. Malin Head, Donegal recorded its highest October 10-minute mean wind speed in 65 years at 111kmh. The storm brought widespread wet and very windy weather on Friday 3rd and Saturday 4th as it passed close to the northwest coast of Ireland moving towards northern Scotland. The highest gust recorded was 148kmh and Donegal had been issued a red warning ahead of the violent gusts. There were higher than usual temperatures recorded for October and rainfall was also well above average. As Amy pulled away on Sunday, October 5, high pressure built over the country from the south, which brought calmer weather. The following two weeks stayed mild and mostly dry, apart from patches of light rain or drizzle at times, but it was disappointingly cloudy. There were a few sunny breaks, mostly in the southwest. Later in the month, low pressure returned with plenty of rain crossing the country bringing heavy falls of rain or showers at times, in between short dry periods. All mean air temperatures across the country were above their long-term average for the month. The national mean air temperature of 11.61C placed October 2025 as the 24th warmest in 126 years, but the coolest since 2020. The month’s highest temperature of 19.7C was reported at three stations, Shannon Airport, Co Clare, Phoenix Park in Dublin and Dublin Airport. The peak in temperatures points to a larger trend that has been emerging, with four of the top ten warmest Octobers having occurred since 2001. None of the top 10 coolest Octobers have occurred since 2001. Storm Amy brought violent storm-force winds in early October. Tens of thousands of properties were left without power as strong winds caused chaos and more than 100 flights were across the country. Blackrock diving tower, Galway Friday, 3 October Today's News in 90 Seconds - Tuesday, November 4 The highest 10-minute mean wind speed was recorded at 111kmh on Friday, October 3, at Malin Head, Co Donegal. Meanwhile, a gust of 148km/h was also recorded that day, the month’s highest gust. October was a dull month right across the country, with record low October sunshine at Malin Head and Casement Aerodrome, Co Dublin. In particular, Malin Head recorded its dullest October on record and the dullest October on record at any station. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Please let us know Topic:Business, Economics and Finance Elon Musk could receive a $US1 trillion compensation package if Tesla investors approve it later this week. (Reuters: Gonzalo Fuentes) Norway's sovereign wealth fund says it will vote against a proposed $1.5 trillion pay deal to Tesla chief executive Elon Musk. The world's largest sovereign wealth fund holds the seventh-biggest stake in the electric car maker, and is so far the biggest shareholder to say how it plans to vote. Opponents of the pay deal face an uphill battle to stop Mr Musk's proposed compensation package, which will be formally voted on on November 6. Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, has announced it will vote against ratifying Tesla chief executive Elon Musk's proposed compensation package that is potentially worth $US1 trillion ($1.54 trillion) at an annual general meeting later this week. Investors in the electric vehicle maker will decide on November 6 whether to approve the package, likely the largest-ever chief executive compensation agreement. Critics have called the pay deal excessive but face an uphill fight against it. Tesla's board is pushing for shareholders to approve the plan, with chair Robyn Denholm warning that Mr Musk could leave the $1.5 trillion market cap firm if the deal is rejected. Opponents worry that it will give the world's richest man too much unchecked power. Mr Musk's new trillion-dollar pay package will almost certainly pass, given broad investor support. Laws in Texas, where Tesla moved its headquarters last year, also allow Musk to vote his own large stake, giving him some 13.5 per cent of voting power. Elon Musk became CEO of electric car company Tesla in October 2008. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer) The Norwegian wealth fund is the largest investor so far to say how it plans to vote. The next largest to do so, Baron Capital, plans to back Mr Musk's pay package. Tesla's largest institutional investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have yet to disclose their voting plans. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO's net worth hit $US500 billion ($755 billion) on Wednesday, the "Real-Time Billionaires" tracker reported. Proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis have both urged shareholders to reject Mr Musk's compensation plan, arguing it would be too large, deliver high payouts even if the chief executive only met some goals and could dilute the holdings of other investors. Both also opposed a shareholder vote last year on a 2018 $56 billion package for Mr Musk that passed with overwhelming support from Tesla's army of mum-and-dad investors. While the package could grant stock worth up to $1 trillion over 10 years, the cost of those shares at the time of the award will be deducted, making the value to Mr Musk slightly lower, at up to $878 billion, according to a Reuters analysis. "While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk — consistent with our views on executive compensation," Norges Bank Investment Management said on its website. The fund, Tesla's seventh-biggest owner with a 1.12 per cent stake worth $17 billion, also voted "no" to Mr Musk's previous compensation plan, drawing a sharp response from the CEO, who turned down an invitation to a conference in Oslo. NBIM on Tuesday also said it would vote against two out of three Tesla directors who are up for re-election, declining to back board veterans Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Ira Ehrenpreis, while supporting Joe Gebbia, who joined in 2022. The $2.1 trillion Norwegian fund also said it would vote against Tesla's proposed general stock compensation plan, which is intended for all employees and can also be used by the board to benefit Mr Musk. Tesla says its chief executive would earn "nothing" unless the company's market value grew substantially and that the maximum award would only be paid if the group reached several milestones, most notably a market value of $8.5 trillion, a near six-fold increase.

ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Looking for the best mutual funds to buy in 2026? As markets shift and volatility remains high, choosing the right funds is key to balancing growth income and diversification. These five mutual funds stand out for their performance, reasonable expense ratios and strong management — offering investors reliable options for the year ahead. Mutual funds provide investors with professional portfolio management without picking individual stocks. They deliver instant diversification, spreading risk across dozens — or even hundreds — of holdings, which cushions portfolios against market volatility. Most funds maintain low minimum investments and allow automatic dividend reinvestment, helping returns compound over time. For investors seeking steady growth or income in a volatile market, mutual funds offer a practical, low-maintenance solution. The five mutual funds highlighted here were chosen based on key performance and cost criteria: Together, these metrics point to funds with consistent management quality, solid fundamentals and sustainable long-term potential. The following five mutual funds represent diverse approaches to wealth building, from international value opportunities to domestic equity strategies. Each brings unique strengths that could benefit different types of investors depending on their goals, risk tolerance and existing portfolio composition. This international value fund focuses on undervalued companies outside the U.S., following a classic value-investing strategy. It seeks businesses trading below intrinsic value with strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential. With an 8.25% forward dividend yield, TBGVX is ideal for investors seeking income and capital appreciation. Its disciplined approach to international markets and diversification makes it a standout in global equity portfolios, even with a higher expense ratio. The International Vector Equity Portfolio uses a systematic, factor-based international equity strategy, focusing on small-cap and value stocks across developed markets. By holding thousands of positions, the fund ensures broad diversification and reduces company-specific risk. DFVQX delivers strong historical returns with a remarkably low expense ratio, allowing investors’ money to compound efficiently. Its evidence-based strategy suits cost-conscious investors seeking international exposure. OWSMX invests in small and mid-cap U.S. companies with strong growth prospects. Holding 40–60 stocks allows for focused research and active portfolio management, helping investors capture the small-cap premium. Small-cap stocks are positioned for a potential rebound after years of underperformance versus large caps. With nearly $9 billion in assets and flexible positioning, OWSMX provides targeted exposure to this overlooked segment of the market. The Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund invests in dividend-paying stocks across all market caps, emphasizing sustainable payout ratios. The fund balances income generation with long-term capital growth. VSEQX offers a 10.10% forward yield — exceptional for an equity fund — and an ultra-low expense ratio, ensuring investors keep more returns. For those seeking dividend income alongside growth, this fund provides one of the strongest combinations of yield, quality, and cost efficiency. The BlackRock Enhanced Capital and Income Fund combines a diversified equity portfolio with an options overlay. By writing covered calls, the fund generates additional income while limiting volatility. XCIIX delivers a 7.13% yield with consistent multi-year performance. Its enhanced income strategy balances risk management with equity exposure, appealing to investors seeking stability and income in 2026. These five mutual funds provide clear paths to build wealth in 2026 — from international value to dividend income to small-cap growth. Each fund combines experienced management, reasonable fees and strong historical performance. While past performance does not guarantee future results, these funds are well-positioned for investors seeking diversification, income, and growth potential. Evaluate how each aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance and portfolio strategy before investing.

Title: Kelleher eyes cup win to keep 'special journey' going

It's close to a decade since Fiacre Kelleher left Ireland to join Celtic. And while he did not make his mark with the Bhoys, stints at a number of English League clubs followed. And now he's back home. On Sunday next he will lead out Cork City against Shamrock Rovers in the Sports Direct FAI Cup final. Kelleher, no doubt echoing the views of many, sees it as a "David v Goliath" clash. The Premier Division champions against the side who propped up the table, with relegation for the Leesiders confirmed a few weeks out from the season's end. But speaking to RTÉ Sport in advance of the Aviva Stadium showpiece, the 29-year-old does not accept that Goliath will have it all their own way, and said: "We play this fixture ten times and Rovers will probably win nine times. "But like the rest of the Cork City fans travelling up on the day, we are full of hope, it's a one-off and we will fancy our chances. If we're at our best and have a little bit of luck on our side, the day can be ours. Hopefully." Getting to a cup final has softened the blow of a third relegation in six seasons for Cork, a renewed focus for all involved, with Kelleher adding: "It has given us all something to look forward to, something that the club needed and us as players needed after the relegation. It has come at a good time, the guns are firing and we are ready to go for Sunday. "Seani (Maguire) has been telling us how big a day it is and how enjoyable it can be for us and our families. The realisation of how big an occasion it actually is really dawning on me now and we need this to be a big day for us." After a season with Celtic and then a year on loan at Peterhead, Kelleher's career took him south where he had spells at eight different clubs. He was there when Ryan Reynolds and co brought a touch of Hollywood to Wrexham and more cash. As he put it himself they were then able to "afford players that were more experienced than me". His final season in England saw a promotion push that fell just short with Colchester in League Two. In June of this year, the Blackrock native signed a long-term deal with the Turner's Cross outfit. And Kelleher still feels he has lot more to give. "It's not done yet," he boasts. More chapters to follow after what has gone before. "It's been crazy, magical, all sorts. I've seen everything. I've played down in the lower divisions and have met all sorts of characters. It has been special, my own journey, one that I have enjoyed. I'm still incredibly proud that I get to play football every day and it's something that I really don't want to give up, even though some day it will happen. "Coming home and playing with my home club is extra special and to top it off you get to play in a big final." One man who will not be present at the Dublin 4 venue on Sunday owing to his presence between the posts for Brentford in the Premier League will be Kelleher's brother Caoimhín. The older sibling very much in awe of what the latter has achieved so far in his career. "I don't think anybody is as laid back as him. I'm a bit more emotional and intense and that's why he is so good, he can keep it under wraps. "He is nothing but full of support for me. He's gutted he can't be there because he plays on Sunday. "It's probably something we don't appreciate at the moment. He does all these special things; it's one thing after another, he just keeps topping it. "In a few years when he's done we will then only realise what a special career he has had. I mean, what a special career he has had all ready. "I took my own little boy over to his first Brentford game against Manchester City. It's incredible, to have my own brother who has played for Liverpool and is now a No 1 goalkeeper in the Premier League is special." Taking his place at the heart of the Cork City defence, Kelleher will be tasked with keeping tabs on those who will provide the firepower for Shamrock Rovers. It's a big task, but much homework has been done by Ger Nash and his backroom team on how the Hoops' threat can be quelled, with Kelleher saying: "We've done a lot of prep. The relegation came a few weeks ago, which was difficult. "In the week or two after it has given us enough time to focus on this fixture, to focus on our preparation, on their threats and on how they might hurt us. "I feel I'm more than prepared to deal with the likes of Burke (Graham) Gaffney (Rory) and Mandroiu (Danny), all those wonderful players. On the day anything is possible and we do fancy ourselves."

Share this article BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, plans to list its iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) on the Australian Securities Exchange, marking a major step in expanding regulated crypto investment access across the Asia-Pacific region. The move would provide Australian investors with direct access to Bitcoin exposure through traditional stock exchanges, eliminating the need for offshore investment vehicles or direct crypto custody. BlackRock manages over $10 trillion in assets globally and has been aggressively expanding its crypto offerings. The company’s iShares Bitcoin Trust became one of the most successful ETF launches in US history after its January 2024 debut, attracting billions in investor funds within months. Australia has emerged as a key market for crypto ETF expansion, with regulatory frameworks that support institutional-grade Bitcoin investment products. The Australian Securities Exchange has signaled openness to listing crypto-related investment vehicles as part of the country’s broader digital asset integration strategy. The ETF would target both retail and institutional investors seeking regulated Bitcoin exposure without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership, including wallet management and security concerns.

Business A Tesla logo is seen at a Tesla showroom in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song OSLO / BOSTON :Norway's sovereign wealth fund, Tesla's sixth-largest outside investor, said on Tuesday it would vote against ratifying a proposed pay deal for CEO Elon Musk potentially worth $1 trillion. Musk's pay package is still seen as likely to win, given broad investor support in the past and the backing Tesla enjoys from its large retail shareholder base. Laws in Texas, where Tesla moved its headquarters last year, allow Musk to vote his own large stake, giving him 15.3 per cent of voting power including restricted stock granted in August. The opposition from stewardship-minded Norges Bank Investment Management was no surprise. But its direct criticism of the compensation and planned votes against two Tesla board directors add uncertainty to the outcome of a ballot set for Thursday, corporate governance experts said, and underscore how other European investors may also turn against the electric-vehicle maker.

This service is not intended for persons residing in the E.U. By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.Tesla's board is pushing for shareholders to approve the plan, with Chair Robyn Denholm warning that Musk could leave the $1.5 trillion market cap firm if the deal is rejected."European voters are much more likely to be swayed by where Norges goes, because of the general support of ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles and concerns into their investment philosophy," said Francis Byrd, a partner at consulting firm Alchemy Strategies Partners.Byrd and several other consultants said they expect Tesla's recommendations to prevail at the meeting, since top investors have stuck with him so far. With a 1.12 per cent stake in Tesla, the Norwegian firm known as NBIM is the only one of Tesla's top-10 outside investors to disclose its voting intentions ahead of the meeting so far.They also noted how big U.S. investors are under pressure from the Trump administration to apply less public pressure on companies. That could make it harder to know if there is much opposition until the day of the meeting, said Karla Bos, an independent governance consultant in Arizona."Less predictability is the watchword for 2025, and certainly for complicated votes like at Tesla," Bos said.SCHWAB TO SUPPORT PAY PACKAGEAfter NBIM, the next-largest investor to disclose its voting intentions is Schwab Asset Management. A Schwab spokesperson told Reuters via email on Tuesday that it will support Musk's performance award as one that "aligns both management and shareholder interests."Schwab is Tesla's 15th-largest outside investor, with a 0.56 per cent stake as of June disclosures. Another firm backing Musk's pay proposal is Baron Capital, which has 0.39 per cent of Tesla's shares. Tesla's largest institutional investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have yet to disclose their intentions.Among other large European investors in Tesla, representatives for Legal & General Investment Management of London and Amundi Asset Management of Paris declined to comment. Each has about 0.6 per cent of Tesla shares.Proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis have both urged shareholders to reject Musk's compensation plan, arguing it would be too large, deliver high payouts even if the CEO only meets some goals and could dilute the holdings of other investors.

A Schwab spokesperson told Reuters via email on Tuesday that it will support Musk's performance award as one that "aligns both management and shareholder interests." Schwab is Tesla's 15th-largest outside investor, with a 0.56 per cent stake as of June disclosures. Another firm backing Musk's pay proposal is Baron Capital, which has 0.39 per cent of Tesla's shares. Tesla's largest institutional investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have yet to disclose their intentions. Among other large European investors in Tesla, representatives for Legal & General Investment Management of London and Amundi Asset Management of Paris declined to comment. Each has about 0.6 per cent of Tesla shares. Proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis have both urged shareholders to reject Musk's compensation plan, arguing it would be too large, deliver high payouts even if the CEO only meets some goals and could dilute the holdings of other investors.

PRAISING VALUE CREATION, BUT CONCERNED WITH OVERALL SIZE While this year's package could grant stock worth up to $1 trillion over 10 years, the cost of those shares at the time of the award will be deducted, making the value to Musk slightly lower, at up to $878 billion, according to a Reuters analysis.

Business A Tesla logo is seen at a Tesla showroom in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song OSLO / BOSTON :Norway's sovereign wealth fund, Tesla's sixth-largest outside investor, said on Tuesday it would vote against ratifying a proposed pay deal for CEO Elon Musk potentially worth $1 trillion. Musk's pay package is still seen as likely to win, given broad investor support in the past and the backing Tesla enjoys from its large retail shareholder base. Laws in Texas, where Tesla moved its headquarters last year, allow Musk to vote his own large stake, giving him 15.3 per cent of voting power including restricted stock granted in August. The opposition from stewardship-minded Norges Bank Investment Management was no surprise. But its direct criticism of the compensation and planned votes against two Tesla board directors add uncertainty to the outcome of a ballot set for Thursday, corporate governance experts said, and underscore how other European investors may also turn against the electric-vehicle maker.

Title: Wall Street Journal Insults Reader Intelligence, Depicts Lenders as Addressing Loan Risks When That Horse Has Left the Barn and Is in the Next County

Seriously, how dumb does the Wall Street Journal think its readers are? Or does the abject lameness and stenography-taking manifested in its lead story, Wall Street Intensifies Scrutiny of Fraud After Spate of Loan Losses, instead reflect lack of competence on its reporting staff? Now admittedly this piece is fuzzy on timing, which again may reflect, erm, artful drafting or lack of attentiveness. But it reads as intended to reassure investors about loan standards. Indeed, the industry is going through one of those periodic Come to Jesus1 moments when it gets serious about loan standards after a string of losses and even resulting crises. But getting religion now does nothing to cure past sins. And they are legion. The elephant in the room, which this article ignores, is the wide-spread practice of making “cov-lite” loans, as in ones with minimal or even no covenants. Particularly with risky borrowers, sound practice requires imposing covenants, as in post-loan issuance requirements, such as keeping certain minimum net worth, asset and interest coverage levels, and financial disclosures. Mind you, the last time I read covenants was in the 1980s, when they were taken seriously. Then, breaching covenants gave the lenders the right to accelerate the loan, as in demand all future interest and principal payments immediately.2 That would result in bankruptcy in pretty much all cases. But that threat is a potent weapon, allowing lenders to demand more information, force a restructuring if they find real problems, and perhaps also replace key top executives. Needless to say, cov-lite lending become widespread when memories of past excesses fade and investors are reaching for returns, meaning too much demand for higher-yield paper gives borrowers more power than they ought to have. The protracted post-crisis period of negative real interest rates was destined to drive investors into riskier assets. We’ve been linking to mentions of cov-lite lending for years. There was no point then in inveighing against it since lenders could not be protected from their greed. A quick search shows how long this sort of thing has been going on. Some examples from a search with a date range of 2010 to 2020: The reemergence of cov-lite loans Financial Times ‘Cov-lite’ loans soar in dash for yield Financial Times, 2013 Leveraged loans are way past “cov-lite” Financial Times, 2018 Cov-lite loans: the new normal, but at what cost? Hermes [highly regarded UK pension fund manager], 2019 This tweet gives an idea of the extent and implications of this practice. Cov-lite loans, now 75% of private equity backed rated borrowers, gut essential financial oversight by ditching quarterly tests & meaningful covenants. Caveat Emptor for this obliterates early warning systems, letting PE firms plunder unchecked, prioritizing their profits over… pic.twitter.com/jLWJxjp1Rj — John E. Montana (@JohnEMontana) September 24, 2025 A sign that risk tolerance has reached dangerous levels was industry publications describing the revival of payment-in-kind loans. These are one that rather than pay all or any of the interest due in cash, that amount is added to the principal balance. The last time these were common was in the very last phase of the leveraged buyout boom, from 1987 to 1989. Asset manager TCW applies porcine maquillage in The Big PIK-ture: As a form of interest payment where interest is accrued by increasing the loan principal rather than paid in cash, PIK interest represents a nuanced tool within credit markets, particularly in the middle market private credit space….. Any private credit manager would agree: first lien senior secured lenders1 seldom prefer PIK interest as their primary form of interest payment. Cash interest payments provide immediate income and liquidity that are critical for many investors, particularly those focused on current income. Therefore, an increase in PIK interest – whether at the individual borrower level or across a portfolio – should prompt a thorough review of underlying credit fundamentals. The primary driver behind the recent growth in PIK interest has been the rapid normalization of interest rates. From 2022 through 2024, SOFR2 (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) rose sharply from near zero to a high of approximately 5.5%. (See Figure 1.) Since most middle market borrowers generally have floating-rate senior secured loans priced as a fixed spread over one- or three-month SOFR, this translated into a significant increase in cash interest expense owed by middle market borrowers. Since the end of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), many capital structures were constructed under the assumption of a persistently low interest rate environment, often near zero, and most borrowers and lenders didn’t anticipate such a rapid and sustained increase. As a result, borrowers with highly leveraged balance sheets faced increased debt service burdens that the underlying businesses were unable to sustain with free cash flow generation alone. In some cases, this led to liquidity crises, where cash flow generation from business operations was insufficient to meet scheduled principal and cash interest payments. Converting some, or all, cash interest to PIK allows borrowers to defer cash outflows, preserving liquidity to maintain operations, invest in growth, or execute turnaround plans. For lenders, PIK accrual increases the principal balance, preserving lenders’ contractual economics and potentially enhancing lenders’ recovery. PIK clearly isn’t the first choice for lenders and can be potentially value destroying for equity investors as well. Translation: even though the Fed has signaled since before the 2014 Taper Tantrum that it wanted to normalize interest rates, investors acted as it that was na ga happen on their watch. So lenders chose to allow stressed borrowers to pretend to stay current by allowing payment in kind. An alert reader might have said earlier, if these bad practices are so long standing, why have there not been more blow-ups? The PIK example shows that investors (as in actual fund investors not the fund manager) are being sold out to preserve the fiction that borrowers would not have defaulted. Other factors: One is that even though loan terms became more permissive, that does not necessarily mean all caution was thrown to the winds in terms of who got loans. There presumably was generally not-bad borrower due diligence before credit was extended. Second is that in a low interest rate environment with too much competition among lenders, some (many? most?) stressed borrowers could likely have refinanced before they got in real trouble. Third is that there has been a ton of stimulus, benefitting corporations more than individuals, which also would generally keep bad outcomes at bay. In the US, Covid relief was particularly business-friendly. Biden and Trump post Covid have kept up large fiscal deficits. So with this background, it’s easier to see the Journal parroting fund manager sleight-of-hand. The first part of this con is to depict the recent blow ups as the result of fraud, as opposed to long-standing lax lending standards resulting in a predictable crunch as the economy weakens and interest rates rise. Second is the pretense that lenders can do anything about outstanding loans. They can’t suddenly demand that borrowers make more disclosures than their credit agreements stipulated. These debtors are nearly all private companies, so transparency is limited. Even if they hire the business analogue to private investigators, such as so-called channel checkers like Gerson Lerhman to get a better grip on company performance, what do they do if they find something amiss? Absent an actual covenant breach, they can’t deploy the big hammer of payment acceleration. To the Journal’s spin: A string of alleged frauds by corporate borrowers is spurring a reckoning across Wall Street, sending bankers and investors scrambling to prevent future blowups. Lenders are increasing due diligence and demanding a longer history of financial data from companies. Some are inserting conditions that permit them to do more frequent checkups before agreeing to make loans. A group of the biggest names in banking, investment management and accounting have formed a task force that will take a deeper look at the nature of the problem and how to protect investors. The frauds that have emerged so far, which involve small to midsize companies in sectors such as autos and telecommunications, haven’t sparked widespread trouble in the market or economy. But they have generated fallout for both regional banks and Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, and the string of revelations has made it harder to dismiss any one case as an isolated event. Consistent with the headline, and the notably frequent use of the “f” word, lenders are supposed victims, as opposed to perps who handed out money on overly generous terms. Even though the first line does make the “alleged fraud” concession, the entire piece is framed around the idea that the only hazard is fraud, as opposed to marginal-at-best borrowers hitting the wall as the economy deteriorates. One does not have to look hard to find more balanced reporting. Bloomberg does focus on the fraud aspect in Credit Fraud Fears Loom After BlackRock’s HPS Zeros Out Bad Loan, if nothing else because BlackRock stuffed up so badly. But a few days ago, Bloomberg also warned of how more and more borrowers can’t service their debt in The Ranks of Corporate Zombies Are Growing. Key sections: The tally of “zombie companies” in the US that aren’t earning enough to cover their interest expenses stands at the highest since early 2022, with almost 100 gaining the designation in October. The main reason: Companies that gorged on debt at near-zero interest rates in the pandemic era have since been hurt by tariffs and higher funding costs. The odds of getting much relief on either front aren’t improving, with the US signing trade deals that lock in some of the higher tariffs and the Federal Reserve signaling that it might not continue to cut rates at its December meeting. Zombies will have to take steps to fix their balance sheets, such as boosting earnings or arranging costly new financing, or potentially face default. It won’t be easy. “Even if the Fed were continuing with cuts, the borrowing costs for small companies, zombie companies, are still multiples higher than historic averages,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. “A lot of these companies were barely scraping by at zero rates.” Read that last sentence again. It is a terse indictment of the lending practices that are producing the current crunch. The UK’s This Is Money makes clear that the idea of taking comfort from the ideas that the distressed companies are mainly small and midsized. Remember the banks in the US savings and loan crisis individually were way below too big to fail status, yet collectively presented a systemic risk. From Lenders urged to come clean over loans to so-called ‘shadow banks’ on November 2: Some of Britain’s biggest lenders have been accused of failing to come clean about the full extent of loans to so-called ‘shadow banks’ as fears grow that a recent spate of corporate collapses in the US could trigger another global financial crisis. HSBC and Barclays were among big European banks accused of ‘very poor disclosure’ over how much money they have lent to this opaque part of the financial system, also known as the ‘non-bank’ lending market. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that ‘alarm bells’ are ringing after the collapse of sub-prime vehicle finance provider Tricolor and another US firm, car parts maker First Brands, earlier this year…. Shadow banks have become a vital source of funding for consumers and firms as big name lenders have retreated from riskier funding deals since the 2008 financial crisis. They promise higher returns for investors than the big banks, but lack transparency and are unregulated, meaning they don’t have to disclose financial details. Mainstream banks are exposed to this risk too as they lend direct to the shadow banks. A risky form of this lending, known as ‘private debt’, has expanded rapidly in recent years and is set to account for £2.1 trillion of all lending in 2029, up from £1.2 trillion last year…. …it [Barclays] declined to say how much it had lent to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) – a broader group of non-banks that include insurers, pension providers, private equity groups and hedge funds. NDFIs provide services similar to those of traditional banks but crucially do not take deposits from the general public and are not regulated as lenders. In a recent note, credit ratings agency Fitch warned that lending by these non-banks, while still niche, was becoming increasingly complex, meaning ‘a financial shock event could reveal unexpected transmission channels’ to the wider system. It risks creating a domino effect similar to the 2008 crash when a collapse in the US mortgage market spread to other parts of the banking sector through a web of interlocking deals and financial products. Mind you, this picture does not contain much evidence of the leverage on leverage which enabled the 2008 credit crunch to threaten to destroy the financial system. In January 2007, we cited Gillian Tett at the Financial Times describing the astonishing gearing driving the so-called “wall of liquidity.” But the flip side is the unwind of the massive Japanese real estate/stock market bubbles didn’t feature big blowups until 1997, years into its protracted zombification, due to the authorities loosening up a bit on the assumption recovery was starting to take hold just before the Asian crisis hit. So a gut-wrenching market upheaval is not necessary to have seriously bad debt overhang outcomes. Nevertheless, things are set to get worse before they get better. So take precautions if you can. ____ 1 I heard this expression often from a terrific Jewish lawyer. 2 Obviously there is A Process. I do not recall what percentage of lenders is required to notify a bond trustee (and I assume these lenders have a similar party in the mix) to trigger the process, or mere documentation of a breach by any lender suffices. I assume there is a notice process, and that the borrower is also given a limited amount of time in which to cure the breach. Another great post. Yes, the ‘f’ word is being bandied about by the increasing number of lenders being caught up in the Big Credit Squeezola. And now we have the ‘z’ word surfacing in a number of places. This ( Private capital zombie firms will pile up in next decade, says EQT chief ) from the FT two days ago. The mainstream financial press is nothing if not derivative. The zombie talk is entirely too charitable. Here we have private equity, or private credit if you will, engaging in a dictionary of extend and pretend…secondaries, PIK, cove-lite and the latest genius move…tertiaries. As you might expect tertiary investors are intended to, (indeed required) to pay off the secondary investors clamoring for their payday. Perhaps we need a new word to define this Mulligan stew of bad investment. How about the ‘p’ word. Nah! Ponzi would never appear on the paragon pages of Bloomberg or the Financial Times. in contemporary ‘golf speak’, a mulligan is a back-slapping practice…among certain factions, to enable an individual a do-over…usually for an aberrant tee shot. with reference to PE tertiaries squeezing secondary investors…in a credit crunch… can such an event be compared to the 2008 performance….as in privatize profits and socialize losses? As an aside, the manufacturing sector is the one being hit hardest by bankruptcies. 32% by mid 2025 if one goes by this heat map (page 7 of the document). I worked a stint for a venture capital company back in early 2008, before the great recession hit. The VC’s investment fund had a portfolio of debt investments owed to them by a variety of small and mid-sized companies, all of which had exorbitant interest rates. A substantial number of these loans were non-performing, where the contractually required payments of principal and interest were no longer being made by the borrower. The latest kill the finance guys were celebrating was a loan taken out by a new client company to finance the buyout of its retiring owner, with an interest rate of 24%. This loan was so incredibly big in relation to the company’s balance sheet that it stood less than a snowball’s chance in hell of surviving it. Apparently, a prerequisite for doing God’s work requires one to keep a safe distance away from both Christian morality and economic reality. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Bitcoin Price Prediction as Technicals Remain Bullish: Why $HYPER Could Soar Next Year

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Bitcoin’s price remains above the critical $100,000 mark, consolidating near $103,700 after a brief pullback of over 3% in the past 24 hours. Despite short-term volatility, analysts point out that $BTC continues to trade around its 50-day trend average near $108K, suggesting the broader bullish trend remains intact. Institutional inflows have continued to pour into spot Bitcoin ETFs, with BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale leading the charge toward the end of the year. For instance, BlackRock’s IBIT recently surpassed Coinbase’s Deribit platform and became the largest venue for Bitcoin options globally, hitting almost $38 billion. These inflows have helped maintain market liquidity and reduced volatility as the crypto market is still dealing with the post-October crash aftermath. Several quantitative models predict that if $BTC sustains its support above $100K, a December 2025 peak between $135K and $140K remains on the cards. While Bitcoin’s price action dominates headlines, this growing institutional interest has reignited focus on Bitcoin Layer-2 scaling networks. These are solutions designed to enhance $BTC’s speed, interoperability, and functionality for decentralized finance. One of these is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a Layer-2 platform designed to make Bitcoin faster and more adaptable for modern DeFi applications. As Bitcoin pushes toward its forecasted $135K–$140K range by late 2025, the broader narrative around Bitcoin’s scalability will only intensify. Historically, Layer-2 ecosystems (from Ethereum’s Arbitrum to Polygon) have seen exponential growth following main-chain rallies. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could be next in line to capitalize on this pattern. It’s one of the best crypto presales of 2025, raising over $25.7M at the time of writing. Built as a Bitcoin Layer-2 solution, Bitcoin Hyper will combine scalability, low transaction costs, and EVM compatibility, enabling developers to dApps that leverage Bitcoin’s security without facing its throughput limits (an average of 7 tps now). The project will use a Canonical Bridge to turn $BTC into wrapped $BTC. This will be used in the L2 ecosystem for dApps and other operations. And a Solana Virtual Machine will speed up transactions to exponentially more than Bitcoin’s current capacity. Transaction settlement will happen on Bitcoin’s Layer-1, which ensures absolute security for peace of mind.

Moreover, $HYPER’s economics are designed to encourage early participation and long-term sustainability. With a capped supply, transparent vesting schedule, and presale nearing completion, market watchers see potential for a strong post-listing debut once trading begins in early 2026. According to our $HYPER price prediction, the token could trade at $0.08625 in 2026, potentially reaching $0.253 by 2030. That could be anywhere from a 552% to a 1,814% increase in 1–5 years. The current presale price stands at $0.013215 per token, with a few hours left before the next price increase. The project also offers 46% staking rewards, offering good passive income for long-term holders. For investors capitalizing on Bitcoin’s future price, $HYPER represents an asymmetrical opportunity. It gives you exposure to Bitcoin’s growth story with the upside potential of an early-stage infrastructure token. ➡️ Here’s how to buy Bitcoin Hyper right now.

Title: The world's largest sovereign wealth fund has rejected Elon Musk's $1 trillion Tesla pay package

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The bank behind the world's largest sovereign wealth fund has just dealt a blow to Elon Musk's $1 trillion payday. Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, said on Tuesday it had voted against the Tesla CEO's proposed pay package ahead of the company's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday. The bank said that while it appreciated the "significant value" created under the billionaire's leadership, it had concerns about the size of the package, dilution, and the lack of mitigation of Musk's "key person risk" for Tesla. The fund, which is Tesla's sixth-largest institutional investor, also voted against Musk's previous pay package in 2024. In January, leaked messages revealed an icy text exchange between the Tesla boss and Norges' CEO Nicolai Tangen, with the billionaire telling Tangen that "friends are as friends do." Norway's sovereign wealth fund is the largest institutional investor to publicly say how it has voted on the $1 trillion pay package. The fund has a 1.2% share in the EV giant. Tesla's CEO compensation plan has come under fire from some investors, including the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York State Retirement Fund. Proxy firms Glass Lewis and ISS have also urged shareholders to vote against it, prompting Musk to label them "corporate terrorists" in a recent earnings call. Several other big investors, including Florida's State Board of Administration and ARK Invest's Cathy Wood, have expressed support. Vanguard and BlackRock, Tesla's two largest institutional shareholders, have not yet said how they are voting. The 2025 CEO compensation plan would award Musk around $1 trillion worth of Tesla shares, assuming he hits a series of ambitious goals over the next decade. These include raising Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion, selling 1 million Optimus robots, boosting annual earnings way above those reported by tech giants Meta and Google, and planning his own succession. Tesla could not immediately be reached for comment. Jump to

Title: Trump Just Issued A ‘Very Big’ China Warning As Bitcoin Teeters On The Verge Of A Major $100,000 Price Crash

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has suddenly plummeted, diving toward the closely-watched $100,000 per bitcoin level (just as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk issues a stark, $38 trillion U.S. bankruptcy warning). Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has soared since the reelection of U.S. president Donald Trump last year, rising on a wave of enthusiasm for bitcoin and crypto, but its rally has stalled in recent months despite U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent quietly sending the market a “signal” last week. Ahead of the bitcoin price crashing toward $100,000, U.S. president Donald Trump warned China is trying to take on the U.S. as the world’s “capital of crypto.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Trump warned that if the U.S. doesn’t dominate the crypto field, then China will, comparing the battle to lead in development of the technology to the artificial intelligence race. "I don’t want to have somebody else have crypto and have China be number one in the world in crypto," Trump told CBS’s 60 Minutes. “Because in crypto it’s a kind of an industry where basically you’re going to have number one and you’re not gonna have a number two. And right now we’re number one by a long shot. I want to keep it that way. The same way we're number one with AI, we're number one with crypto." Trump added that, "China is getting into it very big, right now," perhaps referring to Hong Kong’s plans to ease rules to encourage crypto trading activity in the city. However, crypto trading and mining remains illegal in mainland China following a 2021 ban. Despite Trump’s commitment to making the U.S. into the “crypto capital of the world,” the bitcoin price has this year failed to make gains much above the levels it reached at the end of 2024. “Bitcoin’s price has been moving sideways since July this year,” Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, said in emailed comments, pointing to the possibility the bitcoin price could recover to beyond its all-time high of $126,000 per bitcoin if macro factors align. “If, however, bitcoin drops below $100,000 and consolidates under that level, it could decline further into the $96,000-$93,000 range. Still, I see the $100,000 level as a psychologically significant threshold, so much will depend on how the market behaves there. Most likely, the price will once again rebound from this level, just as it did in June 2025. In simple terms, this area represents a strong support zone.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Alongside the Trump administration’s embrace of bitcoin and crypto, Wall Street has been piling into bitcoin via crypto spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since they were given the green light by regulators in early 2024. Led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, bitcoin ETFs have bought up 1.5 million bitcoin worth $160 billion—just over 7% of bitcoin’s 21 million bitcoins—though Wall Street’s demand for bitcoin ETFs has failed to prevent the bitcoin price collapse from its all-time highs. “Unless ETF inflows or other marginal buyers step in with sufficient spot demand to absorb this distribution, there remains a tangible risk of bitcoin retesting the $106,000 - $107,000 support zone and, if lost, potentially extending toward the $100,000 region or lower over the coming weeks," analysts with the Bitfinex crypto exchange said in emailed comments.

Title: Norway wealth fund to vote against Musk's Tesla pay deal

Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, said today it would vote against ratifying Tesla CEO Elon Musk's proposed compensation package, containing shares worth up to $1 trillion, at an annual general meeting this week. Investors in the electric-vehicle maker will decide on November 6 whether to approve the package, likely the largest-ever CEO compensation agreement, which critics have called excessive. So far, the Norwegian wealth fund is the largest outside Tesla investor to say how it plans to vote. The next-largest to do so, Baron Capital, said yesterday it would back Musk's pay package. The company's largest institutional investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have yet to disclose their voting plans. Tesla's board is pushing for shareholders to approve the plan, with Chair Robyn Denholm warning last week that Musk could leave the company if the deal is rejected. While the package could grant stock worth up to $1 trillion over 10 years, the cost of those shares at the time of the award will be deducted, making the value to Musk slightly lower, at up to $878 billion, according to a Reuters analysis. "While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk - consistent with our views on executive compensation," Norges Bank Investment Management said on its website. The fund, Tesla's seventh-biggest owner with a 1.12% stake worth $17 billion, also voted "no" to Musk's previous compensation plan, drawing a sharp response from the CEO, who turned down an invitation to a conference in Oslo. Various groups have tried and failed to block record payouts to Musk, including a $56 billion compensation plan for 2018 that investors reapproved last year, though legal challenges remain. NBIM also said it would vote against two out of three Tesla directors who are up for reelection, declining to back board veterans Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Ira Ehrenpreis while supporting Joe Gebbia, who joined in 2022. The $2.1 trillion Norwegian fund also said it would vote against Tesla's proposed general stock compensation plan, which is intended for all employees and can also be used by the board to benefit Musk. Tesla says its CEO will earn "nothing" unless the company's market value grows substantially and that the maximum award is only paid if the group reaches several milestones, most notably a market value of $8.5 trillion, a near six-fold increase. Yet Musk could still reap tens of billions of dollars without meeting many of those targets, according to experts in executive pay, company valuations, robotics and automotive trends. Top US investment firms are under pressure from Republican politicians to pay less attention to environmental, social and governance concerns at companies in which they invest and Musk has been an ally of President Donald Trump. The political pressure makes it harder for large investors to vote independently, said Matt Moscardi, CEO of director analytics firm Free Float Analytics. Top investors, Moscardi said, "at this point, almost can't vote against management." Accreditation: Reuters © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Treasury Dept. says inflation is running 'above target' as Trump insists there is 'no inflation'

Time Published: 2025-11-03T21:50:01Z

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The Treasury Department said Monday that inflation "remained above the target of 2 percent in the third quarter," even as President Donald Trump and administration officials continue to assert that there is "no inflation." Speaking on CBS News' "60 Minutes" on Sunday, Trump said, "We have no inflation, we have no inflation." Trump claimed that he had "already taken care of" inflation, calling 2% "the perfect inflation." But inflation came in at 3% on an annual basis in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Food prices for both groceries (food at home) and food services (food away from home) increased moderately in the third quarter," Treasury said in a new "Economy Statement." The statement released Monday is a regular economic update prepared for the Treasury’s Borrowing Advisory Committee. The committee consists of nonpartisan bond market executives from firms such as Citigroup, Pimco, JPMorgan and BlackRock, and provides input to the Treasury on government debt and financing issues. A White House spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Treasury statement. One of the major drivers of food inflation was record beef prices, due in part to lower herd counts. "We're gonna get the beef price down very quickly. It'll be very nice, just like eggs," Trump said Sunday on CBS. Overall, the Treasury Department said that "economic growth solidified in the third quarter with steady business investment and consumer demand." The third quarter is considered the three-month period from July 1 to Sept. 30. CEOs of retail and food companies have noted that while consumer spending overall continues at a decent pace, lower-income consumers are faring much worse than middle and upper income Americans. “Traffic for lower-income consumers is down double digits,” McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNBC in September. “We needed to step in.” Coca-Cola’s chief operating officer, Henrique Braun, said the company also saw “divergency in spending between the income groups” last quarter. Wages for the average worker only slightly outpace inflation. As of August, median pay increased at a 4.1% rate, compared with inflation, which is pacing at 3.0% on an annual basis. Inflation has risen every month since April, when it was recorded at 2.3%. On the topic of the labor market, which many economists and analysts view as rapidly weakening, the Treasury said it sees the market for job seekers as "relatively steady" although "monthly job growth moderated slightly, while the average unemployment rate ticked up only slightly." Employment growth "is below the roughly 100,000 jobs added per month in the first quarter of 2025," Treasury said. This "likely reflects the drop in population growth related to the forced and self-deportation of illegal immigrants." It further added that, "although employment growth slowed in the second and third quarters of 2025, data do not indicate the slower growth is a result of soft GDP growth or weakening aggregate demand." GDP, the primary measure of the country's economic output, rose 3.8% in the second quarter. Third-quarter GDP data was set to be released on Oct. 30, but has been delayed by the government shutdown. There also have been no official jobs reports since September due to the shutdown. Private payroll processor ADP said on Oct. 1 that private companies had shed 32,000 jobs in September. The delayed October jobs report could show another contraction. "Excluding the shutdown, declining government employment may create a headwind for labor markets in the fourth quarter of 2025," the Treasury said. It noted that "the employment report for October could show a decline in total payroll employment" due to the departure of federal employees who opted for deferred resignations earlier this year. Artificial intelligence could also play a role in the changing labor market dynamics. "Artificial intelligence also could have disruptive impacts on the economy and labor markets as businesses and individuals integrate it or fail to," the Treasury said. "Firms that are slow to adapt to the technology could find themselves at a competitive disadvantage." "Looking ahead to the next few quarters, the outlook for the U.S. economy faces upside and downside risks," the report concluded. The Treasury said it would be "monitoring private-sector labor market developments closely" and said the administration would pursue "supply-side policies, deregulation, and other reforms" that it says will "protect the American consumer."

Updated: 11/03/25 There has never been a bigger moment in history when brand differentiation was more important. The channels we relied on for growth are saturated and increasingly less effective. And with AI changing how people search and make buying decisions, the race to stand out has never been more brutal. The brands at the top of the food chain are those we associate with a specific problem. For example, if I want running shoes, I go to Hoka. For skincare, I’m a Byoma girlie, and if I’m craving apple juice, Innocent cures my thirst. But how do these brands differentiate in a crowded market space? What makes them so memorable? In this article, I’ll share my favorite examples of companies smashing brand differentiation and give you actionable tips on how to stand out from the crowd. Table of Contents Brand differentiation is how you carve out mental real estate in a market where everyone‘s screaming for attention. It’s not just your logo, your tagline, or your mission statement. It's the specific reason someone chooses you over a competitor when both products could technically solve their problem. A comprehensive guide to effectively define, launch, scale, and monitor your brand. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Differentiator: Product-led growth that turns customers into advocates In a previous Moz Whiteboard Friday, I said the most important way to build brand authority is to have a great product. There’s no workaround for this. A great product keeps people in-app and coming back. That’s why I love Revolut. When I moved to the UK in 2022 and needed a banking solution, all my friends pointed me to the app. Revolut offered multicurrency accounts backed by frictionless banking, and I’d never seen anything like it. It feels like an everyday app that combines banking, investment, and features you’d only get on a typical credit card. A great product feels two steps ahead of you. It anticipates your needs, offers features before you ask, and gets you from A to Z with ease. Here’s how Revolut differentiates from other neobanks: No amount of advertising or marketing spend can save a bad product. Invest in your core experience. Build features that meet the standard, and go further with future-forward innovation that keeps people in the app. Differentiator: A unique blend of education, design, and storytelling I first heard about Better Trail’s content in the TOFU community when David Broderick used them as an example of intuitive content. So, I took a look, and I was thoroughly impressed. Google is starting to surface longer answers through AI Overviews and AI Mode, cannibalizing traffic that would usually go to websites. Better Trail, a review site that depends on traffic and commissions for survival, is doing something different to attract and keep users. Here’s how Better Trail differentiates from other review sites: The UX is amazing, and I love how it makes the content look more like a magazine than a blog post. If you want to quickly scan the recommendations, they've got you with skim. Source Need a little bit more detail? Choose medium. And if you have time to read the entire thing, they've got a 14,000-word banger for you. Better Trail skips all the unnecessary SEO optimization of “what is” and “how to.” The site instead goes straight to an overview of hiking shoe superlatives, so you can quickly make a choice. Source When buying a hiking shoe, you look for specific features, like comfort, foot protection, and durability. Better Trail uses a scoring system to rate each feature, making it easy to choose based on what's important to you. Source Basically, they've provided the information people look for when buying a product and removed barriers that prevent a sale, all in one go. You’re not going to capture and hold attention if your content looks like everyone else’s. You need a format that feels fresh and unique. Anticipate the decisions people are trying to make and give them answers before they even know what to ask. Finally, structure your content so it works for scanners, researchers, and power users alike. Differentiator: Turning internal SMEs into multi-channel influencers Revenue Intelligence is a heavily saturated niche with many competitors providing similar feature sets. Gong sits within that niche as one of the most expensive options. So, the brand differentiates and captures market share by prioritizing relationships and human-led conversations, not just pricing or features. Source I haven’t seen another brand lean into LinkedIn the way Gong has with its internal SMEs. The first time I heard about Gong was through Udi Ledergor’s LinkedIn content. He was so engaging that I had to check out his profile. Since then, I’ve seen other internal SMEs, like Brian LaManna (104k), JC Pollard (48k), and others post thoughtful, relevant content. Their target audience (sales leaders) spends a lot of time on LinkedIn, so it makes sense for Gong’s AEs and marketing leaders to build a presence there. Source They also show up through activation events like the Celebrate Conference, which platforms Gong’s leadership team alongside external experts. Source In addition, there are ongoing webinars. These digital gatherings are usually co-hosted by one Gong SME and a known industry voice. The brand also hosts smaller in-person events that create space to interact with its audience. It’s brilliant, really. People trust people, and Gong empowers their internal experts to build thought leadership and stay top of mind. Identify experts within your company who want to grow their personal profiles and leverage them to strengthen the overall brand image. Allow them to speak in their own voice, and don’t try to censor their content. Create a program that helps them spread their influence externally through podcasts, webinars, and even public speaking. If they show up in the places your audience is already hanging out, that’s a win for your brand. A comprehensive guide to effectively define, launch, scale, and monitor your brand.

Differentiator: Inclusive products and campaigns that ensure holistic representation Before Fenty, beauty brands got away with exclusion for decades. Deeper foundation shades were an afterthought and rarely existed. Even worse, the people creating products for BIPOC women weren’t part of our communities, and it showed in the existing range. Rihanna saw the gap and built Fenty to close it. Source She launched Fenty Beauty in 2017 with 40 foundation shades on day one because she knew what it felt like not to find your shade of makeup in the store. Personally, I was excited! She was a disruptor, making inclusive products that customers had been begging for, but no one had created. And suddenly, brands that had never prioritized inclusivity scrambled to expand their shade ranges. Source It’s a smart move because Fenty wasn’t trying to compete with the big names. They focused on creating products for BIPOC women with shades you couldn’t find elsewhere, which allowed them to carve a niche for themselves. Within 40 days of launching, Fenty had $100,000,000 in revenue, proof that there is a market for diverse beauty products. But, it’s not just inclusive shades. Fenty has consistently featured plus-size models, disabled models, and talent from across the gender spectrum. Source Everyone gets to see themselves in Fenty because the brand is intentional about representation. It also helps that Rihanna uses her personal brand to maximize visibility for Fenty. She makes tutorials showing people how to use the products, which builds a sense of ownership and community around every launch. Source However, this only worked because the product is fantastic. Fenty also gives back through the Clara Lionel Foundation to fund climate resilience, health initiatives, and education for marginalized communities. You can’t just add a value or mission statement to your website and call it an inclusive brand. You need to start at the product level and ensure that your target audience is represented in the internal teams. Representation and trust go hand in hand. When done right, they build a movement that turns customers into brand evangelists. Differentiator: A tool that’s seamlessly embedded in everyday workflows There’s a YouTube video from 2018 where Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, talks about what makes a great product. He says, “If a product is so good that people spontaneously tell their friends about it, you’ve already done 80% of the work.” Friends, I’ve been on the train, in the air, and on the beach, and at each of these locations, someone was talking about ChatGPT. There’s a pattern I’m seeing as I write this article, where the best brand differentiators are disruptors that innovate with a product so good, it turns the industry on its head. OpenAI has done that with every product they’ve launched, including: Specifically, ChatGPT has become an everyday app. For example, I use it to find healthy recipes, troubleshoot issues with my washing machine, automate content workflows, and even help with fundraising for my nonprofit, The FCDC. OpenAI recently released ChatGPT Pulse. Pulse will deliver personalized updates based on the user’s behavior. In my opinion, this new feature increases app usage and further embeds ChatGPT as part of people’s daily routine. Source Brands that differentiate are those whose products become habits. Habit is how you rank in the user’s mind before they start a search. You want to be the first name out of their mouth when a friend asks for a recommendation. The most powerful form of differentiation is when your users do the marketing for you. Focus on building a product so good, people evangelize without incentive. Differentiator: Punk rock branding for canned water Water is essential to life. It’s something we’re all told to drink more of, yet not everyone enjoys it. A poll by CivicScience revealed that nearly half of U.S. adults consume far below the recommended amount of eight glasses per day. Source The core problem is that many people don’t see water as something they want but as a routine they’re supposed to do. Liquid Death set out to break the mold when they launched in 2019. In a U.S. market flooded with nearly 3,000 bottled water brands, the brand found white space by making water fun. Every time I hear the word “liquid death,” I imagine myself swinging a solid-body electric guitar and playing with Brian May. That’s the brand image that Liquid Death has built. Instead of clean, serene packaging, they gave us tallboys with flaming skulls and taglines like “Murder your thirst.” Source Their content is ridiculous, in the best way. They’ve dropped a metal album about hydration, launched a kids' cartoon called “Murderverse,” and even paid people to get Liquid Death tattoos. Source And, it works. Liquid Death now has over 14 million followers on Instagram and TikTok. In 2024, they pulled in over $333 million in retail sales, up 26% from $263 million the year before. While most CPG brands are still trying to figure out how to connect with Gen Z and Millennials, Liquid Death has already built a cult following. The brand shows that an anti-corporate tone can work. One reason people don't connect with branded content is because it's not engaging. Often, interactions feel faceless and boring. Make your brand fun. Liquid Death’s content works because it’s true to their brand and carries over into their product, marketing, and brand identity. Even water can become a habit when it’s marketed in an engaging way.

These steps are based on principles from “The Difference Engine”. This is a model of differentiation best practices founded by HubSpot Diamond Solutions partner, Articulate Marketing. To start, let’s view the eight steps from a high level. Then, we’ll dive into the details, along with examples you can use to inspire your own efforts. Google’s mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. This Google example showcases a few key elements to help you define your mission: Your mission should be a central goal. From here, you can position your products and services, build out yearly goals, quarterly objectives and metrics for success, and develop your strategies. This is the first step. You’ll want to use this structure to define your ambitions. Once you’ve identified your mission, everyone in your business will be singing from the same song sheet. Your collective voice will carry. Stations play your tune on the radio, the album goes platinum, you become the next Adele of … HealthTech. It’s all within reach if you make it your mission to get there. There are two sides to any brand. The first is the brand identity as it relates to customers. The second is how your brand is positioned within your community, as an employer, and as a global citizen. In other words, the culture of your company. Too many organizations pay lip service to culture. They offer basic benefits and post a “values” chart on the wall. It’s not enough. Talented employees will go elsewhere. But employees that enjoy a great company culture are 3.8 times more likely to be engaged. And engaged and talented people make for an exceptional business. In fact, clients are starting to pay attention to workplace culture, too, because they want to work with happy, supported, and empowered teams — while also having business partners who are committed to shared values. It’s no longer just about cost and results, but about the types of companies people want to partner with for the long-term. Recommendation: Consider third-party certifications, as provided by the likes of Investors in People and B Corp. Their evaluations leave nowhere to hide, so they keep you honest. Such certifications are the evidence that you really do business differently. The best businesses use the best tools. Take Ecologi’s story as an example. Ecologi has established a fantastic brand differentiation strategy. They offer unparalleled transparency around carbon offsetting and tree planting with technology that showcases the great work they do. Their climate-positive mission is timely and well-targeted. What they offer is in-demand given the current environmental crisis. So they began experiencing rapid growth. Businesses want to do their part to achieve net zero. Ecologi provides the means to get there. Although they had experienced success with HubSpot Sales Hub, they relied on multiple systems for marketing. This meant valuable data was falling through the cracks. They had limited marketing intelligence and patchy lead capture compliance. Any changes relied on dev support. Once they were successfully brought onto HubSpot’s Marketing Hub, however, their team found they could track lead sources as well as align their marketing and sales processes. By making the most of the tools, they saw accelerated results. Now, they can personalize campaigns to target sectors, extend their reach, and grow their reputation as a brand. That example is just one way that tools empower a brand to stand head-and-shoulders above the rest. So, step three: audit your toolkit. You want to have a strategic blueprint for all elements of your content and communications. These are the core guides for your positioning. A strategic blueprint is an up-to-date document that everyone in your organization can access. It’s up to you what you need a blueprint for. Most businesses will have these: Consistency is integral to differentiation. If you have a consistent brand, then it’s going to be easier to recognize, whether your audience is reading a Tweet or watching a video. These strategic blueprints should be applied with such regularity and enthusiasm that an outsider could guess their contents. Let’s put that idea into practice. Try this exercise. Take one of these strong brands that you’re familiar with and sketch out a persona and the journey they go on to buy, three key messages, five attitude words and a couple of notable styles, such as the use of formal/informal words: Once you’ve done that, try to do the same for your business. Step five is all about establishing your visual brand. This is a huge topic, but let’s ask ourselves some key questions. When did you last update your logo? Is it simple, modern, and legible? Do you have a well-defined visual style throughout your website and other channels? Are things like your fonts and color palette defined in a brand book? Has your website been updated in the last couple of years? Does it accurately reflect your services and your story? Is it fast loading and easy to navigate? Like with strategic blueprints, consistency is vital. If you have a consistent visual brand, then it’s more likely to become familiar with your audience. Therefore, they will remember who you are. Source Beyond Encryption, a secure communications provider, took their visual branding a step further than most companies. Rather than having one logo and one colorway, they chose to develop a whole brand family. Each of their product lines has its own logo and design profile; they are harmonious, yet distinct. They all flow from the same brand methodology, with the main site brand and logo as the “parent.” Beyond Encryption uses this brand family to target segmented audiences while maintaining a clear, differentiated brand. Thought leadership is a tactic content marketers use to build credibility for themselves or leaders in their company. Essentially, thought leadership is brand positioning based on expertise. The good thing about expertise is, unlike positioning based on price, it’s something you can leverage in a unique and thought-provoking way. It’s the route to long-term positioning that you build over time, rather than a quick and dirty race to the bottom. Real experts have knowledge and opinions that other people are interested in learning about. Businesses with in-house experts can differentiate themselves by creating thought leadership content, like blogs and white papers, leveraging their expertise. This helps you establish credibility with your audience. What we don’t suggest, however, is positioning based on the concept of expertise (“I’m an expert, so trust me”). Thought leaders demonstrate their expertise in tangible ways. They have certifications, and are evidence-based. They don’t just say they are experts. They show it. The other mistake people sometimes make is to confuse expertise with complexity. This means filling your content with obscure jargon about your services. That’s not going to work, either. As Einstein put it, “If you can‘t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.” Once you’ve got your thought leadership content out into the world, you can expect to see a growing audience coming to your website. From there, you want to capture contact details, such as people’s names and email addresses. Here is another opportunity to differentiate yourself. The lead generation and nurturing process is where you start to see real engagement with your brand. It’s your chance to build a relationship with prospects. So many businesses drop the ball here. They miss opportunities to get leads. Or they dive right into pushy sales tactics once they do get them. Here’s an alternative approach: Lastly, let’s talk optimization. Sir David Brailsford leads Britain’s first ever professional cycling team. At the 2008 Olympics, his team won the majority of gold medals in track cycling and did the same at the next Olympics. Sir David Brailsford told Harvard Business Review, “It struck me that we should think small, not big, and adopt a philosophy of continuous improvement through the aggregation of marginal gains. Forget about perfection; focus on progression, and compound the improvements.” You don’t necessarily need to shake up your whole brand to differentiate your business. You can simply make small improvements that, over time, make a big difference. In marketing, this means observing what works, tracking and measuring the data, testing variants, and implementing the better option, every time. That’s how you go for gold. These eight steps to brand differentiation are definitely not for the risk averse. But they are for ambitious companies and leaders who have a growth mindset. The difference between you and every other business out there is that you’re willing to take the first step. You have to bake your differentiating element into your brand from day one. It can’t be an afterthought. The brands winning today built products that form habits, tell stories worth sharing, and live their mission like a second skin.

Title: All Roads Lead To NVIDIA: Bankrolling Its Own AI Gold Rush
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/11/03/all-roads-lead-to-nvidia-bankrolling-its-own-ai-gold-rush/
Time Published: 2025-11-03T16:06:55Z
Full Content:
ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. NVIDIA just wrote a $5 billion check for a stake in Intel. It's the AI gold rush in microcosm: the biggest winner is now bankrolling its own boom. The Intel deal is one small piece of an extraordinary surge. In 2025, through October, nearly one trillion dollars in AI infrastructure commitments has surfaced: $500 billion from Stargate alone; approximately $150 billion in NVIDIA-driven strategic and supply commitments; and a cascade of hyperscaler, private-equity, and sovereign GPU procurement moving at unprecedented velocity. This isn't a tech cycle. It's a capital reordering. And it reveals a fundamental power shift—the company at the center of the AI buildout is now funding it. Every boom has two sides: those writing checks and those cashing them. The spenders? Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon. Over $750 billion in datacenter spending between 2023 and 2025. Nearly $400 billion in 2025 alone. In recent earnings calls on October 29–30, 2025, all four signaled plans to increase spending materially in 2026. And the investor base is multiplying. Private equity firms are raising billion-dollar AI infrastructure funds. Investment banks are structuring datacenter acquisitions. Sovereign wealth funds are locking in GPU capacity years in advance. The recipients span the entire infrastructure stack: GPUs, memory, networking, cooling, and power. Plenty of companies are winning on volume. But one company captured the lion's share—NVIDIA. 80–95% of the AI accelerator market. 70–80% gross margins. Between 2023 and 2025, revenue surged from $27B to $130B while market value exploded nearly tenfold. NVIDIA didn't just participate in the AI boom. It won. Now, with a war chest built from these sales, NVIDIA is deploying capital strategically to control both supply and demand in the infrastructure buildout. Unlike traditional VCs who simply take equity stakes, NVIDIA takes equity and turns portfolio companies into GPU customers locked into its ecosystem. The pattern repeats across the portfolio. In July 2023, a $50 million investment in Recursion Pharmaceuticals enabled the biotech firm to build BioHive-2, an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD supercomputer with 504 H100 GPUs, completed in May 2024. By mid-2025, Perplexity AI, backed by NVIDIA since April 2024, was likely deploying Blackwell GPUs for its AI search engine, consistent with NVIDIA’s strategy of providing early access to its latest hardware. The loop is elegant: NVIDIA Invests Capital and Takes Equity → Portfolio Companies Buy GPUs → Additional GPU Revenue → Portfolio Equity Appreciates → Larger War Chest → Repeat. Each investment converts to infrastructure deployment. Each partnership locks in ecosystem adoption, creating a reinforcing cycle where NVIDIA effectively funds its own customer base. On March 10, 2025, Oracle CEO Safra Catz announced a figure on an earnings call that stunned analysts: $48 billion in new cloud contracts signed in a single quarter, the largest booking quarter in the company's history. The backlog hit $130 billion, up 63% year-over-year. Then came the kicker: those numbers didn't even include Stargate. The $500 billion OpenAI-Oracle-SoftBank megaproject announced two months earlier wasn't included in the reported backlog. By late September, Stargate had committed more than $400 billion and secured seven gigawatts of capacity. An even larger wave followed. Between mid-September and late October 2025, the AI infrastructure market detonated with hundreds of billions more in commitments. Anchoring the blitz: NVIDIA and OpenAI's up to $100 billion letter of intent for 10 gigawatts of compute, with the first gigawatt online mid-2026. Flanking it: CoreWeave signing $36.6 billion in five days—$22.4 billion with OpenAI, $14.2 billion with Meta. AMD locking in 6 gigawatts with OpenAI. Broadcom securing another 10 gigawatts of custom ASICs starting late 2026. NVIDIA is directing capital to reinforce its AI ecosystem moat. $5 billion into Intel, $2 billion into xAI's Colossus 2 supercomputer, $1 billion for a Nokia stake. Then came the deal that revealed the whole game: a BlackRock-led consortium, including NVIDIA, Microsoft, and xAI, spending $40 billion to acquire Aligned Data Centers. It wasn't a traditional tech acquisition—it was a buy-the-grid play. They weren't buying a business; they were buying power, land, and priority access to the electrical future. This isn’t a spending cycle. It's an arms race for computational sovereignty—and the infrastructure is sold out before it's even built. The numbers are staggering, yet the mechanics are variations on a single, ruthlessly efficient playbook. Flywheel one—equity appreciation: In April 2023, NVIDIA invested $100 million in CoreWeave at a $2 billion valuation. Added another $250 million at the March 2025 IPO at $40 per share. Total investment: $350 million. CoreWeave now trades around $135 per share. NVIDIA's stake: roughly $3.3 billion. Nearly 10× on its initial position. As CoreWeave lands customer contracts, that equity value climbs. Flywheel two—GPU revenue: To fulfill those contracts, CoreWeave buys hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. Each purchase generates chip revenue for NVIDIA. The rising revenue and equity value help enable more investments, accelerating the loop. The structure is nearly bulletproof. Heads, NVIDIA wins. Tails, NVIDIA still wins. What's unusual about the CoreWeave relationship: NVIDIA has committed to buy back $6.3 billion in capacity through 2032 if CoreWeave can't fill its data centers. Most cloud providers assume full inventory risk on multi-billion dollar GPU purchases. NVIDIA backstopped its own customer. Not everyone buys it. "There's a lot more that can go wrong with Nvidia than can go right," says Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities. NVIDIA did not respond to requests for comment. AMD's revenue grew from $22.7 billion in 2023 to $25.8 billion in 2024, on track for roughly $32-34 billion in 2025. A 45% two-year climb, respectable but modest against an AI boom that quintupled NVIDIA's revenue. AMD had been scrambling to break into the AI GPU market. In October, it finally got its break. AMD announced a 6-gigawatt deal with OpenAI, its biggest contract ever. The price of landing a transformational AI customer? AMD issued OpenAI warrants for up to 160 million shares at a penny each, potentially giving OpenAI 10% of AMD's equity just to become a supplier. The warrants vest in tranches as OpenAI deploys gigawatts and as AMD's stock hits targets escalating to $600 per share. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri calculated the stake could reach $100 billion if OpenAI holds through completion, though he expects OpenAI will likely sell shares along the way to finance GPU purchases. AMD is essentially financing OpenAI's purchases with its own equity. But AMD isn't just buying in. It's building a genuine alternative. The Helios rack-scale platform matches NVIDIA's Vera Rubin spec-for-spec: 72 GPUs, integrated networking, turnkey deployment, plus 50% more memory at 31TB HBM4. Both systems target mass production in late 2026. AMD projects a $500 billion datacenter AI accelerator TAM by 2028, a conservative estimate given $400 billion in big tech AI capex this year alone. AMD has competitive technology and a massive market opportunity. What it lacks is time and ecosystem lock-in. NVIDIA buys into customers; AMD dilutes to get them. That asymmetry shows NVIDIA's chokehold on the market. Broadcom is playing a different game and winning. Revenue jumped from $35.8 billion in 2023 to $51.6 billion in 2024, on track for roughly $60 billion in 2025. That's a 67% surge as hyperscalers embraced custom ASICs for high-volume inference. On October 13, the company secured 10 gigawatts of custom OpenAI-designed accelerators starting late 2026. It already has design wins generating billions in revenue across Google, Meta, and other hyperscalers. These are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), custom chips built for one job—high-volume inference. They're dramatically cheaper and more power-efficient than GPUs for repetitive tasks like answering ChatGPT queries. This is real business taking real market share. The tradeoff? ASICs are appliances, not platforms. A Broadcom chip designed for OpenAI can't run Meta's models. It can't adapt when workloads evolve. However, this matters less than NVIDIA hopes. For mature, stable inference at massive scale, ASICs win on economics. Broadcom isn't a curiosity. It's a genuine competitive threat to NVIDIA's inference dominance. But none of that matters if the grid does not come through; the bottleneck is electricity, not silicon. AI datacenters currently consume approximately 6–8 gigawatts globally. A single gigawatt of electricity—roughly the output of one nuclear reactor running continuously—can power a large AI datacenter. The September OpenAI/NVIDIA deal requires 10 gigawatts. The math is straightforward. At a modern power usage effectiveness (PUE) of ~1.3, a 10-gigawatt facility delivers roughly 7.5 GW of usable compute power. With ~80% dedicated to GPUs—the standard for next-generation AI datacenters—nearly 6 GW goes to accelerators. At ~1 kilowatt per Blackwell-class GPU, this translates to ~6 million chips across ~83,000 racks. OpenAI builds the datacenter buildings, cooling systems, and networking infrastructure—but it does not generate the power. The grid must deliver the electricity, equivalent to ~10 nuclear reactors running 24/7. The grid must deliver the electricity, equivalent to ~10 nuclear reactors running 24/7. For grid operators, the surge is unprecedented. “I have not seen this degree of change in a forecast in my career, and no one has seen these nationwide growth levels since the 1980s,” says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies. The U.S. grid adds roughly ~10–15 gigawatts of new capacity per year. Meeting the ~44–51 GW requirement by 2026 means building 3–5× faster—just for AI datacenters. High-voltage transmission lines take 3–5 years to build, even before community battles and permitting delays. California’s grid operator says datacenter upgrades won’t finish until late 2027. In Northern Virginia, two-thirds of Loudoun County substations face delays through 2026. Small modular reactors won’t arrive until the 2030s. Natural-gas plants are faster but face infrastructure constraints. The deals promise power years before the grid can supply it. Even if the power arrives on schedule, demand itself could evaporate. A structural shift toward cheaper, distributed, and more efficient AI could erode the very economics this boom depends on. If inference improves on lower-cost infrastructure, and if specialized architectures—from domain-specific ASICs to emerging analog accelerators—deliver order-of-magnitude efficiency gains for targeted workloads, the rationale for premium datacenter GPU infrastructure weakens. The $180 billion in deals assumes AI remains proprietary, centralized, and compute-intensive. History rarely cooperates. Technology cycles bend toward efficiency, commoditization, and distribution. Regulators compound the uncertainty. NVIDIA’s model binds capital, supply, and demand into a single reinforcing loop — a structure increasingly under scrutiny in cloud-AI partnerships. In January 2024, the FTC opened a formal Section 6(b) inquiry into AI investment and cloud-compute arrangements, compelling major firms to disclose terms around preferential access, exclusivity, and required cloud-spend. A follow-on FTC report in early 2025 highlighted concerns that equity-linked compute access and tied-spend agreements can reinforce incumbency and limit competition. If regulators conclude these arrangements distort market access, NVIDIA’s flywheel could meet friction. Jensen Huang has built the most elegant flywheel in modern capitalism. But flywheels spin both ways. The loops that accelerated gains can amplify pain when the cycle turns. For investors and strategists, the implications are clear: NVIDIA has built structural advantages that extend far beyond chip performance. Its capital deployment strategy creates switching costs and ecosystem lock-in that competitors can't easily replicate. But the same feedback loops that drive exponential growth in boom times can accelerate downturns. The questions aren't whether NVIDIA dominates today—it does—but whether power infrastructure can support the buildout, whether demand justifies the scale, and whether regulators will allow the flywheel to continue spinning unchecked. The answers will determine whether this is the decade's most prescient capital allocation or its most spectacular miscalculation.

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee because while Wall Street partys on AI-fueled gains, Bitcoin’s biggest backers are quietly stepping back. Fresh data shows BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF inflows have plunged, hinting that institutional enthusiasm may be cooling just as the bull market heats up. The sharp decline in Bitcoin ETF inflow, reported in a recent US Crypto News publication, is raising eyebrows across the crypto market, even as US equities continue their AI-fueled surge. New data from Glassnode shows that institutional demand for Bitcoin has slowed dramatically, contrasting with the growing euphoria in traditional markets led by technology and infrastructure plays. According to Glassnode, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has seen less than 600 BTC in net weekly inflows over the past three weeks. This represents a significant decline from the 10,000 BTC-plus inflows that have historically preceded major rallies in this cycle. “Over the past three weeks, BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF has seen less than 0.6k BTC in weekly net inflows. This represents a sharp decline from the > 10,000 BTC net inflow per week that preceded each major rally this cycle, signaling a notable slowdown in institutional demand,” wrote analysts at Glassnode. The slowdown marks one of the weakest periods of institutional accumulation since the ETF’s launch. The figures suggest that large investors may be taking a breather after months of heavy accumulation. Bitcoin’s price has struggled to maintain momentum, but has slipped below $110,000, trading at $107,868 as of this writing. ETF flows are now considered a leading indicator of sentiment among institutional investors. Despite the soft inflow data, on-chain analysts spotted movement beneath the surface. Whale Insider reported that BlackRock transferred 1,198 BTC, worth approximately $129 million, to Coinbase, suggesting ongoing portfolio realignment or custody adjustments. JUST IN: BlackRock deposits 1,198 $BTC ($129.09 million) and 15,121 $ETH ($56.1 million) to Coinbase within the last hour. pic.twitter.com/2J8ah3MrCw Such movements do not necessarily indicate selling. However, they highlight how major asset managers are actively managing exposure amid volatile macro conditions. ETF providers often rebalance or consolidate holdings across custodians as liquidity and demand fluctuate. While Bitcoin demand cools, traditional markets are powering higher. Evercore ISI maintains a bullish outlook on US equities, projecting the S&P 500 to reach 7,750 by 2026. The firm reportedly cites strong leadership from AI-driven sectors like tech, communications, and consumer discretionary. Evercore strategist Julian Emanuel said the current bull market remains intact, although he warned of near-term volatility tied to shifts in Fed policy and tariffs. EVERCORE: U.S. BULL MARKET STILL STRONG, BUY STOCKSEvercore ISI advised buying U.S. stocks, saying the S&P 500 could hit 7,750 by end-2026 as key signs of a market top are missing. Analyst Julian Emanuel said gains are being led by AI-driven sectors like tech, communication… With the VIX near year-to-date lows, Emanuel recommended using SPY strangles as hedges in a “still-healthy” uptrend. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed this optimism, calling it a market that’s “forgotten how to fall.” He noted that the -3x S&P ETF has reverse-split five times, a sign of how punishing this cycle has been for bears. NEW: Bears Face Extinction in a Market That's Forgotten How to Fall.. The -3x SPX ETF has reverse split 5 times, a crazy data point showing just how brutal this mkt has been for bears. While they'll get their moment (pullbacks are part of life) we also show that long term it pays… pic.twitter.com/58BwtcWTGg The diverging trends highlight a key tension in global markets. AI and equity exuberance are absorbing liquidity, while Bitcoin’s institutional narrative temporarily cools. As macro liquidity tightens and investor enthusiasm tilts toward AI infrastructure, Bitcoin’s next leg may depend more on when big money returns to the digital frontier than on policy signals.

Title: Best Altcoins to Buy as Crypto Adoption Is Inevitable for Wall Street, per Bitwise CEO

Time Published: 2025-11-03T12:38:49Z

Quick Facts: 1️⃣ Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley believes that within the next 12 months, every Wall Street institution will be involved in crypto. 2️⃣ Massive inflows into products like Bitwise’s Solana ETF and moves by giants like JP Morgan and BlackRock prove the shift is already underway. 3️⃣ The best altcoins to buy now include $HYPER, $PEPENODE, and $BAN – all poised to ride the next big wave. Crypto is hosting the wildest party in town, there is no doubt about it. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley recently took to X to claim that within the next 12 months, every Wall Street institution will be doing something in crypto. ‘Software is eating the world. Crypto is going to eat capital markets’ – Hunter Horsley Almost every major bank, from Bank of America and BlackRock to Goldman Sachs and HSBC, is knee-deep in one or more crypto-related endeavors, whether that’s crypto trading and custody, crypto ETPs, crypto-enabled payments, or tokenization. Is Horsley’s claim a bold one? Sure. Especially considering that DeFi currently represents less than half a percent of traditional finance’s scope. That said, it’s worth noting that these crypto-related investment products are still relatively new, and it’s only fair to give them time to mature rather than immediately comparing them to TradFi. If anything, the massive interest in these new products – ETFs being a great example – shows that the sky is the limit for crypto. That’s a clear sign the market is hungry for new-age investment products that give it exposure to high-quality cryptos. What’s more, a recent Bloomberg report revealed that JP Morgan is all set to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum as loan collateral. This would offer billion-dollar investment parties more flexible financing options, allowing them to retain their crypto holdings and avoid triggering taxable events. And then there’s BlackRock, one of the biggest asset-management companies in the world, which now boasts over $87B in Bitcoin ETF assets and more than $10B in Ether ETFs – proving that crypto is indeed the next big investment opportunity. Don’t want to miss the crypto gold rush? Ready to ride Wall Street’s smarts? Below are three top altcoins to buy right now. One of the best crypto presales of 2025, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has already raised an eye-popping $25.6M+ from early investors. And it’s worth the hype. That’s because $HYPER plans to bring Solana-like speeds, low costs, and Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin blockchain, which has so far been technologically sidelined compared to Ethereum and Solana. It’ll also enable developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts directly on Bitcoin. So, get ready to access DeFi trading apps, DAOs, governance, lending, staking, and gaming on Bitcoin, all thanks to Bitcoin Hyper. Furthermore, a decentralized canonical bridge will facilitate seamless interaction between Bitcoin’s Layer-1 and Hyper’s Layer-2 networks. Simply put, it’ll convert your original Bitcoin into wrapped, Layer 2-compatible tokens. Here’s the kicker: if you want to join the Bitcoin Web3 revolution, now’s the best time to get in. The project is currently in presale, meaning right now you can buy Bitcoin Hyper for just $0.013215 each – and stake it for 46% APY. Check out our guide to buying $HYPER to find out how. And holding onto your tokens until 2026 could earn you a handsome 1,400% ROI, with the token projected to potentially reach $0.20 according to our $HYPER price prediction. To fully understand PEPENODE ($PEPENODE)’s ground-breaking potential to become the next crypto to explode, consider how it aims to revolutionize the crypto mining segment. Right now, traditional crypto mining is not only super expensive – with high GPU, electricity, and maintenance costs – but also highly technical, requiring detailed knowledge to set up and operate. First, PEPENODE is extremely affordable, as your only starting cost is the price of your first $PEPENODE token, which, during its current presale, is just $0.0011317 per token. Second, mining on PEPENODE is set to be simple yet engaging. The only challenge lies in experimenting with different combinations of mining nodes, as each will have unique characteristics and compatibilities. Despite being virtual, the mining setup will feel just like the real thing. The dashboard will include familiar elements such as hashrate and other key performance metrics. Interested? Check out our step-by-step guide on how to buy $PEPENODE. And according to our $PEPENODE price prediction, if you catch the trend early and get in now, you could potentially see a 542% ROI by the end of 2026. Comedian ($BAN) launched in October last year and rode the Q4 boom to shoot up over 3,000% in less than a month. It’s a viral meme coin inspired by the controversial art piece by Maurizio Cattelan, which features nothing more than a banana taped to a wall. This artwork sparked an ongoing debate about modern art vs. contemporary art and whether modern art is borderline stupid, fueling massive investor interest in the $BAN token. Nearly 12 months later, the token now appears ready for another major rally. It’s currently finding support on a key upward-sloping trendline – the same one that triggered a 1,000% rally back in March this year. However, with a strong resistance line overhead, its upside potential will depend on whether it can successfully break past that resistance. That said, even from current levels up to that resistance line, there’s at least a 50% gain on offer. But if $BAN manages to break beyond that line – which is highly likely given that it has tested it four times already (and as we know, the more times a resistance is tested, the weaker it gets) – then we could see another 2024-style rally. Join the meme coin mania – buy $BAN on MEXC today. Disclaimer: Kindly do thorough first-hand research before investing, as crypto is highly volatile. This article is not financial advice.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Bill Winters made a forecast at Hong Kong FinTech Week, while praising the city’s digital asset regulatory leadership. Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters stated on Nov. 3 that he believes all global transactions will eventually settle on blockchains and all money will be digital. Winters made the comments during a panel discussion at Hong Kong FinTech Week. Winters described the anticipated transition as a fundamental restructuring of the financial system, according to CNBC. However, he acknowledged that the industry does not know exactly how this transformation will occur and emphasized the need for continued experimentation. HSBC CEO Georges Elhedery joined Winters on the same panel and expressed optimism about Hong Kong’s fintech future. Winters praised Hong Kong’s leadership in digital asset regulation and its willingness to support blockchain experimentation. Other financial leaders, including the CEOs of BlackRock and Robinhood, have recently made similar predictions about the tokenization of traditional assets. Standard Chartered announced a joint venture with Animoca Brands and HKT in February 2025 to pursue a license for issuing an HKD-backed stablecoin. The partnership brings together the bank’s financial infrastructure, Animoca Brands’ Web3 expertise, and HKT’s mobile wallet capabilities. Standard Chartered participated in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s stablecoin issuer sandbox, which launched in July 2024. Multiple institutions are competing to build payment settlement networks through stablecoin initiatives, according to a recent stablecoin ‘infrastructure war’ report. Beyond stablecoins, Standard Chartered launched an integrated spot trading service for Bitcoin BTC $103 153 24h volatility: 1.3% Market cap: $2.06 T Vol. 24h: $110.93 B and Ether ETH $3 347 24h volatility: 6.0% Market cap: $404.72 B Vol. 24h: $66.71 B in July 2025 for institutional clients via its UK branch. The service offers Bitcoin (XBT/USD) and Ether (XET/USD) trading pairs. The bank has expanded its digital asset offerings through partnerships, including StanChart’s institutional crypto custody services with OKX in Europe. Hong Kong regulators have established multiple sandbox programs and regulatory frameworks to position the city as a global digital asset hub. The government has supported blockchain innovation through licensing regimes and pilot programs for financial institutions. The Hong Kong Blockchain Week started Nov. 3 and will last until Nov. 7.

Check out our Live Next Crypto to Explode Updates for November 3, 2025! Crypto is so unthinkably huge at the moment, a nearly $4 trillion industry that’s aiming for world domination. Recent headlines talk of Circle and Mastercard planning to add USDC to global payment systems, Ethereum and Bitcoin treasuries in the billions of dollars, and Google building its own blockchain. Bitcoin has an all-time growth of over 180,000,000%, Dogecoin over 43,000%, and some of the newest presale coins often pump 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x on rare occasions. Explosive potential is probably the single best description for what we’re seeing today in crypto. Quick Picks for Coins with Explosive Potential Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) - Real-Time Layer-2 Solution for Scaling Bitcoin Launch: May, 2025 Join Presale Maxi Doge ($MAXI) - High-Impact Meme Coin Built On Strength, Staking & Conviction Launch: July, 2025 Join Presale PepeNode ($PEPENODE) - A New, Gamified Way to Mine to Earn Meme Coin Rewards Launch: February, 2025 Join Presale Snorter Token ($SNORT) - Lowest-Fee Telegram Trading Bot for Solana and Ethereum Launch: May, 2025 Join Presale Best Wallet Token ($BEST) - Get Easy, Early Access to New Curated Presale Projects Launch: November, 2024 Join Presale If you’re looking for the most recent insights on the next crypto to explode, stay tuned. We update this page frequently throughout the day, as we get the latest and greatest insider insights for chart sniffers and traders looking for the next coin to explode. November 3, 2025 • 15:00 UTC The Federal Reserve’s Standing Repo Facility exists to pump funds into the banking system when needed. Practically speaking, that means adding liquidity at key points. And in the past week, they’ve quietly added $79B – including a major $50B injection. This means that leading cryptos – including Bitcoin and Best Wallet Token – could be set for a liquidity pump, as investors turn their eyes to riskier assets. Historically, Bitcoin’s price has followed liquidity roughly 80% of the time, climbing as liquidity increases and falling as it decreases. Best Wallet Token and the Best Wallet ecosystem help investors access tokens across the crypto economy, with the wallet, $BEST token, and upcoming Best Card all working together seamlessly. Explore the next cryptos to explode with our guide. November 3, 2025 • 14:00 UTC Michael Saylor forecasts that Bitcoin will hit $150K by the end of 2025, fuelling renewed optimism among Bitcoin holders. He also expects $BTC to reach $1M within the next 4-8 years, a 9X surge from current levels. Saylor’s vision for digital gold doesn’t stop there. He goes on to state that Bitcoin will climb to $20M per coin within the next 20 years. Saylor claims that his forecast is based on the consensus of equity analysts at Strategy, which shows that his forecast isn’t just empty rhetoric but backed by analytical reasoning. While $BTC is now trading near $107K, he states that the falling volatility and new hedging tools will stabilize the coin. While that’s Saylor’s stance on $BTC’s future, Bitcoin proponents like Samson Mow and Arthur Hayes echo similar sentiments, stating that $BTC will indeed reach $1M before the end of this decade. With Bitcoin gaining momentum, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – a Layer 2 scalability solution is gaining traction with its $25.6M presale fundraise. Check out the latest Bitcoin Hyper price prediction here. Aster Token Skyrockets After Binance’s CZ Discloses $2.5M Holding – Is $HYPER the Next Crypto to Explode? November 3, 2025 • 13:00 UTC Aster ($ASTER) surged over 30% on Sunday after Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao revealed his $2.5M personal investment in the token. As the native crypto of an emerging decentralized exchange protocol, $ASTER holds large potential. But it remains to be seen whether it can sustain the recent gains with tangible developments that validate the hype. The token’s surge has strengthened speculations that Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) might be the next crypto to explode. To begin with, the sensational $HYPER token presale is on its way to $26M. But the real catalyst behind the growing hype – which has already seen whale purchases worth $379K and $274K – is its underlying Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin. The project’s goal is to turn the Bitcoin network into a Web3 hub for innovation with speed and programmability. For a clearer picture of where the token is headed, read our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction. November 3, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Ethereum’s on-chain dominance grows as apps built on the blockchain now hold $370B in user assets. This comes as no surprise as Ethereum is the undisputed hub for high-value DeFi and dApp activity. Ethereum also acts as a magnet for developers and open-source contributors with its Layer 2 solutions like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism. It’s not only renowned for its innovation-centric ecosystem, but as the RWA tokenization leader with its 55% share of the total tokenization asset market, worth $12.2B. That said, $ETH now trades at $3,729, down 10.29% weekly. As the token is already trading above its 200-day EMA ($3,609.7), analysts expect a rally anytime now. With Ethereum gearing up for a potential rally, a presale project built on its network – PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is gaining massive traction. It is a gamified mine-to-earn ecosystem that lets users experience mining without an expensive or complicated setup. PEPENODE’s presale has already raised $2M so far. And the project offers a compelling staking APY of 633%. Learn how to buy PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) here. November 3, 2025 • 11:00 UTC Ethereum ($ETH) may be down at the moment, but it now has one of the largest foreign-exchange reserve pools in the world, eclipsing the likes of Singapore and India. That’s because around $165B worth of stablecoins have been issued on Ethereum, according to a Be In Crypto report. This underscores the growing importance of the Ethereum blockchain, whose $ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization. For now, though, there’s no dethroning Bitcoin ($BTC) from the number one spot. This is the reason why many projects continue to build on the Bitcoin blockchain, including Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). With its Layer 2 network, Bitcoin Hyper aims to deliver fast and low-cost transactions to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Its ongoing presale has already raised a whopping $25.6M, potentially making it the next crypto to explode. Learn more about Bitcoin Hyper here. November 3, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Founder of Strategy, Saylor, has hinted at another major Bitcoin Purchase, which will make it the company’s 13th consecutive $BTC buying streak. In a post on X, Saylor noted that ‘Orange is the color of November.’ Historically ‘Orange’ hints from Saylor have meant that a Bitcoin buy is in the offing. With Strategy already holding 640,808 BTC, the company’s portfolio has appreciated by over 48% since its inception. That said, the company’s last buy was just last Monday where it accumulated another 390 $BTC. Strategy’s most recent purchase amid the recent market volatility is another example of Saylor’s unshakable faith in Bitcoin and its long-term value. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has waved the truce flag with China by signing a new trade deal with President Xi. With Saylor’s bullish tweet and favorable macroeconomic tailwinds, analysts expect $BTC to rally this November. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a Layer-2 scalability project designed to make life easier for $BTC holders, is now perfectly positioned to ride this momentum. Find out what makes Bitcoin Hyper the next crypto to explode. November 3, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitwise’s Hunter Horseley cited on X that every wall street institution will be involved in crypto by next year. His forecast isn’t farfetched as the growing trend in TradFi show that global institutions managing over $30T are actively expanding their exposure to digital assets. Although DeFi only accounts for less than 0.5% of TradFi’s total market scope, its growing influence is evident through tokenization, yield products, and programmable real-world asset structures. BlackRock leads the charge with over $87M in spot Bitcoin ETFs and $10B in Ether ETFs. Meanwhile, major institutions like JPMorgan, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and BNY Mellon are also experimenting with tokenized funds, regulated DeFi, and on-chain settlement models. As the institutional momentum is building, investors are exploring for the next 100X project to position themselves for the market’s next bull run. One standout project gaining massive traction in its presale is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a gamified mine-to-earn ecosystem that fosters a competitive environment and offers attractive meme coin rewards. Learn how to get your hands on Pepenode ($PEPENODE) here.

Title: Global Digital Finance unveils results of study on tokenized money market funds
URL: https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/107787/global-digital-finance-unveils-results-of-study-on-tokenized-money-market-funds
Time Published: 2025-11-03T09:43:00Z
Full Content:
Global Digital Finance (GDF), the leading global digital assets members association, announced the results of a working group reporting on the legal certainty of collateral eligibility and the mobility of Tokenized Money Market Funds (TMMF) in Luxembourg, Ireland, and the UK. 1 03 November 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Ireland and Luxembourg host more than 80% of the MMFs and cross-border funds in Europe and English law governs the Credit Support Annex (CSA).The report concludes:• There is relative legal certainty of TMMFs located in Luxembourg in a digitally native or registered form due to the availability of statutory frameworks to govern such transactions• Longstanding historical legal interaction between Luxembourg and the UK in respect of financial and investment contractual arrangements, including CSAs, also makes this an attractive place to establish a TMMF where the tokens will be posted as collateral under a CSA governed by English law • There is not yet express statutory or judicial authority in Ireland specifically addressing tokenized shares or TMMFs. Legal certainty in respect of ownership and treatment of tokenized shares under Irish law therefore requires an analogy to traditional shares and electronic contracts, rather than being directly established • It is reasonable to conclude that Irish courts would treat digitally native TMMF shares in a manner consistent with traditional shares. This alignment reinforces the view that TMMF shares can be accommodated within existing property law principles in Ireland, supporting their recognition and enforceability under Irish legal standards • Where an MMF is tokenized using a digitally native TMMF and is located in the UK, there is a low degree of legal uncertainty concerning the legal treatment of ownership and a similarly low level of uncertainty concerning the replication of rights for market participants between the traditional MMF and a digitally native TMMF • It is anticipated that further certainty will be available in the UK if the Property (Digital Assets etc.) Bill is enacted and common law precedent is developed as to the implications of the “third category” of property. Over 70 firms participated in the working group including S&P, Federated Hermes, R3, JP Morgan, Ownera, Finastra, Lloyds Banking Group, Hogan Lovells, LSEG, Archax, Blackrock, State Street, ISDA, EY, Commerzbank, Fireblocks, Northern Trust, Apex Group, Franklin Templeton, and Goldman Sachs.“As a co-chair of this working group, I have been impressed with the collaborative and effective working engagement across traditional financial institutions and fintechs as well as legal and professional services contributors and their firms. The combination of research and assessment findings and the practical sandbox execution of production use cases made this working group a very special and successful achievement,” said Armin Peter, GDF Executive in Residence who is also a former Global Head of Debt Syndicate EMEA at UBS and a, former GFMA Board Member. Sharon Lewis, Lead Partner for Future of Finance and Co-Chair of Digital Asset & Blockchain Practice, Hogan Lovells said: "There is relative legal certainty of TMMFs located in Luxembourg in a digitally native or registered form, where both Ireland and the UK have a low degree of uncertainty as the courts are likely to treat digitally native TMMF shares in a manner consistent with traditional shares. The cross discipline collaboration involved in this work has been outstanding and it is a credit to the industry participants."As part of the working group 30 of the firms participated in the GDF Industry Sandbox, powered by Ownera, the firm which operates the FinP2P routers that implement the open FinP2P standard to “prove” the production use case for collateral mobility in TMMFs. With no fundamental barriers identified across legal, operational and regulatory dimensions, the sandbox demonstrated that TMMFs can transition from theoretical use cases to a production-ready collateral instrument across six simulations:• Simulation 1: Simple Bilateral Transfer - Manual Margining of TMMFs • Simulation 2: Integrated Margin Calls - Automated Posting via Third-Party Systems• Simulation 3: Depeg Event and Substitution - Dynamic Portfolio Management• Simulation 4: Default Scenario - Enforcement and Recovery in Insolvency• Simulation 5: Funding of TMMF in Triparty• Simulation 6: From SWIFT to Collateral Settlement in Seconds.“Hosting the GDF Industry Sandbox was a monumental collaborative effort, bringing together some of the best-in-class market participants, custodians, and technology providers from across the industry. The results highlight what’s truly possible when we apply FinP2P and its DLT interoperability layer to collateral mobility and optimization,” said Natasha Benson COO and CFO of Ownera.Amarjit Singh, UK Digital Assets Leader, EY said: "The over 30 TradFi and Fintech firms participating in the sandbox have demonstrated that collateral mobility for TMMFs has arrived. This is an exciting next step in the continued uplift to the future market’s infrastructure, leveraging digital assets to bring real-world benefit to investors and financial institutions around the globe.”Lawrence Wintermeyer, GDF Member Board Chair added: “Testing the legal certainty of digital assets and demonstrating real production use cases is a time that has arrived for the global securities industry. This outstanding working group demonstrated it could engage the world’s best TradFi and digital Financial Market Infrastructure (dMFI) firms to collaborate and demonstrate to the whole of the industry and its regulators that digital finance has truly arrived. I look forward to the US working group kicking off in January 2026.”

Irish fashion designers are discovering the advantages of collaboration. It’s what brought the Dublin Six – Jennifer Slattery, Ros Duke Knitwear, Freya Oatway of FAO Millinery, Caoimhe Grant of August Night, Gemma O’Leary of Inner Island and Amy Cahill of Oxmantown Skincare – together to create and style autumn-winter looks combining their respective talents in daywear, hats, jewellery, bags and body products. Their recent show in the restored Dublin’s Civic Trust building, sharing costs of the location, models and make-up, was an exercise in how, in an ever-demanding environment, co-operation and partnership can deliver results. It all began with Slattery and Duke discussing ways they could do a performance with other designers. Duke and Grant had worked together at John Rocha. The venue became a showcase “for our vision and shared ethos”, Grant says, “a one-stop shop where customers could buy”. Their catwalk show, Gathered Forms, after a collection specially designed for the occasion by Gemma O’Leary of Inner Island, was accompanied with music by Megan Nic Ruairí from northwest Donegal. “We wanted to bring some quietness and reflectiveness to our collections because everything is so fast paced. It’s about community over competitiveness and supporting each other. Every piece had a sculptural element to it inspired by art and nature,” Grant says. So who is the customer for the Dublin Six? “It’s the person who loves to support Irish design and who takes her time to choose,” Grant says. “She’s not into trends, preferring classic, timeless pieces that are not going to date, but is still interested in fashion. They are all easy pieces that come together well.” What such collaborations need and deserve is a bigger Irish design shop or location – a rotating space in which everyone has a chance to showcase their work. Such a venue would be a destination for both locals and tourists, creating awareness and visibility of the vibrant Irish fashion scene, which was evident last month at Dublin Independent Fashion Week – notably Ríon Hannora’s Sex Before Marriage bridal collection, Pellador showing womenswear for the first time, Conor O’Brien’s Phantom Thread collection, and Mihai Mar’s knitwear, alongside outstanding collections from Rashiid and the completely self-funded Caolum McCabe show at Henrietta Street. Both Slattery and Duke have had pop-ups recently in Kildare Village and are planning Christmas events in Slattery’s Smithfield shop in December. augustnight.ie, jenniferslattery.com, faomillinery.com, oxmantownskincare.ie, rosduke.com, innerisland.ie Ros Duke and August Night are both stocked in Emporium Kalu in Naas, Co Kildare; Jennifer Slattery in Slow Street in Blackrock, Co Dublin; August Night in Khan in Blackrock, Beo Wellness in Lahinch and Ennis, Co Clare; and Ellen B in Clontarf, Dublin; Oxmantown Skincare in Irish Design Shop in Dublin 2 and Project 29 in Stoneybatter, Dublin 7.

ByRussell Flannery, Senior Contributor. Liang Zaizhong, the son of China manufacturing billionaire Liang Wengen, resigned as chairman of Sany Heavy Equipment International effective Oct. 31, the Hong Kong-listed company said in an announcement on Friday. Sany Heavy Equipment International, whose products include port equipment, named Zhou Fugui, a long-time Sany Group executive, as new chairman. Sany Heavy Equipment International also said Qi Jian would step down from roles as vice chairman and executive director “to enhance the company’s corporate governance structure and strengthen the rotation mechanism of the strategic leadership team.” Qi will remain CEO; Liang Zaizhong will stay on as an executive director. The changes at the top come after Sany Heavy Equipment International’s shares gained more than 45% in the past 12 months; the company said on Oct. 30 net profit rose by 16% from a year earlier to 414 million yuan in the three months to September. Liang Wengen, 68, is the founder and former chairman of Shanghai- and Hong Kong-listed Sany Heavy Industry, a construction equipment maker which has thrived over the years from China’s building and infrastructure boom. China’s richest man in 2011, Liang Wengen currently holds a fortune worth $8.8 billion, according to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Son Liang Zaizong, 40, holds a bachelor’s degree in computer and management sciences from the University of Warwick. He received a master’s degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in May 2014. Both father and son are board members at Sany Heavy Industry. Sany Heavy Industry just last week sold $1.7 billion of “H shares” that began trading at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Oct. 28 at HK$21.30; they closed at HK$23.38 on Friday. Sany Heavy Industry’s Shanghai-traded shares, known as “A shares,” have gained 21% in the past 12 months. The Changsha-headquartered company, a global competitor of Caterpillar and Deere, said on Thursday net profit in the three months to September rose by 48% to 1.9 billion yuan, on revenue that increased 10.7% to 21.2 billion yuan. Sany Heavy Industry is among a group of Chinese companies trading at mainland exchanges to successfully seek an additional listing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this year, making the bourse one of the world’s most important for new offerings in 2025. Others include Contemporary Amperex Technology, better known as CATL, and Zhejiang Sanhua Intelligent Controls. Cornerstone investors in Sany Heavy Industry’s H share offering included Temasek, BlackRock, Infore Capital, Hillhouse and UBS Asset Management. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index has risen more than 27% in the past year. Sany’s history traces to China’s central Hunan province in 1989 as a small welding materials factory. Other Sany-connected billionaires include Xiang Wenbo ($1.4 billion), Mao Zhongwu ($1.3 billion) and Tang Xiuguo ($1.4 billion). Sany America, Sany Heavy Industry’s main U.S. operation, is headquartered in Peachtree City, Georgia.

Title: The Case Against Quarterly Reporting By Public Companies– Part 1, The Fundamentals

ByGeorge Calhoun, Contributor. U.S. financial regulators will soon modify or rescind the 55-year old rule requiring public companies to issue formal financial reports every 90 days. Surveys of business leaders consistently reveal concerns about the cost and distraction of preparing and managing the short-cycle reporting process. They also provide evidence of a short-term bias in corporate decision-making, linked to the pressures of the current quarterly reporting cycle. There is an acknowledged tendency to sacrifice long-term strategic investments, alter accounting schedules, and incur other financial penalties (e.g., customer discounts for favorable purchase arrangements) in order to meet quarterly earnings targets. Meanwhile, academic and industry studies indicate that semiannual reporting does not impair, and may even improve, company performance, the functioning of financial markets, and the quality of financial information available to investors. Finally, the quarterly reporting regime has created a significant short-term disruption or distortion of trading patterns centered around the earnings announcement – dubbed the “Earnings Game” – characterized by abnormal volatility, evidence of mispricing and market anomalies or inefficiencies, an open door to market manipulation, and disadvantages for small investors in particular. In this Part 1, we will review the “big picture” arguments pro and con. In Part 2, the focus will be on the nature and consequences of the Earnings Game. The United States stands alone (almost) among advanced economies in requiring quarterly financial reports from all public companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission enacted the quarterly reporting requirement in 1970. It has evolved into a highly structured, closely regulated framework which defines how companies communicate with the financial markets. Other countries have experimented with the American model – and then abandoned it. The European Union mandated quarterly reporting in 2004, but rescinded the rule in 2013. British regulators instituted a quarterly reporting requirement in 2007 – and repealed it seven years later. Singapore was quarterly for 17 years until 2020. Japan’s experiment with full quarterly reporting ran from 2003 to 2024. (Only Canada still follows the American example.) The SEC has now indicated that it wants to eliminate the quarterly reporting requirement in favor of semiannual reports by late next year, with full implementation expected by 2028. It is of course controversial. The arguments both for and against the proposed change tend to focus on how reporting frequency might influence the way companies are managed or the way markets function. Both sides often rely on deductions from “theory,” or simple appeals to “obviousness” – rather than hard evidence, which is scarce (for reasons discussed below). In the following sections, we’ll state the case for each side and review the available evidence. The main argument for change is the claim that quarterly reporting encourages “short-termism” – a tendency for companies to sacrifice long-term growth and investment in favor of short-term measures aimed at boosting quarterly results. This was the rationale for ending mandatory quarterly reporting in the EU. The EU even sees a “problem” with companies that continue to issue quarterly reports voluntarily. Regulators are said to be considering “more draconian measures, including ways to discourage or ban listed companies from reporting on a quarterly basis” even when they are not required to do so. UK regulators followed the recommendations of the Kay Report (authored by the prominent economist John Kay), which defined short-termism as “a tendency to under-investment, whether in physical assets or in intangibles such as product development, employee skills and reputation with customers” and sought ways to “reduce the pressures for short-term decision making that arise from excessively frequent reporting of financial and investment performance (including quarterly reporting by companies).” American critics of “quarterly capitalism” have included Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton (who coined the phrase), and Joe Biden, who wrote in 2016 that – Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, and Warren Buffett have criticized the “short-termism that is harming the economy” driven by an “unhealthy focus on quarterly earnings.” Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, blames “today’s culture of quarterly earnings hysteria” which is “totally contrary to the long-term approach we need.” David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, believes investors “can get adequate financial disclosure in two reporting cycles and it frees up both time and economic opportunity to really focus on the business and take a longer term view.” Norway abolished quarterly reporting in that country in 2017, and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund ($1.8 Tn) has proposed eliminating quarterly reporting for all public companies everywhere, citing the “risk of companies prioritizing short-term profits and the meeting of analyst forecasts over long-term investment, value creation and sustainable development.” The former Chairman of Temasek, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, cited the problem of short-termism among investors: “Issuing three-monthly updates on corporate performance does not improve transparency but does encourage investors to take a damagingly short-term view of their equity holding.” The President of the New York Stock Exchange focused her comments on the “burdensome” cost of preparing and managing short-cycle financial reporting. So, too, Nasdaq – Many leaders of nonfinancial firms believe that eliminating this short-term bias would improve business operations. Unilever’s CEO said that after the company stopped issuing quarterly reports – The Vice-Chairman of General Motors concurred: “The search for quarterly earnings is the father of many, many bad product decisions.” In sum, advocates of less frequent reporting argue that the current quarterly cycle tends to distort business decision-making, and thereby harms investors. It may even constitute a “threat to America’s enduring prosperity” (to again quote former President Biden). Traditionalists in the financial establishment generally line up against the proposed change, and their opposition tends to be categorical. The Wall Street Journal called the proposal to abandon the quarterly reporting cycle “wrong in every possible way.” They dismiss the short-termism argument out of hand – “utter tosh”(again, The Wall Street Journal). The general success of American business, and strong equity market valuations, are reason enough to reject it. Robust capital spending is also seen as proof that short-termism is a myth. Advocates of the status quo are worried about the negative consequences of less frequent reporting. Their arguments are based on classical Finance Theory. For example, the stock market (in theory) aggregates vast quantities of information about each company – its assets, its performance, its prospects, its customers, its competitive position in its sector, its role in the global economy – to calculate the correct current price and value of the company’s shares. Prices serve as signals to direct the proper allocation of capital. More frequent updates must always be preferable… because… well, more information must be better than less information, right? “Less frequent reporting would lead to less information and riskier markets,” as well as “greater volatility in securities prices.” It would impair price discovery, and render markets less “efficient.” Distorted asset prices would cause capital misallocation and trigger a cascade of evils – Other consequences of eliminating quarterly reporting could include: In sum, opponents of change see the quarterly reporting cycle as a critical guard rail that, if removed, would alter the way markets work and the way public companies are managed, to the general detriment. Many of these arguments are conjectural. For example, I know of no way to measure “market discipline” or to empirically estimate “misallocation of capital” on a quarterly or half-yearly basis. Moreover, because all U.S. public companies have been required to report quarterly since 1970, there is no recent comparative data. Some studies have tried to reach back to find a point of reference before the rule change, in, say, the Eisenhower era. However, the economy is much changed since then, as are the accounting and tax rules, the technology base, the financial markets, and management practices. 70-year-old data is just too stale. In other countries, however, where quarterly reporting is no longer required, some companies still do report voluntarily on a quarterly basis. EU firms are currently divided more or less equally between quarterly and half-yearly reporters, which sets up a plausible A/B comparison. (We will look at some of this data below, but there is an important caveat. Decisions about reporting frequency are not random. Many confounding factors are involved, including company size, the behavior of peers in the same sector, seasonality of the business, and management style.) The UK provides another natural experiment. Prior to 2014, quarterly reporting was mandatory. Today, “almost all” UK companies report semiannually. This sets up an interesting Pre-Post test (although there are possibly important differences between the two time periods). All that said, and with the appropriate caveats – the non-U.S evidence supports a surprising conclusion: Analysts have compared quarterly and semiannual reporters in the EU and UK on the basis of: The only recent study of the effect of reporting frequency on fundamental business performance comes from Goldman Sachs. Analysts compared the business performance of quarterly reporters and semiannual reporters in the EU Stoxx 600 index, and found little difference in return on equity, average net profit margins, and earnings per share growth. On the central question of short-termism, one approach is to look at levels of capital expenditure. Long-term investments should draw down earnings and net cash flows in the short term. A short-term bias would show up as a lower level of such investment at quarterly reporters compared with firms which do not report as frequently. The UK offers a double test – first imposing a mandatory quarterly reporting requirement in 2007 and then removing it in 2014. A study for the CFA Institute found that when quarterly reporting was imposed in 2007 it “had no material impact on the investment decisions of UK public companies.” When the mandate was lifted seven years later – A 2023 “Pre-Post” comparison in the UK examined the effect of reporting frequency on the quality of accounting information included in financial reports. The result was “counterintuitive.” An earlier study (2010) looked at the quality of information from the investors’ perspective. The result was also contrary to theory-based expectations. The previously cited Goldman Sachs study found essentially no difference in the price-earnings ratios for quarterly vs semiannual reporting companies in the EU sample. A 2010 study assessed “share price informativeness” for quarterly and half-yearly reporters in several EU markets – a measure of pricing accuracy and market efficiency based on the speed with which share prices anticipate, capture and reflect new earnings information – the efficiency of the price discovery process. It was unaffected by reporting frequency. The same study looked at the surprise caused by the earnings announcement – conceptualized as the difference between investors’ earnings estimates and the actual results. It is measured by the level of abnormal volatility and trading volume on the announcement date. It turns out that earning surprises are not dampened by more frequent reporting. And – Surprise reflects a disconnect between investors’ expectations and reality as revealed in the earnings announcement. It can be seen as an indication of the degree of mispricing in the market ahead of the earnings date. By this measure, quarterly reporting is associated with greater mispricing prior to the earnings release than semiannual reporting. This is a powerful and important deduction from classical Finance Theory. It is likely true, to some degree, and is often repeated as an article of faith. It justifies the quarterly cycle (for advocates of the status quo). The evidence is sketchy at best. “Cost of capital” is typically modeled rather than measured directly. The models depend on a set of complex assumptions, some of which are highly questionable. (For example, the “weighted average cost of capital” that all MBA students learn to calculate assumes that “perfect capital markets exist.”) The issue can also seem to cut both ways. More frequent updates presumably reduce risk and lower the cost of capital for quarterly reporters. But if less frequent reporting is associated with higher quality financial information (as studies cited above show), that should also reduce uncertainty, reduce risk, and thereby reduce the cost of capital for semiannual reporters. One oft-cited study concludes simply that “the benefits of mandatory disclosures are likely to differ across firms.” It should also be remarked that if a company is topically concerned about its cost of capital – say, in connection with a forthcoming funding round – it can always release information on a more frequent basis voluntarily. (And of course, material events must always be disclosed by means of an 8-K filing.) Then there is the question of mindset, or bias. A survey of 400 Chief Financial Officers of U.S. public companies published in 2005 found that “a surprising 78% of the sample admits to sacrificing long-term value” in order to “smooth earnings.” Nearly 40% said they would give discounts to customers to accelerate future spending plans to increase the company’s reportable sales in the current quarter – forfeiting a percentage of revenue to buff up the 10-Q. The payoff is said to be predictability. At the very least, such measures muddy the quality of the information provided to investors, and may shade towards illegal manipulation. Earnings management and/or manipulation has been the subject of dozens of academic studies, with a variety of definitions and methodologies, so that estimates of the prevalence of these practices vary widely. But it seems clear that the pressure of quarterly reporting deadlines can warp managerial decisions in many cases. So, with regard to “short-termism” the evidence seems mixed. The UK accounting data say no, but survey results confirm a short-term bias among U.S. executives, which is significantly exacerbated by the earnings calendar. That said – after five decades, U.S. public company executives are by now fully habituated to the quarterly reporting cycle – and as opponents of change readily point out, American economic exceptionalism seems unimpaired. Compared to other countries, U.S. businesses are more profitable, the market values of U.S. public companies are higher, and U.S. strategic leadership in many sectors of the global economy (e.g., Tech, Finance, Pharma and Energy) is clear cut. It could be argued that somehow short-termism has served the U.S. economy very well. Perhaps it is an antidote for the complacency which otherwise tends to infect the management mindset in all large and successful organizations. So, short-term biases may exist, but do they matter? Does quarterly reporting help or harm the company and its investors? Would less frequent reporting impair market functioning? The hard evidence, such as it is, suggests that reporting frequency has very little effect, perhaps favoring semiannual reporting slightly. Ambiguity encourages both sides. The New York Times – which leans towards maintaining the status quo – summarized “numerous studies [that] found no discernible improvements in corporate planning or performance in countries where [less frequent reporting] has been tried” – implying no need for change. But a semantically equivalent rephrasing – “Numerous studies found no discernible difference in corporate planning or performance related to reporting frequency” – could equally well support the argument for joining the global consensus. And there may be very good reasons to do so. Quarterly capitalism has created what has come to be called the “Earnings Game”– where company managers, analysts, and investors maneuver for advantage in the turmoil before and after the official earnings release. It generates a characteristic distortion of the market, and a symbiotic distortion of management behavior. The quality of financial information is often compromised. Mispricings develop. Trading is abnormal and even chaotic. The participants are tempted to pursue quasi-adversarial and sometimes dysfunctional strategies, which open the door to market manipulation, inspire or reinforce short-termist biases in business decision-making, and increase the overall risk for investors. It is likely that retail investors in particular are disadvantaged, trading against professionals who have developed sophisticated techniques for exploiting the market anomalies created by the earnings game. Part 2 of this column will examine this game and its consequences, which make a stronger case for changing the current reporting cycle than the shallow theoretical arguments that have dominated the debate so far.

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. After huge rallies or selloffs, it’s often pointed out that the stock market is not the economy, or that Wall Street is not Main Street. But that divide is getting blurrier. That’s because higher asset prices are spurring consumers to spend more freely than before, and consumption represents about 70% of GDP. In fact, this so-called wealth effect has become more potent in just the past 15 years. Today, every 1% increase in stock wealth translates to a 0.05% uptick in consumer spending, according to a note last week from Oxford Economics lead U.S. economist Bernard Yaros. In other words, a $1 increase in stock wealth leads to a $0.05 marginal propensity to consume, up from less than $0.02 in 2010. Meanwhile, every $1 increase in housing wealth leads to a $0.04 bump in consumption, up from $0.03. “As households see their wealth rise, they turn more sanguine about their personal financial situation and are more inclined to loosen their purse strings,” Yaros wrote. “Increases in wealth will also propel spending by allowing homeowners to extract more equity from their houses or to liquidate appreciated stocks to fund their current consumption.” He sees the wealth effect sending the marginal propensity to consume even higher in the coming years because retirees will comprise a bigger share of the population. Given that they already enjoy a bigger net worth than younger generations do, retirees will rely more on their wealth to support consumption after they stop working and earning an income, Yaros explained. On top of that, the ubiquity of digital media means consumer sentiment reacts even quicker to market news, reinforcing these wealth effects, he added. This more powerful wealth effect could help explain why consumer spending has stayed resilient. Even as President Donald Trump’s trade war has kept inflation sticky and made businesses more nervous about adding workers in an uncertain landscape, AI is still propelling the stock market to new record high after record high. At the same time, the stock market has grown more dependent on AI-related stocks, such as chip leader Nvidia along with so-called hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google. Based on his wealth-to-spending math, Yaros estimated that stock market gains in the past 12 months from the tech sector alone will boost annual consumption by nearly $250 billion, which would account for more than 20% of the cumulative spending increase. “While the stock market is not the economy, the latter risks greater whiplash from the ups and downs in the former,” he wrote. Analysts at JPMorgan also looked at the the link between the AI boom and consumers in a note last month. They estimated U.S. households gained more than $5 trillion in wealth in the past year from 30 AI-linked stocks, raising their annualized level of spending by about $180 billion. That represents just 0.9% of total consumption, but JPMorgan noted that it could go higher if AI spurs gains in a broader array of stocks or in other assets like real estate. And stocks are not limited to wealthier Americans either. A survey released last month from the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth showed that over 54% of Americans earning $30,000 to $79,999 a year are retail investors in the capital markets. And more than half of that cohort began investing in the past five years. To be sure, the wealthiest still spend the most dollars, and the emerging K-shaped economy has magnified their impact. Research from Moody’s found that the top 10% of earners accounted for half of spending in the second quarter, a record high. Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, attributed that to the wealth effect from stock and real estate gains as well as from income disparities. “Tying all this together produces two things—an economy increasingly reliant on discretionary spending among higher earners, and higher earners whose discretionary spending is reliant on risk assets remaining buoyant,” he said in a note on Tuesday. This dynamic means central bankers at the Fed who control monetary policy and lawmakers in Congress who control fiscal policy have a greater incentive to support the stock market, Brown added. That’s because the wealth effect can work in the reverse direction, meaning falling asset prices will slow spending and the economy. “What we have, then, is an economy that’s tied increasingly closely to the fortunes of the equity market, and an equity market that’s increasingly tied to overall consumer spending, which coupled together result in stronger ‘put’ structure to backstop risk assets, with fiscal stimulus continuing, and monetary backdrops becoming looser,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: From Wild West to Wall Street: Crypto is boring now because ‘we won’

Once the Wild West of finance, crypto has matured into a Wall Street fixture with regulators and ETFs. We won. That’s why crypto is boring now. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Remember when Crypto Twitter was like taking a front-row seat to the movies? Markets were a runaway rollercoaster, narratives flipped like pancakes, and every week had the energy of a new heist movie. What happened? If you’re lamenting the days of God candles and 20% BTC pumps, Nic Carter wants you to smile through the tears: crypto is boring now because we won. From major exchange collapses to China bans, Elon Musk pumps to COVID black swans, it’s been quite a ride. Jamie Dimon lambasted Bitcoin as a “fraud” and threatened to fire anyone caught trading it at JPMorgan. Now the world’s biggest banks are stacking stablecoins, and even Dimon admits, “Crypto is real. Stablecoins are real,” as JPMorgan invites clients to post BTC and ETH as collateral for loans and launches its own blockchain rails. Are all the crazy days behind us now, and crypto is boring? Is it time to seek a new asset class for our thrills? Turns out, Gandhi’s saying, “first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win,” might fit crypto better than anyone expected.​ At the heart of the vibe shift is what Nic Carter nailed in a post on X. The reason the volatility has dampened is because we won. As he states: “Crypto is boring because so many of the open questions have been answered.” Gone is the existential guessing game about whether stablecoins will be banned or if writing smart contracts will get you thrown in jail. The old school volatility, the kind that made fortunes and wiped them out by lunchtime, came straight from regulatory Russian roulette and the sense that rules might change at any moment.​ Now? The GENIUS Act pins down rules for stablecoins, the Clarity Act sets out bright lines for what is a security and what isn’t. And even the question of crypto’s marriage with TradFi is a historical footnote, not a juicy risk premium. When you live in a world where holding T-bills on-chain is business casual and BlackRock’s ETF isn’t controversial, that means dampened volatility. Which means that crypto is boring. Even as price action grinds along, what used to be wild opportunity now feels, to many, like a playground being turned into a parking lot.​ As BTC analyst Will Clemente commented: “The vibes in the crypto groupchats that I’m in are just sad honestly, people completely giving up and pivoting to other asset classes if they haven’t already.” But Carter isn’t mourning. As he sees it, regulatory clarity, Wall Street adoption, and boring stability are proof that crypto won. The whole space has matured. What was once a technological risk-fest is now a “technological substrate” adopted by the world’s biggest firms. The new game isn’t about skirting the law; it’s about building products that actually generate value in clear daylight.​ Wall Street didn’t just join the party; it put on the DJ headphones. BlackRock. JPMorgan. Even Jamie Dimon’s about-face is now crypto lore. From denier to builder, the old guard’s pivot closes the loop on a playbook that once prioritized chaos and rewarded pirates. Now, crypto is boring. TradFi’s seriousness brings real capital, real custody, and real infrastructure. The legends of the wild west are being replaced by compliance teams, pension allocators, and crash-helmeted bankers. And that’s all great… except some of us miss the outlaws.

Self-custody is under fire as wrench attacks become a real threat for crypto holders, with physical coercion and organized crime targeting those with on-chain wealth. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Welcome to Slate Sunday, CryptoSlate’s weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. Self‑custody was once the ultimate badge of credibility in crypto. A declaration of faith in sovereignty over convenience, code over blind trust, and cryptography over legal fine print. But for many of the space’s earliest and wealthiest adopters, that belief is starting to bend under a different kind of pressure: wrench attacks. In a world now flush with organized crime, doxxing, and $5 wrench attacks, even the most battle‑hardened Bitcoiners are locking away more than their coins; their ideology is going in the vault as well. A decade ago, wrench attack jokes circulated mostly in privacy forums. The meme, coined from a 2015 XKCD comic, encapsulates a brutal truth. You can’t brute‑force a passphrase, but you can threaten someone with a $5 wrench until they tell you it. OG Bitcoiner Jameson Lopp, co‑founder of Casa and maintainer of the “Physical Bitcoin Attacks” directory, has spent years documenting cases of wrench attacks where everyday crypto holders are beaten, held hostage, or worse because of their on‑chain visibility. The directory now lists more than 200 verified incidents spanning at least 34 countries. From European traders kidnapped at gunpoint to influencers targeted after posting wealth flexes online. As of October 2025, the directory records 52 wrench attacks this year alone (more than one per week), with overall physical assaults increasing 169% since February. In late October 2025, Russian influencer Sergei Domogatskii was kidnapped in Bali by masked assailants who tased and beat him, forcing him to transfer approximately $4,600 in crypto from his mobile phone to their accounts. This is part of a rising trend of wrench attacks in this region, as Lopp previously told me: “I’ve seen a number of attacks, for example, where Russian citizens who are either vacationing or living in Southeast Asia are getting hit by Russian organized crime. They’re coming into the country, wrench attacking them, and then trying to get out as quickly as possible, and presumably trying to leverage jurisdictional arbitrage.” Even veteran cypherpunks are taking notice. In a recent interview on What Bitcoin Did, on‑chain analyst Willy Woo admitted: “I’m not self‑custodying anymore… I think you’ll see a lot more people who’ve been in this space a long time doing the same.” Woo reinforced that smaller holders should absolutely keep control of their own coins, but large balances and public profiles create an entirely different threat model. It’s not about losing a hardware wallet anymore; it’s about personal safety. Many others share his view. The Bitcoin Family, known for selling everything to live off Bitcoin, told CNBC in June that they’ve abandoned single‑device wallets for a scattered analog‑digital fortress. They’ve split seed phrases and encrypted data across four continents. Family patriarch Didi Taihuttu said: “Even if someone held me at gunpoint, I can’t give them more than what’s on my wallet or my phone. And that’s not a lot.” Both Woo and Taihuttu were once among the poster children for full sovereignty. Their quiet retreat marks a broader sentiment shift (one now confirmed by the numbers). Somehow, Wall Street has managed to do what few thought possible: lure long-time Bitcoin whales into its regulated fold. According to a recent Bloomberg article, a new breed of discreet, ultra-wealthy holders is quietly offloading their cold wallets and moving billions into spot ETFs (sometimes without so much as a murmur on the blockchain). Thanks to “in-kind transfers,” these whales can dodge a taxable sale, swapping their BTC directly for ETF shares. BlackRock alone has taken in over $3 billion since July through this channel. Suddenly, what used to be a wild-west game of keys and ledgers is starting to look a lot more like traditional finance. All packaged up with a shiny ticker symbol and plenty of paperwork to go around. “This terrified me a bit,” commented Bitcoin advocate and human rights activist Alex Gladstein. For someone who’s spent his career documenting the way repressive regimes freeze assets and lock citizens out of the global financial system, watching Bitcoin drift toward mainstream financial custody feels like watching the escape hatch slowly close. Why? Because safety, reporting, and inheritance are finally trumping ideology. Srbuhi Avetisyan, research and analytics lead at Owner.One and co‑author of Penguin Analytics recently helped analyze 13,500 high‑net‑worth families across 18 countries. She shares: “At high balances, the risk isn’t blockchain failure—it’s physical coercion and OPSEC drift (lost seeds, single-point wallets). 87% of families keep incomplete asset records, and 99.4% lack a verified digital twin of their holdings. Crypto often disappears at incapacity/death—not from volatility, but from missing credentials and unclear rights.” For these families, ETFs and qualified custodians aren’t about giving in to TradFi. They’re about ensuring heirs can locate and transfer what might otherwise vanish. Still, not everyone’s ready to hand the entire stack back to banks. There’s a rising class of “hybrid” custodians building bridges between full self‑sovereignty and institutional protection. Seth for Privacy, vice president of the self‑custodial app Cake Wallet, says the wrench attacks problem doesn’t have to end self‑custody; it just forces it to evolve. He explains: “Crypto has become mainstream, and self-custody solutions have to keep up.” Beyond leveraging privacy tools, like Silent Payments and Payjoin, where possible, to keep their transactions out of public view, he believes the best protection for high‑profile individuals is to stop talking about their wealth. That was a point hammered home by Lopp, as well, who told me: “If you are on any sort of public network and you are flaunting your wealth, that’s one of the more risky things that you could be doing.” Seth points to Lopp’s company, Casa, Unchained, or some newer entrants like Nunchuk and Liana as examples of “collaborative custody.” These setups enable users to maintain control while distributing risk through multi‑signature arrangements, such as a 2‑of‑3 or 3‑of‑5 scheme, with a fiduciary or geographically separate co‑signer to remove the single point of failure. Anthony Yeung, chief commercial officer at CoinCover, also sees hybrid models as the pragmatic path forward. “Complete independence also comes with risk. If a private key is lost or compromised, the assets are often gone forever. A hybrid model addresses this by combining the best of both worlds: individuals retain direct control and ownership of their assets, while a trusted institution provides a safety net through secure backup and recovery mechanisms.” He calls this “a digital Fort Knox”: still user‑controlled, but institutionalized enough to enable secure backups, key recovery, and even inheritance triggers. Yeung adds: “They may well be the bridge that brings the next generation of users from web2 to web3.” Thomas Chen, CEO of Function and managing director at BitGo for six years, agrees, although he emphasizes personalization and risk tolerance. “I think a future for hybrid models ultimately depends on the user’s risk profile and what they’re comfortable with.” Those who self‑custody gain sovereignty but lose convenience, he says, particularly when they want to pledge assets as collateral, trade at scale, or interact with smart contracts in general. That’s not the experience that institutional investors want, and it may not be right for HNW individuals either. ETFs and custodial structures allow Bitcoin to act like a financial asset, not just a collectible. For institutions, that’s non‑negotiable. As Andrew Gibb, CEO of Twinstake institutional-grade, non-custodial staking platform, put it: “The custody landscape is shifting from the crypto-native ideal of total self-control toward models that match the risk appetite and operational rigor of institutional investors.” Fiduciary duty, in his view, forbids relying on untested personal key setups. Yet not everyone’s convinced this convenience is worth the compromise. Tony Yazbeck, co‑founder of The Bitcoin Way, offers a sharper take: “People love to overcomplicate this, but it really comes down to common sense. Some wealthy holders and institutions convince themselves they are safer putting their Bitcoin into ETFs or custodial accounts. They say it protects them from mistakes, inheritance issues, or even physical threats. In reality, it just hands control of the world’s scarcest asset to someone else and replaces ownership with paperwork.” Having lived through Lebanon’s banking collapse, Yazbeck warns that history has proven that third parties fail, exchanges collapse, governments seize assets, and custodians freeze withdrawals. His advice is refreshingly non‑technical. “The risk of losing your Bitcoin because you trusted a middleman is far higher than the risk of losing access to your own keys if you handle them properly. Multisig setups, secure backups, and simple operational discipline solve almost every real self-custody problem.” But the best defense? Once again, stop attracting attention to yourself. “Stay quiet about what you hold and live a normal life.” His mantra: protect privacy, take responsibility, and never outsource what Bitcoin was invented to make trustless. EY blockchain specialist Yaniv Sofer believes we’re witnessing a financial re‑tiering rather than an ideological rupture. He explains: “Financial institutions are accelerating their entry into digital assets use cases, and custody is a critical core capability.” While some firms buy access through third‑party providers like Fireblocks and BitGo, others build internal systems to integrate tokenization and payments. Sofer cautions: “Hybrid custody models have not yet gained significant traction among financial institutions but remain a topic of interest. Regulatory requirements for qualified custodians continue to favor centralized solutions… but hybrid models could emerge as a differentiator as the market matures.” In Avetisyan’s view, the long‑term equilibrium is clear. Most founders will run dual rails: core exposure in ETFs or qualified custody for reporting and collateralization, with a smaller self‑custody satellite for censorship resistance. This dual-rail system, she says, is already shifting how liquidity flows through the crypto economy. As more Bitcoin migrates to custodial wrappers, traditional funding markets gain depth and stability. The flip side? Sovereignty becomes optional, not default. Maybe what’s happening now isn’t so much an ideological defeat as a maturation. Bitcoin’s promise of self‑sovereignty remains intact for those who choose to uphold it. As the Bitcoin lead at Sygnum Bank, Pascal Eberle, comments: “The future of “Freedom Money” lies in choice – investors can opt for full self-custody, institutional-grade protection, or hybrid models that balance both.” Hybrid custody, institutional wrappers, and ETF liquidity are all symptoms of the same evolution: crypto crossing into the realm of structured finance. For early believers, that can feel like a betrayal, with self-custody becoming sidelined to the margins. As Yazbeck framed it: “Thinking you are safer by giving your Bitcoin to someone else is like a rich person surrounding themselves with a military convoy out of paranoia. It looks strong but it is actually weak.” Yet perhaps this is decentralization in action; a dispersion of risk, trust, and control according to every individual’s appetite. Each generation of holder must redraw its own line between freedom and fear. In 2025, that line runs straight through the vault door.

Title: How Fintech Is Redefining Retirement Planning For The Private Markets Era

ByIlona Limonta-Volkova, Contributor. Most Americans are preparing for retirement with yesterday’s tools. The rules of retirement planning are changing, but few have noticed. Financial innovation often promises greater access and equality, yet adoption rarely keeps pace with aspiration. A recent Harris Poll found that nearly 40% of Americans have never heard of private-credit funds, a class of alternative investments that Wall Street is racing to bring to 401(k)s. Only 10% say they want more nontraditional options in their retirement accounts. Yet once investors learn that most U.S. businesses generating over $100 million in annual revenue are privately held, nearly 60% say they would consider investing in them, and 90% would allocate part of their savings to private markets. It is not that Americans do not want these investments. They just do not know they exist. The disconnect between awareness and appetite points to a fundamental problem: the infrastructure to connect regular investors with private credit simply has not existed until recently. For decades, these investments remained locked behind institutional walls, accessible only to pension funds, endowments, and the ultra-wealthy. That is changing as technology platforms modernize an industry that has historically run on spreadsheets and handshakes. "Private credit shouldn’t be a black box," asserts Nelson Chu, co-founder and president of Percent, a fintech platform democratizing access to private credit markets. His company is one of several working to crack open what has long been an opaque, insider-only market. "By standardizing issuance and surfacing live order books and post-close surveillance, we've opened a historically institutional market to accredited investors with shorter durations, lower minimums, and clearer visibility into risk and cash flows." What Chu describes addresses one of the biggest obstacles to bringing these investments mainstream: transparency. Traditional private credit deals are typically opaque, illiquid, and require enormous capital commitments. Modern platforms are changing the equation by building digital infrastructure that brings efficiency and visibility to previously murky markets. This matters for a simple reason: 401(k) investors have watched their investment options narrow as the number of publicly traded companies has declined. Private markets now represent a vast universe of investment opportunities that most retirement savers cannot touch, even as their pension fund counterparts have loaded up on these assets for years. The irony is hard to miss. The investments deemed suitable for public pension funds are considered too risky or complex for the individuals those pensions serve. Earlier this year, federal agencies were mandated to ease regulations around alternative investments in retirement plans signals momentum toward broader access. Major asset managers, like Apollo and BlackRock, are already positioning themselves to capture a share of the $13 trillion 401(k) market. The race is on. Success will likely not come from regulatory approval alone. It will require building investor confidence through education and infrastructure. Companies like Percent in the U.S. and Germany's Exaloan are demonstrating that private credit can operate with the same transparency and efficiency that investors expect from their brokerage accounts. Exaloan provides data infrastructure and analytics that enable banks and asset managers to originate, assess, and monitor private debt portfolios with institutional-grade transparency. By digitizing loan-level data and standardizing reporting, platforms like these are proving that private credit can operate with the same clarity and efficiency investors expect from their brokerage accounts. "Retail investor appetite for alternative assets has accelerated dramatically," Chu explains. "We're seeing sophisticated investors, business owners, executives, professionals, actively seeking diversification beyond the 60/40 portfolio. They want assets that don't correlate with public markets, are designed to generate cash flow, and offer transparency into what they're investing in." The question is no longer whether these assets will enter 401(k) plans. It is how fast the system can catch up. The technology is in place, and investor appetite is undeniable. What remains is closing the knowledge gap and creating the transparency that builds lasting trust. This has the potential to redefine retirement planning. And for millions of Americans, that shift cannot happen fast enough.

Title: Hotels catering for families with autistic children: ‘Nobody looks or stares at you’

When Melanie* travelled abroad in July for a family holiday to Mallorca, Spain, with her six-year-old son Luke*, she found Dublin Airport stressful. Originally from Slovakia, Melanie, who works in finance, and her Irish-born husband have younger children – two-year-old twins – but Luke has profound autism and finds airports challenging. “You’re always worried there will be delays. You’re worried the plane could be sitting on the tarmacadam for three hours. If I have to keep him on a plane for five hours, he will probably walk off the plane. It’s too much,” she says. Luke has limited verbal skills and, in common with many autistic children, a tendency to abscond. “He runs away if he feels like it. One year when we were abroad we had to move chairs and luggage to block the door. The same goes for balconies.” Dining on holidays is difficult. “He’s very limited with his diet. He will eat chips or bologna sauce but the one I make because that’s the one he knows,” Melanie says. “So there’s anxiety around food because the food needs to be always the same. If it’s too much for him, he will lie down on the floor. It doesn’t matter where you are, he will just lie down. For us, it’s much easier to stay in Ireland.” For some families with autistic children, going on a break can feel harder than being at home. Lack of predictability, absence of routine and the anxieties and stress that may come with meltdowns in public settings can result in families avoiding holidays altogether. [ Why neurodivergent people are now coveted as highly skilled workers ] But as awareness has improved – it’s estimated one in 20 children in school today has an autism diagnosis – more hotels are retraining staff and improving facilities to cater to families with diverse needs. Adam Harris, of the autism charity AsIAm, which is working with hotels on training and awareness, says: “There’s an important momentum gathering. Contributing to that is our autism-friendly town initiative. Clonakilty, Maynooth, Drumcondra, Killarney and Waterford city have achieved the standard. Dublin city is working towards it. “There’s huge momentum and hotels are at the table in that regard. We’re in the process of doing accreditation with the whole iNua group,” which is Ireland’s largest regional hotel group, “so that’s exciting.” In Dublin, the Ashling Hotel on Parkgate Street, situated near the Zoo in the Phoenix Park and close to hospitals including St James’s, has 11 family rooms. Since 2023, one of these has been transformed into a sensory room, which is kitted out with mood cubes, weighted blankets, vibrating pillows and low levels of lighting. Ciara Barry of the Ashling says: “Some autistic people are sensitive to light, others to noise, others to touch. They’re able to sit down and just hug the pillow and it calms their nervous system.” Ashling staff have also received autism awareness training and the hotel endeavours to keep the same managers on rotation to welcome returning autistic children so they see a face they know. “They’re not just upgrades that we’ve done, they’re meaningful experiences for people under sometimes tough circumstances,” Barry says. The room rate (from around €260 for a family room per night) is the same as for other family rooms in the hotel, an important factor given it is estimated that it costs an additional €28,000 a year to raise an autistic child. “This isn’t something we wanted to financially benefit from. We just wanted to put something out into the community that’s needed,” she says. In developing their facilities, the Ashling took inspiration from other hotels around the country. “We were the first hotel in Dublin, but I linked up with the Pillo hotel in Meath – they were one of the first to implement a sensory bedroom – and the Radisson in Sligo have also done it,” Barry says. [ We need a more nuanced conversation about autism ] The hotel also worked with Keith O’Grady from Sensory House Ireland, which specialises in designing playrooms featuring everything from memory-foam bean bags to weighted teddy bears, lighted bubble tubes and projectors. These help to capture and regulate attention spans O’Grady says: “Ultimately you’re creating a space for calming within spaces like hotels, which can be over-stimulating, or anywhere with high footfall. We’ve done shopping centres, hospitals, the Curragh Racecourse, secondary schools like Blackrock College. “The most important things are to block out natural light and sound. People can be dysregulated by sunbeams hitting their eyes and fluorescent lighting can have the same effect. “The easiest way to explain to people is you’re trying to emulate the feeling of going into a spa. A relaxing environment with nice ambient lighting – that’s the effect you’re trying to create. You’re hopefully giving a space that they can go into, block out stimuli, and it gives them time to re-regulate themselves.” When it works, he says, families build trust with the hotels and come back time and again. “In the Ashling, people are coming back specifically to go to that hotel because they have that sensory bedroom.” It benefits all the family too, not just the autistic child, he says. “If families have a get-together, there might be only one autistic kid within the family, and it’s so they can go to that hotel, everyone can have a good time and it’s inclusive for everyone, the autistic person and not.” In Clonakilty, Co Cork, the Park Hotel and Fernhill House have evolved their offerings for neurodiverse guests. Irene O’Callaghan, of the Park, says: “We have sensory packs: the idea being that they have something to touch, something to smell and something to squeeze.” As soon as you mention that your child is autistic, it’s like ‘no problem’. Nobody looks at you or stares at you Because routine and predictability can be important, the hotel offers a picture guide of what to expect when guests are visiting for the first time. With staff trained in autism awareness, the hotel tries to anticipate issues before any arise. “During the week we had a lady whose child liked a specific kind of pancake. She told us that in advance so we were able to get them in. That really helps,” she says. In addition to family rooms, the Park has 20 apartments and six units that are fully self-catering. “We would have kids who would be flight risks,” O’Callaghan says. “In our apartments we have put additional locks on the inside, so we’ve those extra little mechanisms.” While not overtly geared towards those families, Center Parcs is a popular destination for parents with neurodiverse children – their self-catering lodges set across 400 acres in Longford Forest offer a soothing, low-stimulation environment. “I know many people say Center Parcs is very expensive, but my boy loves it,” Melanie says. “In the kitchen, I can make his meals. He learned to swim in Center Parcs because they have a slide where, to let you on, you have to be able to swim without a swimming aid. So he actually learned to swim from one side of the pool to the other so he could go down the slide. It was amazing. I never thought he would be able to swim. “There’s huge supervision there. As soon as you mention that your child is autistic, it’s like ‘no problem’. Nobody looks at you or stares at you.” For Etain*, an IT professional based in Dublin, who has four-year-old twin sons who are autistic, “the challenges come sideways at you”. Her twins were diagnosed in May, after they had started at preschool. “We just thought, ‘Oh my God, twins are complete chaos’. It took us a while to come around to the idea that our perfect little men might have been a bit different. “What we realised through that process was that we’d set up our life around the boys. Everything inside our bubble suited the boys. We had a nice routine. It was only when you went into the outside world that things got tricky.” The boys have differing needs and challenges. Noise can be a trigger: the white noise of hand-driers in public toilets or crying babies; big crowds another. When the family gets an invitation to go somewhere, Etain thinks long and hard about what’s best. “If it’s not something the boys are going to enjoy, we’re not just going to go so we have an Instagrammable photo.” She gravitates towards holiday homes in autism-friendly towns, where a minimum of 25 per cent of businesses in the town have undergone autism awareness training. “It’s definitely a plus,” she says. “It means you’re more likely to get a warm welcome from local businesses. If a child is finding a situation stressful, it means they don’t look at that child as a ‘bold child’.” When we speak, Etain is packing the car for Clonakilty for a family trip. “Clonakilty has a model railway village, which is a huge hit with our boys who love trains.” In their Airbnb, “the boys can see the sea from the garden. The garden is enclosed. I just love the freedom of them running around.” Having last visited at Easter, the twins have been excited about the upcoming trip for months. “The boys have had a 60-day countdown on the calendar on the fridge,” she says. Etain is willing to stay in a hotel with her sons, but it’s rarely her first choice. What would make a difference? “What hotels need to realise is parents don’t want to bring chaos. You’re not expecting people to roll out the red carpet, but small gestures like having quiet spaces or being accommodating if someone asks for a larger room, or getting your same table in the breakfast room – all those things make a difference. “In the La Mon outside Belfast, we get the same room every time we go. The hotel is spacious with a lovely quiet pool area and very warm, welcoming staff who remember the boys every time we visit, which is why we always go back.” Friendly staff, quiet spaces, a dedication to people’s needs: what’s not to like? Harris hopes more businesses will incorporate inclusive design and autism awareness training once they realise it’s an approach that makes sense for all. “Who doesn’t like clear communication? Who doesn’t like having predictability about what the experience is going to be like? Who doesn’t want to feel welcomed and not judged?” he says. “What is essential for an autistic family coming on holiday can actually be good for everybody.” *Some names have been changed. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: 3 Signs That Institutions Continue To Drive Crypto Adoption
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/11/01/3-signs-that-institutions-continue-to-drive-crypto-adoption/
Time Published: 2025-11-01T20:24:29Z

BySean Stein Smith, Contributor. Despite the price of bitcoin still making headlines, states issuing dollar-backed stablecoins, and payments use cases dominating the conversation, there are substantial other headlines that investors might have missed in this flurry of activity. Particularly with the end of 2025 approaching, and with that the increased importance and focus of tax-related conversations, investors and advocates need to be especially vigilant to analyze institutional developments as well as what these deployments might mean for the wider marketplace. Another reason why certain investors and advocates might have overlooked the headlines below is the renewed focus that crypto hacks and breaches have brought to bear on the weaknesses that still exist within the marketplace. Be it the Bybit hack that exposed the dangers of institutionally backed hacking efforts, the debut of the film Code Is Law that examined the elements of the crypto landscape that believe regulatory safeguards are optional, or the billions lost through less spectacular hacking attempts the focus has rightly returned to cybersecurity, risks around client data, and the lack of insurance solutions for crypto products. In short, the tail end of 2025 has had a bevy of headlines (good and bad), policy updates and developments that have the potential to obscure just how widespread institutional adoption has become. Let’s take a look at some of those, as well as what the implications might be for investors and advocates alike. According to several sources, Mastercard is in late-stage talks to acquire stablecoin infrastructure platform Zerohash for nearly $2 billion, and while this specific acquisition is not finalized as of this writing, it is indicative of how payment processing giants are prioritizing stablecoins and on-chain payments. Stablecoins have been in the spotlight recently, with a number of recent wins on the policy front as well as the deployment of stablecoin/stabletoken solutions by several major TradFi institutions. With adjusted annual volume of approximately $9 trillion, taking into account bot-based trading and other potentially artificially inflated trading activity, the sheer size of the stablecoin payment space is appealing to the payment processing space. Even as margins continue to face headwinds from a competitive and legislative point of view, stablecoins have the potential to open up an almost entirely new market for payment processors to expand. Bringing together the familiarity and security that customers have come to expect from household names such as Mastercard with the crypto-native improvements delivered via stablecoins is looking like the “killer-app” that crypto has been looking for. Another payment processing giant, Visa, is also expanding its product and service offerings focusing on stablecoin utilization and payments running on four unique blockchains. Visa CEO Ryan McInerney reiterated the firms commitment. As these new services come online, Visa will have added support for four stablecoins running on four blockchains that will be able to converted into 25 fiat currencies. This announcement expands the support that Visa already provides to other stablecoins including USDC, Euro Coin (EURC), PayPal USD (PYUSD) on multiple blockchains. According to Visa the firm has facilitated $140 billion worth of stablecoin flows since 2020, further cementing the reality that stablecoins have 1) grown rapidly in terms of institutional usage, 2) taken center stage as the “every day” crypto use case, and 3) delivers quantifiable benefits to organizations involved in the transactions. This announcement is the foundational layer for other forthcoming efforts that will allow more banks and TradFi institutions to provide stablecoin related services, including the eventual ability of banks to mint and burn native stablecoins on the Visa tokenized asset platform. Visa continues to move to integrate TradFi banking products and services with the crypto-native space, and is another example of stablecoins are leading the effort to bring crypto to the mainstream via stablecoins. The global asset management giant Blackrock has certainly made its presence known in the crypto marketplace, with its leading spot bitcoin ETF having attracted over $100 billion in assets. Additionally, a recent announcement that Securitize (a Blackrock-backed tokenization firm) will be going public via a SPAC deal valued at $1.25 billion cements. The fact that the merger will occur with an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, itself a longtime service provider to Tether and the USDT token, cements the pivot of Wall Street to the tokenized ecosystem. Since Securitize operated in the real-world-asset tokenization space, a sector that Blackrock CEO Larry Fink has forecasted could hit a size of $10 trillion, the implications of this merger are significant. Tokenization or RWA is a pivotal part of the forecasted growth of DeFi systems, DAOs, and other blockchain-based applications built for enterprise use. Given the scope and scale of support provided by both Blackrock and Cantor Fitzgerald the effect of this listing are sure to be felt across the space.

Fox News' Bill Hemmer breaks down the latest on key races to watch nationwide, including the New York City mayoral election and the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey. When New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani stepped to the microphone outside the Islamic Cultural Center of the Bronx last week near Yankee Stadium, his voice broke as he spoke about "the memory of my aunt who stopped taking the subway after Sept. 11 because she did not feel safe." Behind him, a Yemeni-American educator in sunglasses named Debbie Almontaser nodded. Almost two decades ago, in 2007, she was forced to resign as principal of a city school after defending a T-shirt with the slogan "Intifada NYC." City officials viewed it as a call to violence. She said it was benign. Her case became a rallying cry for Muslim American activists who cast her as a victim of "Islamophobia." FBI AGENTS FROM '93 WTC ATTACK BLAST MAMDANI FOR EMBRACING RADICAL IMAM Now, Almontaser was back, this time as a senior advisor to Emgage Action and a board member of Yemeni American Merchants Association Action, two of 110 political nonprofits, community groups and political action committees backing Mamdani as he alleges "Islamophobia" against him. Recently, when critics questioned Mamdani’s ties to hardline Brooklyn Imam Siraj Wahhaj, she sprang to action, helping to organize a protest to defend Wahhaj. That rapid, coordinated response captured the modus operandi of a network of political operatives and clerics intertwined with the shared mission of catapulting Mamdani into the mayor’s office. Mamdani’s background diverges from many of his co-religionists. In an interview, he said he is a Khoja Shia Muslim, part of a small, relatively liberal sect with roots in India. Many of his New York-area allies are religiously strict Sunni Muslims who practice more conservative interpretations of the faith. But they find common ground in politics. "It’s a sophisticated fusion of religion, politics and identity," said Mansour Al-Hadj, a Washington-based researcher on Muslim political movements and extremism. "The same networks that once focused on community services are now mobilizing voters and producing candidates. This is how political Islam adapts inside democracy." Mansour Al-Hadj, a Washington, D.C.,-based researcher on Muslim political movements and extremism, warns of radical forces backing Zohran Mamdani's bid to be mayor of New York City. (Mansour Al-Hadj) Mamdani’s God Squad includes about a few dozen key players who specialize in painting any critique as an attack on their faith, accusing critics of Islamophobia even as many of them have engaged in strident rhetoric against the U.S., Israel and capitalism. The Original Imam: America is "filthy and sick" Mamdani set off a firestorm Oct. 7 when he walked into Masjid At-Taqwa in Brooklyn and later posted a photo of himself beaming beside the mosque’s imam, or prayer leader, Wahhaj.

In a 1992 talk, he said American Muslims should elect an "emir" rather than choose between George Bush and Bill Clinton. Soon after, he served as a character witness in the trial of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the so-called "Blind Sheikh" convicted for plotting the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed six people. "You know what this country is?" Wahhaj said in 1995. "It’s a garbage can. Filthy. Filthy and sick." In 2018, three of Wahhaj's children were arrested after authorities found 11 malnourished children in a New Mexico compound tied to his family; a grandchild had died in what authorities described as an attempted exorcism. He told local news reporters, "Whatever they did wrong … it's not acceptable to us." The Youth Imam: Resist "by any means necessary" In New York, the Muslim American Society recently signed on to a letter to challenge "unmistakably Islamophobic, anti-Black, and xenophobic" attacks on Mamdani. Signatories included CAIR National, the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ New York chapter, Islamic Circle of North America’s New York chapter, the Islamic Center of Five Towns, Muslim American Society of New York, Muslim Community Network, Rockaway Islamic Center and a "Syosset Muslim Community." Members of the Muslim American Society have long been quick to accuse others of Islamophobia even as they unabashedly call for violence against their perceived enemies. At an Eid celebration earlier this year, a cleric at the Muslim American Society cast Muslims as victims worldwide. Mohammad Badawi, youth director at the Muslim American Society, declared the local community’s joy would only be complete when Muslims are "victorious worldwide," adding they would celebrate "after the destruction of the illegitimate Zionist occupiers," Israel. He regularly organizes anti-Israel protests in a campaign against "injustice and oppression." At one protest, Badawi urged youth to "fight back" against injustices "by any means necessary." Abdullah Akl, a charismatic organizer with the Muslim American Society Youth Center, leads many protests under the banner of "Within Our Lifetime," with founder Nerdeen Kiswani. Mamdani joined them before his run for mayor. Akl calls the street protests "sacred activism," a mix of faith and resistance that will "free Palestine." Since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, the Muslim American Society Youth Center has organized prayer protests on Wall Street outside the New York Stock Exchange and street protests for "Nakba Day," calling the day Israel was created a "catastrophe," and youth-led demonstrations outside BlackRock. Akl turned a subway car into a protest zone with chants of "Globalize the intifada… There is only one solution: intifada revolution." When the New York Police Department arrested Akl and other activists, the Council on American-Islamic Relation’s New York chapter sent out a press release demanding their release. During the Oct. 7 protests this year against Israel, Akl shouted, "We did not act enough! We will show up, stronger than we did the first Oct. 7." In response to criticism, he posted a message on social media, doubling down and saying, "Saying we didn’t act enough to stop a full blown genocide against palestinians [sic] is incitement?? Saying we need to be louder and protest more and continue to speak up for gaza [sic] is a crime? Zionist tears once again for the most documented genocide in modern history." For decades, Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has served as an aggressive and litigious watchdog for a host of Muslim figures and causes, often at the forefront of fighting legitimate bigotry. But CAIR has also courted controversy. Federal prosecutors named CAIR an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal terrorism-financing case against the Holy Land Foundation, a nonprofit based in Texas. In 2008, five Holy Land leaders were convicted of funneling $12.4 million to Hamas. Ultimately, no CAIR officials were charged in the case. Years ago, Mamdani recorded rap lyrics celebrating the "Holy Land Five," urging listeners, "My love to the Holy Land Five. You better look ‘em up." Basim Elkarra, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations California chapter and one of the founders of a new 501(c)(4) nonprofit, CAIR Action Inc., now seems to be pursuing a new and entirely legal means of financing causes, taking a page from the powerful pro-Israel political action committee AIPAC. He told a meeting of the Islamic Circle of North America, "AIPAC has had the run for 60 years, but it is over now. "We will teach these folks a lesson … we are coming." In another speech, he said, "The game has changed. AIPAC has been around since 1961…and now they have a formidable foe!" This summer, Mehdi Hasan, a former host at Qatar’s Al Jazeera TV network, sat down with Mamdani for a sympathetic interview. As the campaign heated up, Hasan became a full-time defender on social media, swatting at critics and framing Mamdani as the right kind of provocateur, a "once in a generation political talent."

(Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Crooked Media) Hasan’s own record includes sermons likening non-Muslims to "animals" and comparing gay people to "sexual deviants." He has said his views have become more progressive since then. After a series of plane crashes earlier this year, Hasan wrote on social media, "Make American Planes Crash Again." He deleted the message amid criticism and said, "I deleted this sarcastic quote-tweet because MAGA and Islamophobic folks are clipping it out of context and trying to ridiculously suggest I’m inciting violence. I was obviously mocking the MAGA slogan ‘Make America… Again’ slogan and highlighting the shocking number of plane crashes under Trump and the FAA cuts. But this tweet was in poor taste, poorly worded, and has allowed people in bad faith to call me a terrorist…" Yasir Qadhi, a high-profile American imam and founder of the AlMaghrib Institute and MuslimMatters.com, selling the puritanical Salafi interpretation of Islam, literally wrote the book on "Understanding Salafism." Recently, he posted a two-part thread on X endorsing the idea of Mamdani’s win as a "civilizational victory."

(Getty Images) He urged Muslim Americans to move beyond "naive" religious critiques of politicians who are more socially progressive than they are comfortable. Meanwhile, Qadhi once mocked European Jews as "white, crooked nose, blonde hairs" and "not a Semitic people." In the same lecture, he recommended a book, "The Hoax of the Holocaust." Most recently, he has backed the controversial Muslim housing development outside Dallas, "EPIC City." He noted in his Instagram post, "open to non-Americans as well." He touted some of its features, writing, "Islamic schools, college, masjid." Imam Khalid Latif is a popular chaplain at the Islamic Center of New York City, a $22 million project to build a hub and "our own space" on Sixth Avenue for young Muslim professionals. He endorsed Mamdani earlier this year and has been an ardent supporter. He has called him "a bearer of compassion in a time where it is far too rare."

(Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images) In 2012, Latif led a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia that included Omar Mateen, who would later murder 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the deadliest anti-LGBTQ attack in U.S. history. He has denied radicalizing Mateen, and he hasn’t faced the same type of allegations that surround other imams. After the backlash to Mamdani’s meeting with Wahhaj, he posted, "Happy birthday to my brother Zohran… Keep showing them who we are by showing them who you are." He invoked the divine to bless Mamdani’s mission, revealing the fusion of religion and politics for the Mamdani God Squad: "May your 34th year be one of clarity, courage, and closeness — to your purpose, your people, and your Creator," ending with the Arabic word for amen, "Ameen." On Monday, Latif posted a sassy video from the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, saying, "The name is Mamdani, M-a-m-d-a-n-i," with Latif mouthing the part where the narration turns to, "You should learn how to say it." That day, Latif delivered a speech to support Mamdani, pivoting to allege Mamdani was now a victim of "anti-Black racism," saying, "Anti-Muslim sentiment is always" a symbol of "anti-Black racism." In a glowing portrait, The New York Times called Palestinian American political organizer Linda Sarsour a "Brooklyn home girl in a hijab." Over almost a decade, she has been a political mentor to Mamdani, inviting him into the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, which she co-founded. She later endorsed his race for the New York General Assembly, which he won.

(Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) All the while, she has been a polarizing figure, once saying about two critics, author and ex-Muslim Ayaan Hirsi Ali and activist Brigitte Gabriel, "I wish I could take their vagina away - they don’t deserve to be women." Ali is a survivor of female genital mutilation, a practice that involves cutting the clitoris of a young girl with the idea that it will inhibit sexual promiscuity. As a co-founder of the Women’s March, Sarsour stepped down amid criticism of alleged antisemitism and not welcoming Jewish feminists who support the state of Israel, or "Zionists." At a rally on Sunday night with Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Imam Latif told 13,000 people, "This is our city. This is our moment." Some Muslims beg to differ. "It’s not our moment," said Al-Hadj. "Across the boroughs, the Mamdani God Squad is banging a drumbeat of grievance after grievance, from Staten Island to Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Long Island," he said. "Across the city’s Muslim institutions, you hear the same drumbeat: They smeared us. They silenced us. They fear us. "In that rising volume, something is lost: Muslim pluralism. The God Squad does not speak for every Muslim in New York — nor for every Shia, every Sunni, every immigrant family, or every second-generation kid trying to thread faith and freedom. It speaks for a coalition committed to illiberal ends, with socialist capture of city politics on the one hand and puritanical religious rhetoric on the other. They insist that to oppose them is to betray the community, so they actually push their own tyranny." Win or lose next week, Al-Hadj said, the Mamdani God Squad had actualized the words that had gotten Almontaser into so much trouble years ago: "Intifada NYC." Asra Q.
