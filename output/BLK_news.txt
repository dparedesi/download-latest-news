Title: AIL wrap: Clontarf produce another great escape

Clontarf have certainly mastered the art of Houdini-like escapes this season. The Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A leaders only took the lead in Terenure for the first time with the last kick of the game, which is the fifth occasion in this campaign they’ve won a match with the final play. Terenure dominated the first hour and led through Jordan Coughlan’s seventh try of the season against his former club and their Kerry-born former Glenstal and Trinity full-back Aran Egan, who converted his own try from the touchline. Leading 12-0, Terenure were held up over the line, by which point Clontarf hadn’t fired a shot. But a procession of penalties against Terenure and a failure to exit effectively led to Clontarf going to the corner several times. Their trademark power plays led to tries by hooker Dylan Donnellan (his tenth of the season), Conor Kelly and replacement hooker Barry Gray, which was awarded by the touch judge seven minutes into overtime, after a contentious penalty and yellow card against Terenure captain Luke Clohessy. Having missed his previous two, up stepped Kelly, the Division’s leading scorer, to land a difficult conversion to take his seasonal tally to 164. Terenure’s third annual charity match in aid of Childline by ISPCC and the Children’s Health Foundation raised in excess of €27,000. With a fortnight’s break before the three-game run-in, Clontarf lead the way on 56 points, with St Mary’s (563) second after they ran in ten tries in a 64-22 win away to relegation-bound Garryowen. Mark Fogarty’s hat-trick took his tally to 14. Terenure did move above Constitution on points difference on 48 points but Lansdowne, the division’s in-form team, moved to within two points of the play-offs thanks to a 28-12, bonus point win at Temple Hill before hosting Terenure next time out. Lansdowne’s aggressive defence disrupted Con and they also stole four lineouts in their own 22. Barry Fitzpatrick scored in the second minute and after Peter Sullivan finished of a good move, Con centre Sean French scored his seventh of the season. But Rob Hedderman scored against his former club before Sullivan intercepted James Taylor’s pass early in the second half to render George Good’s late try academic. Ballynahinch are alongside Lansdowne on 46 points after a 28-14 bonus point win at home to Young Munster featuring a brace of tries by Ulster winger Zac Ward. UCD’s 29-21 win over City of Armagh, Bobby Sheehan scoring his tenth of the season and one of the students’ five tries, moved them to within two points of the Ulster side in their battle to avoid a relegation play-off. Old Belvedere sealed their return to the top-flight with a 34-22 win over second-placed Nenagh Ormond at Ollie Campbell Park, their 12th in a row. Instonians took another step towards a fourth successive promotion with a 19-12 win at Navan, while Cashel (31-13 at Ballymena), Barnhall (34-33 at Greystones and Corinthians (22-17 at Greystones) maintained their pursuit of the play-offs.

The bitcoin price shot toward $90,000 per bitcoin following Trump’s post, despite not initially being named as part of the planned U.S. crypto reserve.

[+] bitcoin, Ripple's XRP, solana and cardano sharply higher. “A U.S. crypto reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration, which is why my executive order on digital assets directed the presidential working group to move forward on a crypto strategic reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA," Trump posted to his Truth Social account, referring to Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano and without mentioning bitcoin. “I will make sure the U.S. is the crypto capital of the world. We are making America great again.” In a follow up post, Trump added: “Obviously, bitcoin and ethereum, other valuable cryptocurrencies, will be the heart of the reserve. I also love bitcoin and ethereum.” 03/03 update: Bitcoin and crypto trader attention has now turned to the upcoming White House crypto summit, set for this coming Friday, in which influential crypto executives, founders and investors will meet with representatives of the president’s working group on digital assets. “The announcement comes ahead of this Friday’s crypto summit at the White House. The timing means expectations going into Friday will be for something concrete,” Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered Bank’s head of crypto research, said in emailed comments. A regulatory road map is expected, as well as more details on the crypto strategic reserve, with many analysts questioning how Donald Trump’s proposed crypto strategic reserve will work. “Yesterday’s proposal lacks details on size, timing, and whether it will be managed by the Federal Reserve or another new or existing entity,” Andrew O’Neill, digital assets managing director at S&P Global Ratings, said in emailed comments. “The Jan 23rd executive order only initiates the exploration of a digital asset reserve, with recommendations to follow.” David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar, weighed in on criticism of the crypto reserve coming from Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale who had complained of tax dollars being used to fund "crypto bro schemes," posting: “Nobody announced a tax or a spending program. Maybe you should wait to find out what’s actually being proposed," sparking speculation the U.S. strategic crypto reserve might involve holding seized assets rather than the U.S. buying more crypto to stock it. "More to come at the summit," Sacks added. “White House crypto czar David Sacks will shed more light on what is coming at the crypto summit set to take place on Friday,” Petr Kozyakov, chief executive of crypto payment infrastructure platform Mercuryo, said via email. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market—including Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano—all surged following Trump’s election victory in November, climbing as traders bet he would follow through on his campaign promises to roll back Biden-era regulatory crackdowns on crypto markets and companies. “The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government’s engagement with the crypto industry,” Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer 21Shares, said in emailed comments. In December, Trump confirmed he plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve. "We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead," Trump told CNBC. "Yes, I think so," Trump said in response to a question about whether the U.S. will create a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its oil reserve. In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.

Alongside plans to create a bitcoin reserve, Trump and his family—led by Trump’s sons Don Jr and Eric—have been expanding their businesses into the world of bitcoin, crypto and blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi). In January, Trump and his wife Melania launched twin memecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that’s traded on community interest, which both surged before crashing back. Both memecoins are now trading down more than 80% from their all-time highs. The Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform that is expected to facilitate users earning yield through stablecoins and allow them to borrow bitcoin and crypto, also began buying up various cryptocurrencies, including the ethereum-based wrapped bitcoin. Meanwhile, Trump’s social media company Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which runs the Truth Social platform and has recently announced its expanding into the world of crypto and finance, has taken steps toward launching a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)—putting on course to compete with the likes of Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity.

Title: The Man Who Would Remake Europe
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/03/germany-friedrich-merz-election-cdu/681887/
Time Published: 2025-03-02T15:48:03Z
Full Content:
Germany’s incoming leader is an unlikely force for change. Hours after his election victory last Sunday, Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany’s center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), said on national television that he would try to “achieve independence from the U.S.A. I never thought I would have to say something like this on a television program,” Merz continued, but “it is clear that the Americans … are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.” American security guarantees have protected the Federal Republic of Germany since 1945. Never since then has a chancellor of that country suggested that it emancipate itself from Washington. Not even France’s Emmanuel Macron, who has called for building a “sovereign Europe” capable of defending itself since he was first elected in 2017, could have put the imperative in starker terms. So who is the incoming German chancellor making this transformative demand? Merz is a conservative by any measure—social, fiscal, political—and far from being the avatar of a freethinking new generation in Germany, he may wind up being the last chancellor to hail from the old one. But history has plans for him. He will likely step into the highest office of Europe’s biggest economy and most powerful state just as the United States, under Donald Trump, abandons its post–World War II role on the continent. Merz, with his right-wing instincts and establishment roots, will be guiding his country, maybe even the continent, through a period of epochal change. Already, Merz has pledged to increase defense spending and put Paris, Warsaw, and London at the lead of a new policy to shore up Ukraine’s sovereignty and defend Europe from Russia with or without the United States. He has even sought to explore whether France and Britain might extend their nuclear umbrella to the rest of Europe, in place of American protection. At any other time, this agenda of European self-reliance might be a radical one. Now it’s a logical response to events. When he takes office, most likely at the end of April and at the helm of a coalition government with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), Merz will not be riding a wave of enthusiasm. The CDU won just 28.6 percent of the vote in this election—almost eight points more than the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), and the second-worst showing of the party’s history. And Merz has a personal reputation for being cocky, ambitious, and overly cerebral. He’s a politician with hard edges, and many Germans, especially women, find him hard to like. Read: Germany’s anti-extremist firewall is collapsing At 6 foot 5, the incoming chancellor literally looks down on most people he talks with. He is also a self-made multimillionaire who describes himself as “upper middle class” yet flies his own private propeller plane. He is a former artilleryman in the Bundeswehr who likes authority and orderliness, and he has a taste for cashmere V-neck sweaters and checkered shirts. Once, when a TV crew was following him for a day, he admonished an employee to brush their hair. The postwar generation to which Merz belongs has governed Germany for decades. Its men and women were raised amid the country’s immediate moral reckoning with the horrors of the Nazi Reich, and they have made this imperative central to their vision. Merz’s grandfather was a Nazi brownshirt and the mayor of Brilon, a picturesque town in the country’s west where Merz also grew up. Two generations later, Merz has watched the rise of the far-right AfD with profound concern, calling it a “disgrace for Germany.” Merz’s life in Brilon was economically comfortable but not always easy or orderly. As a child, he spent six months in a tuberculosis clinic run by nuns—an experience he has dryly described as “not nice at all.” His sister was killed in a car crash at age 21. And he was an impatient and irascible teenager who had to leave his local high school for disciplinary reasons, and whose grades were so bad that he had to repeat a year. Merz’s political career has been similarly jagged; he has probably survived more defeats than any other living German politician. A former judge, he rose to prominence as a member of Parliament in the 1990s as the standard-bearer for the conservative camp within the CDU. Yet in 2000, Merz lost a bid for party leadership to an unassuming East German named Angela Merkel. Once she became chancellor, Merkel made a point of marginalizing her most threatening rival. Merz left politics in 2009 to make money—lots of it. He joined a law firm in Düsseldorf and sat on the boards of many big corporations, including prestigious investment firms such as BlackRock Germany, of which he was chair, as well as run-of-the-mill companies such as the toilet-paper producer WEPA. Nine years would pass before he returned to politics. By then, in 2018, Merkel was engulfed in criticism for having let nearly a million refugees into Germany from the Syrian civil war. Within minutes of her announcement that she would step down from the CDU leadership, Merz had a statement ready announcing his candidacy. But the CDU didn’t choose him—at least, not at first. Twice, it picked centrists in the mold of Merkel. But the party kept losing electoral ground. Finally, in 2022, its members saw fit to give Merz a chance to revive the CDU by shifting it to the right. Read: MAGA has found a new model Merz favored a politics of law and order and a relatively hard line on immigration. He has at one point even advocated declaring a state of emergency in order to push migrants back from Germany’s borders, something European Union law would otherwise prohibit. Only weeks ago, he passed a parliamentary motion calling for placing undocumented migrants awaiting deportation in closed facilities. This proposal got through only because it won the votes of the AfD. Merz had earlier promised never to work with the far-right party. Now he told critics that if the AfD wanted to vote for his proposal, he could hardly prevent it. Some of Merz’s rhetoric around immigration sounds a lot like that of the populist right. He once called Ukrainian war refugees “social-welfare tourists”—though he later apologized for it. He has also designated the sons of migrants who fail to respect female schoolteachers “little pashas.” If all this was meant to reduce the AfD’s appeal by moving the CDU to the right, however, it was a failure. His tough talk did not prevent the AfD from capturing almost 21 percent of the vote this year—double what it got in 2021. Merz’s economic views may be the ones most starkly challenged by the geopolitical moment he finds himself in. To wrest European security from the North American framework will require new investments, new programs, and, almost inevitably, big spending. Merz brings to this task the instincts of a free marketeer impatient with government outlay and bureaucracy. In the 2000s, he promised that if he became finance minister, he’d make the income-tax form, which in Germany runs to dozens of pages, fit on a beer tap. In 2008, the year of the global financial crisis, Merz published a book arguing that Germany should cut back its welfare state, deregulate its economy, and encourage people to buy more stocks instead of letting their savings languish in bank accounts. Germany’s economy has stagnated for the past five years, and most of Merz’s solutions to that seem to come at the expense of workers or the environment: reducing unemployment benefits, creating incentives for Germans to work longer hours, and rolling back climate regulation. With the auto industry in crisis, he advocates removing the EU ban on internal-combustion-engine cars that is supposed to begin in 2035. But conservative economic orthodoxies may soon run up against other priorities, some of them every bit as close to Merz’s core. Like most German politicians of the immediate postwar generation, Merz is a Europeanist. He sees the EU not as a constraint but as a conviction. He is an ardent supporter of Ukraine, having criticized his predecessor, Olaf Scholz, for backing Kyiv too timidly and walking in lockstep with President Joe Biden instead of choosing a more assertive course with Paris and London. Scholz once marketed himself as a “peace chancellor,” to which Merz quipped: “Peace you can find in any cemetery. It is our freedom that we must defend.” Read: Is it time to bury Merkel’s legacy? Merz wants Europe to become sovereign and free of foreign interference because he believes that the new administration in Washington, like Moscow, seeks to divide and undermine democracy in Europe. The White House, like the Kremlin, seems intent on intervening in elections on behalf of the far right, and on forcing Brussels to walk back regulations on Big Tech that might curtail disinformation and hate speech. Countering this agenda, when it was only a Russian one, was well in line with conservative German values. On Sunday, the chancellor-in-waiting said: “I have absolutely no illusions about what is happening from America. Just look at the recent interventions in the German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk … the interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow.” Merz’s conservatism may be what allows him to shepherd Europe through a historic transformation. Just as the anti-communist hard-liner Richard Nixon was uniquely situated to establish American relations with the People’s Republic of China in 1972, and just as the left-wing Chancellor Gerhard Schröder was best placed to cut back Germany’s welfare state in the 2000s, Merz, with his stodgy, center-right credentials and postwar pedigree, may be just the leader to get Germans and Europeans to spend big for their emancipation from the United States.

Title: ‘Next in is Micheál Martin with a bowl of shamrock’: Irish Times readers react to Trump-Zelenskiy meeting

Time Published: 2025-03-02T14:43:15Z
Full Content:
Sir, – I have just been watching, with horror, the meeting in the Oval Office between Presidents Trump and Zelenskiy. In my opinion President Zelenskiy is a man of courage, dignity and principle. We’ve seen him standing up, unlike Macron and Starmer, to Trump’s out-of-control bullying and his sycophantic vice-president Vance telling him he wasn’t grateful enough to his host, despite the fact Zelenskiy has repeatedly thanked America for its help and support. It raises the uncomfortable question of how far countries are willing to go to placate the unhinged, so called “leader of the free world”. And what happened to the message we were always taught growing up, that we should stand up to the bully, who is a coward at heart? Trump wanted a deal that suited just himself. This, of course, involved access to Ukrainian “earth minerals” plus a cosy relationship with Vladimir Putin, who wouldn’t break any agreement with his pal Trump – despite the fact that Putin has undoubtedly broken numerous deals he has signed, and invaded Ukraine despite his promise he wouldn’t. In the Oval Office discussions, Trump shouted out over Zelenskiy, jabbing his finger continually and aggressively at him. And then both Trump and Vance hollered about Zelenskiy’s “lack of respect”. The only people showing lack of respect were Trump and Vance. Those 10 minutes of argument showed us Trump for the horrendous bully he is. And, of course, he then began asserting that all the problems of this diplomatic debacle were Zelenskiy’s fault. I wonder how Prince Charles feels now about his letter inviting the American president to Britain? And, will Micheál Martin follow the Macron and Starmer route and try a charm offensive on Trump? Maybe it’s time, in the name of democracy, to stand up and be counted. As Edmund Burke said, “All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.” In my opinion, it’s Zelenskiy who should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Yours, etc, Martha McCarron, Blackrock, Co Dublin. Sir, – It’s hard to imagine that Theodore Roosevelt ever expected the “bully pulpit” to be abused in the manner in which Trump humiliated Zelenskiy in the Oval Office and delighted Putin in front of the international press. Has the US lost its moral compass completely? Yours, etc, Philip Carroll, Celbridge, Co Kildare. Sir, – Anyone who witnessed President Trump’s imperious chastisement of President Zelenskiy must be wondering whether we should give the Taoiseach Covid before St Patrick’s Day. It is well to remember that American isolationism is not new. But this new leadership style where a Russian autocrat is encouraged at every turn and a courageous democrat such as Volodomyr Zelenskiy is chided and belittled like an errant child is no good for anyone. It was very interesting to see the dexterous way in which vice-president Vance stirred the contumelious pot. Let us pray his predatory and opportunistic politics do not prosper. For the first time in my life, I find myself agreeing with President Trump. It is time Europeans stopped depending on the United States. No one is dancing. But this is most certainly a crossroads. Ritual humiliation has no place in transatlantic relations. Yours, etc, Michael Deesy, Bandon, Co Cork. Sir, – And next in is Micheál Martin with a bowl of shamrock. Yours, etc, Thomas Morris Gormally, Rathangan, Co Kildare. Sir, – The White House is indelibly stained. The presidency is disgraced. Let us not entirely discard our values by having our Government represented there. Yours, etc, Denis Meehan, Valencia, Spain. Sir, – I definitely feel closer to Kyiv than Washington right now. Yours, etc, Joe Molloy, Oranmore, Co Galway. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: War Harvesters Bleed Ukraine for Profit

Ukrainians in particular have been duped and propagandized to support a catastrophic war that continues to bleed their country of its youth and its sovereignty. The duplicitous West and its agencies have been the architects of the entire catastrophe. Wikileaks, for example, recently revealed that 9 out of 10 media outlets in Ukraine have relied on USAID funding. Hence, Ukrainians have been drowning in Western intelligence-based messaging (1) that controls the narrative and subverts the truth in favour of certain Western-based financial interests. . . From a distance, it should have been clear that the Western-fuelled, nazi-impregnated Maidan protests and crimes which deposed the elected government of Viktor Fedorovych Yanukovych was the turning point. (2) . . From a distance, Ukrainians should have seen that Nazism and war would serve transnational capital interests and not their own interests. Prof Chossudovsky notes that, “(t)he Neoliberal Endgame for Ukraine –resulting from unsurmountable debts– largely attributable to military aid is the outright privatization of an entire country by Blackrock which is a giant portfolio company controlled by powerful financial interests with extensive leverage. Black Rock signed an agreement with President Zelensky in November 2022.” (3) RFK Junior, currently U.S Secretary of Health and Human Services, elaborated upon Black Rock and the behind-the-scenes financial interests here: Financial interests and Big Business have historically aligned themselves with Nazism and against Russia. Jacques R. Pauwels notes in Big Business and Hitler that “the branch plants of US corporations in Germany managed to realize major profits during the war,” and “these profits did not end up in the pockets of the Nazis, but ended up fattening the wallets of the owners and/or shareholders in America.” (4) Black Rock and others are the hidden villains behind this catastrophe. Those blaming Russia or Putin for the catastrophe have been diverted from the truth. As long as war lies remain ascendant, misery and blood will continue to be shed globally. And the profiteers will continue to benefit from the harvests of war. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Elon Musk is currently battling to reduce the “terrifying” $36 trillion U.S. debt through his dogecoin-inspired Doge department of government efficiency, fueling wild bitcoin adoption speculation. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price, which soared in the aftermath of president Donald Trump’s November U.S. election victory, has dropped back as fears swirl U.S. tariffs could hit the global economy—with some analysts warning a recent bitcoin price plunge could be just getting started. Now, as Musk confirms he wants to put the U.S. Treasury on bitcoin and crypto blockchain technology, the Tesla billionaire has warned those expecting to "win" through betting on so-called memecoins are being “foolish"—as a memecoin crash threatens the bitcoin price rally. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Elon Musk, who's leading the dogecoin-inspired Doge department of government efficiency, has warned ... [+] those buying memecoins shouldn't expect to "win" as a crash threatens to tank the bitcoin price. "I mean it’s sort of like if you go to the casino, if you expect to win at the casino, you’re being a fool," Musk told comedian podcaster Joe Rogan in a wide-ranging three-hour interview. Dogecoin, a tongue-in-cheek bitcoin rival that was embraced by Elon Musk, is one of the original memecoins and rocketed to an $80 billion market capitalization during the Covid-era crypto rally before crashing back. However, dogecoin managed to hold on to more of its gains than its critics expected and is currently worth around $30 billion. “If you expect to win at meme coins you’re being foolish, you’re not going to win, don’t sink your life savings into a memecoin … don’t bet the farm," Musk said. The latest memecoin market frenzy began last year, helped by the launch of platforms like Pump.fun that allow memecoins to be easily created in seconds. Memecoins such as dogwifhat, pepe, bonk and shiba inu saw their prices surge, culminating with the launch of Donald Trump-themed memecoin that was endorsed by the president. “We’ve been hypnotized by price spikes, memecoin frenzies, and media spectacles, forgetting that crypto was meant to be a new financial system—one built on decentralized protocols that make finance accessible to everyone," Dom Harz, cofounder of decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Build on Bitcoin (BOB), said via email. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen sharply, dragged down by a memecoin price crash that Elon Musk has ... [+] could cost people's "life savings." The memecoin market peaked in December last year at a combined $137 billion market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap data, before dropping sharply and then bouncing back when Trump posted about his $trump memecoin. The $trump memecoin soared to over $60 before crashing back and is now trading at under $14. “The issue isn’t just price declines—it’s the realization that insiders could accumulate large amounts early, leverage major crypto exchanges for liquidity, and then sell to retail investors at over $60 per token, only for it to trade below $16. This growing awareness may be discouraging further speculative frenzy," 10x Research founder Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note. “This shift in sentiment has significantly dampened retail speculation, reinforcing our cautious outlook. Daily meme coin launches peaked shortly after the $trump coin debut but have declined sharply. $Trump is now down -85% from its highs, trading at just $11.5, leaving retail investors again sitting on heavy losses after buying into the hype."

Title: Jamie Dimon’s woke demons won’t halt JPMorgan’s DEI

Under pressure from the Trump administration, JPMorgan is continuing to rework and reword its commitment to the controversial Diversity, Equity and Inclusion system of hiring and promotion, including possibly an overhaul of its flashy displays of DEI commitments featured on the company’s website, the Post has learned. But my guess — and the guess of people in Washington and on Wall Street following this issue — is that it won’t be enough to satisfy the courts, the public’s demands for a color-blind meritocracy and the Trump administration’s desires to roll back one of the most divisive political, cultural and business issues of our time. In many ways the nation’s largest lender is an outlier in continuing to support DEI, or the use of racial and “intersectional” (gender and genderidentity) preferences in hiring. Companies are dropping the practice because of its dubious legality following the 2023 SCOTUS ruling outlawing affirmative action in college admissions. President Trump has signed executive orders ending DEI in federal contracting, and is calling on major companies to do the same. And many are. Just this past Friday, BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager and once a major DEI adherent, said that while it loves diversity, it is “not requiring managers to interview a diverse slate of candidates for open positions.” Others have gone so far as to drop the word “equity” or guaranteed outcomes from their hiring metrics. Yet it’s unclear where exactly JPMorgan, led by mega-banker Jamie Dimon, stands on the issue. Dimon has a long history supporting DEI, and became obsessed with it in 2020 during the social-justice George Floyd riots. But a lot has changed since our “summer of love,” as the left termed those turbulent times, and Dimon has spent most of the past month of Donald Trump’s presidency attempting to spin his way out of a possible confrontation with the anti-DEI president. JPM has begun altering public filings as they relate to so-called intersectional hiring preferences at the bank. Some people at the bank tell me there will be at least a semantic weakening of the bank’s DEI commitment. On deck, my sources there say, is a revamping of the DEI section of its website, which features maybe the most florid examples of DEI worship in the business community. As it stands now, the website boasts that “58% of new US hires are racially or ethnically diverse,” and 49% of all global new hires are women. The company has had a 35% increase in “self-identifying” LBGTQ+ employees in the last year it posted data, following a 50% increase. Subscribe to our daily Business Report newsletter! Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. There are “500+” LBGTQ+ managing directors and executive directors at the bank, it adds. People at JPM say look for possible new language that softens such DEI humblebrags. It may even remove “equity” from its diversity hiring metrics, like many others already have. Yet, these semantic changes won’t satisfy the Trump White House, and the president himself, my reporting suggests. White House advisers tell me language tweaks often obscure the backdoor use of illegal hiring preferences. The president, they tell me, wants a color-blind country, and he wants corporate America’s buy-in. Too much is at stake to downgrade skill when we are in a global war for economic supremacyand freedom with China. For proof, they say, look no further than Trump’s Truth Social feed where he recently singled out Apple for JPM-like DEI worship. As Trump wrote in all caps so there was no confusion about where he stood: “APPLE SHOULD GET RID OF DEI RULES, NOT JUST MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEM,” adding that “DEI WAS A HOAX THAT HAS BEEN VERY BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. DEI IS GONE!!!” On Monday, Dimon attempted more damage control, this time with the people over at CNBC. When asked about his DEI commitment, Dimon said: “I don’t like wasted money on bureaucracy . . . obviously you have to modify your plans, but we look at our policies all the time… But if we did something wrong with DEI, we’re going to fix it. I never had a problem admitting that we did too much and we need to change something.” What that gibberish means in reality is difficult to say. A JPM spokesman later told me the bank is “still committed” to DEI. “Changing something doesn’t mean weakening” it, the flack insisted. The spokesman also said all hiring is merit-based, which again seems like a contradiction if you’re committed to DEI. Dimon’s handlers have argued in the past that JPM is a highly profitable enterprise while employing DEI, so it must account for something. True, JPM is profitable, but DEI is hardly the reason any big bank makes money. Dimon is a very good banker, but for all his skills as a manager, he runs a business protected by the federal government since the 2008 financial crisis, aka it’s Too Big To Fail. That designation allows it to borrow cheaply and lend more expensively. It almost seems like it’s able to print money even when the economy sputters. Sorry, the real reason Dimon can’t pull himself away from DEI is because he’s a progressive, and always has been. He’s slated to retire in the next few years, and might run for office as a Democrat or take a job in academia. Both are places that remain committed to racialized employment policies, which explains a lot.

Title: Athletes running abroad: why more Irish medal hopes are being driven by foreign coaches

Before the European Indoor Games grew into a proper championship event and podium places became harder to find, Irish athletes enjoyed a rare and special medal winning streak. Three golds and two bronzes, all won within four years. Beginning in 1966, Noel Carrol won his first of three successive gold medals in the 800m, the smooth-running machine from Annagassan adding another bronze in 1969. Maeve Kyle also won a 400m bronze in 1966, a decade after first blazing the trail for Irish women’s athletics at the Melbourne Olympics. Different times maybe, classy athletes nonetheless. Then in 1970 it expanded into the European Indoor Championships, later becoming a biennial event, during which time the Irish medal success became a lot more sporadic before drying up completely. Marcus O’Sullivan, for instance, won 1,500m silver in 1985, and it took another 15 years before we saw the next medal, Mark Carroll winning 3,000m gold in swashbuckling style, and James Nolan the 1,500m silver. So to Apeldoorn next weekend, where at the Omnisport arena in the centre of the Netherlands a team of 19 Irish athletes will look to restore that medal-winning streak of old, and not without considerable hope and expectation. Although there have been bigger Irish teams at this event over the years, none have boasted more medal prospects, between individuals and the relays. After coming home empty-handed in 2021 and 2023, the team this time includes four Irish athletes ranked in top three positions among the final entries, based on European indoor performances this season. Sarah Healy is ranked second in the 3,000m, Kate O’Connor second in the pentathlon, with Andrew Coscoran ranked third in the 3,000m, and likewise Mark English in the 800m. Four years after making his senior debut, Cian McPhillips has made a welcome return to form and is ranked fourth in the 800m, and Ireland’s two relay interests – the mixed 4x400m and women’s 4x400m – will both contest the straight six-team finals. No Rhasidat Adeleke this time, but there’s still ample baton experience in Sharlene Mawdsley, Phil Healy and Lauren Cadden. Sarah Lavin is ranked ninth in the 60m hurdles, and you know what they say about making the final in that event, and Cathal Doyle is fast adjusting to the banked tracks in his first professional season as a 1,500m runner. His greatest asset is his fearlessness. What also sets this Irish team apart from recent years is the fact so many are training abroad, under foreign coaches. Which is by no means a bad thing. At least not when considering the stage of their careers, where they have come from, and more importantly where they want to go. Mawdsley spoke recently about her need to shake things up after the Paris Olympics: “I’d always said I’d love to train in a professional group, because in Ireland I was very much training on my own. It was never a chore, but I knew after 2024 I would struggle a little with the motivation.” With that she’s moved away from Tipperary’s two-time Olympian Gary Ryan and linked up with London-based Tony Lester, whose group includes the Nielsen twins, Lina (who won Olympic bronze in the 400m hurdles in Paris) and Laviai (who won bronze in the 4x400m and mixed relay). English has changed his set-up too, now training under Australian coach Justin Rinaldi at the Fast 8 Track Club. A four-time European medal winner in the 800m, twice indoors and twice outdoors, English is certainly seeing the benefits of that switch, last month improving his Irish indoor record by almost a second when running 1:45.15. Also part of Rinaldi’s group, incidentally, is Josh Hoey, who last weekend improved the US record to 1:43.24, the second fastest indoor time ever. Coscoran and Doyle have also moved on since Paris, Coscoran joining the New Balance Manchester group under coach Helen Clitheroe (where Ciara Mageean was also successfully based before opting to move home this year). At 28, Coscoran last month improved the Irish indoor record to 7:30.75, and appears well capable of making the podium in Apeldoorn – although he will have Jakob Ingebrigtsen to contend with. The Norwegian hasn’t raced the distance this season but looks certain of a third successive 1,500m/3,000m double. Doyle is now coached by Jon Bigg, husband of Sally Gunnell and former training partner of Steve Ovett, whose training group is based in Brighton. Conor Kelly, only 17 and part of the mixed 4x400m relay, is coached by Paul Miller at the Hercules Wimbledon club in London. And Jodie McCann, who races the 3,000m next weekend, is working with Dutch coach Tomasz Lewandowski, along with her father Clark. Of all these, however, none have benefitted more from moving abroad than Healy, who has just turned 24 and heads to Apeldoorn in the form of her young life. Healy has now broken a record of some sort every time she’s raced this season, twice improving her own indoor 3,000m mark, plus the 1,500m mark, before twice improving the 1,500m championship record at last weekend’s National Indoor Championships. Healy won everything possible “all the way up”, as they say, including double gold at the European Under-18 Championships in 2018, all while carefully nurtured by her coach Eoghan Marnell at Blackrock AC. Then when entering the final year of her law degree in UCD, they realised the need to think outside the big-fish-in-a-small-pond scenario, and Healy moved to the husband-and-wife coaching team of Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, based in Wigan. Their group includes Keely Hodgkinson, who won the Olympic 800m gold in Paris. After joining their training camps in France and South Africa, Healy relocated full-time to Wigan in May 2023, and the move has proved transformative. There’s a confidence and consistency about her running now, which Healy attributes to being in such a competitive training group. This is no slight on the standard of Irish coaching. There’s nothing wrong with Irish athletes needing or wanting to look beyond the horizon to discover a more competitive step up, and it can sometimes lesson the pressure when it comes to winning medals.

Title: Libya Offers to Welcome Palestinian Refugees

Abdul Hamid Muhammad Al-Dubiba, the prime minister of the Government of National Unity (GNU) in Tripoli, Libya (the Libyan government that the United Nations recognizes) has told the U.S. government that Libya will take 100,000 to 200,000 refugees from Gaza. The Libyan offer is the first such proposal to receive Gazan refugees into a Muslim country that President Trump has received after announcing on Wednesday, February 5, in his press conference with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that the United States would take over Gaza, relocate the residents, and rebuild the area as a “Riviera on the Mediterranean.” This follows Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s decision to reject an open invitation to the White House for talks as long as Palestinian relocation is on President Trump’s agenda. “In Egypt, we have been warned since the beginning of the crisis that what was happening was an attempt to render the Gaza Strip uninhabitable, paving the way for the displacement of the Palestinians,” al-Sisi insisted. He added, “the displacement of the Palestinian people from their place is an injustice. We cannot condone or be a part of the unjust displacement of Palestinians.” Jordanian King Abdullah II joined al-Sisi in rejecting Trump’s proposal. Egypt has announced it will host an emergency Arab summit in Cairo on February 27 that would include “the state of Palestine.” In January, the United Nations and World Bank estimated that 72 percent of the territory’s housing, 84 percent of its health facilities, and 92 percent of its primary roads had been damaged or destroyed. Without water, sanitation, or electricity, the estimated 1.8 to 2.3 million Gazans face returning to the rubble that is today’s war-devastated Gaza without the essentials required for healthy daily living. Image: Truth screen grab. The United Nations, the European Union, and the World Bank estimate that more than $50 billion will be required to rebuild Gaza over the next 10 years, with $20 billion needed in the first three years. Francesca Albanese, a UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of Gazan human rights, has insisted that the forced removal of the residents from Gaza would constitute “mass ethnic cleansing,” reminiscent of the Nabka, the Arabic word for “catastrophe” that the United Nations uses to accept the Arab narrative to describe the exodus of people following the 1948 Arab-Israel war. Every time Israel has floated the idea of dispersing the Arab residents of Gaza, Judea, and Samaria from Israel to the surrounding countries, the Arab residents have been unwilling to go, afraid that leaving Israel would be tantamount to abandoning the idea of creating a “Palestinian state.” Obviously, the success of President Trump’s Middle East plan depends upon the willingness of various Muslim countries in the region to welcome Gazan refugees into their countries. This is a serious proposal that the Libyans are prepared to negotiate and implement. By acting quickly and responding positively, the White House can affirm that President Trump’s “out of the box” proposal has a chance of being implemented in a conflict that has remained stuck in a dysfunctional repeat pattern since the 1948 Arab-Israel war, for 75 years, three-quarters of a century. President Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. would cut foreign aid to Egypt and Jordan over their refusal to relocate Gazans is consistent with Elon Musk’s plan to end USAID as an independent agency. That threat is most likely aimed at forcing those governments to welcome refugees, rather than the Gazans themselves. “I don’t think people should be going back to Gaza,” Trump said at his February 4 meeting in the Oval Office with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “I think that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. They’ve lived like hell; they’ve lived like you’re living in hell. Gaza is not a place for people to be living. The only reason they want to go back, and I believe this strongly, is they have no alternative, they’d much rather not go back to Gaza and live in a beautiful place that’s safe.” In response to pushback from Egypt and Jordan, Trump told Fox News on February 21, “The war to do it [redevelop Gaza] is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works. But I’m not forcing it. I’m just going to sit back and recommend it.” That interview came just a day after an investment conference in Miami Beach on February 20 where Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and Steven Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, touted applying their real estate prowess to developing the Gaza with private capital. The Future Investment Initiative Institute hosted the conference, which was paid for mainly by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, a fund overseen by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and that has invested an estimated $2 billion in Kushner’s private investment firm. In 2020, Kushner played a major role in negotiating the Abraham Accords. Witkoff profited handsomely from “developing tenement buildings in Harlem and the Bronx and later iconic properties like the Woolworth Building.” Whether Kushner or Witkoff are tapped for the honor of redeveloping Gaza, there are plenty of actors in the world of BlackRock who would relish the chance to be involved. Keeping the momentum going, on February 26, Trump posted on TruthSocial.com an AI-generated video featuring “Trump Gaza” as the centerpiece of Gaza private redevelopment. Viewing Trump’s Gaza video, we are invited to enter a stretch of private land on the Mediterranean that has been developed and enriched by private capital, a project that does not require neighboring states to pony up $50 billion or more of generally very costly sovereign debt. That Libya is the first Muslim country to offer to take in the Gazans, a population that fomented trouble in those nations that previously accepted them, suggests strongly that President Trump may find the most responsive countries will be the Muslim nations across North Africa and the Middle Eastern nations more distant from Israel. Very possibly both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates might be more receptive nations than Egypt and Jordan to welcome Palestinian refugees relocated from Gaza. President Trump has a unique opportunity to break through the Middle East’s historically unsolvable problem by renewing the push to finish the implementation of the Abraham Accords that he began implementing toward the end of his first term. The only real solution in the Middle East is economic. A Muslim world that agrees to co-exist with Israel has the potential to experience long-term economic growth. The Libyan GNU government clearly aims to win favor with President Trump, seek a new election unifying the nation, and embark upon a path to economic growth. With massive oil and natural gas reserves, the United States can apply the strategy of buying oil futures from Libya (comparable to obtaining future options on Ukraine’s rare earth minerals) as an investment, rather than a give-away. By responding positively to Libya in a White House meeting with Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Muhammad Al-Dubiba, President Trump can expand on his “out of the box” suggestion that the United States “take over the management of Gaza,” creating the reality that the United States and Israel are resolved to create peace by bringing prosperity to the Muslim world in North Africa and the Middle East. Israel can police a Hamas-free Gaza without the need for U.S. troops. Our “management” of Gaza will thus involve setting the stage for private capital to accomplish a lasting peace that decades of Middle East accords have failed to achieve. Meanwhile, Libya will offer the relocated Gazans an opportunity to work and enjoy a standard of living never attained under decades of rule suffered under the grip of Hamas, a group that was never able to imagine a governing policy other “wiping Israel off the map of the Middle East. Abdul Hamid Muhammad Al-Dubiba, the prime minister of the Government of National Unity (GNU) in Tripoli, Libya (the Libyan government that the United Nations recognizes) has told the U.S. government that Libya will take 100,000 to 200,000 refugees from Gaza.

Title: Belfast juice chain says low Irish taxes and 9pc Vat rate led it to expand into Dublin

‘The rates down here are next to nothing compared to up north’ Sam Shephard started Juice Jar in 2019 A healthy food and juice chain from Northern Ireland plans to open three new stores across Dublin. Juice Jar, founded by Sam Shephard in 2019, is opening its first store in the capital on Dawson Street in an outlet next to Marco Pierre White Steakhouse and Grill later this month. The brand has six other outlets across Belfast and Bristol and will serve a health-focused array of sandwiches, fresh juices, smoothies and acai bowls. Shephard said Juice Jar had already identified a second unit in Dublin “within a stone’s throw” of its Dawson Street outlet. He is also looking at a third potential site in the Blackrock suburbs, and hopes to have all three outlets open by the year’s end. ​“In terms of why Ireland, primarily it’s from a business perspective – the fundamentals down here stack up hugely,” he said. “I could rhyme off a million reasons. You have Vat sitting at 9pc in July 2025. Up north, it’s 20pc across the board. Corporation tax is 12.5pc down here while it’s 25pc up there. "The rates down here are next to nothing compared to up north, where they’re about 40pc of your rent. Down here, it works out at about 10pc of rent. “There are a lot of plusses,” he adds. “For me, it is just the straight economics of it.” Shephard said the heart of Dublin sees six times the footfall of Belfast. The opportunity on Dawson Street was significant, he added, predicting it could potentially generate three times the sales of one store in Belfast. The Juice Jar store on Dawson Street is a 2,300sqft unit undergoing a €500,000 fit-out.

Title: BlackRock Includes IBIT Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange-Traded Fund in Model Portfolio: Report
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/03/01/blackrock-includes-ibit-bitcoin-btc-exchange-traded-fund-in-model-portfolio-report/
Time Published: 2025-03-01T19:45:59Z
Full Content:
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, has reportedly incorporated its iShares spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (IBIT) into some of its model portfolios. Bloomberg, citing a BlackRock investment outlook that its journalists had viewed, reports that the firm added a 1-2% allocation for IBIT in model portfolios that allow for alternative investments. Model portfolios are a basket of different investments crafted by a financial advisor. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, reportedly wrote in an investment commentary this week that the firm believes Bitcoin has “long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios.” In January, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that sovereign wealth funds could drive the price of Bitcoin higher if they attempt to hedge against “local fears,” such as inflation and political or economic uncertainty. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument, and so if that becomes true and you see that it could be a proper hedge against hope securities or equities, the question is, could you see it be a 2% or 5% allocation? I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that was the conversation. Should we have a 2% allocation? Should we have a 5% allocation? If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” IBIT is the largest Bitcoin ETF, with $47.89 billion worth of assets under management (AUM), according to data from Coinglass. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum (ETH) ETFs for trading in July. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Finally Snap Eight-Day $3.2B Outflow Streak With $94.3M Inflows
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/01/bitcoin-etfs-finally-snap-eight-day-usd3-2b-outflow-streak-with-usd94-3m-inflows

Full Content:
Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. saw $94.3 million of total inflows on the last day of February as crypto's worst month in three years came to an end. The figure capped an eight-day streak of outflow during which investors pulled over $3.2 billion from these funds as digital asset prices fell. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot bitcoin ETF by assets under management, was one of the outliers that saw $244.6 million in outflows on Friday. Meanwhile, other large ETFs, including Fidelity’s FBTC, brought in $176 million from investors, while the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF saw the largest inflows, bringing in $193.7 million, according to Farside Investors data. The inflows came as the cryptocurrency market started showing signs of recovery after the price of bitcoin hit a $78,000 low in the early hours of Feb. 28. Bitcoin is now trading around $84,900 after rising 1.6% in the last 24 hours, while the broader CoinDesk 20 Index rose 0.3% to 2,705. Over the past week, BTC is still down by roughly 12%, while the broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, fell by 15.8%. Spot bitcoin ETFs had been enduring a significant outflow streak since Feb. 14, a day in which these funds saw $66.2 million inflows. Spot ether ETFs, on the other hand, have maintained an ongoing outflow streak on the last day of February, with $41.9 million leaving these funds.

The cryptocurrency market is showing initial signs of recovery from its worst month in three years after the price of bitcoin (BTC) plunged to $78,000 in a week that saw the space’s total market capitalization drop by over $400 billion. The dip in prices saw the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunge to 10, a level that hadn’t been seen since the 2022 bear market. However, it has since recovered to 20 while still being in the “extreme fear” range. Bitcoin’s price has now risen more than 3% in the last 24-hour period to now trade above $84,400, while the broader CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) rose 1.5% in the same period to 2,700. Its performance is being affected by SOL dipping nearly 3% in the period, while other components are up for the day. The cryptocurrency market seemed to have caught a bid after the White House announced that U.S. President Donald Trump will host a crypto summit on March 7. Summit attendees are set to include “prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry, as well as members of the President's Working Group on Digital Assets, according to a press release. The event is the latest sign of the Trump administration’s pro-crypto policies. It comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped lawsuits against Coinbase and MetaMask developer Consensys, as well as investigations Into Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap Labs, and OpenSea. In addition, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has added a 1% to 2% allocation of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to one of its model portfolios. These models propose portfolio and rebalancing strategies that are subsequently executed by advisors and platforms. This is the first time BlackRock has decided to add IBIT to any of its models, opening up the potential for a new wave of demand for bitcoin ETFs. As of December 31, 2024, BlackRock’s model portfolios manage approximately $150 billion in assets.Read more: Bitcoin Dip-Buyers Step in Friday, but What Might Weekend Action Bring?

Title: How Open-Access Networks Boost Your Internet Provider Options

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. How we test ISPs Open-access networks bring fast fiber to cities nationwide but don’t operate like typical internet service providers. It's not Santa and his sleigh, but trucks like these bring a present of another kind: the gift of fiber connectivity. Colorful painted symbols decorate the streets a few blocks from my Albuquerque, New Mexico, home. Bright arrows and checks mark hidden water and gas lines. Large trucks with boring machines and vast spools of orange pipe are parked along the sidewalks. They’re here to install fiber for Gigapower, an open-access network. An open-access fiber network is installed by a company that then sells access to ISPs. That means you can have multiple providers offering plans for your house. When Gigapower arrives at my house, it won’t be my internet service provider. Gigapower represents a different fiber model. Here’s what home internet customers need to know about open-access networks. Locating local internet providers Chances are, your home is covered by one or more internet providers, each with its own infrastructure -- whether cable, fiber, DSL or 5G, like my T-Mobile Home Internet. Open-access networks flip this concept on its head. An open-access fiber network is installed by a company that then sells access to ISPs. That means you can have multiple providers offering plans for your house. They use the same infrastructure but may have different prices, services and bundles. Locating local internet providers Don’t be surprised if you haven’t heard about open-access networks before. “Open access is not mainstream,” says Gary Bolton, president and CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association. “It’s kind of an edge case in the US.” Bolton says the concept is more widespread in countries where regulations and government involvement mean open access is common. You’re about to hear more about open-access networks thanks to Gigapower’s ambitious plans to expand fiber into previously overlooked communities. “From an operator's perspective, it's a no-brainer because someone else bears the cost of building out the network,” says Bolton. You’ll find two types of open-access networks in the US. Municipally-owned networks are owned by cities. Private companies own commercial networks. They both work in a similar fashion, usually with multiple ISPs competing for customers. The Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (Utopia Fiber) is a community-owned fiber network covering homes in 21 Utah cities, including Brigham City, Orem, Payson and Woodland Hills. The Utopia communities weren’t satisfied with existing home internet options. They wanted fast fiber. “If the incumbent operators aren't willing to make the investment, then the community takes it in their hands because they need it for economic development,” says Bolton. Gigapower is an example of a commercial open-access network. The company is a joint venture between telecommunications giant AT&T and investment company BlackRock. In Albuquerque, AT&T Fiber is signed on as an anchor tenant, but that still leaves room for other ISPs to potentially jump on board and compete to offer fiber internet to customers. When ISPs share the same network, they want to stand out from the crowd. That can translate into a complex dance of promotions, pricing and streaming or phone bundle options. Gigapower’s rollout is still young, so we have yet to see how this might play out in the longer term, but we can look to Utopia for clues. With the Utopia model, consumers cover two fees. One is the monthly price paid to the ISP and the other is the fiber connection cost for Utopia, which typically runs $30 monthly. Put the two together to get your total. For example, you could sign up for XMission’s 1Gbps plan for $54. Adding in the Utopia fee brings your monthly total to around $85. Bolton says that’s pretty typical for gigabit pricing on an open-access network. “You start seeing there's a lot of bundling going on,” Bolton says. “Providers typically try to find other things of value that they can add to sweeten the deal.” If you’re shopping among ISPs on an open-access network, look at promotions, bundles, add-ons and the provider’s customer service reputation. Scan the Utopia providers’ pricing and you won’t see huge swings at the 250Mbps, gigabit or 2.5Gbps plan levels. But there is one area where pricing varies widely. Not all ISPs offer 10Gbps plans, but those that do have prices ranging from $110 to $200 per month. That won’t likely affect very many customers. Here’s how to figure out how much internet speed you really need. Utopia and Gigapower are two big names in open-access networks, but others exist. Colorado Springs Utilities, for example, is building out with Ting Internet as its initial anchor tenant. Other communities scattered around the country -- including Ammon, Idaho and Ashland, Oregon -- have open-access networks as well. On the commercial side, Ubiquity is expanding with a focus on Arizona, California, Nebraska and Texas. SiFi Networks specializes in citywide open-access fiber with networks under construction in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and New York. Cities that feel passed over for fast fiber broadband will continue to consider open-access networks. Meanwhile, Gigapower’s rapid expansion could bring more commercial companies into the fold. “I think it’s a great model and I wouldn’t be surprised if other people took advantage of it,” says Bolton. While gigabit speeds are common across fiber networks, most can offer faster services to homes. Utopia, for example, goes up to 10Gbps with some ISPs. AT&T Fiber typically offers up to 5Gbps. The open-access networks going in across the country can be scaled up to handle the internet demands of the future. “This is the final network for at least the next couple of generations,” says Bolton. There’s a hunger for fiber. Albuquerque has been a cable and DSL town for too long. Gigapower isn’t the only fiber player in the city. Ezee Fiber, Vexus Fiber and Quantum Fiber are all staking out parts of town with traditional networks, but Gigapower is coming in hot. I’ll notice Gigapower when it shows up on my street to install the bright orange tubes to run fiber. After that, I likely won’t give it much thought. I’ll be dealing with AT&T Fiber as my ISP, and, perhaps someday, I’ll be comparing AT&T with a competitor using the same network. Ultimately, what’s most important to me as a customer isn’t how the fiber gets here, just that it gets here. If that means ISPs competing on pricing and bundles down the line, then all the better. An open-access network is installed and operated by a company that leases access to ISPs. That means multiple providers can offer plans to customers using the same fiber network. An open-access network is one way a community overlooked for fiber can access fast, symmetrical broadband services. If private companies aren’t willing to invest, cities can use a municipal model instead. On the commercial side, open access networks remove the burden of installation and operation from ISPs, which can then piggyback on the network to reach customers. Plus, customers may benefit from competition among ISPs looking to differentiate themselves through pricing, customer service, perks or bundles. Competition among ISPs on an open-access network can benefit consumers, but don’t expect cut-rate price wars. There may be slight contrasts in pricing but more significant differences in phone and video bundles or free add-ons like streaming services. Also, look for promotional deals, like one or two months of free service for new customers.

Title: The radical left is boycotting companies abandoning leftist insanity

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/01/2025 4:55:19 AM PST by MtnClimber Today might be a great day to go shopping. If you’ve already been to Walmart, Target, or other major retailers, you might have noticed that the people there looked...well, normal. No blue hair. No nose rings. No giant holes in their earlobes. No tattoos. No “Free Palestine” t-shirts. No bearded men in dresses and heels. It might have looked strangely like shopping in 1985, at the height of Reagan’s America. If you noticed all that, it’s because you were the beneficiary of a leftist boycott of major retailers who have decided to abandon leftist extremism (DEI, BLM, LGBTQ+, CRT, and whatever other acronyms leftists love). Instead, they’ve decided to back normal Americans, rather than the anti-American, antisemitic, anti-Christian, anti-capitalist, and anti-free speech, and pro-everything weird, vile, debased, and debauched. I only know about the boycott because I saw it in the fever swamps of former high school classmates who were riding high during the Biden and Obama years, and who have hit the emotional bottom now that MAGA’s back in town. First, there was the cute bunny poster instructing people “Don’t buy stuff Friday Feb 28” because “we have power.” They were told to skip Amazon (Jeff Bezos came out in favor of free speech), Walmart (which is ostensibly abandoning DEI), Target (which actually seems to have abandoned DEI), fast food restaurants (e.g., McDonald’s has rolled back DEI), and all gas suppliers (I assume that’s because of climate change). The pierced, blue-haired, sexually confused crowd is also being told to use cash, because credit card companies are seemingly also bad. Small businesses are good, which leaves one wondering if any among the leftists understands that McDonald’s is a franchise-based outlet, making each outlet a small business, often owned by up-and-coming minorities.

Title: A cofounder shares how he pitched his startup and 'earned' his way to compete with Microsoft and Salesforce
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/watershed-taylor-francis-how-to-pitch-startup-salesforce-microsoft-compeitition-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-03-01T12:55:02Z
Full Content:
As cofounder of Watershed, an emissions data-tracking startup, Taylor Francis's job is to convince companies to spend money on reducing their carbon footprint — even in a political landscape that may be hostile to climate initiatives. Francis co-founded the software startup in 2019 with two former Stripe colleagues, Avi Itskovich and Christian Anderson, at the tail end of the first Trump administration, which aggressively scaled back climate-oriented incentives and regulations. At the time, their investor pitch was simple: There's money to be made in climate action. Six years later, with the onset of a second Trump term, Francis told Business Insider the message remains the same. "We've been here before," he said. In February 2024, the startup announced a $100 million Series C funding round at a $1.8 billion valuation. And January 2025 was Watershed's "best month ever as a business" regarding new revenue, Francis said. He did not disclose a figure. Today, Francis said his biggest competitors are Salesforce and Microsoft which also offer similar emissions-tracking services. He said his clients include 60 of the Fortune 500 companies. "I feel like that's a problem we've earned our way into recently," he said. Business Insider visited Francis at Watershed's 23,000-square-foot office in San Francisco's SoMa neighborhood, where his nearly 400 employees are encouraged to come into work. He told BI he likes to operate in an "old school" way: in person, where people can freely exchange ideas in front of a whiteboard. Francis shared how he first pitched his company to investors in 2019 and the challenges he navigates today. The interview was condensed and edited for clarity. Was it hard getting companies onboard with Watershed in 2019? Yeah, I mean, 2019 was in the first Trump administration. It seemed no one had ever done this before — getting companies to spend money on software for climate. People had spent money on consultants, they'd spent money on [carbon] offsets. And I think that the mega trend that we are both riding and trying to accelerate is that climate is getting more and more in-the-money for companies. That was the pitch at the time — there's money in pursuing climate initiatives. Honestly, the first slide of our sales deck was the same in 2019 as it is today. Literally the first slide of the sales deck. It looks better, it's been redesigned, but it still says: "Software to measure, reduce, and report your carbon emissions, because climate action is good for your business." Here's the thing, I'll say January 2025 was our best month ever as a business. What do you think is happening there? I think that we are indexed to companies doing the work on climate, not indexed to companies talking publicly about their work on climate. We see now that companies are behind the scenes. When you're an enterprise software, you kind of get to see the inside of organizations and whether they're thinking about this in a thoughtful way. The companies are going about this with more organizational seriousness now than they did three years ago. They're saying much less about it, but the executive leader who's responsible has shifted from chief sustainability officer to the chief financial officer. Who are your competitors? Microsoft and Salesforce. They have these modules. It's nice market validation that they think this is a big opportunity, but there's just a difference in product quality when it's the only thing you do. A Salesforce spokesperson told Business Insider in an email that sustainability management is "fundamentally a data challenge" that requires a unified platform. A Microsoft spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. What's the hardest thing right now? Honestly, I think it's pretty pedestrian: enterprise software challenges.How do you make it a no-brainer for companies to buy a nice piece of software rather than a module from someone they've already purchased from? How do you manage a growing team between San Francisco and London? Two years ago, Watershed was a hundred people, now it's 380 people. How do you make sure you're delivering well for companies at the scale of Walmart who have enormous expectations about this sort of thing? How many customers do you have now? I don't know that we've shared that publicly, but we have more than 500 clients now than the 5 clients we had when John Doerr [the Chair of Kleiner Perkins] joined us in 2021. What was your reaction when BlackRock — a Watershed client with $11.6 trillion in assets under management — pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Management Initiative? We work with a pretty broad set of the financial sector and I will say that they are doing the work with more seriousness today than when we started working with them. And so I think there just is this talk-action ratio thing, where a bunch of companies around the Glasgow climate conference came out with huge press releases with big bold claims and had not really figured out the data yet. Today, you see the pullback on the pledges, and companies — behind the scenes — know what they're doing. They've got the initiatives that they're prioritizing. So I think the talk-action ratio has flipped. Is it a good time for climate action in the world right now? No. Obviously the policy pendulum matters and the policy pendulum is not swinging in the right direction. But — behind the scenes with companies — I think people are doing more, even though they're talking less. Jump to

Title: ‘This Is A Big Deal’—Bitcoin Price Braces For A $150 Billion BlackRock Game-Changer

Bitcoin has bounced back after plunging under $80,000 per bitcoin, sparking fears the bitcoin price could be headed a lot lower. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has climbed back to around $85,000 per bitcoin but remains at a “critical juncture” as a perfect storm sweeps the crypto market. Now, as traders yank a record amount from bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has added bitcoin into its $150 billion model-portfolio ecosystem for the first time—described as a “big deal” by one analyst. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has led Wall Streets charge into bitcoin and crypto—pushing the ... [+] bitcoin price higher. “This is a big deal because this is the first of those models to add bitcoin,” James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Coindesk, adding, “it probably won’t be the last.” BlackRock is adding a 1% to 2% allocation to the IBIT iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in its target allocation portfolios that allow for alternatives and are aimed at investors with higher risk tolerance. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock’s $48 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), giving those holding it exposure to its near-600,000 bitcoin. “We believe bitcoin has long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios," Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, wrote this week in investment commentary seen by Bloomberg. However, Seyffart said that as bitcoin is such a divisive asset, "I don’t know if or when they would add IBIT to their primary models that have a lot more money tracking them.” Last month, Abu Dhabi’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund revealed it purchased $436 million worth of BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF during the final quarter of last year, kicking off a global adoption “race” amid calls for the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve to reduce the U.S.’s spiraling, near-$36 trillion national debt. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped sharply from its post-U.S. election peak, with traders yanking $1 ... [+] billion in just one day from a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), led by BlackRock's IBIT bitcoin ETF. The bitcoin price rebound—coming as the latest U.S. inflation data in the form of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index came in at expectations, boosting the chances the Federal Reserve will resume its planned series of interest rate cuts—has emboldened bullish traders and analysts. “With PCE aligning with expectations and inflation concerns balanced by upcoming rate cut prospects, bitcoin may finally get the catalyst it needs to break out of its current $80,000 to $85,000 range and push toward the coveted $100,ooo psychological level,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at crypto ETF issuer 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “ETF inflows continue to build momentum, institutional demand is growing, and with regulatory clarity improving, bitcoin is on the verge of another major leg up. If this breakout occurs, it could open the door for an accelerated price discovery phase, further solidifying crypto’s role in the broader macro landscape.”

Title: I went to a major bitcoin conference as a crypto skeptic. I still have doubts, but I see why buying the dip is worth the risk.

As a cryptocurrency skeptic, I arrived at the Bitcoin Investor Week conference in New York City significantly outnumbered. I was armed only with my backpack, a notepad, and an open mind. Eight hours later, I left with something else: a newfound fondness for the crypto community, and a plan to buy bitcoin for the first time in years. Like many small-time investors, I've had a love-hate relationship with crypto. I first bought $50 worth of bitcoin in June 2020 when it traded for about $9,300. That would now be worth $455 if I had held through the ups and downs. As bitcoin soared, I bought more, and I later bought some dogecoin and ethereum, inspired by memes and Elon Musk tweets. My goal was to score a solid return and to have fun. I never was a big believer, so when the crypto market imploded in late 2022, I emptied my Robinhood account for good — or so I thought. In my mind, crypto was rife with fraud and grifters like Sam Bankman-Fried and Alex Mashinsky. I interviewed Mashinsky in 2021, years before his arrest and guilty plea to fraud. He criticized the financial system and said people "couldn't explain to you what's happening, but they know that something's broken." Ironically, that's exactly how I felt when I heard Mashinsky promising massive, risk-free yields. Though I haven't covered crypto in years, I made an exception to attend Anthony Pompliano's bitcoin conference on February 27. I spoke with dozens of bitcoin fanatics, and while I'm still not drinking the orange Kool-Aid, their enthusiasm convinced me to reconsider my cynicism. I arrived at the conference ready to learn, and to take the crypto community's pulse. Bitcoin had fallen about 25% from its all-time high above $109,000, and I wanted to see whether anyone's heart had skipped a beat. A clear consensus quickly formed: bitcoiners couldn't care less about this sell-off. Throughout my conversations, bitcoin's plunging price didn't come up unless I brought it up. One man named Ryan, who's plotting a move from tech to crypto and didn't give a last name, said he obsessed over bitcoin's price moves a few years ago. Now, he said he's no longer fazed by bear markets — even though he estimated 50% to 60% of his net worth in crypto. The hot crypto job market isn't cooling either, he said. Many others are also running toward the crypto industry, even as some investors bail. They're coming from stable fields like finance, unconcerned by what many may see as a risk. Their primary goal during the conference was to network, and maybe meet the next Vitalik Buterin. Some attendees were primarily there to learn, including bright-eyed college students and retired professors. With luck, their tickets will be small investments relative to their bitcoin holdings. One enthusiastic bitcoiner was Peter Giammanco, a crypto startup cofounder who was once wary of the "libertarian types" who hawked bitcoin. The skeptic changed his tune in 2019 and is now a crypto evangelist. His parents and siblings are on board, and he hopes his cousins are next. Some of my conversations abated as speakers took the stage, where they extolled the virtues of everything from crypto mining under Trump 2.0 to bitcoin-backed life insurance policies. However, I learned most from mingling in the foyer, where I spent much of the day. On occasion, I'd ask bitcoin fanatics the questions at the root of my skepticism: What is bitcoin worth, and if there's no clear way to value it, how can I be sure that it's a worthy investment? For most of my career, I've written about stocks. Investors often disagree about what companies are worth, which is why stocks move, but everyone in markets knows equities' primary value comes from the cash they produce now, issued in the form of dividends, or their future profits. By contrast, bitcoin doesn't create anything, nor is it tangible like gold or other commodities. But that doesn't make it worthless; on the contrary, bitcoin has several clear advantages over other cryptos and even traditional fiat currencies. Bitcoin's supply is limited, unlike most cryptos and the US dollar — which has been devalued by inflation and rampant money-printing. It also runs on an ultra-secure, pseudonymous network where there's both transaction transparency and privacy since wallets aren't tied to names. I appreciate the value of bitcoin's network, especially for those without viable banking systems, and can see why its proponents see it as a crucial store of value as the dollar gets devalued. However, as I told several bitcoin gurus, it's hard for me to buy bitcoin since it can't be valued by traditional metrics. Who's to say whether it should sell for $5,000, $10,000, or $510,000? No one seemed to mind my doubts, and one attendee thanked me for making an effort to learn. The bitcoiners agreed that there's no reliable way to intrinsically value the asset, though their confidence isn't tied to a mathematical formula of fair value. Instead, bitcoin fans' bull case centers on the ECON 101 principles of supply and demand. Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million. Close to 20 million units are already in circulation, including several million that may be unrecoverable. And demand is steadily rising, including from asset management giants like Fidelity and BlackRock, which just put a bitcoin ETF in its model portfolio for the first time. Companies are also adding bitcoin to their balance sheets, even if few are going to the extremes of MicroStrategy. Crucially, the Trump administration is also enamored with crypto, and there's even been talk about building a strategic bitcoin reserve. Essentially, the thinking is that bitcoin will appreciate as supply steadily shrinks unless demand dries up. And all indications are that interest is growing, especially as major players buy in. While I'm not completely sold yet, I did fire up my Robinhood app and place a limit order for $300 worth of bitcoin at a price of $81,000. If, or when, the transaction goes through, I'll hold for at least six months so I follow our company trading policy. I had few expectations when I arrived at the bitcoin conference. But although I was an outsider who didn't own crypto or work in the industry, everyone was very kind and respectful. I can see why some seem to value the crypto community almost as much as the digital asset itself. When I left, I'm glad I consumed more than just a pair of iced lattes and happy-hour margaritas. I came away with a better knowledge of crypto and the fast-growing world that's propping it up. As for whether I left with an idea for a winning investment, I'm just keeping my fingers crossed.

Title: Feuz: Court decision hurts America’s economic growth

Full Content:
President Trump’s promises to cut taxes, reduce regulations and promote “America First” economic policies excite many who think economic growth will result. Unfortunately, that agenda could be undermined by judges who pursue politics instead of calling balls and strikes from the bench.That’s what Texas District Court Judge Reed O’Connor did when he ruled that American Airlines violated its fiduciary duty by including BlackRock-managed funds in its 401(k) plan, given the asset manager’s broader corporate engagement with environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. While many conservatives oppose ESG, this case had nothing to do with it because no such funds were involved in American’s decision. O’Connor’s ruling assumes American Airlines is guilty because it dared associate with a company that has practices O’Connor doesn’t like.This means that businesses can be penalized not just for their direct actions but for the perceived intentions or broader activities of their partners and service providers. This could lead to increased litigation risk and uncertainty for all businesses because the ruling seems to depart from legal and financial prudence, undercutting established investment practices and the ability for employers to sponsor retirement plans with the best fund choices for their employees’ needs.Furthermore, the ruling inadvertently undermines American’s workforce efforts to prepare for a financially secure retirement. The decision casts doubt on the ability to use low-cost index funds and other popular types of funds in 401(k) plans, potentially limiting the options available to plan fiduciaries in seeking the best returns for retirees. This affects not only large corporations like American Airlines but also small businesses that manage their retirement plans under the same legal principles.Looking at the macroeconomic picture, reigniting the American economy hinges on the stability and growth of business. Businesses are the backbone of our economy, responsible for employment and innovation. And 401(k)s are essential to Americans’ financial security. Yet, rulings like this could stifle their recovery and growth by creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty around investment and partnership decisions. Imagine if no one had access to a 401(k) at work because of the liability it puts on employers.The reality is that O’Connor’s ruling ignores the myriad investor protections already in federal law and regulation, including those that stem from the fiduciary duty requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Policymakers and the legal community must consider the broader economic effects of judges, regardless of their preferred politics. Conservatives should question why O’Connor put his politics ahead of a consistent, predictable regulatory environment that will unleash economic growth and opportunity.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/28/2025 8:48:19 PM PST by Kazan The European Union’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas, a legend in international diplomacy (kidding), lashed out at President Trump after Volodymyr Zelensky’s disgraceful and rude display on Friday in the Trump White House.Earlier today, ungrateful Ukrainian President Zelensky waltzed into the Trump White House and treated President Trump and the American people with total disdain.President Trump ended the talks after several minutes due to Zelensky’s rude behavior.Secretary of State Marco Rubio and NSA advisor Michael Waltz then went into the Roosevelt Room to ask Zelenskyy to leave, Rubio made it clear that any further engagements today would be counterproductive. Waltz told Zelenskyy he had made a tremendous mistake, and it was a grave disservice to Ukraine and to Americans.It is the first time a US President kicked out a world leader from the White House in recent memory.Following this horrible display, the EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas tweeted out that we need “a new leader of the free world.”Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine.We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the agressor.Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.— Kaja Kallas (@kajakallas) February 28, 2025Kaja wants the EU to take up this world leadership position – and if you disagree with her the EU will arrest you and threaten you at your home!Or, was this just a direct threat against President Trump?This isn’t the first time Kallas has attacked President Trump.RT reported:Kallas previously accused Trump of adopting “Russian narratives and talking points” about the Ukraine conflict, and expressed concern over what she described as Washington’s shift away from its longtime European allies.She also pushed back against criticisms of democracy in the EU made by Vice President Vance at the Munich Security Conference – remarks that Trump praised as “brilliant.” “I refuse to accept that criticism, because it’s just simply not true,” Kallas said.In recent weeks, Trump has made several critical statements about Ukraine’s leadership, describing Zelensky as a “dictator without elections” and suggesting that Kiev bears responsibility for allowing hostilities to escalate in 2022.

Waltz told Zelenskyy he had made a tremendous mistake, and it was a grave disservice to Ukraine and to Americans.It is the first time a US President kicked out a world leader from the White House in recent memory.Following this horrible display, the EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas tweeted out that we need “a new leader of the free world.”Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine.We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the agressor.Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.— Kaja Kallas (@kajakallas) February 28, 2025Kaja wants the EU to take up this world leadership position – and if you disagree with her the EU will arrest you and threaten you at your home!Or, was this just a direct threat against President Trump?This isn’t the first time Kallas has attacked President Trump.RT reported:Kallas previously accused Trump of adopting “Russian narratives and talking points” about the Ukraine conflict, and expressed concern over what she described as Washington’s shift away from its longtime European allies.She also pushed back against criticisms of democracy in the EU made by Vice President Vance at the Munich Security Conference – remarks that Trump praised as “brilliant.” “I refuse to accept that criticism, because it’s just simply not true,” Kallas said.In recent weeks, Trump has made several critical statements about Ukraine’s leadership, describing Zelensky as a “dictator without elections” and suggesting that Kiev bears responsibility for allowing hostilities to escalate in 2022.

Wow! A new rooster in the chicken coop! It’s about time. Americans really need to kick back and count our tax dollars for a while. An old trope from the Cold War that used to mean something. Whatever you say, Top Diplomat. Didn’t Adam Schiff post the same thing on X ? Kaja Kallas, first female Prime Minister of Estonia. She didn’t specify who that leader was going to be. Perhaps the EU could come up with a committee. What is this ‘free world’ of which they speak? Piss off weenie. Those nasty Americans almost made me cry for Ukraine. Somebody censor this turd. It’s the Euro way ya know. LOL. Europe is not part of the “Free World”. Europe has gone full NAZI. Funny if somehow when Zelensky flew back to Europe his plane somehow landed in Moscow instead of Kiev. The war would soon be over. Trump’s reaction to Zelensky has a parallel in Mario Puzo’s novel “The Godfather”. Trump’s comment that Zelensky is not a man of peace is akin to Vito Corleone saying that “nobody could do business with such a man”. Very soon the uncooperative man was no longer a problem. Raise, call, or fold. Reality hits hard after you’ve been denying it for a long time. He gave Trump the perfect excuse to pull support and do what he was mandated to do by the US people, to put America first.I have mixed feelings about pulling support, but it's absolutely unacceptable for the Euroweenies and the little fella to dictate to us when he are paying the bill.As Trump said, How long do you think this war would have lasted without US support.And how long is going to last if we pull support?As it stands it is a surrogate war between the US and Russia in which we lose no blood just treasure.If Trump wants to dictate the terms to the Ukraine so be it.The terms will be better now than if we pull support.The American people want this war ended, the Deep State, the neocons, Elite Stream Media, the Democrats and the Zeepers do not.

We’ve sacrificed far too much of it for ungrateful trash around the world. Blackrock wants it’s wheat and minerals...had to keep trump from blowing it for them.

Title: Bitcoin Crashes, But Standard Chartered Sees $200,000 In 2025
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-crash-standard-chartered-200000-in-2025/
Time Published: 2025-03-01T01:00:14Z
Full Content:
In an interview with CNBC’s Street Signs on February 27, Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered, offered insights on Bitcoin’s recent price decline and laid out a bold forecast for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Despite near-term volatility, Kendrick expects Bitcoin to reach $200,000 this year and as high as $500,000 before the end of President Trump’s term. Kendrick opened the discussion by noting the influence of political developments on investor sentiment: “So I think the Trump Administration will be positive medium term. So we came into January 20, hoping for quite a lot and you could argue there was already quite a lot of positivity priced in.” He highlighted the immediate post-inauguration shift in regulatory stance—specifically, the removal of SAB 121, which he described as having “been hampering financial institutions.” Kendrick also addressed the lack of a widely anticipated strategic Bitcoin reserve, replaced instead by a “stockpile” approach. According to Kendrick: “The stockpile for me is okay because it legitimizes other sovereigns […] both within the US [and outside]. A number of US states are considering holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet.” Still, markets have been rattled by fresh uncertainties. Kendrick pointed to ongoing trade war and geopolitical flashpoints: “Initiatives in the last couple of weeks have been very confusing for risk assets […] tariffs on and off. Canada, Mexico, EU […] obviously some potential positives coming around Ukraine and or the Middle East but nothing solid really on any of those and risk assets don’t like uncertainty.” Within the crypto sphere specifically, he cited the Bybit hack, trouble with the Solana meme coin scams, and a generally “confusing” environment as contributors to the pullback. Kendrick underscored the cascading effect on Bitcoin. When asked whether Bitcoin remains a genuine diversifier amid its correlation with equities, Kendrick maintained a nuanced view: “Certainly when we see large moves like we’ve seen in the last few weeks […] on the negative direction risk assets all trade together […] Medium-term, I think the diversification story is reasonable […] The use case for Bitcoin in particular is to diversify against risks around traditional financial markets.” Kendrick also addressed the large outflows from the spot ETFs since Trump’s inauguration: “Even in the last week, we’ve seen about $3 billion of outflows in terms of ETFs […] we got to a net position of about $40 billion of inflows over the first 12 months of those ETFs in the US […] but in the last week or so we’ve seen $3 billion of outflows.” He estimates that those who bought Bitcoin post-election in November are now “heavily underwater” to the tune of $2 billion in paper losses. This newer cohort of holders, combined with the sector’s still-robust retail participation, has amplified volatility: “It’s much more difficult for investors then to hold through losses […] when you see moves like we saw this week, you tend to get some panic selling.” He also reiterated the need for deeper institutional participation—citing banks like Standard Chartered and investment giants such as BlackRock—to improve custody solutions and reduce the frequency of such hacks like the Bybit one, leading to damaging headlines: “As the industry becomes more institutionalized it should be safer […] hopefully we get some regulatory clarity in the US too […] that should add to that medium-term top side potential which for me is Bitcoin up to $200,000 this year and $500,000 before Trump leaves office.” Looking ahead, Kendrick underscored that regulatory clarity—particularly around stablecoin rules and KYC—could trigger a wave of institutional and even sovereign capital inflows. He identified long-term public pension funds and sovereign wealth funds as pivotal market movers, referencing the Abu Dhabi Sovereign Wealth Fund’s purchase of 4,700 BTC-equivalent shares in the BlackRock ETF at the end of 2024: “There’s that very long-term sector that is still to participate more […] and then also Sovereign so the only Sovereign that we know so far has bought the ETFs is Abu Sovereign wealth fund […] I’d expect more of that to come through this year as well.” At press time, BTC traded at $81,428.

THIRTY-TWO POLITICIANS in the Dáil have declared that they rented out property or land last year. Five TDs also declared an income from contracts with the Department of Integration for housing asylum seekers or refugees or with local authorities for renting a property to someone receiving the Housing Assistance Payment. Another TD also said their spouse owned a property that had a contract with the Department of Integration. The latest edition of the Dáil register of interests, published this week, contains an updated list of TDs who are legally obliged to declare their income from land or property. Under ethics legislation, all TDs and Senators are required to declare any land or properties they own – aside from their family home – as well as any source of income over €2,600 that is derived from a source other than their political office. The information is published annually on the Dáil and Seanad registers of interest, though representatives can make retroactive additions for specific years at any time if they discover that they did not complete the annual return for a given year accurately. According to last year’s annual return, 31 TDs derived an income from being a landlord last year – as did 31 in 2023 (before additional interests were declared for that year). This year’s 32 landlord TDs include 11 deputies from Fianna Fáil, ten from Fine Gael, four from Sinn Féin, one Social Democrats TD and six independents. The TDs listed as landlords for 2024 were: Cathy Bennett (SF); Colm Burke (FF); Joanna Byrne (SF); Thomas Byrne (FF); Seán Canney (Ind); Micheál Carrigy (FG); Joe Cooney (FG); Emer Currie (FG); Pa Daly (SF); Alan Dillon (FG); Timmy Dooley (FF); Frank Feighan (FG); Sinéad Gibney (SD); Paul Gogarty (Ind); Noel Grealish (Ind); Johnny Guirke (SF); Michael Healy-Rae (Ind); Martin Heydon (FG); James Lawless (FF); Charlie McConalogue (FF); Tony McCormack (FF); Aindrias Moynihan (FF); Michael Moynihan (FF); Carol Nolan (Ind); Seán Ó Fearghaíl (FF); Peter Roche (FG); Eamon Scanlon (FF); Brendan Smith (FF); Edward Timmons (FG); Gillian Toole (Ind); Robert Troy (FF); and Barry Ward (FG). Another 29 TDs also declared that they owned land or some other property, aside from their principle residence (though in a small number of cases, this land was earmarked for a future family home). Sinn Féin’s Cathy Bennett declared herself as landlord of a rental property at Canal View in Co Monaghan – for which she received money under the Government’s Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) – and also listed ownership of a holiday home in Co Donegal. Colm Burke, a Fine Gael TD and qualified solicitor, declared rental income from his former practice’s office on Washington Street in Cork, which he lets to the Cork City Sheriff and to three other solicitors. Sinn Féin TD Joanna Byrne listed herself as landlord of a property in Pearse Park in Drogheda, Co Louth. Fianna Fáil’s Thomas Byrne declared a rental income from a property in Rossnowlagh in Donegal.

Frank Feighan, a Fine Gael TD, declared himself a landlord for ownership of a newsagents, from which he derives an income of €400 a month. Social Democrats TD Sinéad Gibney declared that she rents out a property in Blackrock, Co Dublin, though she noted that this is the only residence she owns; she says she rents her own accommodation and did not list her occupation as a landlord. Paul Gogarty, an independent TD, declared an income from part-time rental of a holiday home that he part owns in Killala, Co Mayo. Another independent TD, Noel Grealish, listed income from a house he rents in Claregalway, Co Galway, as well as ownership of an apartment in Dublin which is declared for personal use. Sinn Féin TD Johnny Guirke declared himself a landlord of two properties: one located in Oldcastle Co Meath and another located in Tuam. Independent Michael Healy-Rae, often described as the Dáil’s biggest landlord, declared himself as the owner of almost 30 properties or pieces of land, including houses he owned for rental purposes; he also declared contracts with the Department of Integration for accommodating Ukrainian refugees and a HAP contract with Kerry County Council.

Advertisement Fine Gael’s Peter Roche did not declare income as a landlord, but said he owns a two-bed cottage and farmland next to his private home (without disclosing where this is), which is rented under the HAP scheme with Galway County Council; he also declared ownership of additional farmland in Tuam. Eamon Scanlon, a Fianna Fáil TD, declared income from 5 apartments in Sligo, as well as ownership of 27 acres of farmland in Ballymote. Another Fianna Fáil TD, Brendan Smith, said he received an income from renting an apartment in Dublin. Fine Gael TD Edward Timmins also received an income from a property on Dublin’s North Circular Road, two properties in Germany, and an apartment in France; he also owns agriculatural land in Wicklow. Gillian Toole, and independent TD from Meath, declared an income from a post office and another property in Dunshaughlin, and five further properties in Navan, Lucan and Dublin 15; she also declared ownership of more land in Navan and Ratoath. Fianna Fáil’s Robert Troy declared income from eight properties in Phibsborough in Dublin, and Mullingar and Ballynacargy in Westmeath. And Fine Gael TD Barry Ward said he derives an income from an apartment at The Gasworks in Dublin 4. Another 29 TDs who did not list themselves as landlords also declared ownership of second homes or multiple pieces of land. Another newly elected TD for Fine Gael, Willie Aird, declared himself as owning land for farming near Portlaoise, Co Laois. Catherine Ardagh, a newly elected Fianna Fáil TD, declared ownership of a holiday home in Ballyshannon, Co Donegal. Fianna Fáil TD and former Dublin Lord Mayor Tom Brabazon declared a share in a former family home in Raheny, Dublin, which he also said is listed for sale. Fianna Fáil’s Housing Minister James Browne listed ownership of land in Enniscorthy, Co Wexford, which he uses as a constituency office. Fine Gael’s Peter Burke declared ownership of a house – formerly owned by his late mother – and land for farming at Clonmore near Mullingar, Co Westmeath, as well as more land for farming in Slanestown. Michael Cahill, another new Fianna Fáil TD, declared ownership of land at Rossbeigh, Co Kerry an additional vacant property in Rossbeigh and a vacant property in Killarney; he also declared his spouse’s ownership of a bed and breakfast in Rossbeigh, which is used to supply accommodation on behalf of the Department of Integration. Fine Gael TD Catherine Callaghan declared ownership of a house where her nephew lives in Kildavin, Co Carlow, from which she derives no income, and farmland also located in Kildavin. Social Protection Minister and Fianna Fáil TD Dara Calleary declared part-ownership of a former family home in Ballina, Co Mayo, though he does not derive an income from this. Independent TD Michael Collins declared ownership of a farmhouse and land for farming in Ardravinna, near Schull in Co Cork, and more land for farming at Knock and Lissacaha, also near Schull. Another Clare TD, Fianna Fáil’s Cathal Crowe declared ownership of farmland at Woodcock Hill, Meelick and Heathmont, Cratloe, including an uninhabited farmhouse at Woodcock Hill. Fianna Fáil TD Martin Daly declared ownership of a property at Sydenham Court in Ballsbridge, Dublin for family use and part-ownership of a cottage in Cleggan, Co Galway which is listed for family use. Independent Ireland TD Michael Fitzmaurice declared ownership of land for farming at Strangefort and Keelogues in Williamstown, Co Galway.

Independent TD Brian Stanley said he owns a constituency office in Portlaoise.

The world's largest asset manager is adding a 1% to 2% IBIT share to its target allotment for Target Allocation with Alternatives and the Target Allocation with Alternatives Tax-Aware portfolios, which are aimed at investors with higher risk tolerance. "Target Allocation with Alternatives models invest across a full risk spectrum, and allocate to a core allocation of stocks and bonds plus liquid alternative investments," a BlackRock spokesperson wrote in an email to Decrypt. "The addition of IBIT to these portfolios as a diversifier are in line with the investment objectives of this model, as Target Allocation with Alternatives portfolios are designed for investors with a higher risk budget and growth target." The additions affected a small part of BlackRock's Target Allocation with Alternatives portfolios, the spokesperson said. Still, the fund could spur fresh demand for the ETF. It also reflects traditional finance's widening embrace of crypto assets, stemming from markets increased demand for these products. Model portfolios offering prefabricated strategies for financial advisors have been soaring in recent years. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink had been among crypto skeptics in the past, but has since become more upbeat about Bitcoin. "It’s another step towards bringing Bitcoin into the investment mainstream," ETF.com Analyst Sumit Roy wrote in a text to Decrypt. "IBIT was already a resounding success—this move could boost demand for the fund further." IBIT, which debuted in January 2024 along with nine other Bitcoin-tracking funds (an 11th fund started trading later in the year), reached $60 million assets under management faster than any other ETF in the industry's 32-year history. It has shed more than $1 billion in assets over the past seven trading days amid a downturn in crypto markets stemming from market unrest over spikes in inflation and other macroeconomic uncertainties. The fund still holds about three times the assets under management as its largest rivals. Spot Bitcoin funds collectively have about $90 billion in AUM, even after hemorrhaging more than $2.4 billion worth over the past seven trading days. Bitcoin was recently trading above $84,000, up about 8% from an overnight low under $79,000, but well off its all-time high of over $108,000 set in mid January. It has fallen 13% during the past month. ETF.com's Roy said that demand for IBIT resulting from the model portfolio changes was unclear. "The actual incremental inflows for IBIT could be... in the millions rather than billions," Roy said. In other words, at least in the near-term, this move may be more of symbolic significance than a needle-mover on flows.

Title: AIL preview: Clontarf in the driver’s seat as they make trip to Terenure
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/02/28/ail-preview-clontarf-in-the-drivers-seat-as-they-make-trip-to-terenure/

Full Content:
Terenure host Clontarf at Lakelands Park in a reprise of the Energia All-Ireland League finals of 2022 and 2023 with the stakes as high as they’ve been for most of their 10 meetings over the past three seasons. With just four rounds remaining, Terenure sit fourth on 47 points, a point behind neighbours Clontarf and champions Cork Con, the former leading the table on 52 points. And, as is usually the case when two sides become overly familiar, there is not much love lost between this pair. The home side have been boosted by the return of Leinster academy duo outhalf Caspar Gabriel and winger Henry McErlean, while Clontarf’s influential prop Ivan Soroka has been called up by Leo Cullen for his prospective Leinster debut off the bench for their URC game against Cardiff. In what is also Terenure’s third annual charity match in aid of Childline and the Children’s Health Foundation, somewhat typical of a wildly unpredictable Division 1A, the home side won 28-10 at Castle Avenue in round four, with Jordan Coughlan in inspired form against his one-time club. Yet on a line through recent meetings with City of Armagh, a vengeful Clontarf would be strong favourites, having won 41-7 away to the Ulster side a week ago in their rearranged match in hand to return to the top of the table, while Terenure lost there a week previously. Con host Lansdowne, who like Ballynahinch sit just six points off the play-offs and remain very much in the picture, in another hugely significant clash. Lansdowne beat Con 27-10 earlier this season, albeit Con’s nine-game unbeaten run came to an end with a dramatic 15-13 loss in Clontarf a fortnight ago. Harry O’Riordan, part of Con’s AIL-winning team last season, is on the bench for Lansdowne. Bobby Sheehan reverts to hooker in a strong-looking UCD team, which also features Ben Brownlee and Ruben Moloney, sitting in the relegation play-off spot. They host City of Armagh, who are seven points above them, in a pivotal tussle in Belfield. Saturday, 2.30pm kick-off (unless stated) Men’s Division 1A: Ballynahinch v Young Munster, Ballymacarn Park; Cork Constitution v Lansdowne, Temple Hill (Live on IrishRugby+); Garryowen v St Mary’s College, Dooradoyle; Terenure College v Clontarf, Lakelands; UCD v City of Armagh, Belfield.

Asset manager BlackRock is backing away from diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies as President Donald Trump’s administration fights such initiatives. BlackRock’s leaders explained the shift and where the company is headed, Fox Business reported Friday. “‘Delivering for clients requires attracting the best people from across the world,’ BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a memo to employees Friday morning in a letter also signed by the asset management giant’s President Robert Kapito and Global Head of Human Resources Caroline Heller,” the outlet stated. The company’s leadership said they want to continue creating a culture that is open to diverse individuals and perspectives: The email goes on to discuss the recent number of “significant changes to the U.S. legal and policy environment related to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) that apply to many companies, including BlackRock.” … The top executives explained that they will not be renewing their representation goals in the workforce that expired in 2024, while pointing out that the company will continue “welcoming diverse talent” worldwide without requiring managers to interview a diverse roster of candidates for open positions. BlackRock will be merging its Talent Management and DEI teams to create a global Talent and Culture team. WATCH — President Trump Signs Multiple Executive Orders in Front of Cheering Crowd: On the BlackRock website, its careers page titled “Our Global Talent & Culture” said: We believe that maintaining a strong corporate culture is an important component of our human capital management practices and critical to our long-term success. Our culture is underpinned by five core principles that unify our workforce and guide how we interact with our employees, our clients, the communities in which we operate and our other stakeholders: (1) We are a fiduciary to our clients; (2) We are One BlackRock (1BLK); (3) We are passionate about performance; (4) We take emotional ownership; and (5) We are committed to a better future. The recent news about BlackRock comes after Trump signed an executive order telling federal agencies to look into corporate DEI programs that could possibly be in violation of civil rights laws, the Fox report said. The order that was signed on January 21 read: Illegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system. Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex. … The Federal Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws. The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination. In Wednesday’s Breitbart Business Digest, the outlet’s John Carney wrote, “A dramatic and decisive shift is sweeping through corporate America, as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives crumble in the face of legal scrutiny, economic reality, and shifting public sentiment.” “What was once considered the inevitable march of corporate progressivism is now being reversed with stunning speed,” he added. A recent survey from Cygnal found that most Americans believe government hires should be based on merit and experience, a finding that goes against DEI efforts, per Breitbart News.

Title: BlackRock adds Bitcoin exposure to model portfolio via IBIT

The asset manager allocated 1% to 2% in Bitcoin through its IBIT exchange-traded fund. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock incorporated Bitcoin (BTC) into its $150 billion model-portfolio offerings through its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF), Bloomberg News reported on Feb. 28. The asset manager has assigned 1% to 2% of its target allocation portfolios to IBIT. As of Dec. 17, the fund registered over $36 billion in net flows, amassing more inflows than any ETF launched since 2014. According to the report, Bitcoin’s inherent volatility prompted BlackRock, in a December report from the BlackRock Investment Institute, to define a 1% to 2% allocation as a “reasonable range.” The document noted that exceeding a 2% allocation could disproportionately increase the cryptocurrency’s impact on overall portfolio risk. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, stated: “We believe Bitcoin has long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios.” Additionally, Eve Cout, head of portfolio design and solutions for US Wealth at BlackRock, noted that investors want to allocate more to alternatives. Still, they need guidance on the position’s size, scale, and rebalance. The decision comes amid IBIT registering $930 million in outflows in the past four days. On Feb. 26, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF experienced its largest daily outflow, with $418 million in capital leaving the fund. Despite the recent woes, IBIT currently holds over $48 billion in assets and displays nearly $40 billion in net flows per data from Bold Report and Farside Investors. Notably, the firm doubled its Bitcoin exposure in its Global Allocation Fund last year, reporting 430,770 shares of IBIT in its third-quarter 13F Form. The amount was 117% larger than the 198,874 shares reported for the second quarter. BlackRock’s addition of Bitcoin to its model portfolio is a much-needed positive development that could boost market sentiment amid falling prices.

By Lambert Strether. Readers, the fundraiser for my very nearly gold retirement watch + all my Water Cooler work done in 2024 is complete! The goal was 400 donors; we now have 132 232 324, 402 or 33% 58% 81% 101% of goal. Thank you all so much. It means a lot, and it’s very, very helpful. –lambert Bird Song of the Day Lambert here: Readers, I really enjoyed starting each Water Cooler by finding a bird song. I enjoyed it even more when some readers suggested mimidae like catbirds, thrashers, and mockingbirds! American Robin, Hammond Hill SF, Tompkins, New York, United States. “Mobbing a Barred Owl.” From 1992! * * * In Case You Might Miss… Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * * Trump Administration Wowsers: Democrats en déshabillé Readers, I’ve been compiling a solid list of Democrat maleficence for my last Water Cooler. Please check back in an hour or so, when I’ve worked up a good head of spleen. (1) Generally I avoid this trope, because who wants copycats, but please kill me now: Democrats pick Elissa Slotkin to represent the party & respond to Trump's speech.She was the first Democrat ever endorsed by Liz Cheney; voted for the Laken Riley Act, empowering Trump to detain people without due process; and is a top Democratic voter of Trump's cabinet. More: https://t.co/72t23ghZo7 pic.twitter.com/fMXs9kSQ3v — Prem Thakker (@prem_thakker) February 27, 2025 Slotkin is, of course, a “CIA Democrat” (first listed by WSWS in 2018). I don’t know whether this is the intelligence community, given Tulsi, yanking Schumer’s chokechain, or Schumer signaling fealty, or both. “They have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.” –Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, of the Bourbons. (2) You will only pry “fighting for” from their cold, dead hands: NEWS: I’m standing with @GillibrandNY, @RepDanGoldman, @RepGarbarino, and our 9/11 heroes to reintroduce the bill to permanently fund 9/11 World Trade Center Health Program. Trump and DOGE tried to axe this program. But we're fighting for the healthcare our 9/11 heroes deserve. pic.twitter.com/hqNt81wlTu — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) February 27, 2025 So wait a minute. The health care “our 9/11 heroes deserve” but not the rest of us?

For example– (6) A centrist snoozefest: "The memo, exclusively obtained by NOTUS ahead of its release, lays out the three pillars: economic growth and opportunity, healthy and safe communities and strong national security and defense." Sounds like a good memo. https://t.co/OqMTww7vgg — Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) February 27, 2025 (7) A hoodie too far: Update: AIPAC has removed their new John Fetterman-inspired hoodie from their website. AIPAC also deleted the LinkedIn post promoting it. https://t.co/6BRzk86LbD pic.twitter.com/HUDVPg652j — Prem Thakker (@prem_thakker) February 27, 2025 (8) If you hold a primary, you don’t have to improvise a firing squad: Former Biden press secretary Karine Jean Pierre on the post-debate fall-out. “It was a firing squad…I had never seen anything like that before…that was shocking, shocking…It was truly, truly unfortunate. And I think it hurt us more than folks realized.” pic.twitter.com/GrFwP7muRo — Alex Thompson (@AlexThomp) February 27, 2025 (9) Learn to code: former DNC Chair responds to someone pointing out he was a registered lobbyist for Boeing and Lockheed by telling him to get a job pic.twitter.com/Prs3NhwzZN — Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) February 27, 2025 (10) Every so often I have hope for the labor movement but not now: Andrew Cuomo to receive labor endorsement in mayor’s race he's yet to enter https://t.co/0CvwvnyZRv — POLITICO (@politico) February 25, 2025 (11) Bernie, Bernie…. Trump berates Zelensky, the leader of a democratic country courageously fighting Russian imperialism, while he allies himself with Putin, a dictator who started the bloodiest European war in 80 years. Sorry, President Trump. We believe in democracy, not authoritarianism. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) February 28, 2025 (12) No: “Kamala,” by Kadir Nelson, would have been the cover of the November 18, 2024, issue of The New Yorker, had Kamala Harris had won the election. Read about the cover that never was: https://t.co/GlOlEFKmR8 pic.twitter.com/VaQqfPMcSm — The New Yorker (@NewYorker) January 20, 2025 And there’s more, so much more…. Syndemics Lambert here: Many readers have commented on how helpful they found the Covid section. Let my repeat my belief: Assume for now that airborne disease will be a constant going forward, by Rule #2. (Covid, measles, maybe bird flu, the usual suspects like TB, RSV, etc.) Devise your airborne protection protocol according to the Swiss Cheese Model and stick to it. Don’t be thinking all the time and adjusting your behavior, not least because there will be at least a two week lag time between the next pandemic getting rolling and you hearing about it in the news. The K.I.S.S. principle applies. Covid coverage at Naked Capitalism will continue, but neither the list of Covid resources nor the Daily Covid charts will continue; they are too complex to maintain. (For a good weekly Covid wrapup, check out the Threat Model blog with Violet Blue.) I was especially pleased and proud of the collective responsibility readers took on for each other by aggregating and then maintaining the Covid Resources listings, immediately below. If some kind reader with a blog wants me to send them the HTML code, so they can carry on the work, send me mail. Finally, I was not “HEARD” as Garrison was, very sadly. I feel that I did help out readers, and I did inspire part of a lawsuit against HICPAC’s Inspector General. Five years of charts, and the only conclusion is that anybody who tells you that Covid has gone away is deluded or shamelessly lying…. “I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD.” –William Lloyd Garrison * * * Covid Resources, United States (National): Transmission (CDC); Wastewater (CDC, Biobot; includes many counties; Wastewater Scan, includes drilldown by zip); Variants (CDC; Walgreens); “Iowa COVID-19 Tracker” (in IA, but national data). “Infection Control, Emergency Management, Safety, and General Thoughts” (especially on hospitalization by city).

Zeitgeist Watch “What conservative women know − and liberals don’t − about happiness” [USA Today]. “One of the weirdest reactions I saw after President Donald Trump was reelected in November involved videos on social media of young liberal women in hysterics over the results of our democratic process. Some even vowed to shave their heads and swear off having sex with men. I don’t remember losing my mind when Joe Biden was elected president in 2020. I was disappointed, but angry and depressed? No. Turns out, there’s data behind this phenomenon. New research shows that young conservative women are much happier than liberal women. The findings are about far more than political ideology. They demonstrate fundamental differences between Republicans and Democrats. According to the 2024 American Family Survey, liberal women ages 18-40 are far less likely than conservative women to say they are happy. Only 12% of liberal women said they are “completely satisfied” with life compared with 37% of conservative women. Self-described moderates also are happier than liberals, with 28% agreeing that they are fully satisfied with life. Grant Bailey, a research associate of the Institute for Family Studies, and Brad Wilcox, a senior fellow at the institute, investigated “how marriage, churchgoing, and loneliness help to account for the happiness gap between liberal and conservative women.” Bailey and Wilcox make a strong case that conservative women are happier because they make different life choices. They are more likely to get married, have babies and embrace a strong faith − all things that make them feel less lonely. And people who don’t feel lonely are more likely to be happy.” • Hmm. “A History of Violence” [BookForum]. The deck: “On Gisèle Pelicot, Virginie Despentes, and post-#MeToo narratives” And: “It goes without saying that victims of sexual violence experience victimization individually. But the abiding cultural formulations of rape as unspeakable—a private and singular tragedy for which words will not suffice—serve mainly to shore up stigma and secrecy surrounding these violations, leaving rape a kind of insoluble fog saturating life under patriarchy. As a physical trauma, at least, rape is a delineable event: it happens in a particular time and place; specific, divisible bodies are involved; and presumably, at some point, the incident concludes. Either you live or you die. Your rapists are held to account or they are not. (Mostly they are not.) While the psychic aftershocks of rape are murkier, it’s nonetheless experientially intelligible; trauma does not categorically defy utterance, as is frequently insinuated or proclaimed. If narrative is at times an ill-fitting container for grief, the alternative—silence—is unthinkable.” The Screening Room Clip suggested by a reader (take a bow in comments): “Good. Great!” Political Ecomedy Clarke and Dawe, suggested by a reader: Musical Interlude Heavy beats– Apparently the first reggae song, c. 1965 (though perhaps not the first version): And another bassline.

News of the Wired “Violence alters human genes for generations, researchers discover” (press release) [University of Florida]. “In 1982, the Syrian government besieged the city of Hama, killing tens of thousands of its own citizens in sectarian violence. Four decades later, rebels used the memory of the massacre to help inspire the toppling of the Assad family that had overseen the operation. But there is another lasting effect of the attack, hidden deep in the genes of Syrian families. The grandchildren of women who were pregnant during the siege — grandchildren who never experienced such violence themselves — nonetheless bear marks of it in their genomes. Passed down through their mothers, this genetic imprint offers the first human evidence of a phenomenon previously documented only in animals: The genetic transmission of stress across multiple generations. ‘The idea that trauma and violence can have repercussions into future generations should help people be more empathetic, help policymakers pay more attention to the problem of violence,’ said Connie Mulligan, Ph.D., a professor of Anthropology and the Genetics Institute at the University of Florida and senior author of the new study. ‘It could even help explain some of the seemingly unbreakable intergenerational cycles of abuse and poverty and trauma that we see around the world, including in the U.S.’ While our genes are not changed by life experiences, they can be tuned through a system known as epigenetics. In response to stress or other events, our cells can add small chemical flags to genes that may quiet them down or alter their behavior. These changes may help us adapt to stressful environments, although the effects aren’t well understood. It is these tell-tale chemical flags that Mulligan and her team were looking for in the genes of Syrian families. While lab experiments have shown that animals can pass along epigenetic signatures of stress to future generations, proving the same in people has been nearly impossible.” • Will Jean-Baptiste Lamarck please pick up the white courtesy phone?

Grant Bailey, a research associate of the Institute for Family Studies, and Brad Wilcox, a senior fellow at the institute, investigated “how marriage, churchgoing, and loneliness help to account for the happiness gap between liberal and conservative women.” Bailey and Wilcox make a strong case that conservative women are happier because they make different life choices. They are more likely to get married, have babies and embrace a strong faith − all things that make them feel less lonely. And people who don’t feel lonely are more likely to be happy.” • Hmm. “A History of Violence” [BookForum]. The deck: “On Gisèle Pelicot, Virginie Despentes, and post-#MeToo narratives” And: “It goes without saying that victims of sexual violence experience victimization individually. But the abiding cultural formulations of rape as unspeakable—a private and singular tragedy for which words will not suffice—serve mainly to shore up stigma and secrecy surrounding these violations, leaving rape a kind of insoluble fog saturating life under patriarchy. As a physical trauma, at least, rape is a delineable event: it happens in a particular time and place; specific, divisible bodies are involved; and presumably, at some point, the incident concludes. Either you live or you die. Your rapists are held to account or they are not. (Mostly they are not.) While the psychic aftershocks of rape are murkier, it’s nonetheless experientially intelligible; trauma does not categorically defy utterance, as is frequently insinuated or proclaimed. If narrative is at times an ill-fitting container for grief, the alternative—silence—is unthinkable.” The Screening Room Clip suggested by a reader (take a bow in comments): “Good.

News of the Wired “Violence alters human genes for generations, researchers discover” (press release) [University of Florida]. “In 1982, the Syrian government besieged the city of Hama, killing tens of thousands of its own citizens in sectarian violence. Four decades later, rebels used the memory of the massacre to help inspire the toppling of the Assad family that had overseen the operation. But there is another lasting effect of the attack, hidden deep in the genes of Syrian families. The grandchildren of women who were pregnant during the siege — grandchildren who never experienced such violence themselves — nonetheless bear marks of it in their genomes. Passed down through their mothers, this genetic imprint offers the first human evidence of a phenomenon previously documented only in animals: The genetic transmission of stress across multiple generations. ‘The idea that trauma and violence can have repercussions into future generations should help people be more empathetic, help policymakers pay more attention to the problem of violence,’ said Connie Mulligan, Ph.D., a professor of Anthropology and the Genetics Institute at the University of Florida and senior author of the new study. ‘It could even help explain some of the seemingly unbreakable intergenerational cycles of abuse and poverty and trauma that we see around the world, including in the U.S.’ While our genes are not changed by life experiences, they can be tuned through a system known as epigenetics. In response to stress or other events, our cells can add small chemical flags to genes that may quiet them down or alter their behavior. These changes may help us adapt to stressful environments, although the effects aren’t well understood. It is these tell-tale chemical flags that Mulligan and her team were looking for in the genes of Syrian families. While lab experiments have shown that animals can pass along epigenetic signatures of stress to future generations, proving the same in people has been nearly impossible.” • Will Jean-Baptiste Lamarck please pick up the white courtesy phone?

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. I feel like that English personage who delighted in a leisurely read through the entire Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and then asked, “Is there no more Gibbon?” There are always more Gibbons.

For your viewing pleasure (or maybe not): BREAKING: Trump KICKS Zelensky OUT After INSANE Shouting Match https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjnNbvPIEOI Well, at least much less is happening behind closed doors without the public knowing about it. That’s progress… I just posted this below too. My initial thoughts are Zelensky was high on something, his own supply and maybe coke too. I can’t imagine walking into a meeting like that and arguing in that venue unless your senses were clouded by drugs. This may be the best gift for Trump though. He has a good excuse to back out of any future agreements with Ukraine. I guess we’ll see if he takes that opportunity or not. Cocaine is a helluva drug! see Z’s fidgeting, nose tweaking, agitation….Z was tweaking. Citation: and having partaked (a bit) and being around it in my early 20’s, lol And I bet (tea-totalling) Trump’s been around tweakers a lot too over the decades, and knows the signs from across the room. And likely doubly offended at Z’s imbibing. Zelensky has gotten accustomed to many of his pleas and convincing appeals to US government leadership ( Biden, Blinken, Sullivan, etc…) that the new bosses are for real, and just not in the BAU mode of operations… No longer is it Business as Usual, or standard procedure to have your refill of countless millions and billions. Reminding me of a hard tack in foreign policy approach, not necessarily a bad shift. We got problems closer to home, fighting a never ending overseas conflict or even just merely playing the role of Big Daddy War money I believe has, or had already, begun to grate on American citizens. Trump can be a blunt tool in such affairs and in his negotiating tactics. No kidding. The image of Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova with her head in her hands pretty much sums up how this went. I can picture Joe Biden, watching that video while sitting in a nursing home in a wheel chair like Hector Salamanca from “Breaking Bad.” Spittle and foam forming at his mouth, while he watches his entire legacy go down the drain. Unable to speak due to a stroke. https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Hector_Salamanca That was a very funny comment! It is a funny comment. But the blackest of black comedy given the half-million-plus human lives flushed down the toilet in this incredibly stupid war. “Ding ding ding ding ding ding” Actually the Dems are probably very happy about this – now they can say “Ukraine would have won the war if WE were in power! Trump lost the war!!” And the fully propagandized public will buy it. IF Israel, just as Ukraine, requires US security guarantees and US weapons and US funds to pay it’s bureaucracy and guarantee it’s bonds to survive -and Ukraine must sign a resource extraction and infrastructure collateralization deal with the US to protect US Taxpayers’ interests to secure those security guarantees and weapons and funds; WHY is there no commensurate commitment demanded of Israel? If he (Biden) even remembers much about being president. Depends of the state of his decline, probably. The transcript is above. Vance escalated the conflict? Oof Laura, that’s a shallow slant, but anyway, yo Lambert, good on ya in all your metamorphoses! You’ve tangibly contributed to the self-education of many, myself included. May the last song from our admired ‘Combat Rock’ serve as the soundtrack of my tribute. Ginsberg may be passé, but this cut-up rug really tied that room together. https://youtu.be/GTLMgAuTNOI?si=UFuIVk0r42XCslE- wow. just wow. I’ve not seen anything like it. watching the “Rest is politics” live stream on it now. Alastair campbell reminding us that Trump is a not serious reality tv person. Interested in just two things, ratings and conflict. more evidence of the clown show in the oval office. Does the video of that encounter make you think Trump isn’t a serious person? He looks like Churchill next to Zelensky in that affair. I hope I don’t stray outside the guidelines after the latest comment ban. Going to be careful with my response. I can look at the video of that encounter with the sound off. What I see are 3 primates in a power display. The body language is not collaborative or healthy at all. Crossed arms from Zelenksy. (defensive), finger pointing from Trump and Vance (aggression). It’s a conflict situation. One of the primates is in good physical condition , the other two look ready for a long winter, one old, one young. the young is subservient to the old. Now if we replace 3 primates with “2 presidents and one vice president” then I expect very different behaviour. I would not expect such a nakedly obvious animal interaction. More type 2 thinking vs type 1 please. Lastly the comment at the end of “this will make great TV”. As a way to try and close out the encounter at the end? This trivializes one of the important political situations of our time. Unserious. This is going to go down very badly over here. people will be incredulous at the encounter. Staff will be working overtime on damage limitation. Curious why you draw the comparison with Churchill? (and as a Brit I know Churchill was very much of his time with his own problems) hazelbee; I can look at the video of that encounter with the sound off. What I see are 3 primates in a power display. What else would you expect? What else was all of this ever, from the start, but primate power competitions? Is it, maybe, actually better that the proles can see that that’s what the reality always has been? Indeed, however inelegant you may find Trump – and I too am a Brit, who after decades in the US is back in London to watch the equivalent of what I fully expect may be the equivalent of the Yeltsin years for the US — isn’t hearing Trump and Vance articulate out loud the actual stakes of what Zelensky is trying to get them to do, which is to have the US underwrite the continuance of this conflict on his terms rather than make peace, slightly refreshing? Each to their own taste, of course. But you say that this was ‘unserious.’ I, on the other hand, don’t like Trump and Vance, and liked Biden, Obama, Clinton, etcetera, even less, but I liked this. Because this was the truth. nice observation. and of course we—US, UK, the West—put Z in this position to begin with. Talk about a bait and switch… No, Zelensky and his Ukrainian backers put Zelensky in this position. I realize that this conflict was managed by grifters and ideological US bureaucrats wanting a proxy war with their real target, but none of them went to Zelensky and told the popular comic actor to run for his country’s Presidency. But even being a clueless entertainment figure, the precarious situation the country was in had to be clear to him before he did this. He ran knowing that the US was pulling the strings, actually ran on policy counter to what his administration did, and was the appropriate front man for the grifters in his country with the West. He may have gotten more than he expected. (It wouldn’t surprise me that he was deluded about what Russia could do as our ever failing foreign policy strategists were.) But once again he chose to jettison a successful career for this. I feel for many Ukrainians. I do not feel for Zelensky or the remaining Ukrainian legislature, or most of its top military, especially the Azov brigade. Not that most of the American government (and top Europeans) are any better. And while not keeping up the pretense that Ukraine as anything but lost in this is refreshing, throwing more money at it because of a ‘deal’ that Zelensky has no real legal right to make doesn’t make doesn’t give the latest home team any points either in my book. Consistent with earlier theory that Trump will take the minerals deal, reportedly inked by the Rada already, and work it with the Russians, Zelensky is boxed out and his authority hasn’t been reinforced or made significant. I have to wonder if this isn’t still kayfabe, because Zelensky’s defiance and expulsion will buy him some credibility with the Banderites who have guns to his head. Maybe he will make it to France. Strange for me to say so but in all fairness to Zelensky the guy is probably a mental train wreck right now. He has just signed his entire country over to the US for who knows how many generations and he knows full well that if it had not been for the US this war would never have even happened – and now the US is going to walk away with everything. Vance and Trump talk a lot about respect but I have noticed that for them the respect goes only one way. First Zelensky and Ukraine were slapped by the left hand of imperialism, and now they (and particularly Zelensky) have been slapped by the right hand of imperialism. The Archie slap from Guy Ritchie’s RocknRolla. More relevant than you might imagine. Rev Kev: (Zelensky) knows full well that if it had not been for the US this war would never have even happened – and now the US is going to walk away with everything. Sure. But when any country’s elites have actively sought to get into bed with Langley and indeed with DC, generally — after no less a personage than Henry Kissinger explained the score decades ago (recite after me, children: to be an enemy of the US is dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal) — that country’s elites are not wholesome, upstanding, and respectable. They are deeply corrupt. How did those thirty-plus US biolabs in Ukraine ringing Russian borders get there, for example? With the active connivance of Ukraine’s elites. And so on. Furthermore, the US is not going to “walk away with everything.” After this, the US’s credibility is almost certainly so deeply tarnished that even, for instance, the quisling elites in Europe are going to have a hard time selling out to it. Good. No. The minerals deal has not been signed. I think Z knew what he was doing going into this: putting on a show for the Europols, use their hatred of Trump to get them to put together a security guarantee without the USA. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/02/24/nuclear-armed-ukraine/ or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtY4MpoOQ1s How a nuclear-armed Ukraine could become ‘Europe’s Israel’ “On the third anniversary of the Russian invasion, Ukraine faces a dilemma over how to defend itself…….” I have not read the article or watched the youtube…. the thought of a nuclear armed Zelenski is repugnant to me ……… This project of, Ukraine as Europe’s Israel, sums up, imo, much of the last eleven years in the Ukraine. The Trump-Zelensky dust up is very welcome news imo. The Israel model pops up from time to time in the writings of the foreign policy think tank crowd. They want to do the same with the Kurds, too. These maniacs love Israel precisely for the exact reasons we hate the whole damned failed project. They want to recreate it throughout the world. Best wishes! Thanks for all the content! From the bottom of my heart, I thank you Lambert. I have learned from and been entertained by you for many years now. I will miss your posts and all the wit, intelligence, insight, critical commentary, snark and plain good writing they have encompassed. It does not surprise me at all that so many writers are required to fill those yellow waders of yours. I wish you all the best in retirement and your new endeavours. Farewell, may you live in peace. Intelligence, wit, good cheer, those have been Lambert’s trademarks. We will miss him, certainly. Thanks for everything, Lambert. Bon voyage! Fair winds and following seas, Lambert.

What conservative women know − and liberals don’t − about happiness | Opinion The pursuit of happiness − a right outlined in the Declaration of Independence − can mean a lot of things. In 1776, the right to follow one’s own path toward happiness was foundational to liberty. Now, happiness is all that Americans want to pursue. And much of our culture is geared toward individual happiness in the moment Happiness is not meaning. The pursuit of happiness can make people perpetually miserable, because happiness depends on external circumstances – things you can’t control. Pursue contentment and meaning, which you can control, and accept happiness whenever it finds you. yeah, Nietzsche’s “define yer own good” is a hard row. i built a village, and now theres nobody here but me and my lunatic mom. so i had to modify the Good that i am still moving towards… now…well… my boys will need a refugia…. in the coming darkness. so this infrastructure remains important. > this infrastructure remains important 100% in agreement. i hung a 12′ sign on the side of my shop, right after we moved back out here: all i want for christmas is the means of production. one of many aphorisms and statements i sequestered on walls and among bushes so that my kids and their friends would notice them, and ask questions…leading to discussion and discourse. Amfortas, ever heard of Armand Schulthess? Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne CH: https://www.artbrut.ch/en_GB/author/schulthess-armand “He embarked on the task of laying out his 18,000 m2 property with a network of paths, bridges, stairways and ladders. From the trees, by means of wire, he hung hundreds of metal plaques made from the tops or bases of food tins, which he coated with paint and inscribed with messages. The texts, written in five languages, combine knowledge relating to geology, astrology, psychoanalysis, literature and music, among other subjects.” For years I hung on to a house much too big for me, occasionally renting rooms. Then my long gone son moved back in, worked locally, got married and had two kids that now all live with me. Yeah, based on my good fortune, I’d say keep the infrastructure both within and without in good working order. I have heard that in college that liberal girls tend to hook up with conservative guys more than liberal guys. Make of that what you will. The oft quoted part of Robert Frost’s Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening won’t quit my mind. In it’s entirety: Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; He will not see me stopping here To watch his woods fill up with snow. My little horse must think it queer To stop without a farmhouse near Between the woods and frozen lake The darkest evening of the year. He gives his harness bells a shake To ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound’s the sweep Of easy wind and downy flake. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. Perhaps one snowy evening we all will meet again. Bon voyage.

Also, it’s been 3 years (Jan 2022) since I last asked, so as we enter Pandemic year 6 I’m again looking for TV show recommendations; I’m currently rewatching all of Stargate SG1 (I never watched the last 2 seasons) and Stargate Atlantis (never saw the last 3 seasons). That might keep me busy until Oct-Nov, but then I’m out of ideas again. Thanks! Stargate Universe is prolly my favorite scifi show of all time. and do check out the Expanse, on amazon….they still have sounds in space(lol), but get a whole lot of the other stuff right(Flip and Burn, for one) and if you havent enjoyed frelling Farscape..get thee there!…and suspend all disbelief, because its worth it. and i recently enjoyed a big chunk of star wars…Andor to the end. andor and rogue one are pretty gritty by disney standards. ive read about a treatment of Asimov’s Foundation…with Lee Pace, but didnt want yet another subscription,lol. and the recent Dune movies…as well as the Sisterhood series on whichever network that was…were pretty good. lots better, save for fandom weirdos like me…than the David Lynch, etc versions of pretty much the same material(Herbert is hard to translate to film) and if you like procedural crime show that aint law and order svu…look to scandinavia, and daneland, and germania… from the latter, Dark was excellent. on netflix, last i looked. Expanse was great, last season weak sauce. Farscape best sci-fi I’ve seen. Your library could probably get you copies of the Inspector Morse, and later Inspector Lewis series. I sometimes find them up on Youtube. They are excellent watching and I have the full Inspector Morse series here at home. No big gun battles, no helicopter chases, no major explosions – just thoughtful character development and great stories based on the books set in an England that we do not see much. Same with Inspector Lewis too with the same values. Thank you, Lambert, for everything, and thanks to everyone who sent the many plantidotes over the years. We have enjoyed them every day and saved many to continue to enjoy in the future. It’s lovely to have Desert Dog’s tree as the final installment. Best wishes Lambert! And, a link for you to consider on your way out the door. This is the Breaking Points highlights of the absolutely wild press conference with Zelensky, Trump, and Vance. I think our boy Z may have killed any hope of future support from the US. But who knows? Trump does what Trump wants to do. However, I don’t think that there is any way Trump can support Ukraine after Zelensky’s outburst today. From the transcript 1) Nobody mentions Maidan, how odd. 2) No, Trump is not strong on detail but he has a firm grasp of the essentials. 3) The end, where Trump clearly visualizes Putin as, with him, a victim of Democrat calumnies — could Trump actually be showing empathy here???? — is awkward 4) Was Vance playing “Let’s you and him fight”? Obama was mentioned by Trump a few times at one point, but I couldn’t figure out the context. Was this a roundabout reference to Maiden? As for Vance, I bet he was hoping for an excuse to raise it to fisticuffs. There is nothing but upside to kicking VZ’s butt on tv. “As for Vance, I bet he was hoping for an excuse to raise it to fisticuffs. There is nothing but upside to kicking VZ’s butt on tv.” Fight, fight, fight!!!! (would have been so funny – and god, I’m disgusting) Z left without signing a critical minerals deal. So maybe it turns out to be a way to ease out of that after all the hoopla. > Z left without signing a critical minerals deal. That’s a damn shame. LOL How I will miss you, Lambert. All the best of luck to you, always! Is Z’s doctor a CIA “asset,” and running a similar game to what Dr. Theodor Morell was doing for the Brown Hair Satan of years gone bye? See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Morell Z is just learning the lesson that all of America’s “Strategic Partners” learn eventually; with friends like the US, who needs enemies? This is also the perfect set up for a “Stabbed in the Back” myth for the Kiev regime. After the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia of the Nineteen Teens, Paris was flooded with “displaced” Russian ‘nobility’ and middle classes. Will Paris soon be seeing the birth of a vibrant Ukraine Exile culture and community? shit. i knew i should have jumped on that boat to Paris, mite near forty years ago,lol. would have still been Paris, back then…smoking assholes yammering philosophical gibberish on little streetside tables. Lol, that yammering a-hole could be me! Come on down to the Mermaid cafe And I will buy you a bottle of wine We will laugh and toast to nothing And smash our empty glasses down. Let’s have a round for these freaks and these soldiers A round for these friends of mine Let’s have another round for the bright red devil That keeps me in this tourist town…, Carey Joni Mitchell I’m sure it will hardly surprise you or anyone else here at NC to learn that the Daily Kos staff take is completely opposite: Zelenskyy shows true leadership as Trump implodes in Oval Office meltdown Talk about living in an alternate reality… P.S.: Once more, from me along with everyone else here, profound thanks for all you have done and best wishes for the future! https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/world/asia/14minerals.html US identifies vast riches of minerals in afghanistan June 14, 2010, Fifteen years ago. “The United States has discovered nearly $1 trillion in untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan, far beyond any previously known reserves and enough to fundamentally alter the Afghan economy and perhaps the Afghan war itself, according to senior American government officials. (!!, OMG!) The previously unknown deposits — including huge veins of iron, copper, cobalt, gold and critical industrial metals like lithium — are so big and include so many minerals that are essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could eventually be transformed into one of the most important mining centers in the world, the United States officials believe. An internal Pentagon memo, for example, states that Afghanistan could become the “Saudi Arabia of lithium,” a key raw material in the manufacture of batteries for laptops and BlackBerrys.” Ukraine’s $500 billion rare earths scam: they don’t exist, and we should know better “Inside China Business” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tILXLxMTmgA&t=623s “Reports that Ukraine will pledge its vast reserves of rare earth metals and other strategic minerals in exchange for hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loan forgiveness and additional aid have supply chain managers perplexed. No honest assessment of Ukraine’s mineral assets comes anywhere close to the numbers that top government officials claim. The US Geological Survey, and even publications from Ukraine’s ministries report only trace amounts of rare earth metals anywhere in the country. Even were we only to consider non-rare earths, other problems become apparent. Many of those reserves are in Russian hands, and much of the rest can not be commercially mined at current market prices. The situation in Ukraine is alarmingly similar to Afghanistan, where Pentagon assessments of Afghan mineral reserves dramatically overstated their actual size and market value, while giving war planners additional time and resources to prosecute what was ultimately a losing war effort.” i watched the whole thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_YtXWVfkJE remarkable is too soft a word. ive never seen anything like it. zelensky is under the bus and vance is next president Thanks for the link. At about 9 minutes into the video, Trump repeatedly refers to what sounds like “raw” earth instead of rare earths. Is that what you heard? Wow, reading that transcript seems almost surreal. I wonder if Vance’s presence was to position him in the thick of things now, for a presidential run in ’28. Regardless of what people think of the theater of it all (and those opinions will fall along all the predictable lines) — I suspect the substance of the position Trump and Vance have staked out will prove quite popular with the public. Swiss Vance now? Vraiment? Je ne le pense pas. Non, je ne le pense pas du tout. I think both Trump and Vance appropriated finger wagging from the Dems. Also, this was hysterically funny to watch! Reminded me of Trump’s having an on-camera meeting with Schumer and Pelosi during his first term. They were terrified and it was my pleasure to watch. My question is if it was intended to go this way. From Vance and Trump that is. Typically these world leader press conferences are scripted. Here instead you have Vance right of the bat pushing Zelensky’s buttons. Zelensky hits back, Vance accuses him of being disrespectful to Trump. “You come here, on the day of my daugther’s wedding…” Sorry, wrong script. Anyway it goes on until Trump gets out the steel chair and tells Zelensky not to tell him what he will feel. Zelensky starts to backtrack and Trump goes in for the kill “We are trying to save you, come with me if you want to live…” Sorry, wrong script again. I just don’t see why they would have set this up like this otherwise. You don’t have a frank discussion in front of the media, you just don’t. Wonder what the Ukrainians were told would be going down. I’m sure this was intended, and I’d bet the real audience was not Z, but American voters and the agencies. Just watched the video. How richly enjoyable. I took in about the first 10 minutes and then skipped ahead. I wanted to see the blowup but I also wanted to see it in context so I scrolled to about 35 minutes. And then sat through a seemingly interminable and ignorant harangue by Zelensky, who came across as thoroughly detestable. By the time Vance interjects, it comes as a relief. https://www.france24.com/fr/info-en-continu/20250228-le-verbatim-de-la-passe-d-armes-entre-zelensky-trump-et-vance/ The verbatim exchange of arms between Zelensky, Trump and Vance Verbatim except they made sure to leave out this line, which appeared to be the line that set Trump off: Z: “Everybody has problems even you. You have a nice ocean and don’t feel. But you will feel it in the future“. Now that is interesting that. Trump seems to think that the two oceans on either side of America will always protect them. And as part of this, he wants both Canada and Greenland to make this geographical block secure. Same with his idea of an Iron Dome for America. Call it Fortress America. So for Zelensky to say that this will not always be true must have really struck a raw nerve with Trump. I don’t think that’s what struck the nerve, Rev. Trump did, after all, warn of the risk of world war, several times during the event. I think it’s a more basic response. Zelensky’s statement “you will feel it in the future” can be interpreted one of two ways: as a threat, or as a prediction. Neither is very gracious. I myself was appalled by it, not so much by what Zelensky said, but just the fact that he said it. Just not a very “politic” thing to say, especially when you’re a begging dependent. Having see the Breaking Points Video I thought the the highlight was the UK Ambassador to the US @6:48 in the background with head in hand. It was 40 minutes into the media PR $unt when it all came undone. Few other notes. “For his part, Trump made clear that the US would continue delivering military aid. All Zelensky had to do was remain calm for a few more minutes and they would’ve signed a deal. The argument started when Trump pointed out that it would be hard to make a deal if you talk about Putin the way Zelensky does. Vance interjects to make the reasonable point that Biden called Putin names and that didn’t get us anywhere. The Zelensky/Trump dynamic was calm and stable. It was when Vance spoke that Zelensky started to interrogate him.” Lmmao … from experience it was like watching a white collar Coke deal go bad, no guns allowed affairs, so it all comes down to attitude and the knowledge of it being backed up. Zelensky just got put in the – Gimp Box – on international media for everyone else to see. On that note I wonder what the EU posse is musing right now, come to Oval office and get a public spanking for all to see, go back home and plead for ice – ???? The only other thing is the juxtaposition of Trump/Vance/Musk vs say Putin/Xi on global media. How is that dynamic going to play out in the near and long term. Thank you Lambert. Vaya con dios. Lambert, Fare thee well wherever you may fare. May your chisels remain sharp and saw lines true. Ave atque vale. Retired Carpenter In grief, I often resort to poetry: spoken by Prospero. Now my charms are all o’erthrown, And what strength I have ’s mine own, Which is most faint. Now ’tis true I must be here confined by you, Or sent to Naples. Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got And pardoned the deceiver, dwell In this bare island by your spell, But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands. Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill, or else my project fails, Which was to please. Now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair, Unless I be relieved by prayer, Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself, and frees all faults. As you from crimes would pardoned be, Let your indulgence set me free. MAY YOU WEATHER ANY UPCOMING STORMS WITH GRACE AND INSIGHT. You leave a big hole hehind Lambert ! Lambert, goodbye. I’ll especially miss your DOGEbag commentary. Enjoy your retirement or whatever comes next for you. Lambert, there’s nothing I can add to the very eloquent encomia expressed by my fellow commentators other than I share their feelings and well wishes for you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I will miss you. I have added orts and scraps (for the final time; thanks for all the kind words). It’s fitting that “the goddamed Democrat Party” is the topic. That, and an amazing session at the White House with Big Z, Vance, and Trump. I have a couple of weekend posts to go, and then… I’ll see you on the other side. Z: Everybody has problems even you. You have a nice ocean and don’t feel. But you will feel it in the future. Whooboy…that made Trump pipe up,didn’t it? Code for blowback is a bitch? You take care, Lambert. Wow, just watched the melee or was it a poker game, with the many mentions of not having the cards? I’d imagine the big Z wishes he’d worn his lucky green shirt~ Maybe it was the lighting, but i’ve never seen the President looking oh so very Oompa-Loompa as today, wow. Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-da If you’re not greedy, you will go far You will live in happiness too Like the Oompa, Loompa, doompa-dee-do Doompa-dee-do I see the Democrats have not changed. They are going with Democrat Elissa Slotkin who is Republican Lite but people will more likely just go with an actual Republican. When you don’t offer a truly different choice you shouldn’t be surprised if there is no rush to follow you. But the Democrats will be. I was just watching a silly but comforting movie. The big theme, so big it is repeated multiple times, is when what you are doing is not working you need to step back and go in another direction. The problem that elected Democrats and their consultants have is that they are having a hard time understanding that because they are comfortable and have been somewhat protected and don’t realize that is not the case for more and more Americans. They really do not understand how this happened. They will not change until they truly hit bottom. It is too uncomfortable for them as their livelihoods, where the real money is, will not survive real change. So posturing and pretending and putting the spooks on the air to reassure the owners that none of it means anything will continue. Sad to see you go and thanks for all you have done here. You’ve done a good stint. I am educated and better from what you have shared here. Particularly the covid coverage. and you are going out at a quiet news time. nope nothing going on of note at all right now…. :D The other side? Is the grass greener? Flowers smell better? What about bees, butterflies? See you there, I guess? Lambert – thank you for your insights and your wit – I will miss reading your column – good luck – happy trails. Brian Appreciate the promotion of bassists. I saw Jaco Pastorius with Joni Mitchel in 1979 and the solo he did was a highlight of the concert. It was the first time I’d experienced looping in a live performance, mind expanding. Great that you saw it. This video should have been titled Joni with a very good band. As Wayne Shorter said of her (roughly), she didn’t copy any one else’s style but held with her own. I’m a musician, I understand something of how these things work. These major cats backing her up were all off book. That was a major economic effort. And an artistic success. Pat Metheny, Joni Mitchell, Jaco Pastorius, Michael Brecker – “Shadows And Light”. I’m watching it again after some years. There is solid musicianship throughout. It was Joni’s show and she had the musical foundation to propel it. Done watching — She was better than good. And she was a universalist human being. Thank you Lambert for all the insight, and (“dry, very dry” :D ) wit over the years, you will be missed! I wish you only the best. This felt like a fitting Irish well-wish for the occasion: “May misfortune follow you the rest of your life, and never catch up.” Thank you, Lambert! Thank you, Lambert, for all of your wonderful Water Coolers, articles, and analyses. Every one of them was a masterpiece. I am especially grateful for your unrivaled Covid coverage and for honoring the avian world with the beautiful Bird Song of the Day. Much happiness and success with all of your future endeavors! “Andrew Cuomo to receive labor endorsement in mayor’s race he’s yet to enter”, because government is organized crime, lol, it’s like putting it on a billboard. The good news is that no mayor of NYC has ever gone on to higher office. Of course that’s only good for those of us who don’t live there. At least NYS prison guards know how to organize a wildcat strike and get concessions. Hochul had 6500 National Guard acting as prison guards. National coverage is crickets. Deal reached to end strike by NY prison workers, Hochul says syracuse.com We’ll see if they go back work tomorrow. The strike worked. State caved. Why are other public or private workers so timid? I saw that. Kudos to the prison guards I hope, but not knowing the lay of the land, and having a deep suspicion of the prison industry, I’ll refrain from being too enthusiastic. Thinking about the question you finished with, prison guards holding an almost unique position of power as to who can and will fill in, combined with society’s urgent need for uninterrupted service. Air traffic control professionals might fit here as well. Baristas, well, I already make my own coffee. Thank you, Lambert, for all the years of Water Cooler posts, as well as the countless yellow wader sessions! An amazing body of work. Gonna miss your intelligent insight badly, Lambert. Gonna miss that dry wit the most! Thank you, Lambert. The Covid coverage has been vital, and the general insight and snark have been greatly appreciated. Wishing you the best for the future. Stay safe, wherever you are, whatever you do. Thank you for all the hard work. Take a well deserved rest. You have more friends and colleagues than you will ever know. Lambert – a suggestion? I think you mentioned one of your next projects is writing a book? If so please let us know when and where it is – cuz nothing helps a book get traction like the 500 glowing reviews that I’m sure everyone here would participate in providing. :) Thank you LS. I wish I was not so skint. Hat’s off. Lambert….will send a check……I cannot BELIEVE you are leaving. NC is an absolute fave and your “dry” wit has grown on me as the years pass. BEST……..and take care. What a last Water Cooler! It’s like the Hollywood exit where the explosion is right behind you as you walk off the stage. Lol enjoy your cool new world my guy. Lambert 4 evah! Lambert, you’ll be missed. I hope retirement suits you. So long, Lambert. And thanks for all the wit and wisdom. For man who rarely laughs out loud, you certainly inspired a number of guffaws for me over the years. Best wishes! Some of the conservatives I know seem generally happy – although they are all convinced that many woke forces are out to get them, personally and specifically. That doesn’t sound pleasant, no matter how they describe themselves. The MAGA heads I know for other reasons would, I believe, tell you they are happy. And they probably are because they love drama and being angry all the time. Imagined slights – they know I don’t like this many pickles! – crazy paranoia about the knock-out game and seed oils and not going to parts of town where they would be sex trafficked (even thought they have guns in their purses.) It’s like their social skills were learned from bots. Thanks for the time together we all shared with you, Lambert. Water Cooler was my most eagerly anticipated read of the day. So sorry it’s going away. All the best to Lambert! “Fare thee well now Let your life proceed by its own designs Nothing to tell now…” Yours words have been a treasure. Thank you for everything, Lambert! In case you haven’t already seen this and if you don’t plan to get away from the internet completely after your retirement, it may be of interest to you for future web searches: Bruce Sterling (the sci-fi author) posted on his Mastodon today about an open-source search engine that prioritizes non-commercial content, which sounds like something that a lot of us have been wishing for. For some quick examples that I tested with, a simple search for “Ukraine” returned several of NC’s favorite/friend blogs in the first page of results. A search for “calpers” returned Naked Capitalism on the second page of results. Compare that to Google’s results. Their tagline on their github calls it an “Internet search engine for text-oriented websites. Indexing the small, old and weird web.” https://marginalia-search.com/ I hope you enjoy this and that you also enjoy your retirement! Best regards. Thank you, Turtle! “Internet search engine for text-oriented websites. Indexing the small, old and weird web.” https://marginalia-search.com/ Marginalia Search – what a find! Former librarian here, frothing at the mouth. This is fantastic! You’re welcome, Jenny! I hope you enjoy it and find it useful! We have much more to thank you for than can be said. I will miss your insights and wish you all good things to come. Thank you, Lambert! Wishing you well on the new stage of your life as you will have more time to go after those pursuits that you have left aside. Lots of changes ahead for you but I hope that you check in on comments every now and then to add your own insights. Happy trails. I agree. Now that you have more time you will accomplish much. We will all be saying “I knew him when . . . ” Have fun, but don’t have too much fun. And as that old Irish saying goes ‘May you be in Heaven thirty minutes before the devil knows that you are dead.’ I’ve a hole in my heart, now that it comes down to it. Lambert, please drop us all a line from time to time and let us know how you’re doing. Only the best wishes for you and yours in your next phase in life. I have gained so much from my daily visits to the Water Cooler that I can’t even express. Working in BigTech I am surrounded by kool-aid drinking PMC neoliberals all day every day, and Water Cooler has been a welcome respite from all that. Because of Water Cooler I joined Twitter (now X) to follow Matt Stoller, and from there have ended up following 75-odd people and counting, many of whom I was introduced to through these very pages. This eclectic collection of X’ers has led me down paths that have contributed my having a more open mind and open heart. The commentariat does the same every day. I so appreciate what you have done for all of us, Lambert. I hope your retirement includes writing projects we can enjoy in the future . . . but more than that I hope you know you’ve already done more good than most writers could ever hope to achieve. Lambert, you went deep–deep into places, issues, causes, committees, bird calls, tree barks, mindsets, air flows, transcripts, computer coding, keyboards, overlooked photographers, Twitters, gardens, and so much more. I don’t go that deep–probably don’t have the patience, but thank you for taking us on the ride. Have a merry and satisfying post-NC journey. Lambert, thank you for everything. I’ve marked so many days by the water cooler that I can’t even attempt to count. How will I even know it’s 2pm without the water cooler? Wishing you all the best and echo Petal’s comment that if you are ever in the Hanover NH area, the first, second and third round are on me. And dinner will be on me. Thank you Lambert for your dedication and good will! My best wishes to you always. Thank you Lambert: You, along with helpful commentarians, were, from the beginning (Mar 2020, if memory serves) the only believable source for COVID information. Of which I fear there will be very little from now on, things being how they are. Best of luck Lambert. You will be missed. Wayfarer, go with God, and reason, within reason. Thank you, thank you, thank you for you work in NC. You will be missed, but I think NC will just be a little different. Your Covid coverage and political coverage has been very helpful. Highlighting different websites (Black Agenda Report to the Daily Yonder) (and Yves does similarly) shows how despite differences (some significant, others not so much) the working class has a common interest and a common enemy. I will look forward to your future contributions (and book?). Inspired by Angie Neer’s b/w photo, I had hoped to send a couple before now, maybe an occasional plantidote will be in the works. Donated last night. Re today’s WC: It’s a wonder Bernie and the Kamala cover didn’t poke holes in your yellow waders. I had finally put my toe in Facebook, but I recently tried Mastodon, which is more to my liking. A Covid post pointed to this concerning future vaccine possibilities. https://absolutelymaybe.plos.org/2025/02/28/exciting-news-from-europe-and-roadblocks-in-the-us-nextgen-covid-vax-update-26/ Enjoy your retirement. Thank you for all the amazing work you’ve done, Lambert. Don’t be a stranger. May the Long Time Sun guide you on your journey. Darn, howl…see you on the sunny side. Darn, with-drawl count starts…Thank you so much for your numerous gifts! Be well.🌅 One last heartfelt thanks and fond farewell Lambert. Sure will miss you and Watercooler lots. Wishing you much awsome reading and fresh new discoveries, insights and experiences. Keep in touch! Lambert, thank you for the years of education and entertainment. There was a hole in my life on weekends, now it will be permanent. Wipes tear from eye … as you partake of a bit of Clarke&Dawe … Lambert. John Clarke: Thanks for your time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539bkrv7g2k Lambert, thank you so much! “Violence alters human genes for generations, researchers discover” A version of that was one of the premises of Freud’s book Moses and Monotheism among other things. The old is new again. Till now I’ve avoided stopping here today: I don’t want to see you leave. As much as I’ve enjoyed the insight and humor you’ve brought here, work-ethic and more, I appreciate the sense of plain old common decency that comes across in your writings. You’ve set an example that I and many others will try to follow, hopefully meeting with at least some success. Truely. Thank you, Lambert!!! Wish you the best on future endeavours. Thank you 1000x for daily nudging my personal dial back toward ‘there is maybe some hope for humanity’; for building and maintaining a network and hub of covid info; and for many a well researched and thought out take that I have learned from and passed on (w attribution!). Long live the old school blogosphere! Thank you, Lambert, for all the gifts you’ve given, which other commenters have documented so well, and best wishes to you as you take this next turn in the road. A final thank you to Lambert for everything. Truly a blessing for all the readers. Wish you well for the next part of your journey. Lambert, Thanks for the phrase “birds like messy”. I think of it often as I wander around my messy garden in a neighborhood of sterile manicured yards. Seems like the messy place is the only one full of life, especially birds and bugs. Also, have appreciated your insights and jokes. A short cynical take on the rally to protect the special health programs, you have to understand that for many NY elected Congressional members it is the biggest and most important piece of the numerous ways that money was funneled to various power groups as a result of 9/11 that of the biggest thing they ever accomplished. It was, quite honestly, the only real accomplishment of Hillary Clinton’s senate terms, the rest was renaming post offices. It is not just that there is a psychic wound about the events of that day that in NY is inescapable. They literally have benefitted for years because of the largesse that has been spent over the years. They cannot lose it or its legacy of success. And you are right that it is just wrong that this is the wrong focus or approach, they all should have gotten single payer universal health care long ago. In the meanwhile as a fitting irony in the same week that was going on, Mount Sinai won their court battle to close Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital on First Avenue and 16th Street. This was the hospital farthest downtown since Saint Vincent’s was closed. If they had their way there would be nothing below 23rd but urgent care and enhanced urgent care centers. (I have it on good authority that the extensive one across from where St Vincent’s once stood has to send anything truly serious to real hospitals, one of their doctors told me.It has beds but they are for observable situations.) Now it is true that a new temporary court stay was put in place Friday, with the hopes that the full court will hear the case, but they are determined to shut the hospital. Take care Lambert, thank you. Thank you so much, Lambert, and good luck for the future! Thank you for all the hard work, Lambert! Especially the covid coverage these last (checks watch) five years! The proposed New Yorker cover of Kamala is really a remarkable thing. While initially distracted by the hallowed visages that are somehow printed onto her suit, it was the raised index finger that surprised me. That’s a gesture that readers will remember I am sure, popularised by our friends ISIS: the tawhid, “the belief in the oneness of God and a key component of the Muslim religion.” As I understand it, this is the type of fundamentalism that rejects any other religious outlooks, including Shia etc, as idolatry, and worthy of death. It’s a very odd gesture for Kamala Harris to make. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2014-09-03/isis-sends-message Thank you Lambert, an era is passing, all is sackcloth and ashes. Farewell and god speed. It’s also a very popular gesture amongst cricket umpires. Doesn’t she have connections to India? She does indeed, but apparently the umpiring thing is to raise your index finger above your head. And if Kamala had her finger over her had it would suggest that, um, she was the umpire when she was actually a competitor in the election. So if even the image had her signaling Trump as out with a finger over her head, it would be wrong because if she beat Trump she’s a bowler, or fielder, not an umpire. And her finger is most definitely not over her head. I prefer a theory of rank stupidity. Goodbye and thanks for all the thoughts! Thank you for the years of work Lambert. I was working yesterday and thought more than once,this is the last water cooler. I hope your next adventure is satisfying and you continue to share your insights with the many who appreciate them. Cheers Many thanks!!! Beir Bua agus Beannacht, a Lambert! Take Victory and Blessing, Lambert! (Conveniently abbreviated BBB for these accelerated times, although that sounds like the robot from Space 1999). As those palindromic Swedes didn’t quite sign off:: Thank you for plantidotes, the songs and musing, Thanks for all the joy they’re bringing, Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty, What will life be? Without your Water Cooler, what’s NC? So I say thank you for the writing, the thoughts you’ve given me. Thank you, Lambert. I came to NC for the GFC in my GMT lunch breaks and stayed for the MMT but along the way I found myself reading the water cooler in the evening despite it being so American in name and often in subject matter because it was so European in perspective. The refreshing ennui, the ironic detachment, the rumination. It’s probably where I spend most time because of my day’s pattern. And with that, everything must change to stay the same. Goodbye and I look forward to hearing of your new works (and I will try not to exasperate Yves in your absence!). Your email address will not be published.

Share this article BlackRock has incorporated the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) into its model portfolios, allocating between 1% and 2%, as Bloomberg reported today. This move comes as the world’s largest asset manager adjusts its investment strategy, which includes reducing equity overweight positions and exposure to long-duration bonds. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, highlighted Bitcoin’s role as a diversification tool. Despite recent market fluctuations, BlackRock maintains its strategic view on Bitcoin, with the firm overseeing more than $11 trillion in assets. IBIT, launched in January 2024, has attracted over $37 billion in inflows, although it saw $900 million in outflows last week. By November 2024, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust reached a significant milestone by amassing $40 billion in assets in just 211 days, becoming one of the largest ETFs. The crypto market has been pressured by economic concerns and trade tensions, dampening risk appetite. Bitcoin is currently trading at $84,500, following a 7% dip to $78,200 overnight. The largest cap crypto had previously reached nearly $110,000 last month before pulling back. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Airlines Scrub DEI From Latest Annual Reports

Time Published: 2025-02-28T17:41:27Z

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Select a question above or ask something else U.S. airlines have begun to minimize mentions of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in their annual reports following political pressure from the Trump administration. Notably, American and United Airlines removed DEI sections from their latest reports, while only Delta and Southwest Airlines maintained such statements, focusing on merit-based hiring. This trend is part of a larger shift in corporate America, which has seen companies like Walmart and McDonald's also scale back DEI initiatives, influenced by recent political and legal changes, including the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action. Read the Stories Major U.S. airlines are starting to dial down statements on diversity, equity and inclusion hiring policies after wide-ranging pushback from the Trump administration. In American Airlines’ 2024 10-K, the company didn’t include a section on DEI – it had DEI sections in each of the four prior years. In its 2023 annual report, American said, “Cultivating an environment that celebrates diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is a priority for us,” and listed out a range of initiatives the company had done to increase its diversity. This year, American said, “We seek to hire the best and brightest,” and made no mention of diversity. United Airlines had a similar shift. In its most recent annual report, there are no mentions of “diversity, equity and inclusion.” Last year, in the same report, United provided statistics on the percentage of women and underrepresented minorities in its workforce. The company provided similar statistics in 2022, 2021, and 2020. JetBlue also did not have any statements on DEI hiring policies in their most recent annual reports, but did include such statements in its 2023 10-Ks. “The report reflects that we have always hired based on merit and qualifications, especially as safety is critical to our airline,” JetBlue said in a statement to Skift. “We believe in the programs, practices, and policies that we’ve put in place to create a workplace where people feel valued, respected, and able to do their best work.” While Alaska Airlines did not mention DEI by name, it did say, "We believe that all who depend on Alaska Air Group deserve respect regardless of race, ethnicity, ability, age, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. We are committed to treating every person equally – on and off our aircraft. " Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines are the only two major U.S. carriers that included a statement on DEI in their 2024 annual reports. “Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is critical to effective human capital management at Delta,” Delta said in its 2024 10-K. The carrier also emphasized in the same report that its hiring practices were “merit-based.” Last year, the Atlanta-based carrier said one of its DEI initiatives included: “Closing diversity gaps in senior leadership positions by increasing the representation of women, Black and Latin/Hispanic groups in those roles.” This year, Delta didn’t mention closing any diversity gap in senior leadership, but instead it was “ adopting recruitment strategies that seek qualified leadership candidates with diverse experiences, skills and perspectives and expanding leadership development programs to continue promoting from within.” Southwest said in its 2024 annual report that “DEIB [diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging] is a part of the Company’s culture.” Southwest didn’t mention initiatives related to hiring more women and underrepresented minorities in the report, but had such mentions in its 2023 report. The industry has been slow to close its gender and racial gaps. For example, around 80% of flight attendants are women. But only 8% are pilots, even with a significant increase in pushes to recruit more female pilots. Delta’s and United’s most recent ESG reports from 2023 say that women make up around 34% and 33% of senior roles, respectively. American, Delta, United and JetBlue also signed onto the International Air Transport Association’s “25 by 2025,” a pledge to increase female representation among corporate and frontline roles. DEI policies in corporate America took off in 2020 following the George Floyd protests. Many industries, including airlines, started publicly embracing diversity hiring policies. And as the industry faced an acute pilot shortage following the pandemic, airlines made major strides to recruit more women and people of color into those roles. United opened a flight school called the United Aviate Academy and covered much of the hefty costs associated with becoming a pilot. The carrier touted that 80% of its first Aviate class were either women or people of color. United also has business resource groups for its employees. Delta partnered with historically Black Hampton University as part of its collegiate pilot career path pipeline. And Alaska launched a partnership with Sisters in the Sky in 2019 to increase its representation of Black female pilots by 2025. President Trump and allies like Elon Musk have blamed DEI hiring policies for compromising safety in the airline industry. In a post on X, Musk claimed DEI was a reason for the Alaska Airlines blowout last year. “Do you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety?” Musk wrote on X. “That is actually happening.” Trump blamed DEI for a fatal collision near Reagan National Airport, without citing any evidence. The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating the incident. Some airline executives have also changed the way they talk about DEI, instead emphasizing that their companies hire on merit. “Well, we do hire on merit,” United CEO Scott Kirby said during a January 22 call with analysts. “We can hire the absolute best of the best and have a naturally diverse workforce.” Delta CEO Ed Bastian told the Atlanta Journal Constitution last month that DEI hiring is merit-based. “We don’t have DEI initiatives. We have people initiatives. … That’s the way it’s always been. It’s core to who we are,” Bastian said. U.S. airlines toning down their language on DEI reflects a broader trend in corporate America. Walmart, Ford, Meta, and McDonald’s have walked back their DEI programs. BlackRock also removed references to DEI in its annual report. The pullback started last year after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions. Trump has issued multiple executive orders to end federal DEI programs and to bar the practice by federal contractors. A federal judge in Maryland blocked these bans on February 21. Another executive order asked federal agencies to flag corporate diversity hiring programs for potential investigation. A report from law firm White & Case advised companies filing 10-Ks to “carefully consider their diversity disclosure and ensure it is updated and aligns with a company's current priorities and policies.” U.S. agencies, including the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration, have deleted webpages related to DEI hiring policies.

Title: BlackRock Adds Its IBIT Bitcoin ETF To Alternative Asset Model Portfolio

BlackRock has added the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the fund issued by the asset manager that holds bitcoin (BTC), to one of its model portfolios. These models suggest portfolios and rebalances which are then followed by advisors and platforms who can also request adjustments to the models based on their investment needs. BlackRock added a 1% to 2% allocation to IBIT in its target allocation portfolio that allows for alternative assets, according to James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In a report from Thursday, Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF models, wrote that there are “several substantive arguments that support bitcoin’s long-term investment merit.” According to Gates, this includes the crypto asset’s novel store of value and global monetary alternative, as well as hedge to the U.S. dollar hegemony and political instability, and proxy play on the “offline” to “online” digital transition of goods and services. “Collectively, these features may help provide unique and additive sources of risk premia and diversification to traditional multi-asset portfolios,” Gates wrote. The model represents one of IBIT’s smaller portfolios, however, the step is significant given that it is the first time BlackRock had made the decision to add IBIT to any of their models. “This is a big deal because this is the first of those models to add bitcoin,” said Seyffart. “It probably won’t be the last but bitcoin is also a lightning rod for many — some will hate this while others will love it — so I don’t know if or when they would add IBIT to their primary models that have a lot more money tracking them.” BlackRock’s model portfolios manage around $150 billion in assets as of December 31, 2024. CORRECTION (February 28, 2025, 14:56 UTC): Adds that BlackRock's model portfolios manage $150 billion in assets as opposed to $130 billion which the article incorrectly stated previously.

Title: Five ways the world has changed under Donald Trump - Fran O’Sullivan

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. United States President Donald Trump's views have changed corporate America's approach. Photo / Getty Images THREE KEY FACTS It’s been extraordinary how quickly corporate America has jumped - if not to Donald Trump’s will – at least fast enough to be seen on the same side. The five big shifts outlined in this column will inevitably invite policy responses around the world – including in New Zealand. “BP rolls back on Net Zero Goals – bets $US10 billion on fossil fuels". The headline was qualified - “A smart move or a climate setback?” BP chief executive Murray Auchincloss has claimed the Ukraine war, the pandemic and unstable energy markets have slowed the shift to renewables. But in truth, BP’s strategic shift is as much about boosting profits and shareholder returns as the slowdown in the shift to renewables. Call it a fortuitous alignment for the oil major as it falls into line with the fossil fuel peddling from The White House. I got a sniff of this changing mindset at the 2023 Apec CEO Summit in San Francisco. Exxon chairman and CEO Darren Woods’ address was pure anodyne: climate change is real; human activity plays a role; it is one of the major problems facing the world today – but it’s not the only one. Woods segued. Many ideas to accelerate the energy transition were not based in economic, technological, or political reality. “We cannot replace overnight an energy system that took 150 years to build. The size and complexity are simply too vast … No country has ever joined the developed world without access to oil and gas. The countries of the global south have every right to lift their people out of energy poverty and into the global middle class.” There is some truth to this. But coming from New Zealand where our political leaders had revelled in imposing a ban on oil and gas exploration, the contrast was stark. This strategic shift simply underlines Shane Jones’ moves to leverage New Zealand’s resource base are not based on an alternate reality. The shift is real. BlackRock boss Larry Fink has made a commercial fetish of positioning his company at the forefront of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). But when the world’s largest asset manager released its annual report this week, all the usual virtuous references to DEI policies were gone. In 2023, BlackRock said a diverse workforce with an inclusive and connected culture was “a commercial imperative and indispensable to its success”. The latest report simply says “delivering for the firm’s clients requires attracting the best people from across the world. BlackRock is committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid group think”. It looks very much like the powerful Fink has simply fallen into line with the sentiments in Trump’s executive order that instructed federal agencies to investigate corporate DEI programmes on the grounds of potential civil rights violations. It’s too early to say what the implications will be for sustainable finance deals but when BlackRock pulls away from DEI and the oil majors step up fossil fuel production, there is a significant shift under way that will have implications here. The United States military has begun firing transgender members, who will be separated from service unless they receive exemptions. “Military service by service members and applicants for military service who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria is incompatible with military service,” a Defence Department memo says. “Service by these individuals is not in the best interests of the military services and is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security.” The memo follows Trump’s signing of an executive order that took aim at transgender troops in a personal way, describing them as “not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member”. Waivers would be granted only “provided there is a compelling government interest in retaining the service member that directly supports warfighting capabilities”. NZ’s defence chiefs will have to watch out that the US does not seek to impose restrictions on those serving within the forces with which it operates. Washington Post owner and tech baron Jeff Bezos has issued an edict to his newspaper ruling that the opinions section would now be focused on “personal liberties and free markets” and won’t publish anything that opposes those ideas. “We are going to be writing every day in support and defence of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” the billionaire Amazon founder wrote in an email to Post staffers he published on X. “We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.” Bezos’ stance is not too far distant from that imposed (through osmosis) by Rupert Murdoch in his flagship mastheads the Wall St Journal and The Australian. But it is a shock to the sensibilities of staffers and readers of the liberal leaning Post. Post publisher and chief executive William Lewis said that change was not about “siding with any political party”. “This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for.” It’s also crystal clear that personal liberties and free markets is what the Trump administration stands for. The US Vice-President stunned the recent Munich Security Conference when he said the threat he worries most about is not Russia, nor China – but the threat from within. He exploded the consensus between Europe and the US by arguing Europe has retreated from its most fundamental values by repressing conservative speech and political actors and was reaping the fruits of uncontrolled immigration. It was the equivalent of farting in church. What it does signal is the US leadership will respect no boundaries when it comes to selling its worldview. Will New Zealand subvert its own values to fall into line – or is it time to craft a new story we can all be proud of? Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Ethereum – Institutional sell-offs hit ETH hard, but why are spot traders still buying?

Institutional and spot investors are clashing over ETH lately. Ethereum [ETH] has seen a major price drop lately amid a broader market downturn. In fact, over the last 24 hours, the altcoin declined by 10.41% on the charts, bringing its one-month loss to 33.10%. Institutional investors, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have contributed to this trend by continuing to sell ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, according to AMBCrypto’s analysis, spot traders have helped prevent an even steeper decline. This week has seen significant ETH sell-offs by institutional investors through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the time of analysis, these investors seemed to have offloaded approximately $293 million worth of ETFs since the market opened on Monday, 24 February. A week-long sell-off like this usually alludes to skepticism among institutional investors about ETH’s price outlook. In fact, according to Coinbase’s ETH/USD daily chart, this sell-off caused the asset to drop from an opening price of $2,821.64 to a press-time value of $2,103.84. Source: Coinglass Among institutional sellers, BlackRock and Fidelity have contributed the most, offloading $144 million and $65.4 million worth of ETH, respectively, this week. While institutional investors have been selling, spot traders have been actively buying ETH over the same period. Between 24-28 February, approximately $864 million worth of ETH was purchased across cryptocurrency exchanges, according to Coinglass’ exchange netflow data. Notably, even as ETH recorded a 10% drop in the last 24 hours, spot traders made their second-largest purchase of the week, acquiring $241 million worth of ETH. Source: Coinglass When significant institutional selling is met with strong spot buying, it points to underlying bullish sentiment in the market. AMBCrypto found that this week’s buying pressure has been primarily driven by retail investors, as large investors—who typically control a substantial portion of supply—have continued selling. According to IntoTheBlock, from a low of 36,430 ETH sold on 25 February, large investors have since offloaded an additional 114,850 ETH. If retail traders sustain their buying activity, ETH could maintain its bullish momentum and avoid dropping below the $2,000-threshold. The ETH exchange reserve, which tracks the amount of ETH held across different cryptocurrency exchanges, could serve as a confirmation of a price reversal. Source: Cryptoquant A decline in exchange reserves hints at potential price appreciation, while an increase alludes to growing selling pressure. If the press time reading of 18.9 million ETH declines further, it would indicate strengthening bullish momentum and a potential rally for ETH. This would mean that institutional sell pressure won’t potentially weigh on ETH as much.

A HUSBAND AND wife cryptocurrency trading team arrested in Dublin over an alleged €21m international money laundering operation have been accused of facilitating organised crime. Jixu Wang, 35, and his 34-year-old wife, Ye Wang, who are originally from China but living on Avoca Road, were initially charged with possessing crime proceeds in a digital bank account between September 2023 and February 2024. They had been denied bail and have been in custody since 16 November last year. The couple appeared again at Dublin District Court where Detective Garda Barry Cusack informed Judge Deirdre Gearty that the Director of Public Prosecutions directed trial on indictment in the Circuit Court. They were also further charged with facilitating organised crime. Judge Gearty noted they made no reply when the detective put the new charges to them. She remanded them in continuing custody pending the preparation of a book of evidence, and they will appear again next week. Following a “complex” investigation by the Dublin East Garda economic crime unit, with cooperation from Europol and police forces in Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK, officers arrested the unemployed couple on 12 November. They searched their rented apartment on Avoca Road, Blackrock. An earlier bail hearing was told the pair previously ran a cryptocurrency trading business. They moved from the Philippines to Ireland in 2023 as part of an “immigration investment programme” after donating €400,000 to a charity, ICARE Housing CLG. Advertisement Detective Garda Steven Dunican and Barry Cusack raised concerns about flight risk or that they could dispose of evidence. They had said officers from a Garda economic crime unit received information from German police about a suspected investment fraud.A German citizen had €10,000 transferred from his bank to a Paytend digital bank account of Wang. Detective Garda Cusack conducted inquiries with Paytend regarding Jixu Wang, and it was alleged the accused used his Chinese passport number on the account. Garda Cusack identified 1,894 unusual transactions transferred into the account, valued at €5,043,705, from 622 different IBANs over five months between 2 July and 9 November 2023. It was claimed that there were other unusual transactions between another Paytend account held by his wife, Ye Wang, who is a qualified accountant. Her Paytend account allegedly received 733 transactions valued at just over €2.1m from 321 different bank accounts from 11 September 2023, and 12 January last year. The court heard claims GPS location has been obtained for login dates for both Paytend accounts, matching their address. The detectives claimed the couple were both unemployed but had just over €7 million in their accounts. Gardai, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, allegedly identified €14.7m in cryptocurrency wallets, of which €4.4m has been seized or frozen by the investigation team, the bail hearing was told. Their apartment was searched, resulting in an alleged seizure of €20,000, gold coins and five envelopes with “seed words” to access a cryptocurrency wallet. Documents, phones and laptops have also been recovered. It was alleged Mrs Wang helped create fake documents to set up “money ” accounts, but she denied knowing it was part of a crime. The detectives feared the couple, who have a young child, would leave the country if released on bail, as they had no family in Ireland or links to this jurisdiction.

Title: Bitcoin Boom’s Expiry Date? CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Timeline

Many people wonder about the length of Bitcoin’s rollercoaster journey that its price increase has been on. The bull run may persist until at least April 2025, argues CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju. Should this be the case, it could signal the longest ever Bitcoin bull cycle. Ju created a Bitcoin growth rate difference statistic for May 2024 that formed the foundation for his projection. Monitoring the long-term market movements of the crypto helps one to ascertain whether the asset is still in a growth phase or overheated. Right now, Bitcoin is in what he refers to as a “critical zone,” in which market signals combine bullish and bearish patterns. Whether Bitcoin keeps on its ascent or begins to lose vigor will depend mostly on the next few weeks, or months. #Bitcoin on-chain indicators are at the bull-bear boundary. I expect this to be the longest bull run in history, but I could be wrong. We need at least another month of data to confirm whether we’re entering a bear market. If demand doesn’t recover, indicators may fully signal a… https://t.co/QkaZx7wmAt pic.twitter.com/4iHbuitW4o — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) February 27, 2025 Investors are beginning to have jitters about Bitcoin’s price as it has lost 30% of its value in the last few days. But Ju is not bothered. According to him, severe pullbacks like these are not uncommon during a bull cycle phase. Historical records support his assertion; earlier bull runs show price losses of up to 52% before recovery. Should history be the barometer, Bitcoin might still have some surprises in its sleeves and carry out strong upward moves in the face of a volatile market. Movement in Bitcoin price is much influenced by institutional investors. BlackRock lately sold roughly $70 million in ether and $440 million in bitcoin. These big sell-offs could cause temporary devaluations and change investor mood. These events could change the price direction of Bitcoin in the next months even if Ju is optimistic. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is not in good form as we speak: it is languishing in the $79,900 level, to the delight of those who’ve been waiting to buy the dip. Bitcoin is trading 7% below its most recent closing. It peaked at $86,990 then fell to a low of $79,490. The bulls can only wish it was the other way around. Ju’s research shows that although some investors worry about possible future dips, the bull run is far from over. Since April 2025 is just a month away, traders and experts are still captivated by Bitcoin’s long-term trend and what the coming days will bring on the table. Ju’s observations offer a data-driven viewpoint even if nobody can exactly predict the market. Whether Bitcoin follows past patterns or creates new ground, investors will be closely observing it. Anything can happen in the crypto space. Featured image from Gemini Imagen, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle.

When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.
