Lansdowne moved into the top four in Division 1A of the All-Ireland League for the first time this season with one of the campaign’s statement wins when beating Terenure 32-0 on the Aviva back pitch last Saturday. Declan Fassbender’s side appear to have timed their run perfectly and with remaining games against UCD and Garryowen look well placed to make the play-offs. This sixth win in seven was never really in doubt. The 21-year-old Leinster academy flanker set the tone in a dominant defensive display. After tries by Hardus van Eeden and Rob Hedderman, who opened his account in an injury-affected season with a brace, Jerry Cahir and Jack Cooke completed a bleak day for Terenure, who were feeling the scars of their defeat at home to Clontarf. Trailing 3-0 after 25 minutes, it looked like Terenure were about to go ahead when outhalf Conor McKeon put centre Ethan Reilly through under the posts. Alas, not alone was the pass forward, but the outhalf suffered a broken leg when tackled as he passed. This compounded the recent loss of Harrison Brewer, Chris Cosgrave and Conor Phillips, while Henry McErlean, Caspar Gabriel and Fintan Gunne are on Leinster duty in South Africa. Lansdowne, now fourth on 51 points, face relegation-threatened UCD next week before entertaining bottom-placed Garryowen in a fortnight. Terenure, in fifth on 48 points, host Young Munster before a last day trek to Cork Con (third on 52). Con had a hard-fought 30-23 win away to Young Munster which ended the latter’s slim play-off hopes, as the sides traded three tries apiece, with James Taylor kicking 15 points. However, after the game there were some unseemly scenes involving virtually all the players from both teams, and some supporters. In a statement, Cork Con said they are aware of an incident after the full-time whistle and “the club is currently conducting a full internal review into the incident. We are committed to upholding the highest standards of conduct, and will take appropriate action in line with our disciplinary procedures. “We wish to acknowledge the strong relationship between Cork Constitution and Young Munster, and we remain in contact with their representatives as we address this matter. As this is an ongoing review, we will not be making any further comment at this time.” Clontarf stayed top on 60 points thanks to another brace of tries from hooker Dylan Donnellan in an 18-5 win at home to UCD. ‘Tarf will travel to Garryowen before hosting St Mary’s on the last day. The St Mary’s fullback Conor Hayes scored their first try in his 19-point haul and former Munster centre Dan Goggin, playing at number eight, completed their 12th attacking bonus point of the campaign in a 32-21 home win over Ballynahinch. St Mary’s sit second on 58 points and will host City of Armagh before that last day trek to Clontarf. Although it will only be a stay of execution, Garryowen ended their 14-match losing streak with a surprise 26-17 win at City of Armagh, which keeps the latter just two points ahead of UCD in the relegation play-off place. In 1B, Nenagh Ormond took a significant step toward a home semi-final in those play-offs thanks to a 34-20 win over Old Wesley. Bottom placed Shannon kept their hopes of avoiding relegation alive with a gutsy 15-10 win at Naas to move within five points of Trinity and Highfield after the latter’s 28-23 win at College Park. Instonians, a junior club three seasons ago, will play in 1B next season after securing their fourth successive promotion with a 38-22 win at home to Greystones.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs End Outflow Streak With $744 Million Weekly Influx — Details

The US-based Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have been on a negative streak of capital outflows in the past few weeks, reflecting dwindling appetite and worsening sentiment amongst investors. However, the latest daily performances of these crypto-based financial products suggest that fresh demand might be growing among investors. According to the latest market data, the Bitcoin ETFs in the United States continued their hot streak of capital influx, registering a daily total net inflow of $83.09 million on Friday, March 21. This fresh capital inflow marked the sixth consecutive day of net daily inflows for the crypto products. On Friday, only two of the Bitcoin ETFs witnessed any form of investor activity. BlackRock saw the highest amount of value ($104.99 million) added to its exchange-traded fund iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT); while Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) posted a daily net outflow of $21.9 million to close the week. Nevertheless, this $83.09 million performance brought the Bitcoin ETFs’ weekly record to a staggering $744.35 million weekly total net inflow. Interestingly, this previous week’s record put an end to five consecutive weeks of total net outflows from the exchange-traded funds. Data from SoSoValue shows that the US Bitcoin ETF market witnessed a total withdrawal of $5.39 billion over those five weeks of negative outflows. Specifically, the crypto-based financial products witnessed a daily total net outflow of over $1.14 billion on February 25. The magnitude of outflows witnessed by the Bitcoin ETFs has been associated with the uncertain climate of the US financial markets. Since the United States President Donald Trump resumed office, the markets have been plagued with fears of a global trade war, interest rate decisions, and so on. Since their launch, there has been a discussion around the impact of US Bitcoin ETFs’ performance on the price of the flagship cryptocurrency. As seen in the recent consecutive weeks of net outflows, the Bitcoin price tends to struggle whenever ETF investors are leaving the market. However, the premier cryptocurrency seems stuck in a consolidation range despite the fresh demand for the US Bitcoin ETFs. However, a sustained demand for its exchange-traded funds might be the positive catalyst for the Bitcoin price to resume its upward trend. As of this writing, the price of BTC is hovering around the $84,000 mark, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader has barely recorded any notable movements in the past week. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: The New Sustainability Playbook: 10 Questions For Business Leaders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pklein/2025/03/23/the-new-sustainability-playbook-10-questions-for-business-leaders/
Time Published: 2025-03-23T15:15:54Z
Full Content:
ByPaul Klein ByPaul Klein , Contributor. Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer Microsoft, at talking about "Accelerating climate ... More solutions with AI" on November 16, 2023 in Lisbon, Portugal. The negative impacts of the Trump administration’s tariffs are already taking effect and are projected to be even more consequential. Prices are projected to rise. At the same time, output and employment will be reduced, resulting in a net negative impact on the U.S. economy. In this context, every business with a global supply chain is facing an existential crisis: reduce investments in sustainability to save money in the short term, or stay the course and preserve long-term value? As costs rise from higher tariffs, business leaders need to understand the consequences of reducing investments in sustainability. Cutting costs will jeopardize business relationships with global supply chain partners that require compliance with sustainability standards including GRI, ISSB, and SASB. Downsizing investments in sustainability will also alienate employees, consumers, and communities who reward businesses that reduce environmental impact, enhance social equity, and improve long-term resilience. Every business leader will need to decide whether to maintain investments in sustainability that come with a cost but also deliver immense value. This new playbook will help leaders make the best choices for their companies. Short-term cost savings can lead to long-term vulnerability. Cutting back on emissions reductions, renewable energy, or supply chain resilience might lower costs now. But it also raises the risk of climate impacts, harm to reputation, and fines from regulations. PG&E’s failure to upgrade grid infrastructure to prevent wildfires resulted in the company facing an estimated $30 billion liability for damages from the two years of wildfires, according to the New York Times. Many multinational clients and procurement partners now mandate sustainability metrics. Preferred supplier lists may remove companies that fail to align with frameworks like GRI, ISSB, or SASB may be removed from preferred supplier lists. This is especially true in sectors such as apparel, electronics, automotive, and food. If you are part of a global value chain, slashing ESG investments could mean losing business. Walmart requires key suppliers to report emissions and energy use. Suppliers that don’t comply may be delisted. Employees want to work for companies with purpose, consumers reward brands that do good, and communities are more supportive of responsible corporations. Scaling back ESG efforts to offset tariff-related costs could result in lower morale, higher turnover, customer churn, and social license to operate issues—intangibles that can rapidly transform into significant concerns. Patagonia’s sustained customer loyalty and employee retention are closely linked to its genuine ESG commitments. Institutional investors are placing greater emphasis on sustainability as a proxy for governance and future-readiness. While some shareholder segments may support short-term margin improvements, others—like pension funds and ESG-focused funds—may divest from companies seen as backtracking on sustainability. Before you cut ESG budgets, consider how it might change your investor profile. BlackRock has flagged companies with weak ESG disclosures as riskier and redirected capital toward ESG-aligned portfolios, according to ESG Today. Sustainability efforts can benefit your company in the long run. You will save energy with efficient operations. Proactive compliance will cut regulatory costs. Plus, responsible sourcing will help your brand stand out. These investments may not appear on this quarter’s balance sheet, but they build competitive advantage over time. What will you lose if you abandon what you’ve already built? Unilever’s Sustainable Living Brands grew 69% faster than the rest of its portfolio, demonstrating tangible ROI. The green transition is not a trend—it’s an economic transformation. Companies in many fields are investing in sustainable innovation. They focus on electric fleets, biodegradable packaging, zero-waste operations, and inclusive hiring practices. If your rivals are pushing hard while you pull back, your market relevance could drop significantly. Ørsted shifted from relying on fossil fuels to becoming a top player in offshore wind. They moved faster than European energy giants who took longer to adapt. Before making cuts, get insights from boards, investors, employees, NGOs, and community leaders. They likely have strong views on your sustainability goals. Often, stakeholders will advocate for re-prioritizing—not abandoning—ESG commitments. Transparency can protect your brand and build credibility, even in times of retrenchment. Interface, the carpet maker, teamed up with NGOs, suppliers, and customers for its sustainability plan. This likely helped maintain its brand trust during tough times. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and state-led green grants offer billions to companies investing in sustainability. Cutting ESG funding now could mean missing out on tax credits, rebates, and partnerships that offset costs and de-risk long-term investments. Have you explored every opportunity to turn sustainability into a net gain? First Solar secured over $700 million in federal tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act for U.S. manufacturing. Sustainability and profitability should co-exist. ESG investments boost efficiency, cut waste, and make resource use better. They also reveal new business models. Leaders who see sustainability as central to performance, not just an extra, are most likely to succeed. IKEA’s focus on circular practices and renewable energy cuts waste and saves money worldwide. Will people remember you as the company that pivoted toward the future—or as the one that retreated when pressure mounted? Leadership is not just about getting through this quarter. It’s about creating a story that builds confidence, pride, and progress. The choices you make today will shape your company’s legacy. This is especially true during times of climate change and economic uncertainty. Microsoft’s pledge is to become carbon negative by 2030. This makes it a leader for the future, even in tough economic times. Tariffs and inflationary pressure are forcing difficult decisions. But cutting sustainability investments will likely be a costly mistake. Business leaders need a new approach. This should balance short-term costs with long-term stakeholder value, regulatory risks, and market expectations. Sustainability is not a corporate responsibility—it’s a strategic advantage. In the current environment, reducing investments in this area may seem like a sensible decision, but it can ultimately lead to weakened supply chain relationships, investor skepticism, employee disengagement, and lost consumer trust. As tariffs increase and economic strain grows, the most resilient and respected companies will be those that continue to be leaders by maintaining investments in sustainability.

Title: Billionaires Advance Fossil Fuels at “Energy Super Bowl” in Houston

Climate activists flocked to Houston to challenge the energy conference and its reckless promotion of fossil fuels.

Last week, thousands of people gathered in Houston, Texas for CERAWeek 2025, perhaps the most significant annual meet-up of the network of oil executives, investors, consultants, government officials, and more, that make up and support the fossil fuel industry. Inside the gathering, oil, finance, and tech executives joined a slew of panels discussing a range of energy industry topics. Top Trump officials spoke, including US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and US Interior secretary Doug Burgum. According to Guardian climate reporter Dharna Noor, “Wright said global warming was merely a needed “side-effect” of modernization, while Burgum called to “take our natural resources and turn them into natural assets.” Meanwhile, outside CERAWeek, hundreds of climate activists protested the conference’s display of billionaire power and celebration of fossil fuels, with several activists arrested. What is CERAWeek, anyways? Who or what is the power behind CERAWeek? What functions does CERAWeek perform for the fossil fuel industry power structure? Who were some of the key billionaires at CERAWeek? This primer will address these questions. What is CERAWeek? CERAWeek is a massive, transnational gathering of powerful people tied to the energy industry, including top fossil fuel executives, big financial investors, and high-level government officials and regulators. The Houston Chronicle — newspaper of the fossil fuel capital of the US, where CERAWeek is held — has labelled the event the “Super Bowl of energy,” awash with “energy insiders.” Climate activist Bill McKibben has referred to it as “the hydrocarbon world’s biggest festival, a Davos for carbon.” CERAWeek performs several functions for the energy industry. These include serving as a space to discuss and debate industry trends; engage in networking and dealmaking; hold high-level conversations between executives, investors and regulators; and broadly, to promote and legitimize the industry with a high-profile event. Thousands of participants attend CERAWeek. In 2023, around 7,200 people from 90 countries flocked to the event. It claims to be rated among the top five “corporate leader conferences” worldwide. Leaders from the highest heights of politics and industry attend CERAWeek. Past speakers have included Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Justin Trudeau, Narendra Modi, Henry Kissinger to Bill Gates. This year, new Trump Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum were speakers, along with CEOs or other top executives of fossil fuel companies that span the gamut of the industry, from Big Oil giants to LNG export companies, oil pipeline corporations to utilities. Some of these include ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Oxy, BP, Cheniere, Pioneer, Enbridge, NRG, EQT, Baker Hughes, Hunt Energy, Williams Companies, Hess, NextEra, National Grid, and Freeport LNG — just to name a few. Harold Hamm of Continental Resources — maybe the industry’s closest ally to Donald Trump — was a speaker. Top leaders from industry groups like American Petroleum Institute, American Gas Association and Edison International attended. Critically, major Wall Street investors and tech giants also attended CERAWeek. These include asset managers like BlackRock, private equity firms like Carlyle, Apollo, and Blackstone, and tech corporations like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet (the parent company of Google). Nor is CERAWeek a solely U.S. affair. Government and corporate representatives from countries all over the world — Saudi Arabia to Canada, Turkey to Nigeria, South Korea to Kuwait — attended as well. Who Rules CERAWeek? While CERAWeek is filled with industry representatives, it’s dominated by major corporate players. Different “Partners” sponsor the conference, presumably through hefty fees, and the biggest sponsors gain the most access and power in shaping the event’s tone and content. For example, according to the sponsorship brochure from the 2024 CERAWeek conference, the highest level of sponsorship, which is limited to just a few corporations and firms, is “Foundational.” These sponsors “benefit from the highest levels of access, visibility, and executive support” and “play a leadership role within the CERAWeek community and are provided premier engagement and contribution.” Foundational Partners also “may collaborate with CERAWeek to develop a customized Special Program or community aligned with specific objectives.” This year’s Foundational Partners were Chevron, Amazon, and BlackRock, as well as professional services firm Marsh McLennan and the coal company Xcoal. The next level of Partners are “Strategic,” which “supports active engagement and access across a wide range of the CERAWeek community.” Among other things, Strategic Partners’ “objectives are supported by the CERAWeek Steering Committee,” and these Partners “receive priority consideration to contribute content and access to CERAWeek Private Communities. Strategic Partners for CERAWeek 2025 included ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, EQT, Freeport LNG, NextEra, Carlyle Group, Microsoft, and dozens more. Notably, a major power player behind CERAWeek is Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer-prize winning author who helped found the conference over four decades ago and serves as chairman of CERAWeek and Vice Chairman of S&P Global, the well-known financial services company that runs CERAWeek (read more on Yergin below). The Fossil Fuel Industry, the Houston Power Elite & the Houston Police Foundation The power elite of Houston is deeply intertwined with the fossil fuel industry. Energy companies dominate the board of the city’s main chamber of commerce, the Greater Houston Partnership, making up around a quarter of its membership. Houston is one of the fossil fuel corporate headquarters of the world, home to key global and regional offices of many numerous companies including ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, Occidental, and many others. The fossil fuel industry also has a close relationship with the Houston Police Department through the Houston Police Foundation, a non-profit that channels corporate donations to city police. Oil billionaires like Jeffery Hildebrand sit on the Houston Police Foundation board, and the foundation helps fund police programs, including the Mounted Patrol that aided attacks on climate activists during CERAWeek. The Houston Police Department used horses to try to disperse activists peacefully protesting CERAWeek, injuring and nearly trampling people in the process. Several fossil fuel corporations sponsor the Houston Police Department’s Mounted Patrol horses through the Adopt-A-Horse program. Credit: Luigi Morris. In fact, oil companies like Chevron, Shell and Valero sponsor individual Mounted Patrol horses. (For more on police foundations and their ties to the fossil fuel industry, check out our 2020 story and our 2021 report coauthored with Color of Change). CERAWeek and the Fossil Fuel Industry Power Structure CERAWeek performs several roles within the fossil fuel industry and wider energy power structure. Legitimizing the Fossil Fuel Industry While CERAWeek ultimately functions as a show of force for the fossil fuel industry and a space for it to hash things out, it has a veneer of legitimizing wonkiness and expertise. CERAWeek was founded by Daniel Yergin in the early 1980s, a decorated author who has carved out a space as a benign interlocutor between the fossil fuel industry and civil society — an author with intellectual bona fides who has deep and direct personal ties to the corporate energy world. Yergin has numerous influential ties to academic institutions, like MIT and Columbia University, and government-aligned think tanks like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institution. He has authored several well-known books about the fossil fuel industry — most notably his award-winning The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power — while also serving on advisory boards and boards of directors of key industry groups and think tanks worldwide. Over his career, Yergin has run high-profile energy consulting firms and serves as a Senior Advisor with private equity giant Carlyle Group (a “Strategic Partner” of CERAWeek that is also a major fossil fuel investor). All told, the spectacle of a massive, public-facing conference, well covered by the media, celebrating and discussing the energy industry and its fossil fuel giants, all given a wonkish gloss by analysts, academics and consultants, provides cover for an industry whose core operations are widely known to be driving climate chaos. Networking, Schmoozing, Dealmaking Gatherings like CERAWeek are critical sites for industry networking. CERAWeeks says it convenes “over 450 C-Suite executives, 80 ministers and top officials, and 325 media representatives.” Participants chat, schmooze and socialize behind closed doors or at any number of extended Happy Hours. This helps build and cultivate relationships and allows for conversations that lead to new contracts, deals, positions, and so on. At CERAWeek, this networking is all the more important because many high-level representatives of government and international companies are attending. The energy priorities that are hashed out through these conversations — the formal panels, and also the backroom discussion — can have deep implications for global energy policy and geopolitics (one of the event’s themes). Taking Stock of Industry Trends and Fractions CERAWeek’s huge numbers and ambitious agenda also present a moment for taking stock of the energy industry’s present and its future. Conference themes explore the gamut of areas within the corporate energy world. This year’s themes included Policy and Regulation, Oil and Gas, Power, Grid and Electrification, Trade and Supply Chains, Business Strategies, Minerals and Mining, Technology and Innovation, and more. Different fractions of the energy industry, some aspiring, can also use CERAWeek to make their case. “AI and Digital,” for example, is a conference theme this year. The rise of data centers needed to power AI has strengthened the nexus between the fossil fuel industry, Big Tech, and financial investors, at the expense of a green energy transition. The event is also filled with the world’s top private equity firms and asset managers, who remain not only wedded to fossil fuels but retreated from previous net zero commitments – indeed, Finance (“The Capital Transition”) was a theme of CERAWeek this year. Greenwashing CERAWeek is also a performance in greenwashing. The fossil fuel industry today is simultaneously doubling down on its core business of oil and gas extraction and production while also giving lip service to concerns over carbon emissions and seeking to capture and profit from false solutions like carbon capture and hydrogen. CERAWeek allows the fossil fuel industry to do both these things. The conference is dominated by fossil fuel giants who are currently racing to drill and burn more oil and gas, but also to gobble up subsidies and produce hydrogen plants — falsely promoting hydrogen as a climate “solution.” Indeed, CERAWeek 2025 included themes like “Managing Emissions,” “Climate and Sustainability,” and “Hydrogen and Low-Carbon Fuels.” But as Kate Aronoff reported on a previous CERAWeek: “There’s some people involved with copper and lithium and various things, but the main focus is oil and gas, and with a pretty specific focus within oil and gas on some of the bigger companies.” CERAWeek’s Billionaires Among the most powerful people at CERAWeek are a slew of oil billionaires, tech titans, and fossil fuel financiers who, whether they show up in person, stand to benefit from the discussions and deal-making that occur at the gathering. Among these are: Hundreds of Climate Activists Protest CERAWeek Recognizing the opportunity to disrupt mainstream messaging about CERAWeek, and to confront the fossil fuel industry and lift up the stories of frontline communities fighting fossil fuel infrastructure, dozens of climate justice groups participated in coordinated days of actions protesting CERAWeek. Hundreds of elders, young people, and residents of rural areas and cities, marched to demand an end to fossil fuels and accountability of wealthy polluters. Hundreds of climate activists marched in downtown Houston to protest CERAWeek. Credit: Lauren Parker. Activists specifically focused on the build out of methane gas (also known by euphemism “liquified natural gas”) export terminals along the Gulf South. These export terminals rely on transporting fracked gas via pipelines and have notoriously imperiled local communities due to toxic air releases, overdrawing water resources, and destroying precious marine habitats. In June of 2022, the Freeport LNG terminal actually exploded, sending a 450-foot ball of fire and pollutants into the air, shaking the houses of nearby residents. Freeport LNG’s CEO, billionaire Michael Smith, was a featured speaker at CERAWeek, stating that methane gas was “necessary”, echoing other speakers’ sentiments which downplayed the urgent need for renewable energy sources. At the culmination of the march, eight frontline and Indigenous activists and allies sat in the intersection in front of the CERAWeek conference. The Houston Police Department violently attacked these activists with Mounted Patrol horses before conducting arrests. As noted above, major oil and gas corporations sponsor these horses, underscoring the tight and varied relationships between policing and the energy industry to suppress struggles against fossil fuels. CERAWeek, an extravagant display of billionaire power and the convergence of the fossil fuel industry, government, tech and finance, stood in stark contrast to those in the march – everyday people fighting for clean water and air in their hometowns, sovereignty for Indigenous communities, an end to extractive energy systems, and a liveable future for generations to come.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have dropped after surging in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s election victory (though a White House official has just revealed how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has fallen to around $85,000 per bitcoin, down from a peak of $110,000 per bitcoin in January, as traders scramble to protect their bitcoin from a new, mystery threat. Now, after the Federal Reserve confirmed expectations it could be about to open the “floodgates," Fed chair Jerome Powell has warned the risk of recession is rising—something BlackRock’s head of bitcoin and crypto has predicted could be a “big catalyst” for the bitcoin price. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said the risk of recession has ticked up—something ... More BlackRock's head of bitcoin and crypto thinks could fuel a bitcoin price boom. “I don’t know if we’ll have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for bitcoin,” Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, told Yahoo Finance in an interview, pointing to how recession responses such as increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, lower interest rates and monetary stimulus have historically boosted the bitcoin price. "And it’s catalyzed to some extent over fears of general social disorder,” Mitchnick said. “And that, too, unfortunately, is something that can happen in a recession.” This week, the Fed downgraded its economic growth outlook while raising its inflation projection while leaving interest rates on hold. "If you look at outside forecasts, forecasters have generally raised … their possibility of a recession somewhat, but still at relatively moderate level … [it] has moved up, but it’s not high,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said during his post-interest rate decision press conference. Ahead of Powell’s comments, Moody’s Analytics’ chief economist Mark Zandi told CNN it “feels like we’re being pushed into recession” by Donald Trump’s international trade tariffs. “The recession risks are uncomfortably high and they’re rising,” Zandi said. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen back in recent weeks but remains far higher than before Donald Trump's ... More election victory despite the Federal Reserve warning recession risks are rising. Meanwhile, UCLA Anderson School of Management has published an official “Recession Watch” for the first time in its 73 years of economic forecasts, with its chief economist Clement Bohr predicting Trump “could very well be the author of a deep recession.” Earlier this month, BlackRock’s chief executive Larry Fink warned Trump’s trade policies will stoke inflation—dampening expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025 and invoking the specter of “stagflation”—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises. Fink, who has become one of the most bullish voices supporting bitcoin on Wall Street, led BlackRock in its campaign to get a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now boasting around $50 billion in assets under management.

Iconic ice-cream company Ben & Jerry’s (B&J), founded by two hippies based on knowledge gained through a $5-correspondence-course, is taking on the might of its parent, the Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever. The issue: Unilever has sacked B&J’s chief executive, ostensibly for the ice-cream company’s public support for Palestinian refugees, in alleged contravention of their merger agreement of 2000 that B&J’s board would retain its independence. It’s a classic David-versus-Goliath spectator sport. But the essence of this spat between the owners of dominant brands—a popular ice-cream maker (this columnist’s preferred flavour remains Cherry Garcia, launched in 1985 as homage to Grateful Dead lead guitarist and vocalist Jerry Garcia) and a consumer goods conglomerate—is the influence that geopolitics can have on brands.

Title: Trump’s Policy Toward Latin America: Crippling Sanctions against Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/trump-policy-toward-latin-america/5882481
Time Published: 2025-03-23T10:14:12Z
Full Content:
During his first term, President Donald Trump exerted a “maximum pressure” campaign against perceived U.S. adversaries in Latin America and elsewhere. Among other hardline policies, he levelled crippling sanctions against Venezuela—leading, ironically, to a mass exodus of Venezuelans to the United States—and reversed former President Barack Obama’s rapprochement with Cuba. But just how committed is Trump to fighting communism in Latin America at this particular moment—in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua? Today, it’s anyone’s guess. Trump’s recent threats against Panama, Canada, and Greenland, on top of his clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, take the spotlight off the “real enemies,” as usually defined by Washington. In that sense, Trump’s foreign policy actions in the first two months of his second administration are a far cry from his first, when regime change was the unmistakable goal. In sharp contrast to the rhetoric of his first administration, in his March 4 address to the Joint Session of Congress Trump made no reference to Nicolás Maduro, Miguel Díaz-Canel, or Daniel Ortega. It’s even unclear whether Trump will pursue the use of international sanctions, which he ratcheted up against Venezuela and Cuba in his first government. So far, Trump has indicated that his use of “tariffs as punishment” may be preferable to international sanctions, which, as one insider stated, the president “worries are causing countries to move away from the U.S. dollar.” Unlike Trump’s policies on immigration, trans rights, and taxation, his Latin American policy is plagued by vacillations and uncertainties, a sign of his deepening reliance on a transactional approach to foreign policy. The anti-communist hardliners in and outside of the Republican party are not pleased. Take Venezuela as an example. The Venezuelan opposition led by María Corina Machado had all the reason to be upbeat when Trump won in November and then chose Latin America hawk Marco Rubio as Secretary of State. “Sadly, Venezuela is governed by a narco-trafficking organization,” Rubio declared at his confirmation hearing, in which his appointment was unanimously ratified. He then said that “the Biden administration got played” when it negotiated with Maduro in late- 2022 and issued a license to Chevron, which is “providing billions of dollars into the regimes’ coffers.” With regard to Cuba, Rubio issued an ominous warning: “The moment of truth is arriving, Cuba is literally collapsing.” Events in Syria added to the euphoria on the right. Just days before Trump’s inauguration, Machado told the Financial Times, “Don’t you think [the generals supporting Maduro] look in the mirror and see the generals which Assad left behind?” But then came the friendly encounter between Trump’s envoy for special missions Richard Grenell and Maduro in Caracas in late January, when Maduro agreed to turn over six U.S. prisoners in Venezuela and facilitate the return of Venezuelan immigrants from the United States. Days later, the Biden-approved license with Chevron for exploiting Venezuelan oil, constituting a quarter of the nation’s total oil production, was allowed to roll over. At the same time, Grenell declared that Trump “does not want to make changes to the [Maduro] regime.” To complicate matters further, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it would cancel Biden’s extension of Temporary Protected Status for over 300,000 Venezuelan immigrants, on grounds that “there are notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime that allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.” These developments did not sit well with the Miami hawks and the Venezuelan opposition. Notorious Miami Herald journalist Andres Oppenheimer put it forcefully: “The handshake of Grenell and Maduro fell like a bucket of cold water on many sectors of the Venezuelan opposition… and was like a legitimation of the Maduro government.” Oppenheimer went on to point out that although the Trump government denied it had cut a deal with Maduro, “many suspicions have been raised and will not dissipate until Trump clarifies the matter.” After Grenell’s trip to Venezuela, the issue of the renewal of Chevron’s license took surprising twists and turns. In a video conversation on February 26, Donald Trump Jr. told María Corina Machado that just an hour before, his father had tweeted that Chevron’s license would be discontinued. Following a burst of laughter, a delighted Machado directed remarks at Trump Sr.: “Look, Mr. President, Venezuela is the biggest opportunity in this continent, for you, for the American people, and for all the people in our continent.” . Watch on X . Machado appeared to be attempting to replicate the deal between Zelensky and Trump involving Ukraine’s mineral resources. But simultaneously, Mauricio Claver-Carone, the State’s Department’s Special Envoy for Latin America, told Oppenheimer that the license granted Chevron was “permanent” and automatically renewed every six months. Then, just one week later, Trump reversed his position again. Axios reported that the latest decision was due to pressure from three Florida GOP House members who threatened to withhold votes for Trump’s budget deal. Trump allegedly acknowledged this privately, telling insiders: “They’re going crazy and I need their votes.” Trump’s threats against world leaders come straight out of his 1987 book The Art of the Deal. For some loyalists, the strategy is working like magic. Trump’s approach can be summarized as “attack and negotiate.” “My style of deal-making is quite simple,” he states in the book. “I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing… to get what I’m after.” This is precisely what happened when Trump announced plans to “reclaim” the Panama Canal, prompting a Hong Kong-based firm to reveal plans to sell the operation of two Panamanian ports to a consortium that includes BlackRock. Not surprisingly, Trump took credit for the deal. A similar scenario played out in the case of Colombia, in which President Gustavo Petro yielded on U.S. deportation flights to avert trade retaliations. For the same reasons, Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum began sending 10,000 troops to the northern border to combat irregular crossings and then, on March 6, asked Trump by phone: “’How can we continue to collaborate if the U.S. is doing something that hurts the Mexican people?” In response, Trump temporarily suspended the implementation of 25 percent tariffs on Mexican goods. In The Art of the Deal, Trump boasts about this strategy of bluffing, such as when he told the New Jersey Licensing Commission that he was “more than willing to walk away from Atlantic City if the regulatory process proved to be too difficult or too time-consuming.” Similarly, Trump has repeatedly stated that the United States does not need Venezuelan oil. In fact, global oil volatility and the possibility that other nations will gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves are matters of great concern to Washington. The “Art of the Deal” approach to foreign policy exemplifies Trump’s pragmatic tendency. The Maduro government and some on the left welcome the pragmatism because it leaves open the possibility of concessions by Venezuela in return for the lifting of sanctions. Venezuelan government spokespeople, at least publicly, give Trump the benefit of the doubt by attributing his annulment of Chevron’s license and other adverse decisions to pressure from Miami’s far right. The Wall Street Journal reported that several U.S. businesspeople who traveled to Caracas and “met with Maduro and his inner circle say the Venezuelans were convinced that Trump would… engage with Maduro much like he had with the leaders of North Korea and Russia.” But this optimism overlooks the contrasting currents within Trumpism. Although the convergences are currently greater than the differences, priorities within the MAGA movement sometimes clash. On the one hand, right-wing populism spotlights the issue of immigration, anti-“wokism,” and opposition to foreign aid, all designed to appeal beyond the Republican Party’s traditional upper and upper-middle class base of support. On the other hand, the conventional far right calls for nothing short of regime change and destabilization actions against Venezuela and Cuba. While progressives have sharply different views on Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, the far-right hawks currently define all three governments as “leftist” and, in the recent words of Rubio, “enemies of humanity.” Maduro’s agreement to collaborate on the repatriation of immigrants in return for the renewal of the Chevron license exemplifies the conflicting priorities within Trumpism. For the anti-left far right, the alleged deal was a “betrayal” of principles by Washington, while for the right-wing populists it was a victory for Trump, especially given the enormity of Venezuela’s immigrant population. Another example of clashing priorities upheld by the two currents is the Trump administration’s decision to cut foreign aid programs to a bare minimum. In his recent address to Congress, Trump denounced an $8 million allotment to an LGBTQ+ program in an African nation “nobody has heard of,” and other alleged woke programs. Even Florida’s hawk senator Rick Scott has questioned the effectiveness of foreign aid, saying: “Let’s see: the Castro regime still controls Cuba, Venezuela just stole another election, Ortega is getting stronger in Nicaragua.” Scott’s statement reflects Trump’s transactional thinking regarding the Venezuelan opposition: too many dollars for regime-change attempts that turned out to be fiascos. In contrast, hawk champion Oppenheimer published an opinion piece in the Miami Herald titled “Trump’s Foreign Aid Cuts are a Boon for Dictators in China, Venezuela and Cuba.” The issue of U.S. aid has also produced infighting from an unexpected source: within the Venezuelan right-wing opposition. Miami-based investigative journalist Patricia Poleo, a long-time opponent of Hugo Chávez and Maduro, has accused Juan Guaidó and his interim government of pocketing millions, if not billions, granted them by the U.S. government. Poleo, now a U.S. citizen, claims that the FBI is investigating Guaidó for mishandling the money. The influence of the anti-leftist component of Trumpism can’t be overstated. Trump has become the leading inspiration of what has been called the new “Reactionary International,” which is committed to combatting the Left around the world. Furthermore, the hawks who have expressed interest in toppling the Maduro government (which the populist current is not at all opposed to either)—including Rubio, Elon Musk, Claver-Carone, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz—populate Trump’s circle of advisors. It is not surprising that during the honeymoon phase of Trump’s presidency, a populist wish list would receive considerable attention. But the annexation of the Panama Canal, Canada, and Greenland is unrealizable, as is the conversion of Gaza into a Riviera of the Middle East. His tariff scheme is not far behind. Furthermore, while his use of intimidation has helped him gain concessions, the effectiveness of this bargaining tactic is limited—threats lose power when endlessly repeated. Finally, Trump’s unfulfilled promises to lower food prices and achieve other economic feats will inevitably add to the disillusionment of his supporters. Trump loathes losing and, in the face of declining popularity, he is likely to turn to more realistic goals that can count on bipartisan support in addition to endorsement from the commercial media. In this scenario, the three governments in the hemisphere perceived to be U.S. adversaries are likely targets. Short of U.S. boots on the ground—which would not garner popular support—military or non-military action cannot be discarded against Venezuela, Cuba, or Nicaragua, or, perhaps, Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: RWA News: Fidelity Files for OnChain U.S. Treasury Fund, Joining the Asset Tokenization Race

Asset manager Fidelity Investments has filed paperwork to register a blockchain-based, tokenized version of its U.S. dollar money market fund, aiming to join the tokenized asset race. According to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company seeks to register an "OnChain" share class of its Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX) and use blockchains as transfer agent. FYHXX holds cash and U.S. Treasury securities and was launched late last year. The Onchain class of the fund currently uses the Ethereum (ETH) network, and the firm may expand to other blockchains in the future, the filing said. The registration is subject to regulatory approval, with the product expected to become effective on May 30. The filing happened as global banks and asset managers increasingly put traditional financial instruments such as government bonds, credit, and funds on blockchain rails, a process often referred to as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). They do so to pursue operational and efficiency gains and faster, around-the-clock settlements. Fidelity, with $5.8 trillion in assets under management, is the latest traditional financial heavyweight seeking to enter the fast-growing tokenized U.S. Treasuries space. Blackrock (BLK), in partnership with digital asset firm Securitize, launched a similar tokenized T-bill fund last March called BUIDL and has become the market leader with nearly $1.5 billion of assets, rwa.xyz data shows. Franklin Templeton's fund, which was the first on-chain money market product, gathered $689 million in assets since its 2021 debut. The entire tokenized U.S. Treasury market is currently worth $4.77 billion, growing almost 500% over the past year, per rwa.xyz. Fidelity is also one of the largest issuers of spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S., with its $16.5 billion FBTC and $780 million FETH, per SoSoValue data.

Title: Thrifted gifts: ‘If you’re worried about the environment, it’s conscience-free shopping’

“When somebody has gifted you something that has been thrifted, they put a huge amount of effort into it,” says vintage enthusiast Naomi Fitzgibbon. As owner of her own online boutique Vintage Finds You, Fitzgibbon specialises in second-hand fashion – “Irish vintage is the holy grail for me” – but she has a knack for unearthing all sorts of rare goods, and is passionate about thrifted gifting as a more sustainable alternative to buying something new. Gift-giving is one of five “love languages” coined by American author and radio host Gary Chapman in his 1992 book, which have since entered the cultural lexicon. If, like Fitzgibbon, you find joy in gift-giving, then opting to seek out thrifted gifts for your special someone might elicit an even greater sense of fulfilment. The appeal of giving or receiving thrifted presents is the fact that they are “so different, and they’re never going to find them anywhere else,” says Fitzgibbon. “They’re unique and special.” When on the hunt for gifts for family and friends at markets, in charity shops and online, she puts “a lot of thought into trying to find something they want, but that they’re not going to find anywhere else”. The item will hopefully be “a one-off thing” that can be treasured for years to come. If you are unsure whether a second-hand gift is right for someone, “test the water and see what they say,” she says. “You can always ask” for their opinion, by saying something like: “What would you think about that, would you wear it?” You’ll soon know whether the water is hot or cold. “If you’re into vintage yourself and people ask ‘Where did you get that’ and you go, ‘Oh, it’s vintage’ and they’re turning their nose up, you know it’s not going to work for them,” says Fitzgibbon. “Most of my friends and family appreciate vintage pieces, but there’s no point in buying [second-hand] for [for some people] because it’s just not their thing.” You could consider a piece of jewellery like a bracelet or necklace if second-hand clothes aren’t their cup of tea, she adds. “Ask the vendor as well, because they’re probably used to dealing with people who might be a little unsure.” Approaching your gift shopping with “an idea of what their likes and dislikes are, and what they are into” helps narrow the focus. “Homeware? Glassware? You can find some incredible vintage books in some of the Oxfams,” says Fitzgibbon, showing off a Japanese hand-lacquered jewellery box she found in Blackrock Market in Dublin. She is a regular visitor to Dublin’s various flea markets, and mentions Thomas Street as one hub. “There’s the Milk Market in Limerick, and some really good ones in Belfast as well,” she says. One of the most cherished thrifted gifts Fitzgibbon has received is a vintage silk Chinese hand-embroidered jacket. “It was a gift from my husband as he knows I’m fascinated by oriental vintage silks like this. He got it in Naples.” She wore the piece to a recent school reunion. Delphine Velut and Richard Harte run Le Zeitgeist Bohemia Flea Market in Phibsborough, north Dublin. Every second Sunday of the month, about 100 traders gather at the venue tucked behind Phibsborough Shopping centre. Some 60 stalls, featuring everything from leather goods, antiques, prints, vintage toys and clothes to mid-century furniture, handmade jewellery, candles and crafts can fit inside, sheltered from the elements. Another 40 stalls, full of fashion and bric-a-brac, occupy the outdoor area. The market has become immensely popular among the local community. “We have thousands of people coming through our door on a given Sunday,” says Harte. “For us it’s about [offering] a wide variety of quality things and also keeping an eye on what’s happening in the community. There are some lovely stories about traders testing their product and using us for a platform and then they’ve gone on to much bigger things, maybe opening shops in the city.” They both particularly enjoy the eclectic selection of trinkets on offer from “the bric-a-brac guys”. “We just love the outside area,” says Harte. “Although we do have some art and craft stalls, the emphasis is on creating a dirty free market, for want of a better word ... It’s so real.” The pair are proud to have created “a place where people can go and rummage and just not know what they’re going to find”. Like Fitzgibbon, Harte is a big fan of thrifted gifting. “If you’re conscious about the environment, it’s conscience-free shopping.” “All my gifts around Christmas time, I’d get them in the market. No matter who [the potential recipients] are or what they’re into, you’re going to find something there that’s going to tick the boxes.” It is important to keep an open mind and embrace the unexpected when on a thrifting mission for a gift. “Have something in mind but be prepared to go home with something completely different,” Harte advises. As a trader himself, he suggests customers bringing cash – “because it’s harder to haggle with a credit card”. “The first price is not necessarily the end price. They’re expecting a haggle. There’s always a bit of movement on the price.” Come prepared to root around. “It’s not the high street. Not everything is going to be laid out. You need to be in that mode, prepared to rummage through and seek out the bargains.” Market prices range broadly, so there’s something for every budget. “You could buy something for 50 cents, or a sideboard off the mid-century furniture guy for €1,500.” “If you have something in mind, just speak to [the traders] and tell them what you’re looking for. They could have something to bring you next month. That’s my advice on looking for the perfect gift.” Robert Reddin, one of the organisers of The Fairyhouse Market in Ratoath in Co Meath, echoes Harte’s advice over haggling. “If I was going for the first time I’d make sure I had small denominations. You are expected to do a bit of haggling.” The car boot sale, founded in 1991, operates every Sunday from the grounds of the Fairyhouse Race Course, except for race days. “My father started the market over 30 years ago with a partner and myself, and then other partners soon took over,” says Reddin says. The market has a selection of traders offering a mix of brand new goods, second-hand items and food stalls. “You never know what you’re going to find. As they say, one man’s junk is another man’s treasure. There are things that you don’t see in the average shop or shopping centre.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Her mother gave her 20 reasons not to buy – but she went sale agreed anyway

For Gráinne Wynne, owner of Beautiful South, a fashion boutique in Rathmines, 2020 was a difficult year. It started with her father having to go into a nursing home. Then the pandemic happened and then she separated from her husband. Divorced and with two children to house, and a finite amount of money with which to do so, she had to box clever to find them a new home. Like many of us, she was looking for something a bit special that she could make her own. She wanted a contemporary look, and had a penchant for poured concrete – as anyone who has popped into her shop on Castlewood Avenue in the Swan Centre, Rathmines, and coveted the brands on the hangers there will know. The place looks cool, but the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. It’s not the kind of place to sniffily look you up and down for daring to cross its threshold. She wanted a home that looked and felt similarly, and viewed about 100 properties in her attempt to find it. She even got as far as going sale agreed on a small house in Killiney. It had a big back garden with the potential to extend into it – subject of course to having the money to do so. Building costs put her off. And while she thought she wanted a garden, she realised that she didn’t have the time to attend to it. These combined reasons meant she didn’t go through with the sale. Instead, she followed her heart. Discreetly hidden off Main Street in Blackrock village, Co Dublin, she found a mews of about 118sq m. Originally configured as a commercial office, it had come to the market with residential planning permission. When she saw the space, her heart missed a beat. “My friends thought I was crazy,” she recalls. So did her mother. So much so that she wrote her a letter listing some 20 reasons not to buy it. She was in favour of her buying something more conventional, she recalls. Wynne understood her concerns. “Working in retail is a massive struggle. I had a finite amount of money and no pension,” she explains. “I went with her the first day she visited it,” her 88-year-old mother Marie Wynne says. “When you want something, you look at the plusses. You don’t see the minuses.” For the matriarch, one of the minuses was the number of stairs in the property. It didn’t have a garden either, she recalls, and her daughter Gráinne had wanted an outdoor green space. “If you’re a mother it’s your job to point out snags. Once it’s done, it’s done.” Laid out over four floors, with one room on each, the property’s layout meant Wynne could easily get her 10,000 steps a day in ascending and descending the spiral staircase that forms the spine of the building. Her mother had also flagged this issue. “She might need a pulley to get up the stairs in the future,” she laughs. Mother and daughter toured the area after that first viewing, walking down by the sea, and she realised all the village had to offer, including a wide expanse of Dublin Bay in lieu of a green space. The 88-year-old viewed the refurbishment for the first time only on Christmas Day. “It’s terrific,” she says, having now climbed up to the second floor on both December 25th and again on December 31st. “It’s definitely right for her.” She was over the moon, says Gráinne. “She came back on New Year’s Eve for a party and loved the vibe.” Friends who were equally sceptical were “blown away” by the refurbishment, Gráinne recalls. Fees on commercial buildings Change of use planning permission had already been granted thanks to a design submitted by Node Architects on behalf of the vendor before they brought the unit to market. In the application letter, available to view on the planning website of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the practice noted “that with the increase of opportunities for people to work from home came a decrease for demand for small office buildings such as this one”. Constructed in 2000 with ocean-liner-like oval windows and slightly curved walls, the four-story cedar-clad space had been vacant, the firm pointed out. In an acute housing shortage, a conversion to residential would create a new dwelling unit in the centre of Blackrock village, contributing to its vibrancy. As it was unoccupied, Wynne didn’t have to pay any rates. But commercial stamp duty was an issue. A good conveyancing solicitor was essential, Wynne says, when buying this type of property. Based in Carrick-on-Shannon, Carol McCormack Solicitors pointed out that while the planning had been applied for it hadn’t yet been acted on. The works and changes to the property would commence only once Wynne was the owner. “So legally, it was still viewed as a commercial unit, which had Revenue implications,” McCormack, explains. “Commercial stamp duty is at a rate of 7.5 per cent, rather than the residential 1 per cent rate.” Once planning is acted on there is a possibility of a rebate, she adds. With house-hunters casting their eyes wider to try to buy alternative options to the restricted stock levels of more traditional residential homes, McCormack feels we’re going to see more of this. The home is accessed through a vehicular arch and while the office had the rights to parking outside, the change-of-use application made the point that this space could be used as an outdoor terrace, In the same application Node Architects’ rationale was that “given the location of the building with easy access to many public transport modes, it is proposed to convert this parking space to an outdoor terrace serving the new dwelling. This will contribute to the open space requirements for the new house and there are additional balconies and terraces on each of the upper levels of the building which also add to this.” But, having committed to the purchase and the additional stamp duty fees, Wynne was left with a really tight budget to do all the works. It needed plumbing throughout, to fit the principal bathroom on the first-floor level, a shower en suite in one of the two bedrooms and a guest wc off her room. These have been fitted with black sanitary ware from the Bathroom Boutique. The electrics also needed attention. The bathrooms were originally server rooms and all their fuseboards had to be relocated, explains Greg Murray of Carne Electrical. “There was also much rerouting of data cables.” The property has two bedrooms and a mezzanine level. There is a charcoal and an off-white palette throughout, with microcement floors and on some walls, supplied by Stone Seal. There is a tiny terrace on each floor which gives access to outside space. Each room is a long rectangle shape that suits contemporary living, especially when zoning an open-plan kitchen diner. While Node Architects had suggested installing it on the mezzanine top floor, she opted for the floor below, because it had the largest footprint. The mezzanine level has been glassed in to dim down sound and heat transference. She retained all the fire doors, made by O’Carroll Joinery when the property was constructed. Greenery from Urban Plant Life, Howbert & Mays, Diarmuid Gavin at Dunnes Stores and Windy Ridge populates each floor. “I could see the potential. I believe in taking something simple and making it beautiful,” she says. She had a lot of help from Irish Conservatories and Building Services, and from her best friend Rod Hayden, who most recently helped her char her timber stair treads. “I’ve learned a lot in the last four years and would feel absolutely confident doing another refurbishment,” she concludes. So much so that she’s named the property Athena, after the Greek goddess of wisdom. There are still some minor elements to tease out. Living so centrally and beside food businesses means that the commercial bins are being fenced in, and an industrial ventilator that is making more noise than she’d like is being sorted, she says. “The place had never been residential before and we’re working together to remedy it.” irishconservatories.com; beautiful.south; © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

And we've basically landed right back where we started. Right now, Bitcoin's price now stands at $84,150 per coin after not budging over a seven-day period, according to CoinGecko data. It's up 0.2% on the day, but totally flat on the week. The asset jumped briefly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters Wednesday that everything was under control and that President Trump's tariffs would have a "transitory" effect on inflation. Bitcoin had been dipping—just like stocks—whenever President Trump abruptly announced tariffs over the past month. But investors seemed to like the news from Powell. American Bitcoin investors had been fast cashing out of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month, but that all changed this week, Farside Investors data shows. Every day this week, money has flooded back into the new vehicles, with over half a billion entering the funds by Wednesday. About $734 million worth of funds reentered Bitcoin ETFs this week as investor sentiment has changed as speculators expect interest rates to lower this year. Note that the positive sentiment hasn't extended to all crypto ETFs, as Ethereum funds are collectively nursing a now 13-day losing streak (including Friday's fresh data)—even as Bitcoin funds show green over the last six days. Still, investors could still be in for a bumpy ride as data shows that Bitcoin's volatility is at a six-month high due, as worries about the U.S. economy and geopolitical tensions push people to adopt a more "risk-off" mindset. Amberdata Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt that volatility—in the short-term, at least—was likely here to stay. And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said it would put right the previous administration's "mess" by being clearer on rules for the digital asset industry, made a statement that applies to Bitcoin mining: proof-of-work mining operations do not need to register their actions as they "do not involve the offer and sale of securities." According to the regulator, as a miner's "expectation to receive rewards is not derived from any third party's managerial or entrepreneurial efforts upon which the network's success depends," the activity does not come under the SEC's jurisdiction. Under crypto-friendly President Donald Trump, the regulator appears to be adopting a more relaxed approach to the space, and and has already scrapped a number of lawsuits and investigations targeting firms in the space. Meanwhile, BlackRock—the world's biggest asset manager—has tried to clear the air about Bitcoin... again. In an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box, the firm's Digital Asset Head Robert Mitchnick said that calling the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap a "risk-on" asset was not exactly accurate. "What we've seen lately seems to be self-fulfilling and actually a self-inflicted wound by some of the research and commentary that the industry does, leaning into this idea of it as a risk-on asset at times," Mitchnick said. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has been one of the most successful BTC ETFs since its launch last January. Is the Wall Street giant trying to get more clients for its fund?

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has agreed to a 10-year, $1.4 trillion investment framework, the White House announced on Friday, saying it will "substantially increase the UAE’s existing investments in the U.S. economy." The White House said the investments would be in AI infrastructure, semiconductors, energy, American manufacturing and more. The White House said in a press release that the UAE agreed to the framework after President Donald Trump hosted the UAE National Security Advisor, HH Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, for a meeting in the Oval Office.

Title: How Binance holds over two-thirds of the Stablecoin market

With huge stablecoin reserves and Futures trading volumes, there seems to be no competition at all. Binance has consistently maintained a dominant position in the crypto exchange landscape, with recent data highlighting its significant edge over competitors. From holding a commanding share of stablecoin reserves to leading the pack in Futures trading volumes, the exchange’s market presence continues to outpace other exchanges, Needless to say, these findings have simply reinforced Binance’s role as a key player in the crypto space. In today’s market, stablecoins remain the backbone of on-chain liquidity and trading efficiency – Providing price stability, reducing friction in capital movement, and serving as the default unit of account for traders worldwide. As of March 2025, Binance holds a staggering 66% share of stablecoin reserves among major exchanges, far outpacing rivals like OKX, Bitget, and Bybit. In fact, according to CryptoQuant data, Binance’s reserve-to-market cap ratio has climbed steadily since late 2023, while competitors have seen their shares stagnate or decline. Source: CryptoQuant The data underlined this growing gap – Binance and Binance.US dominate over two-thirds of the stablecoin ecosystem on centralized exchanges, bolstering the exchange’s deep liquidity and investor confidence. With $31 billion in reserves, Binance benefits from strong user inflows and a robust institutional presence. Meanwhile, new stablecoin projects in 2025 – across Layer 1s, fintech startups, and even potential government initiatives – only deepen the exchange’s strategic grip on this rapidly expanding asset class. Binance remains the undisputed leader in stablecoin reserves, holding approximately $31 billion – More than double the combined reserves of OKX, Bybit, and Coinbase. The data revealed a dramatic hike in Binance’s stablecoin holdings since late 2024. This coincided with renewed retail inflows, ETF-driven market optimism, and USDC’s resurgence after Circle’s January deal with BlackRock to expand tokenized treasuries. Source: Cryptoquant While Binance.US also saw some steady growth, competitors like Bitget and Kraken may appear dwarfed in comparison. Binance’s dominance stems from its deep liquidity pools, low-fee structure, and aggressive market-making programs that attract both institutional and retail users. Additionally, its early integration of stablecoins like FDUSD and TUSD as zero-fee trading pairs has kept volumes high. With new Layer 1 ecosystems launching stablecoins, Binance continues to capture most of those inflows. In January 2025, Binance blew past competitors with a staggering $1.08 trillion in monthly Futures trading volume – Nearly doubling Bybit ($509 billion) and eclipsing Coinbase and OKX. While February and March saw a pullback to $717 billion and $498 billion, respectively, Binance still commands the Futures arena. Its lead stems from an unmatched combination of deep liquidity, product breadth, and accessibility for retail and institutional users alike. Source: Cryptoquant The exchange benefits from an intuitive interface, low trading fees, and advanced risk-management tools that cater to high-volume futures traders. In mid-January, Binance also delisted a series of cross and isolated margin pairs, a move that may have streamlined capital allocation and improved trading efficiency for institutional accounts. To put it simply, despite regulatory overhang in some regions, Binance’s global reach keeps it ahead of the curve in this high-stakes derivatives market.

Title: Ireland look to show strides they have made by upsetting France in Six Nations opener

It is a measure of the huge strides made by the Irish team compared to the corresponding first round game 12 months ago in Le Havre that Scott Bemand and his players are embracing much higher expectations of themselves. A year ago the Irish head coach spoke of firing a few shots at the French in that opening game, and succeeded to some extent with two tries in the last 10 minutes. Out of little acorns and all that. Now, having won five of their last seven games, including victories over Australia and New Zealand this season, they expect to be competitive against France and believe they can beat opponents whom Ireland have only overcome three times in 32 previous meetings. Bemand accepts that this year is the tougher schedule, with the big two of France and England (who have finished first and second since 2017) at home whereas they are away to their Celtic and Italian rivals. Yet in insisting they have to move their game further forward in this 2025 Six Nations, Bemand went so far as to say: “We’re hungry to close the gap on the monopoly held by England and France to a degree. They’ve always been the top two in the Six Nations for a good while.” Recalling last year’s Six Nations, Bemand said: “We were able to spend time developing our game, becoming harder to beat, sorting our set-piece out, getting more tries on the board, scoring against France for the first time in three years, scoring against England for the first time in I don’t know how long. “There’s little moments in games that we’ve been able to build. When we went to WXV1, we got more of those moments. We were more in games to the point that we beat a Tier One nation and secondly we were disappointed to lose to Canada. “France are no mugs. France are a very good team, incredibly talented group. Last World Cup they were a kick away from being in the final against the Red Roses. They’re a good group but we believe we’re going to cause more problems this time. We’re going to be a harder team to beat. “Coming out of this fixture on the weekend, this could very well be a quarter-final in a World Cup. So we want to come out of this knowing we can beat them, whether that means beating them or whether that means we’ve got the game to beat them. And by the time we get to a World Cup hopefully, it’s the next step on from whatever we achieve in this Six Nations.” Ireland retain only seven of the starting XV from last year’s 38-17 defeat to the French, while Les Bleus also retain just seven as Gaelle Mignot and David Ortiz make six changes to the French side compared to their last outing, a 39-14 defeat to a New Zealand side which Ireland had beaten 29-17 in the WXV1 last autumn, which suggests the gap has closed further this season. “They’ve had a relatively tough WXV1, and they said they’re reviewed hard,” said Bemand. “Bringing them to our shores gives us a great opportunity to test ourselves.” Still, the centre partnership of Gabrielle Vernier and Nassira Konde remains intact, while inside them Carla Arbez will make her first appearance for France since November 2023 and alongside the heartbeat of their team, the 61-times capped Toulouse scrumhalf Pauline Bourdon Sansus. Ireland perhaps exceeded expectations slightly last season with a third-place finish to secure qualification for both the WXV1 and the World Cup later this year. Although results and the schedule fell their way, they made the most of their luck and have benefited from competing against more elite teams in WXV1. “Getting the same position again is harder to do this year,” admitted Bemand. “So, if we came third, and we win three games, we’ve done better than we did this year. We also want to stretch ourselves. We’re targeting trying to close that gap on the top two, we want to become World Cup contenders. At some point, we got to take some chunks out of a Tier One nation and for us that’s doing something against a France or an England. With the successful reintroduction of the Sevens players, this Irish team has more firepower and more of a cutting edge than the side which lost to France a year ago. Brittany Hogan, Erin King and Aoife Wafer give them more go-forward carrying, Dannah O’Brien brings a strong kicking game and with Stacey Flood hitting the line, Amee-Leigh Costigan’s head-to-head with her French counterpart as captain and winger, Marine Menager, could be worth the admission money alone. France have usually brought more power and pace to this fixture but Bemand is an astute user of his replacements, and has opted for a 6-2 split in the belief that the benches will go some way toward determining the outcome. If Ireland are still in the mix at that stage, then anything is possible.

Title: Dollar-pegged stablecoins are a hedge against volatility

Institutional interests soar as market uncertainty highlights the role of stablecoins in navigating economic pressures. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post from Maksym Sakharov, Co-Founder & Group CEO of WeFi. The current markets are experiencing tailwinds due to the tariffs imposed by the U.S. administration and retaliatory measures from trading partners. So far, however, the market proponents are saying that Trump’s tariffs are primarily a negotiation strategy, and their effect on businesses and consumers will remain manageable. Adding to uncertainty are the inflationary pressures that could challenge the Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting outlook as inflation is still stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. Besides that, an impending fiscal debate in Washington over the federal budget is also causing jitters in the market. Resolving the debt ceiling remains a pressing issue, as the Treasury is currently relying on “extraordinary measures” to meet U.S. financial obligations. The exact timeline for when these measures will be exhausted is unclear, but analysts anticipate they may run out after the first quarter. While the administration has proposed eliminating the debt ceiling, this could face resistance from fiscal conservatives in Congress. Despite these macroeconomic uncertainty, one sector that is experiencing steady growth is stablecoins, according to a recent report. Much of the volume is driven by flows in USDT and USDC. Stablecoins started as an experiment – a programmable digital currency that would make it easier for users to enter the crypto market and trade different digital assets. A decade later, they are a critical part of the wider digital financial infrastructure. At present, the stablecoin market cap stands at a record $226 billion and continues to expand. Demand in emerging markets drives this growth. According to a recent Ark Invest report, Dollar-pegged stablecoins are dominating the market. They account for over 98% of the stablecoin supply, with Gold and Euro-backed stablecoins only sharing a small portion of the market. In addition to this, Tether’s USDT accounts for over 60% of the total market. ARK’s research suggests that the market will expand and include Asian currency-backed stablecoins. Besides that, digital assets are going through a shift marked by “stablecoinization” and “dollarization.” Asian nations like China and Japan have offloaded record amounts of US Treasuries. Saudi Arabia has ended its 45-year petrodollar agreement, and BRICS nations are increasingly bypassing the SWIFT network to reduce reliance on the US dollar. Traditionally, Bitcoin and Ether served as the primary entry points into the digital asset ecosystem. However, over the past two years, stablecoins have taken the lead, now representing 35% to 50% of on-chain transaction volumes. Despite global regulatory headwinds, emerging markets have been adopting stablecoins. In Brazil, 90% of crypto transactions are done via stablecoins, primarily used for international purchases. A Visa report ranks Nigeria, India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil as the most active stablecoin markets, and Argentina ranks second in stablecoin holdings. Additionally, 6 out of every 10 purchases in the country were made using stablecoins pegged to the dollar, with near parity between USDC and USDT. This shift towards stablecoins in Argentina is driven by high inflation and the need to protect against the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. Clearly, in countries with unstable currencies, people turn to stablecoins such as USDT to safeguard their wealth. In addition to making cross-border transactions easier, this adoption offers a hedge against local currency volatility. This signals a serious challenge to outdated financial systems. Analysts predict that the 2025 stablecoin boom will push market capitalization to $400 billion or more. Projections suggest that stablecoins could reach a market cap of $3 trillion over the next five years. Most importantly, financial institutions are joining this trend. Stripe recently completed a $1 billion acquisition of Bridge, a startup that builds stablecoin infrastructure. Traditional banks such as BBVA plan to launch their own stablecoins by the end of 2025. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller described stablecoins as an important innovation. He stated that digital currencies can cut reliance on payment intermediaries, lower global costs, and improve efficiency. Last year, commerce nominee Howard Lutnick said stablecoins help support the dollar. Major Wall Street players like Bank of America, BlackRock, BNY Mellon, CBOE, Charles Schwab, and Citi are investing in the sector. Their participation signals that stablecoins are set to transform global payments. The trend is clear: stablecoins are no longer a crypto experiment — they are becoming a core part of financial infrastructure in emerging markets to move money globally. As adoption accelerates, the question is not if stablecoins will transform payments but how quickly they will stand alongside — or even replace — outdated financial systems.

Title: The Routledge Companion to 21st-century Irish Writing: academics deliver hefty report from the coalface on the state of our culture
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/review/2025/03/22/the-routledge-companion-to-21st-century-irish-writing-academics-deliver-hefty-report-from-the-coalface-on-the-state-of-our-culture/
Time Published: 2025-03-22T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
The problem with a great deal of academic writing comes down to one word: hedging. I don’t know why the mark of intellection should have become the refusal boldly to advance a claim. The following is a parody, but it gets at what I mean: “Certain discourses of embodiedness can, even if we take into account the various persuasive critiques of the very word ‘embodiedness’ advanced by Theorist, Thinker and Frenchman, be understood as suggesting the possible formulation of spaces in which the body might be thought anew.” Possible. Might. Take into account. The eyes of the non-academic reader glaze over. Why not just say what you think? I don’t mean to mock. I’m an academic myself. I’ve had my own tussles with Theorist, Thinker and Frenchman. But it seems to me that we are now at a point in history when academic critics of culture need to start saying what they mean as clearly as they can. Social media hourly pours its effluent into the river of truth. Most of our rulers no longer bother to pretend they’re not lying. “The zone,” in Steve Bannon’s sinister formulation, is being “flooded” – flooded, that is, with bulls**t intended to distract. Academics, particularly liberal and left-wing academics, can no longer afford to hedge. They need to stop talking to each other and start talking to the world – if it will listen. These thoughts are provoked, somewhat indirectly, by a reading of The Routledge Companion to 21st-century Irish Writing, a huge, various and stimulating anthology of academic essays on contemporary Irish culture assembled by Anne Fogarty (who teaches at UCD) and Eugene O’Brien (who teaches at Mary Immaculate College, Limerick). Editing such a book is a heroic endeavour. There are 35 essays here, each one fearsomely accoutred with endnotes, references, in-line citations. (A parenthetical suggestion to academics: if you want to hedge, hedge in the endnotes. That’s what they’re for.) Getting that many academics to pull together is, proverbially, like herding cats. But Fogarty and O’Brien are expert cat-herders. They have produced an important book. It is not, alas, priced for civilian readers: £215 for the hardback. Academic publishing is badly in need of reform. But that’s another story. The Routledge Companion is important because what has characterised 21st-century Ireland is change and because we need all the help we can muster if we want to think about this change and what it means. I was born in 1981, which means I have lived through radical social transformations that show no sign of stopping: the end of Catholic theocracy, the erosion of Civil War politics, the neoliberalisation of the economy, the growth of the middle class, the ambiguous aftermath of the Troubles, net immigration, housing crisis, climate change, racial diversity, the first ugly shoots of a far-right politics. To live in 21st-century Ireland is to live in uncertainty. What country, friends, is this? Then again, it is hard to think about the present. In their introduction, Fogarty and O’Brien observe that “to read the contemporary is a vexed matter and not as smooth as presupposed”. Well, quite. Kierkegaard is often quoted to the effect that life must be lived forwards, but can only be understood backwards, though he didn’t quite say this. What he did say was that, time-bound as we are, there can be no static point from which to understand your life at all. (Tough break.) [ The 100 best Irish books of the 21st century: how we made the list and what it says about the state of Irish fictionOpens in new window ] The editors know that this applies to history and culture too. Their response is to construe the present as a historical moment like any other – as knowable as the past, and (crucially) as unknowable. “The present may seem to be the area of cultural production that we should know best,” they write, “but, in fact, it is one that faces us with as many questions, problems and conundrums as the study of any other historical eras.” To study the contemporary, they note, is to experience a “sense of estrangement”. But such a sense of estrangement is enormously useful. The estranged mind – that is, the critic’s mind – is like the cow in the Gary Larson Far Side cartoon who looks up suddenly and says, “Hey, wait a minute! This is grass! We’ve been eating grass!” We need that cow. Otherwise, we’re just chewing the cud. So, what kind of grass have we been eating? Note carefully the title: not “21st-century Irish Literature” but “21st-century Irish Writing”. There are four big sections. The first looks at prose, and includes, among other pieces, Liam Lanigan’s essay Counterfactual Geographies on Paul Murray’s The Mark and the Void (2015); Eamon Maher on Representations of Catholicism in Contemporary Irish Fiction; María Amor Barros-del Rio on The Ethics of Care in Sally Rooney’s Novels; and Anne Fogarty on Animals in Short Stories by Contemporary Irish Women Writers. Part Two looks at poetry – it’s called A Poetics of the Unfinished and the Transformative, suggesting two perspectives through which not just contemporary Irish poetry, but contemporary Ireland itself, can be understood. This section includes an illuminating and passionate survey of contemporary Irish queer poetry by Kit Fryatt, and an essay by the always-interesting Eoin Flannery on Contemporary Irish Ecopoetics, which stresses the ethical subversions made possible by an ecopoetic approach. The third section looks at theatre and it reminds us that the stage is generally where we go, in Ireland, when we want to think about class (otherwise our great unspoken subject). There are long reflections on the work of THISISPOPBABY (by Martin Kenny and Miriam Haughton), on ethnotheatre in Northern Ireland (by Lisa Fitzpatrick), and on post-2008 working-class theatre (this is a contribution from an early-career scholar, Clara Mallon, who is to be commended: we need more, we always need more, honest and perceptive writing about class in Ireland). Part four is New Voices, New Forms, New Modes of Material Production. It includes Irish Fantasy Fiction in the 21st-century by that one-man crusade for Irish genre studies, Jack Fennell; Molly Slavin on Global Irish Crime Fiction in the 21st-century; and Claire Lynch on The Personal Essay and life-writing more broadly. The final section also moves beyond the textual to look at how and where texts are published (this is a big trend right now, in literary studies). Thus, a pair of essays on literary journals: Elke D’hoker on The Stinging Fly and its preferred modes of short fiction, and Liam Harrison on the journal scene as such. The last piece in the book is Languages and Publishing in Contemporary Irish Writing by Tim Groenland and Margaret Kelleher, which thinks carefully about the conditions at present influencing translation, publishing initiatives and arts funding in Ireland. To say it’s a mixed bag is to miss the point: it’s supposed to be a mixed bag. The editors are clear about this. What they sought to assemble, they say, was a collection of “critical readings at the coalface of 21st-century writing that reflect on, theorise and tease out current cultural momentums, energies and blockages”. The book was “conceived of as initial soundings in our current moment rather than a sweeping or definitive set of overviews”. One of criticism’s jobs is to do aesthetic triage on the busy waiting room of contemporary art – to attempt to distinguish, in other words, the good from the bad, and the good from the great. The Routledge Companion doesn’t really do this. What I mean is it lets in a lot of bad art and leaves out a lot of good. Its contributors now and then expend their intellects on works that really aren’t worth it. But this is to be expected from a book that is essentially an interim report – a collective dispatch from, as the editors say, “the coalface”. (Putting it this way makes art and culture sound like not much fun, actually. But we’ve all done our bit at the fringe plays and the poetry readings. We get it.) The great value of such a book, produced by diverse hands, is that it allows you to gain precisely what none of its individual contributors pretend to offer: a synoptic, or near-synoptic, overview of Ireland in the 21st century. What’s the “TL;DR”? Catholicism: creeping in again through the back door. (They haven’t gone away, you know.) We need to fund more translators. The exciting emergence of non-white Irish artists. There is a general and rather bewildered sense of destabilisation, of shifting ground. Several contributors cite Zygmunt Bauman’s notion of “liquid modernity”: the idea that a computer-based, financialised global economy has severed us from the old “heavy” ties of community; now we float free, and lost. We are living through a time of (as the title of one essay has it) “epochal change”. Interestingly, the editors note that “older paradigms and theoretical lenses like postcolonialism seem no longer to have purchase”. They mean in universities, but the insight holds good more generally. It must be 10 years or more since I last heard anyone blame our colonial past for some quirk of the Irish psyche. Are we post-postcolonial, at last? Huge, if true. Ah, but what about that other empire, now messily expiring on the other side of the Atlantic? A reckoning with Ireland in the age of US cultural hegemony is conspicuously absent from this book. But it might be too soon to expect any such thing. Also strangely missing from the volume as a whole: the internet. What it’s done to us. What we’ve done with it. Even so, the assembled essays bear out the truth of the editors’ opening assertion: that “Irish writing in the 21st century appears significantly different from that of the 20th century” and “there are distinct areas where these differences can be pinpointed and explored”. A tiny bit of hedging: that “appears”. But we’ll let that slide. Ireland in the 21st century is different. So is its art. Once we were certain, of certain things, at least. Now we are uncertain about almost everything. Art is the great stable vessel in which we can hold that uncertainty for long uncertain moments. Here is a book to help us think about our art, and ourselves, now that we most urgently need to.

Title: BlackRock, NYSE push for staked ETH ETFs – Why it matters

Time Published: 2025-03-22T03:00:25Z

BlackRock and NYSE Arca are advocating for staking-enabled ETH ETFs to enhance investor returns. Regulatory approval remains key. The demand for Ethereum[ETH] staking is rising, fueled by growing institutional interest and regulatory advancements. BlackRock has voiced its support for staked ETH ETFs, emphasizing their potential to enhance returns for investors. Simultaneously, NYSE Arca has submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking for Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF. With Ethereum staking trends shifting, the landscape of ETH investment products is evolving rapidly. BlackRock’s Digital Assets Head, Robbie Mitchnick, recently stated that while the firm’s ETH ETF is a success, it remains “less perfect” without staking capabilities. He highlighted that staking provides additional yield and aligns with Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model. Mitchnick believes that unlocking staking in ETFs could be a game-changer, attracting a broader investor base. However, he also acknowledged the challenges of implementing staking within the ETF structure due to regulatory constraints and operational complexities. NYSE Arca has taken a step forward by filing a request with the SEC to incorporate staking into the Bitwise Ethereum ETF. If approved, this would significantly shift how ETH ETFs function, allowing them to generate staking rewards and potentially enhance investor returns. The SEC’s decision will be closely watched, as it could influence how other crypto-based ETFs are structured in the future. Recent data highlights significant shifts in ETH staking dynamics. According to data from Dune Analytics, Kraken and Blockdaemon have led the growth in staking deposits over the past month, while Coinbase has experienced the most substantial outflows. Source: DuneAnalytics This divergence reflects shifting preferences among institutional and retail investors regarding custodial staking solutions. Meanwhile, platforms like Lido, stakefish, and Upbit have maintained steady inflows, reinforcing their dominance in the staking ecosystem. The second chart provides deeper insights into Ethereum staking flows. Over the past few months, staking deposits have outpaced withdrawals, leading to a net positive flow. Source: DuneAnalytics The black line representing the two-week net flow showcases an upward trend, indicating growing confidence in Ethereum’s staking ecosystem. Notably, principal withdrawals (shown in red) have decreased, suggesting that fewer investors are opting to unstake their ETH despite market fluctuations. This trend signals that long-term holders and institutions are embracing Ethereum staking as a sustainable investment strategy. The growing emphasis on staking carries significant implications for ETH ETFs and their investors. If approved, staking within ETFs could introduce an additional revenue stream through staking rewards, making ETH ETFs more appealing than traditional spot ETFs. Institutional investors may favor staked ETH ETFs, as they provide both price exposure and passive income through staking yields. However, regulatory uncertainty remains a major obstacle, with the SEC historically cautious about crypto-related products, particularly those involving staking. A favorable decision on NYSE Arca’s proposal could set a precedent, paving the way for more advanced Ethereum-based investment products.

Title: Pro-Beijing Paper Urges Li Ka-shing to Scrap Panama Port Sale

(Bloomberg) -- A pro-Beijing newspaper has called on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. to pull out from an agreement to sell its ports on the Panama Canal to a group led by BlackRock Inc., marking an escalation of a pressure campaign on billionaire Li Ka-shing over the deal. The transaction will damage China’s national security and development interests, which directly violates Hong Kong’s laws on safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, the Ta Kung Pao paper said in a commentary Friday. The article didn’t identify CK Hutchison as the Hong Kong company in question but did name BlackRock as the buyer. CK Hutchison is expected to sign an agreement on the sale of its two Panama ports by April 2. It’s the key part of a wider deal to offload 43 facilities outside of Hong Kong and mainland China for more than $19 billion in cash proceeds. US President Donald Trump has hailed the sale as winning back control of the waterway from Chinese influence. “Stop the transaction and do not make the wrong calculation,” the paper said in the article. “Those who repeatedly emphasize that this deal is a ‘legal transaction’ under the freedom of contract are too naive and confused.” The paper has blasted CK Hutchison for “spineless groveling” to Trump and “selling out all Chinese people” in previous commentaries, which were reposted by China’s top office on Hong Kong affairs, signaling the criticism reflects the government’s view. Following the move, several prominent politicians, including the city’s leader John Lee, have also weighed in with veiled criticism. The latest article hasn’t been reposted by any Chinese agencies yet. The growing calls on Li to reconsider the port sale highlight the political risks for companies based in Greater China amid rising trade tensions between the world’s two most powerful economies. So far, Chinese officials haven’t explicitly given the 96-year-old Li and his firm any demands or instructions. But if Beijing does decide to take a tougher approach, it could raise concerns that sweeping national security laws imposed on Hong Kong since 2020 might ensnare businesses’ assets and operations. While CK Hutchison is based in Hong Kong, it has limited exposure to both the US and China. The conglomerate is registered in the Cayman Islands and accrues only 12% of its revenue from Hong Kong and the mainland, while Europe, Canada and Australia make up the bulk of the rest. CK Hutchison slumped as much as 4.4% in Hong Kong on Friday after the company reported weaker-than-expected profit and warned in its earnings statement of a deteriorating global business environment due to geopolitical and trade tensions. The Panama Canal is “of great significance to China’s national interests,” Ta Kung Pao said in its latest commentary. As the second largest user of the waterway, China’s foreign trade stability and logistics costs are directly affected by its operation, it said. The sale of the two Panama ports may lead to an increase in the logistics costs of Chinese companies and threaten the long-term development of China’s manufacturing industry and foreign trade, it said. The transaction is a “concrete manifestation” of US attempts to put pressure on China’s supply chain by controlling key ports, it added. “It is not an exaggeration to say that the transaction will cause endless troubles to China’s economy and national interests after it is completed,” the paper said. Several Chinese state agencies have started looking into the deal for any potential national security or antitrust violations, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.

He is the author of “The Myth of Voter Suppression: The Left’s Assault on Clean Elections.” Send an email to Fred. Oklahoma lawmakers advanced legislation that could “gut” a three-year-old anti-ESG law and leave state taxpayers vulnerable to environmental, social, and governance-based investing, Heritage Action for America contends. The Oklahoma Senate Energy Committee recently advanced SB 714, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Rader, which amends the existing law on state contracts and transfers enforcement authority from the state treasurer to the state attorney general. A House version is sponsored by Speaker Pro Temp Anthony Moore. Both lawmakers are Republicans. “It’s in a lawsuit now and we just want to make some corrections so it’s not in a lawsuit,” Rader told The Daily Signal in a phone interview. “We are being proactive to keep the bill applicable.” The 2022 Energy Discrimination Elimination Act bans state investments with companies that boycott or penalize energy companies for lawful action, according to Heritage Action. Oil and gas companies are key to the Oklahoma economy. In July, Oklahoma District Court Judge Sheila Stinson issued an order to permanently block the law, stemming from a legal challenge by a state pensioner. The case is pending an appeal in the state Supreme Court. Rader argued enforcement of the anti-ESG law should have been with the attorney general in the first place. Under the 2022 law, the Oklahoma state treasurer, currently Todd Russ, keeps a list of financial institutions that boycott oil and gas companies and creates a schedule for state governmental entities to divest from the companies that include BlackRock, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. BlackRock has been among the largest boosters of ESG pressure on companies. Oklahoma Senate bill 714 is touted as “fixing” the Energy Discrimination Elimination Act (EDEA); SB 714 is not a fix, but a full dismantling of Oklahoma values by prioritizing political ideology over the interests of Oklahoma taxpayers, shareholders, and residents.Heritage… The state Senate bill would transfer enforcement authority to the state attorney general, currently Gentner Drummond. Drummond is handling the appeal. It would also change disclosure and judicial provisions for state governmental entities. Heritage Action counters the bill would “gut the EDEA and return power back to woke finance and climate activists.” “The changes SB 714 makes to the EDEA would again allow taxpayer dollars to subsidize the demise of Oklahoma’s economic interests by empowering asset managers to use Oklahoma dollars to fund the Left’s agenda,” Heritage Action says in a statement. The bill also creates loopholes for government agencies to ignore the law to divest companies if there are “transaction costs.” Any divestment will have some “transaction cost,” but the bill doesn’t require the costs be weighed against the significant cost to the state for subsidizing ESG, according to a bill analysis from Heritage Action. Rader was not familiar with this during the call, but he said state agencies have been reluctant to enforce because of the litigation. “Some state agencies are hesitant to do anything with the law because they only want to maximize the investment, and they worry about the legal ambiguity,” Rader said. “That’s why we want the attorney general. It’s not really a treasury matter.” Russ, the state treasurer, opposes the legislation. It would allow “financial firms could continue discriminatory practices under weakened enforcement,” the treasurer’s spokesperson Lara Blubaugh said. “The result could delay accountability, the attorney general’s office lacks the expertise and immediate oversight needed to track and respond to financial discrimination effectively,” Blubaugh continued. “The office has a structured, consistent process for managing state funds, investments, and financial relationships; moving oversight to the attorney general’s office adds uncertainty along with a century’s long-tested constitutional process.” Past comment by Drumond suggests a faceoff between the two GOP officials. In a December statement, after making the appeal to the state’s high court, Drummond faulted the state treasurer’s office for losing in a lower court. “There is a great deal of lost ground to make up on this litigation after the treasurer and his hand-picked legal counsel failed in district court,” said Drummond. “I will not let that failure deter my efforts to protect Oklahoma’s oil and gas industry from discriminatory practices by financial entities kowtowing to a radical environmental agenda.” Dive into the brilliant mind of Victor Davis Hanson, renowned classicist, historian, and Senior Contributor at The Daily Signal.

The total is spread across 79 DeFi platforms, with the top three RWA protocols accounting for 36% of that total-value locked, according to DeFiLlama. The top three RWA protocols—Maker RWA, BlackRock BUIDL and Ethena USDtb—hold $1.298 billion, $1.232 billion and $1.182 billion in TVL, respectively. Analysts are forecasting an explosion in the real-world asset market as investors flock to tokenized RWA products. Global investment firm VanEck has predicted RWAs will surpass $50 billion in market capitalization by the end of 2025. Total-value locked is a commonly used metric for user demand in DeFi that measures the value of assets deposited on a particular decentralized platform. Real-world asset tokenization refers to the process of creating digital representations of tangible assets, including T-bills, real estate, and gold, on blockchains. Maker's RWA is backed by real estate and digitized traditional RWAs such as treasury bonds, while USDtb is backed by tokenized BlackRock money-market fund shares. BUIDL is a tokenized money market fund built on the Ethereum network. Tokenizing RWAs has gained traction as investors turn to investment vehicles based on treasury bonds, stablecoins and various commodities to hedge against crypto market volatility and diversify their portfolios. Launched early last year, BlackRock’s BUIDL holds $373 million in assets, while other tokenized treasury-backed funds such as Franklin Templeton's BENJI and Ondo Finance's OUSG are also attracting investor dollars. Meanwhile, interest in stablecoin-backed tokenized funds is picking up, with Ethena USDtb's TVL increasing 1,000% over the past month, according to DeFiLlama.

The Energia All-Ireland League enters the homeward straight with the last three rounds of the regular season over the next three weekends, and nowhere is there more of a make-or-break feel to the day’s action than on the Aviva Stadium back pitch. Fifth-placed Lansdowne, Division 1A’s form team, host third place Terenure, who go into the game on 48 points, just above Cork Con on points difference and just two points ahead of their hosts. Lansdowne have won five of their last six games to close in on the top four and the playoffs, their only defeat being in that sequence being a 49-46 loss away to Clontarf when beaten with the last kick of the game. Interestingly, the former Cork Con back three player Rob Hedderman, who scored a try in last season’s final against Terenure, is named for a rare start on the wing. Terenure, themselves beaten with the game’s final kick by Clontarf last time out three weeks ago, have been hit by Leinster dipping into their squad for their trek to South Africa, with outhalf Caspar Gabriel, scrumhalf Fintan Gunne and fullback Henry McIrlean all on duty with their province. Conor McKeon, the former Connacht scrumhalf, starts at outhalf, with Aran Egan remaining at fullback and Alan Bennie at scrumhalf. Lansdowne, perhaps benefiting from not having any players in the Ireland Club side for their win in Portugal, are also seeking revenge for the 28-22 defeat in Lakelands in round three, and quite simply whoever wins this reprise of last season’s semi-final will find themselves in the top four, whereas whoever loses will be outside the playoff picture entering the final two rounds. Young Munster are technically the only team with seemingly nothing tangible to play for in the top flight, yet they have picked a notably strong looking side for the visit of Cork Con. Evan O’Connell, scrumhalf Jake O’Riordan, centre Shay McCarthy and fullback Patrick Campbell have all been released by Munster for this game, and the former Ireland Under-20 and current Munster academy winger Fionn Gibbons is named on the bench for what will be his first game of the season since rupturing his ACL last summer. The champions have seen an eight-game undefeated run come to a halt with successive defeats but retain a settled side featuring a strong midfield of Niall Kenneally and Seán French. After their fifth last-ditch win of the season, leaders Clontarf are now eyeing up a home semi-final and will be strongly fancied to take another stride toward that objective at home to a understrength UCD side who have also been hit by Leinster’s trek to South Africa. Already without key backrower Ronan Waters, St Mary’s have also lost Ethan Baxter after he was injured on Ireland Club duty, so ex-Munster centre Dan Goggin starts at number eight at home to a strong looking Ballynahinch. City of Armagh should take a step towards preserving their 1A status at home to Garryowen, for whom a 15th successive defeat will confirm their relegation. Energia Men’s All-Ireland League (2.30pm unless stated) Division 1A: City of Armagh v Garryowen, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v UCD, Castle Avenue; Lansdowne v Terenure College, Aviva back pitch; St Mary’s College v Ballynahinch, Templeville Road; Young Munster v Cork Constitution, Tom Clifford Park.

Send an email to Virginia. PANAMA CITY, Panama—If China wanted to disable the Panama Canal to stop the flow of military or cargo ships through it, it likely could do so through an attack on the software system, military veteran and “Hot Zone” podcaster Chuck Holton says. Using a Chinese ship to physically block the canal could cause a temporary disruption, but a cyberattack would likely create a much more serious issue, according to Holton, a former U.S. Army Ranger-turned-war correspondent. If China were to “scrambled the software that is used to open and close the locks, or something like that, now you’ve got a bigger problem,” Holton said, adding that it is “very likely” China already has the ability to “scramble” the technology used to operate the Panama Canal. The “software that runs the canal, very likely, is also infected with Chinese hackers,” he said, and if China “wanted to damage or shut down the canal, they could probably do it from Beijing with a few keystrokes. They don’t have to have Chinese troops at the port and they don’t. They don’t need them.” Holton, who serves as a foreign correspondent for Newsmax, lives in Panama and was part of the U.S. military invasion of Panama in 1989 to oust the nation’s corrupt dictator, Manuel Noriega. Standing in the square of Casco Viejo, Panama City’s historic district, Holton told The Daily Signal that China is actively working to gain influence in Panama, but “China is not running the canal.” During his inauguration speech on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump said, “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” But Panama President José Raúl Mulino denies China is operating the canal. Trump’s comments on the canal, coupled with a recent large canal port deal between an American-based company and a Hong Kong-based company, have called attention to China’s influence in the region. The Chinese government has been critical of a deal for a Hong Kong conglomerate, CK Hutchison, to sell ports in the Panama Canal to BlackRock, an American global asset manager. Trump has praised the deal, but CK Hutchison says the agreed-upon deal is “purely commercial” and has nothing to do with Trump’s recent comments on the canal. About 10,000 people work at the canal, the majority of whom, according to Holton, are Panamanian. The U.S. built the Panama Canal and operated it for decades, but in 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama to begin the gradual transfer of the canal to Panama, with the complete transfer by the end of 1999. The canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and operates through a lock system, raising ships above sea level to connect to the Gatun Lake before lowering them back to sea level. On average, 36 to 38 ships pass through the canal each day, according to The Associated Press. About 70% of the ships passing through the canal are coming from or headed for the U.S., though the shipping companies themselves may not be American. U.S. military ships do use the canal, and in the event of a conflict with China, anything China “could do that would complicate the U.S. Navy’s ability to move troops and products … into or out of the war zone, obviously, that’s a strategic issue for the United States,” Holton said. For years, Holton explained, China has been growing its power in Panama through economic and political ties. Panama joined the Belt and Road Initiative, a Chinese-led investment and infrastructure project, in 2017, but announced in February that it would not renew its participation in the Chinese project. China’s presence in Panama is not new, though political and economic ties are more recent. The first groups of Chinese arrived in Panama in the 1850s to help build the trans-Panama railroad. China’s influence is noticeable in the Latin nation through the presence of Chinese cultural centers, architecture, and Chinese-owned businesses. Holton says Panamanians know the nation has “a problem with Chinese influence, and it’s more with our government, it’s more with our economic system,” but, he added, the same cannot be said of the canal. Right now, the relationship between the U.S. and Panama is “confusing,” he said, because “Panama is an ally of the United States. Panamanians love Americans. They’ll say all the time that America’s our big brother … and so they’re a little befuddled by the president’s comments that seem very antithetical to, or negative toward, Panama.” The U.S. has a “long history of being a blessing to Panama,” Holton said, adding, “I don’t see why we need to change that now. That should be, the question is: How can we come and have a win-win situation with Panama and the United States? And there certainly is a path forward for that.” Dive into the brilliant mind of Victor Davis Hanson, renowned classicist, historian, and Senior Contributor at The Daily Signal.

In the beginning of March 2025, I traveled to Mexico to speak with a range of officials and experts about activities by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and its companies in the country, among other topics. In the midst of U.S. attention to China’s activities in Mexico and across the region, and in the face of threatened U.S. tariffs against Mexican products, the Mexican government of Claudia Sheinbaum is reportedly attempting to restrain high-profile activities with China that it perceives could antagonize the Trump administration. Nonetheless, beyond a small number of completed or postponed projects with China – such as a BYD hybrid car plant and the Maya tourist train – that have received particular high-level U..S scrutiny, the China-Mexico relationship continues to grow and deepen. Political Relations President Sheinbaum’s caution toward China appears to be reciprocated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It’s been over three months since China’s outspoken former ambassador to Mexico, Zhang Run, departed for a post in the Foreign Ministry at the end of 2024, yet the Chinese government has not yet named a new ambassador. That’s particularly unusual in CCP engagement with a country as large and important as Mexico. Beyond the state-to-state relations, China’s engagement in Mexico also extends to the legislative branch and subnational governments. There is a China friendship committee and an Asia committee in the Mexican legislature headed by leftist Workers’ Party (PT) member Yeidckol Polevnsky. Senate President Geraldo Fernandez Noroña, also of the PT and considered more radical than Polevnsky, is a powerful advocate for strengthening Mexico’s relations with China and reportedly has a close relationship with China’s embassy. China also courts Mexico at the state and local level, both through regular business delegations to Mexican states, few of which bear fruit, as well as at least 15 Mexico-China “sister city” relationships. Military and Defense Ties In military affairs, the current and recent Mexican administrations have restricted engagement with China. This year, neither the Mexican Army War College (CODENAL) nor the Navy War College (CESNAV) are hosting People’s Liberation Army (PLA) cadets, although the army has done so previously. In 2024, CESNAV hosted a visit by a sizable contingent from the PLA Superior War College. Also, in September 2023, a delegation of 16 PLA members, as well as a military delegation from Russia, visited and marched in Mexico’s Independence Day parade. Although China has not sold Mexico substantial military equipment, it did participate in an ill-fated joint venture to assemble 6.5 ton First Auto Works (FAW) trucks in Mexico. A China-based company also reportedly sold the Mexican Army uniforms, with the Mexican partner company – which is tied to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) ally and former Interior Minister Adan Agosto Lopez – reportedly profiting from a 300 percent markup on the cost paid to the Chinese wholesalers. In addition, the Mexican Navy purchased three Chinese catamarans for $26.7 million for a tourist transit, which it operates from Mazatlán to the island of San Blas. Beyond arms sales and engagements, China has assigned a capable military attaché, Army Colonel Cui Yungmao, seeking to strengthen military engagement and pursue arms sales opportunities. Cui reportedly has excellent Spanish and is a regular visitor at Mexican Army and Navy military institutions. China-based military companies regularly have a substantial presence at the annual Mexican Air Force air show (FAMEX), which they reportedly use to court the Mexican military and the Mexican Space Agency (MSA). Beijing has long courted the MSA. The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) has reportedly signed agreements with the Technical University of Beijing to bring students to China for graduate-level training on satellites and space sciences. On the other hand, the MSA’s plan to launch a satellite in China was reportedly switched to another provider and another site, possibly to avoid alarming the Trump administration. Chinese Private Security Companies (PSCs), represented in organizations such as the Mexico-Chinese Private Security Council, have sought work in the Mexican market, but have not to date established a substantial presence. Drones from the Chinese firm DJI and Chinese-made military equipment, including body armor used in confrontations against the Mexican military and other adversaries, are reportedly readily available for purchase by criminal organizations in Mexico on the black market. Chinese Investment in Mexico In commerce, driven by nearshoring, Chinese investment in Mexico in recent years has expanded to approximately $2 billion per year. The well-respected commercial consultancy Rhodium Group identified $13 billion in Chinese investment in Mexico in approximately 700 transactions between 2013 and 2023. In the digital space, Huawei has become a leading infrastructure provider, diversifying from telephone equipment to other services. Indeed, by 2024, Huawei had invested an estimated $1.3 billion in Mexican cloud computing infrastructure alone. The company, principally through Telmex, is also reportedly providing such services and infrastructure to the Mexican government, including the presidency, the Secretariat for Communication and Transportation (SCT), and a number of ministries. There are also rumors of a Huawei offer to provide technology and data services to the country’s national intelligence centers. In addition to Huawei, a range of Chinese companies are active in Mexico’s telephone sector, including Oppo, whose Mexico market share has reportedly expanded rapidly in recent years, as well as the China-based companies Honor, Xiaomi, and ZTE. The Chinese company Hikvision, operating in Mexico since 2016, including a research center in Queretaro, continues to be a dominant player in commercial and private security systems, including a number of initiatives to provide cameras for public security for towns around Mexico. Chinese computer and electronics manufacturer Lenovo has made Mexico its largest production and research and development (R&D) hub in Latin America, expanding its sales to the Mexican market by 25 percent in 2023 alone. Reportedly, Lenovo tries to keep out of the public spotlight. This year’s $22.8 billion acquisition by Blackrock of 80 percent of the properties of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports will dramatically change the Chinese profile in the port sector. Hutchison had previously operated ports in Veracruz, Lazaro Cardenas, Manzanillo, Tijuana, and Ensenada. In the automotive sector, although plans for a factory by the electric car maker BYD remain on hold, Giant Motor Corporation, which represents First Auto Works (FAW) and the Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp (JAC) production facility in Hidalgo, as well as Shanghai Automotive industrial Corporation (SAIC) and Beijing Automotive Industrial Corporation (BAIC), continue to have a substantial presence in the Mexican market. BAIC and Foton are major players in the market for buses. In construction, although the China Communication Construction Corporation (CCCC), in conjunction with the 30 percent CCCC-owned Mota Engil, have completed most of the track work for the Maya tourist train, there is a question of their continuing role. The Mexican Army continues to build train stations and other facilities to make the infrastructure functional. In a similar fashion, although China Railway has completed most of its improvements to Line 1 of the Mexico City Metro, it continues a presence on the line with a long-term maintenance contract. China-based companies have expressed interest in investing in warehousing, logistics, and other facilities in Mexico’s “Trans-Isthmus Corridor,” whose development is a priority for the Sheinbaum government. To date, no concrete projects have yet materialized. In the lithium sector, the Chinese company Ganfeng continues to own the Bacanora lithium field, but its ability to exploit it continues to be paralyzed, following former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s February 2023 initiative to nationalize Mexico’s lithium sector. Ganfeng is now in litigation over the issue. Stores specializing in Chinese merchandise have also expanded notably in Mexico’s retail sector, including not only informal shops in markets such as Tepito, but networks of brick-and-mortar stores such as China Market and Hogar China. These chains are expanding not only in Mexico City but around the country in cities such as Hidalgo, Puebla and Queretaro. Products from China exceeded 20 percent of all imports for the first time in 2024. There are concerns over whether such stores fully operate in conformity with Mexican tax and other laws. In July 2024, the Sheinbaum government symbolically raided and shut down China Mart, a three-story retail outlet for Chinese products in Plaza Izaga 89. China-Mexico commercial collaboration in general is reflected in its business councils. The China-Mexico Chamber (MexCham), under working President Victor Cadera, principally represents Mexican companies working in China, while the China Chamber of Commerce and Technology of Mexico, headed by Amipola Grijalva, is more focused on networking involving Chinese companies and their counterparts in Mexico. Academic and Media Engagement Mexican academic and intellectual engagement with China continues to expand. Mexico’s sixth Confucius Institute, providing Beijing-sanctioned instruction in Chinese language and culture, recently launched in the University of Guadalajara. The University of Veracruz in Jalapa opened a nongovernmental Center for China Studies, complementing others in Mexican public institutions, including in the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the College of Mexico (one of the country’s oldest), the Autonomous University of Baja California in Tijuana, University of Guadalajara, and the Asia-Pacific (APEC) Studies Center in the University of Colima. China’s government reportedly provides 10-20 scholarships per year for Mexicans to study in China, in addition to countless scholarships for Mexican students coming directly from Chinese universities. China-based companies also provide sponsored training programs for Mexicans to study in China, such as Huawei’s “Seeds for the Future” program. Just within the context of its employment of Mexicans, Huawei may have brought as many as 100 Mexicans to its training center in Shenzhen in the past five years. As in other parts of the region, China also actively courts Mexican media outlets. The left-oriented journal Jornada regularly carries content from Xinhua. The more centrist Reforma reprints content from Chinese media. China’s recently departed ambassador, Zheng Run, was a featured regular columnist in Milenio. Indeed, Milenio reporter Alma Paola Wong, among others, received a sponsored trip to China, and other representatives of Milenio and other respected media outlets were brought to China by Huawei for a media technology demonstration. Conclusion Mexico’s relationship with China will continue to be shaped by the “strategic triangle” involving the Mexico-U.S. and China-U.S. relationships. Despite the caution exercised by the Sheinbaum administration, the multidimensional China-Mexico relationship continues to evolve through its own momentum. China, in practical terms, is not an “alternative” to the United States for Mexico, but for both good and bad, it will continue to be an important part of the dynamics shaping Mexico’s future. R.

Title: Death announced of businessman Pat Dineen

Taoiseach Micheál Martin has led the tributes to the late businessman and sportsman Pat (PJ) Dineen who chaired Irish Steel, Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis, as well as playing cricket for Ireland on over twenty occasions. Mr Dineen (87) of Blackrock in Cork, but originally from Glasheen in the city, died on Thursday surrounded by his family “after a long and happy life.” He is survived by his wife Colette, sons Peter and Roger, daughter Linda as well as his brother Dick, grandchildren, son and daughter-in-law, extended family and friends. Mr Martin took time out of his trip to Brussels to issue a statement in which he said that Pat Dineen had made an “enormous impact on Irish industry, sport and public life.” “A great wit, with a keen business mind, Pat guided Bord Gáis, Irish Steel and Bord na Móna through some successful and challenging times. Pat retained his lifelong love of cricket, having been part of the Irish team that famously defeated the West Indies in 1969. My sympathies go to his wife Colette, children and wider family and many friends in his native Cork.” Cork Chamber of Commerce President, Rob Horgan, said that Pat was a “ a long-time friend and supporter of the business community. ” “He founded a very successful insurance company, Dineen Life & Pensions, in the 1960s, consolidating and expanding in the 1970s before it was later sold on. Later in his career, he brought this expertise to Bord Gáis, where he oversaw the construction of the Kinsale Head gasfield and pipeline, and also served as an executive chairman of Irish Steel, overseeing its transition from a loss-making company to a profitmaking enterprise and, ultimately, its sale. Our deepest condolences to his entire family and our thoughts are with them at this time.” Well known Cork auctioneer Dominic Daly said his late friend had led a rich and varied life and was a success at everything to turned his hand to over the years. “He was working for I think Standard Life (when we met) and I was in the wine business. He was very business orientated and gentlemanly. He was very in to cricket. And soccer – not as many people knew that. He was also very good at squash.” Mr Dineen’s life in business started in 1965 when he established his life and pensions company in Cork. The business grew rapidly and in 1972 he sold 40 per cent of the company to the merchant bank Charterhouse. The international insurance group Sedgewick acquired the Charterhouse stake a year later and the company became Sedgwick Dineen. He sold his stake in the company, which was valued at over £10 million, in 1994. Before setting up his own company he had worked for Norwich Union and Standard Life. During his time at Irish Steel, which he joined as executive chairman in 1993, he guided the company through several difficult years and its sale to Ispat International. He later told The Irish Times that the sale to the Indian firm had come down to the wire with Irish Steel coming “within eight hours of closure.” Mr Dineen was chairman of Bord Gáis from 1984 to 1989. During that time he oversaw the acquisition of the town gas companies throughout the State and the construction of the Kinsale Head gasfield and pipeline. Away from business he was a member of the legendary Irish cricket team which famously beat the powerful West Indies in 1969 at Sion Mills in Co Tyrone. Cork Cricket Club said he was a “true icon of Munster and Irish cricket.” “Pat captained the club on six occasions between 1963 and 1984, leaving an indelible mark both on and off the field. His contributions to the game and his club will not be forgotten.” Dolphin Rugby and Football Club said that they were “deeply saddened by” the death of their former member and player. Tributes were also paid to Mr Dineen by Munster Cricket and Cricket Leinster. He will lie in repose at Temple Hill Funeral Home in Boreenmanna Road in Cork on Friday from 5pm to 6pm. His requiem mass will take place on Saturday at 10am at St Joseph’s SMA Church in Blackrock in Cork City.

Title: Chinese anger at sale of Panama Canal ports to US investor highlights tensions between the two superpowers

Associate Professor in US History, University of Nottingham Maria Ryan has received funding from the British Academy. University of Nottingham provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners When Hong Kong-listed conglomerate CK Hutchison announced it was selling its two port concessions on the Panama Canal to a US consortium led by New York-based giant BlackRock, the Chinese government issued a strongly worded rebuke. Through government-backed newspaper Ta Kung Pao, Beijing accused the US of forcing the deal “through despicable means”, and claimed that if this was completed: “The United States will definitely use it for political purposes … China’s shipping and trade there will inevitably be subject to the United States.” CK Hutchison’s decision to sell its ports, which it has operated since 1997, to a US-led buyer came after the US president, Donald Trump, criticised Chinese influence over this strategically vital waterway. In his inaugural address, Trump claimed, falsely, that “China is operating the Panama Canal” and vowed “we’re taking it back”. In fact, data shows that the majority of traffic through the canal goes to or from the US. This has stoked fears in Beijing that US companies operating ports on the canal will do Washington’s bidding and potentially seek to restrict China’s access. Beijing’s angry response indicates the rivalry between the two great powers is deep and ongoing. While it is likely that this rivalry will continue to intensify under Trump, the president is unpredictable. Indeed, he sees unpredictability as a virtue – a way to keep advisers and foreign leaders on their toes. When asked last year whether he would support Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, Trump gave his own twist on the longstanding US policy of “strategic ambiguity”, saying: “I don’t want to reveal my cards … I wouldn’t want to give away any negotiating abilities by giving information like that to any reporter.” This means there are multiple plausible outcomes for the US-China relationship in the second Trump administration. On the one hand, there is a very strong, bipartisan consensus in Washington that China poses a systemic, generational challenge to American power. Whereas Russia is viewed as a disruptor, China is a potential peer competitor that could build a new international order based on Beijing’s preferences and interests. Since Trump’s first term in office, the US has been aggressively waging a “tech war” on China to limit its technological and military development, by cutting off access to high-end semiconductors designed by US companies. This was intensified in the Biden years with new sanctions on Chinese tech companies, and the passage of the Chips and Science Act, designed to encourage the return of semiconductor manufacturing to the US. Defensive weapons sales to Taiwan had already been increased in Trump’s first term – and remained at high levels under Joe Biden. What Biden called “extreme competition” with China has become the main organising principle of US foreign policy. While Republican lawmakers have, so far, been willing to go along with Trump’s diplomacy when it comes to Russia, there is likely to be less tolerance of a similar approach to China. Unlike other US presidents, Trump does not seem to believe that alliances extend American power in the world – although he does still want the US to be the undisputed number one. In his second inaugural address, he vowed to “build the strongest military the world has ever seen”. Trump sees China as an economic adversary, one of the reasons for imposing punitive tariffs of 20% on all incoming goods. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own and and has proposed more restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals. These are vital components of semiconductors, electric batteries and many weapons – and the global market is dominated by China. The US State Department recently signalled a possible shift in policy towards Taiwan, removing the phrase “we do not support Taiwan independence” from its fact sheet on Taiwan in February. This irritated Beijing, which sees the island as an integral part of China. This subtle move away from the US’s longstanding “One China” policy – along with the tariffs and Trump’s hostility to alleged Chinese influence over the Panama Canal – suggests the continuation of a hostile, competitive approach to China. That said, as Trump’s recent diplomacy with Russia and his comments about absorbing Greenland showed, he is not afraid to upend the established norms of US foreign policy. He enjoys provoking the “globalist” foreign policy establishment. He lauds his own deal-making abilities, and would not want to fight a war with China over Taiwan. Trump is attracted to “strongman” leaders and claims to have “a great relationship with President Xi”. He achieves his goals by taking maximalist positions (for example, the punitive tariffs) which he uses to extract concessions. At a recent press conference, Trump stated: “I see so many things saying we don’t want China in this country. That’s not right. We want them to invest in the United States. That’s good. That’s a lot of money coming in.” Trump is well aware the US is heavily dependent on imported semiconductors from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) – the world’s leading chip manufacturer – and has repeatedly accused Taiwan of “stealing” the US semiconductor industry. He recently took credit for TSMC’s announcement that it would invest a further US$100 billion (£77 billion) in three chip factories in Arizona, declaring that production of vital semiconductors inside the US was “a matter of national security”. But it will take years for TSMC’s investments to come to fruition in terms of aiding US self-sufficiency in chip manufacture. In the meantime, it is not out of the question that Trump could seek a deal with China that guarantees US access to imported chips from Taiwan, in return for China absorbing the island peacefully. Given the historic importance of Taiwan to Beijing, this could appeal. Avoiding war could also be popular with Trump voters who want to put “America first” without getting embroiled in foreign wars. Although the hawkish China consensus is firmly embedded in Washington, its continuation is not guaranteed while the mercurial Trump is at the helm.

Title: TRON ETF rumors heat up with Justin Sun’s latest move – Why?

Justin Sun hints at Tron ETF as USDD grows, TRX shows potential but faces challenges. Justin Sun is in the spotlight again, this time with hints of a possible ETF for TRON [TRX]. Along with the recent expansion of TRX to the Solana blockchain and the ongoing growth of its algorithmic stablecoin, USDD, TRX seems to be working towards greater institutional involvement and wider market integration. Amid market uncertainty and consolidation, TRX focuses on regulatory compliance, cross-chain integration, and stablecoin development. This strategy positions TRX to capitalize on the next phase of crypto adoption. In a recent social media post, TRON founder Justin Sun hinted at a TRON ETF, prompting speculation about whether TRX might soon join the ranks of regulated crypto financial products. The timing is notable: with Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs already approved, traditional finance is warming to crypto’s more established assets. Source: X BlackRock and Fidelity are actively advancing new applications, and TRON could soon follow suit. While no official filing has been confirmed, Sun’s hints at institutional interest suggest ongoing behind-the-scenes efforts. If a TRX ETF becomes a reality, it would represent a significant step in TRON’s transition from a niche project to mainstream financial markets. TRON’s USDD stablecoin is gaining momentum, recently surpassing a $270 million market cap. Amid heightened scrutiny of algorithmic stablecoins, USDD’s resilience stands out, particularly in emerging markets where dollar-pegged assets are vital for daily transactions. Sun remains committed to expanding USDD across multiple blockchain networks, extending its reach beyond TRON’s ecosystem. As one of the most widely used innovations in crypto, stablecoins highlight TRX’s broader goal of achieving real-world utility rather than merely speculative interest. With rising global demand for stable, censorship-resistant assets, USDD’s growth could play a pivotal role in shaping TRX’s next chapter. At press time, TRX was trading at $0.233, showing signs of a modest recovery following a sharp drop earlier this month. The daily RSI stood at 54.45, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This indicates a potential for further upside, albeit cautious. OBV remained relatively flat around 97.31 billion, showing weak conviction from buyers despite the recent bounce. Source: TradingView TRX’s price action shows a minor higher low, signaling potential short-term bullish momentum. However, without a significant volume increase or an RSI breakout above 60, any move beyond the $0.24 resistance level may struggle to hold. Traders should monitor for a confirmed breakout or an uptick in OBV to validate the possibility of sustained upward momentum.

Catch up on select AI news and developments from the past week or so (in no particular order): Gemini adds Canvas document editing and Audio Overviews. Google has introduced two new features for Gemini: Canvas and Audio Overviews. Canvas allows users to draft, edit, and refine documents and code within Gemini, with integration to Google Docs for collaboration. The tool also supports code generation for apps and scripts with real-time previews. Audio Overviews, previously part of NotebookLM, are now available to summarize and present information via audio. Both tools are part of Gemini’s broader push into productivity and multimodal interfaces. Importance for marketers: These enhancements support AI-driven content creation and code development, offering marketers more efficient tools for ideation, copy generation, and automation workflows. Study shows AI-generated meme captions score higher on average. A study comparing meme captions written by humans, AI, and human-AI teams found that captions by GPT-4o scored higher on average for humor, creativity, and shareability. AI consistently produced broadly appealing memes, though the funniest individual captions were still human-made. Human-AI teams created more ideas efficiently but felt less ownership. The study highlights AI’s role in boosting productivity while also noting emotional and qualitative trade-offs in creative collaboration. Importance for marketers: AI can increase output and audience resonance in content creation, but marketers should balance efficiency with human insight to maximize creative impact and emotional connection. Stability AI unveils model to turn images into 3D videos. Stability AI released Stable Virtual Camera, a new model that converts up to 32 images into videos with simulated 3D depth and dynamic camera paths. The tool supports formats up to 1,000 frames and multiple aspect ratios. It’s currently available under a research-only, noncommercial license. Though early versions show limitations with complex textures and scenes, the model enables users to create immersive content without traditional 3D tools. Importance for marketers: This model presents new creative options for immersive advertising and storytelling, enabling brands to produce 3D-like video content from 2D assets at lower cost and complexity. Mistral AI releases small model that outperforms GPT-4o Mini. Mistral AI has launched Mistral Small 3.1, an open-source model with 24 billion parameters that matches or exceeds GPT-4o Mini’s performance. The model processes text and images, supports 128k token contexts, and runs efficiently on modest hardware. Mistral is promoting digital sovereignty by making the model accessible under an Apache 2.0 license. The company also highlighted tools like Mistral OCR and Saba. Importance for marketers: Open, efficient AI models like Mistral Small 3.1 offer cost-effective alternatives for marketing applications, enabling on-device AI integration without reliance on large cloud-based proprietary platforms. Baidu unveils two new AI models to rival US competitors. Baidu introduced two new AI models, including ERNIE X1, which it claims rivals DeepSeek R1 at half the cost. The model offers advanced reasoning and autonomous tool use. Baidu also launched ERNIE 4.5, with strong multimodal and high-EQ capabilities. These models aim to bolster Baidu’s position in the global AI race as Chinese firms compete with US tech giants. Importance for marketers: Competitive advances from global AI players mean more options and price competition for AI-driven tools, offering marketers new opportunities in content creation, personalization, and regional expansion. Adobe launches agentic AI platform and prebuilt marketing agents. Adobe introduced agentic AI to its Experience Platform, offering 10 prebuilt agents for tasks like audience optimization, personalization, and content production. The new platform integrates with GenStudio Foundation and Brand Concierge for seamless campaign management. Adobe also announced data-sharing partnerships with AWS, Microsoft, SAP, and others to improve AI model training across platforms. The launch was announced during Adobe Summit in Las Vegas. Importance for marketers: Adobe's AI tools automate key marketing functions at scale. The interoperability and prebuilt agents help marketers streamline personalization, campaign planning, and content generation across ecosystems. Anthropic reportedly working on voice capabilities for Claude. Anthropic plans to introduce voice interaction for its Claude AI assistant, according to company executive Mike Krieger. The feature is being prototyped for desktop use and could become a more natural interface for users. Anthropic has discussed potential partnerships with Amazon and ElevenLabs to support this capability. No launch date has been announced. Importance for marketers: Voice-enabled AI offers more intuitive user interaction. Marketers may explore voice-based engagement tools, conversational commerce, or hands-free content creation using Claude once this feature launches. AI-powered search engines found to cite incorrect sources 60% of the time. A Columbia Journalism Review study revealed that generative AI search tools provided incorrect citations in over 60% of tests. Eight platforms, including ChatGPT and Perplexity, were evaluated using 1,600 queries. AI tools often generated plausible but incorrect answers rather than declining to respond. Some also ignored publisher restrictions. Paid versions frequently delivered more errors than free ones. Researchers raised concerns about growing reliance on these tools for news and research. Importance for marketers: Marketers relying on AI-driven search tools should vet information carefully. Misinformation risks can damage brand credibility and misguide strategic decisions based on flawed AI output. Microsoft partners with Inait to develop brain-like AI models. Microsoft has partnered with Swiss startup Inait to create cognitive AI systems modeled on mammalian brain reasoning. The technology integrates symbolic reasoning with neural networks, aiming for adaptive, energy-efficient systems. Potential applications include finance, robotics, and enterprise tools. The partnership builds on 20 years of digital neuroscience research and will use Azure for deployment. Importance for marketers: Brain-inspired AI could yield more nuanced customer insights, smarter automation, and faster learning systems—advancing personalization and predictive marketing capabilities. OpenAI and Elon Musk agree to expedited trial over for-profit status. OpenAI and Elon Musk have agreed to fast-track their legal dispute over OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit model. The case will proceed to trial in autumn. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015, alleges the organization deviated from its original nonprofit mission. OpenAI counters that the move is necessary to secure investment and stay competitive. The trial outcome may influence OpenAI’s ability to raise capital. Importance for marketers: The trial outcome could impact OpenAI’s growth and product strategy, which may influence future access to or pricing of tools like ChatGPT used in marketing and content generation. Cisco expands Webex with AI agents to enhance customer service. Cisco announced new AI Agent and AI Assistant tools for its Webex Contact Center at Enterprise Connect. These features help manage dynamic conversations, provide live recommendations, transcribe calls, and summarize interactions. The AI Agent can automate tasks like booking flights and integrates with corporate systems. Cisco also added AirPlay support for Microsoft Teams Rooms. Importance for marketers: Cisco’s AI-driven customer service enhancements offer marketers better CX data, more responsive service tools, and deeper insights into customer behavior during live support interactions. OpenAI to beta test ChatGPT Connectors for Drive and Slack. OpenAI will begin beta testing ChatGPT Connectors, allowing users to connect Slack and Google Drive accounts to ChatGPT. The tool can access and respond to queries based on synced content, respecting file and channel permissions. It supports documents, presentations, and spreadsheets, but does not analyze images or Slack DMs. Future integrations include SharePoint and Box. Importance for marketers: These integrations make ChatGPT a more powerful internal assistant, streamlining content discovery, campaign planning, and team collaboration across popular workplace platforms. Meta requires disclosure of AI use in Canadian political ads. Meta will now require advertisers to disclose if political or social issue ads in Canada use AI to create or alter images, videos, or audio. This includes content depicting realistic but fake events or individuals. The rule aims to reduce misinformation ahead of Canada’s federal elections.

Visitors to gemini.google.com can use the chat interface in incognito mode, though advanced features like model selection, file uploads, and chat history still require login. Signed-out users are limited to Gemini 2.0 Flash. The Android app continues to require account login. This change aligns the Gemini web experience with Google Search, emphasizing accessibility.

Photo Credit: x/ @hhtbzayed As the US shapes crypto laws, the UAE advances in Web3 regulations This week, the US hosted UAE National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss technological cooperation, energy, and investment opportunities. During his visit, he met with key officials from President Trump's administration, including White House crypto czar David Sacks, where cryptocurrency regulation was a key topic. While the US is still shaping its crypto laws, the UAE is among the first nations to have established regulations. Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan and David Sacks have initiated discussions on expanding digital currencies, particularly within international financial systems. They also explored upcoming investment opportunities at the intersection of crypto and artificial intelligence (AI). “As technological advancements accelerate, fostering collaboration and adopting forward-looking strategies remain essential pillars for driving sustainable growth and achieving long-term impact,” a post by Sheikh Tahnoon Zayed Al Nahyan said on X.

Earlier this month, MGX acquired a minority stake in Binance for $2 billion (roughly Rs. 17,403 crore). As per reports, MGX has committed $7 billion (roughly Rs. 60,209 crore) to President Trump's ambitious Stargate project, that aims to build high power AI data centres across the US. OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and SoftBank are other participants in the $500 billion (roughly Rs. 43,00,668 crore) project. Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Larry Fink (BlackRock), and Jensen Huang (Nvidia) also met with MGX chief Sheikh Tahnoon Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss the US's AI initiatives. Al Nahyan later shared glimpses of the meeting on X.

The 47th US President later shared the update on Truth Social. “Discussions included ways for our countries to increase our partnership for the advancing of our economic and technological futures,” President Trump posted. At present, US SEC's Crypto Task Force is designing a regulatory framework to govern the crypto sector. During the recently held Crypto Summit at the White House, President Trump directed the Task Force to present its proposed laws by the end of August. The UAE has been implementing Web3 regulations for over two years. Key milestones include the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) framework, which regulates crypto trading platforms, and Dubai's Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), that oversees virtual assets in the region. With its advanced regulatory framework, the UAE has become a key advisor for nations like the US seeking guidance on crypto policies. In January, Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim met with UAE officials to discuss the formulation of a supportive crypto policy framework.
