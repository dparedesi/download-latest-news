By Carolina Mandl NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citadel's founder Ken Griffin said on Thursday that he would be open to selling a small stake in his hedge fund at some point in the future. Griffin, at an event hosted by the Economic Club of New York, said it made sense for him to sell a minority stake in his market maker Citadel Securities to Sequoia and Paradigm in 2022, in a deal that valued the firm at $22 billion. His comments come days after reports about BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) in talks with Citadel's competitor Millennium for a potential tie-up, involving the acquisition of a minority stake in the hedge fund by the world's largest asset manager. "We take great pride in being in a private partnership. It has served us well for 30 years," he said when asked about a potential consolidation in the hedge fund industry. Still, he said he "would be open to the possibility of selling a minority stake in Citadel at some point in the future." When asked about what kind of partner he would engage with, he said venture capital firm Sequoia would be an example. "We would look for a partner that feels like Sequoia, that's going to push us to be better at what we do." Griffin said the focus on Citadel Securities now is on the growth of the business and that an initial public offering should not happen "in the foreseeable future." Griffin, a Republican supporter, criticized in a wide-ranging interview President-elect Donald Trump's plans for deportation of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, tax cuts and tariffs implementation, saying some of his policies could increase the U.S. deficit and make domestic companies less competitive and productive. "We've got to put the fiscal house to order," he said.

Title: Can Bitcoin Solve The Sovereign Debt Crisis?

Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images The United States is facing a fiscal crisis of historic proportions. Ballooning deficits, runaway debt service costs, and the risk of a bond market meltdown are pushing the nation toward uncharted territory. Traditional solutions, whether austerity, tax hikes, or controlled inflation, are inadequate. Could a radically different approach, leveraging bitcoin, chart a path forward? A thoughtful post by @stackhodler on X entertained the idea that bitcoin could play a role in addressing a sovereign debt crisis. This thought experiment requires an understanding of how money systems evolve during times of upheaval, plus a little imagination. From the collapse of the Roman denarius to the end of the Bretton Woods gold standard, monetary resets are not new. How might bitcoin kick off the next chapter in global money? The problem starts with unsustainable debt. In the wake of trillions in COVID-era spending, the U.S. has grown dependent on short-term Treasury bills, leaving its finances vulnerable to rising interest rates. Government spending is totally out of control, and the number of people who are partially or wholly dependent on government transfer payments has mushroomed. For all the consternation among conservatives about Democratic policies moving the U.S. in the direction of socialism, there is surprisingly little attention paid to the reality that it is already here. As outlined in our earlier analysis, there is a danger that rising interest rates could lead to a debt spiral in Trump’s second term. Higher borrowing costs would beget more borrowing, which would fuel yet higher costs. This would apply inflationary pressure to the dollar that would be difficult to counteract, even with the radical spending cuts promised by the DOGE initiative spearheaded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. This feedback loop is hard to escape in the fiat system. Tax hikes slow growth, spending cuts invite backlash, and inflation – though politically expedient in the short term – would destroy the purchasing power of the voting public. The result is a dollar teetering on collapse, where global competitors like China use its weakness to siphon soft power away from the United States. The question is: how could bitcoin fit into a solution for sovereign debt? Don your tinfoil hat and get ready to entertain a fascinating, if speculative, scenario. As U.S. policymakers recognize the inevitability of a monetary reset, the first move would be strategic devaluation of the dollar. By flooding global markets with dollars, the U.S. would trigger inflation across rival economies, destabilizing their currencies while counterintuitively protecting the dollar’s status as the premiere global reserve currency. Sound familiar? The inflationary result of the COVID and post-COVID debt bonanza was predictable, leaving one to speculate about why the powers-that-be allowed it to transpire. The explanation need not require a grand conspiracy. The Cantillion Effect is reason enough. On an individual level, powerful politicians and financiers store their wealth in assets, not cash. Printing money does not put them at risk, since more dollars chasing the same number of scarce assets simply raises the prices of the assets they already own. And because they can use their privileged position to acquire assets with the newly printed money faster than the broader market can, they are even able to increase their wealth by snapping up more before inflation causes prices to rise. Combine that with the power to route newly printed dollars to institutions (and stakeholders within them), and you have strong incentive alignment among elites to spend as much money as quickly as they can. If they agreed in aggregate that the dollar’s demise is inevitable, you would expect to see them racing to print dollars and scoop up assets, while using their political power to bestow money (and the assets it can buy) upon those in their trust networks to strengthen their positions in the social hierarchy. This logic is sound, if perverse, and it would explain why the U.S. government spent trillions of dollars unnecessarily under the guise of COVID spending after the crisis was long over. If you’re in a car careening at high speed towards a chasm, and your brakes don’t work, you press down on the accelerator and hope that by increasing your speed you might make the jump to the other side. The other side is bitcoin – not because bitcoin is perfect or desirable, but simply because there is no alternative. For over a decade, the U.S. government has battled bitcoin – from the unjust withholding of approval to sell financial products that touch it, to the frontal attack on bitcoin-friendly banks by the Biden-Harris administration. However, in 2024, the tune suddenly changed. The ultimate Big Finance insider, BlackRock, began selling and promoting bitcoin. Pension funds, family offices, and individual investors now have easy access to bitcoin exposure, with no need of technical knowledge. Now that capital markets are open to large-scale adoption of bitcoin, the U.S. is free to pivot to endorse it as a reserve asset. Whether or not it is yet happening, it’s now indisputably possible for the masses to use bitcoin as a hedge against the declining dollar. If the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve comes to fruition and the U.S. Department of the Treasury begins purchasing and holding bitcoin, other nations would need to compete by doing the same. Some would sell assets – including U.S. Treasury bonds. Others would print their currencies to purchase it. The result would be further acceleration of capital exiting the fiat system and entering the bitcoin ledger. Suppose the U.S. Treasury acquires significant bitcoin reserves while simultaneously allowing the dollar to slide into oblivion. As bitcoin appreciates – potentially into multi-million-dollar territory – it could offset the national debt in nominal terms. A hyperinflating dollar paired with appreciating bitcoin reserves would invert the current debt dynamic, allowing liabilities to shrink relative to assets. Perhaps this is what President Trump was gesturing at when he suggested that the U.S. could pay off its $35 trillion debt with bitcoin. Much derided at the time, could this have been another example of Trump’s intuition being correct, if not clearly expressed? Transitioning from the dollar to bitcoin wouldn’t come without pain. Dollar hyperinflation would create chaos and dislocation across the entire planet. But bitcoin would provide the foundation on which to rebuild. And, those holding bitcoin – governments, financial institutions, and individuals – would have their wealth preserved through the upheaval. Now that Americans have clearly marked exits from fiat to bitcoin, the U.S. economy could emerge in the 21st century strongly positioned to continue its dominance, while late adopters scramble to adjust. If bitcoin were to become a global reserve asset, it would kick off a new era of fiscal discipline. Unlike fiat, bitcoin’s fixed supply imposes natural constraints on government spending, forcing policymakers to operate within the bounds of solvency. Reckless deficit spending, forever wars, and currency debasement would become relics of the fiat past. A bitcoin-based financial system wouldn’t just rein in excess, it would also encourage investment in ultra-long-term, ambitious projects. Bitcoin would be used to underwrite energy resource development, infrastructure revitalization, and most importantly, interplanetary expansion. Freed from the distortions of fiat monetary policy, markets could allocate capital efficiently, fostering an explosion of productive growth. This scenario is not as far-fetched as it may first seem. By historical standards, the dollar is past its sell-by date, and the postwar “rules-based international order” is clearly under renegotiation. World reserve currency periods.

Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, surging to $97,852 on Binance. The cryptocurrency is up 5% in the last 24 hours and has gained an impressive 43% over the past 16 days since November 5. The momentum shows no signs of slowing as BTC price continues its steady ascent. Several key factors are driving this remarkable rally: Following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, market sentiment has shifted significantly. The initial “Trump trade” has evolved into the “US Bitcoin Reserve Trade,” fueled by speculation that President-elect Trump may establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). This follows his pledge at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville. Industry insiders like David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc and a Trump campaign advisor, and Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, have hinted at the possibility of the SBR becoming a reality. Both have urged that the SBR be established within the first 100 days of Trump’s presidency through an executive order. They warn of the United States potentially falling behind in the global race to accumulate BTC. Bailey revealed on November 9, “There is at least one nation-state that has been actively acquiring Bitcoin and is now a top 5 holder. Hopefully, we hear from them soon.” He emphasized his certainty with a meme, indicating his information is based on knowledge rather than speculation. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, confirmed in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV that “countries are already buying BTC in huge volumes.” The “US Bitcoin Reserve Trade” is expected to continue until Trump’s inauguration on January 20. It remains to be seen whether Trump will follow through on his promises, potentially moving over 208,000 BTC confiscated by law enforcement into the reserve or even adopting Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act proposal to purchase 1 million BTC over five years. A leak on Wednesday suggests that President-elect Trump’s team is in discussions about creating a new White House position dedicated solely to Bitcoin and crypto policy. Sources familiar with the transition efforts indicate that candidates are being vetted for this role. If established, it would be the first-ever Bitcoin and crypto-specific White House position, underscoring the influence the nascent industry stands to wield in the incoming administration. It is unclear whether the role will be a senior White House staff position or a “crypto czar” overseeing policy and regulation across the federal government. Crypto industry advocates are pushing for the role to have a direct line to Trump – a massive news for the entire industry. The introduction of Bitcoin ETF options has had a significant impact on the market. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) ETF options, launched on November 19, 2024, saw an unprecedented $1.9 billion in notional exposure on their first day of trading. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart stated, “Final tally of IBIT’s 1st day of options is just shy of $1.9 billion in notional exposure traded via 354k contracts. 289k were Calls & 65k were Puts. That’s a ratio of 4.4:1. These options were almost certainly part of the move to the new Bitcoin all-time highs today.” Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Invest, recently highlighted the game-changing nature of Bitcoin ETF options: With the approval by the SEC to list and trade Bitcoin ETF options, we are on the verge of witnessing the most extraordinary upside ‘vol’ of ‘vol’ in financial history. For the first time, Bitcoin’s notional value will be ‘fractionally banked’ with ETF options. This marks the most monumental advancement possible for the crypto market. Park explained that Bitcoin ETF options provide a regulated market where the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) protects clearing members from counterparty risks, allowing Bitcoin’s synthetic notional exposure to grow exponentially. He emphasized that this could lead to an explosive recursive effect on Bitcoin’s price due to unique volatility characteristics and the “volatility smile.” If there were one thing to read today re the game-changing nature of Bitcoin ETF options, read (and bookmark) this one for 2025 – it’s going to be wild. pic.twitter.com/On2DmUsbHX — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) September 20, 2024 The latest rally has also been driven by significant activity in the spot market. Heavy spot bids have propelled the price higher, with yesterday’s BTC ETF inflows being a crucial factor. Inflows amounted to $773.4 million, with BlackRock contributing $626.5 million, Fidelity $133.9 million, Bitwise $9.2 million, and ARK Invest $3.8 million. Over the past three days, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have purchased a staggering $1.856 billion worth of Bitcoin. Good morning, Yesterday’s Bitcoin ETF flows were positive for $773.4 million.

The UAE, a major oil producer in the Middle East, launched Alterra at the COP28 summit in Dubai last year. The fund’s goals are to “drive forward international efforts to create a fairer climate finance system, with an emphasis on improving access to funding for the Global South.” With $30 billion committed, Alterra became the world’s largest private investment vehicle for climate change action. The fund has stated its goal to mobilize as much as $250 billion globally by 2030 and help bridge the gap in investment into the solutions needed to keep the world on the 1.5 degrees Celsius pathway, drive investment into the Global South, and create new investment opportunities and strategies for emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). In collaboration with BlackRock, Brookfield, and TPG as inaugural launch partners, Alterra has so far committed $6.5 billion to climate-dedicated funds for global investments. However, the actual money spent on funds is significantly lower than this initial commitment, Alterra’s CEO Majid Al Suwaidi told Bloomberg in Azerbaijan, which is currently hosting the COP29 climate summit. The project financing of energy transition projects is often complicated because of the mix of public and private investments needed. According to Alterra’s Al Suwaidi, it is difficult to mobilize financing from the public sector, which is often experiencing financial troubles, while private investors and banks are averse to taking a lot of risk.

Bitcoin is on a roll — again. Bitcoin’s stratospheric rise continues, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency spiking to new heights on Thursday as an upsurge catalyzed by former president Donald Trump’s win earlier this month continued. The $100,000-per-BTC psychologically important mark is now just a stone’s throw away. Bitcoin rose to as high as $98,310.57 earlier today, CoinGecko data shows. At this level, BTC is roughly 2% from the much-anticipated $100,000 milestone that would drive it above a $2 trillion market cap. Bitcoin has gained roughly 46% over the past month, propelled by bullish sentiment across digital assets and broader equities following President-elect Donald Trump’s successful return bid for the Oval Office on Nov. 6. Industry participants have dubbed the parabolic rally the “Trump Trade,” as all assets, including equities, bonds, and digital currencies, have surged since Trump defeated Kamala Harris. Traders view Trump’s win as a favorable environment, providing a clear runway for deregulation and business-friendly policies to spur continued rallies into next year. For crypto, Trump’s administration is expected to drive regulation designed to establish a domestic Bitcoin reserve, safeguard crypto mining interests, end the current administration’s hostile regulatory stance, and foster innovation. In fact, the President-elect’s team is reportedly planning to create a position focused on crypto policy, which would be a first for the White House, according to Bloomberg. The team is assessing potential candidates to serve in that role. The unprecedented demand for the newly launched BlackRock IBIT options, which track BTC prices and are poised to dramatically increase liquidity in the market, has also added to the latest bullish momentum. On Nov. 19, the first day of trading on the Nasdaq, the new options contracts recorded nearly $2 billion in notional exposure traded on its first day, as ZyCrypto reported. Bitcoin is now on track to surpass $100,000 in the coming one or two months, as observed by MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe. Up 3.2% on the day, Bitcoin is less than $3,000 from the historic six-figure achievement. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trader Bitcoin Munger shared a Glassnode chart on X showing massive accumulation across all cohorts, noting that BTC is likely to “blow way past” $100,000.

Title: McCanns win votes to take Balmoral private amid cries of ‘corporate greed’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/11/21/mccanns-win-votes-to-take-balmoral-private-amid-cries-of-corporate-greed/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T15:36:20Z
Full Content:
A move by the McCann family, once synonymous with Fyffes, to take Balmoral International Land fully private secured backing at an extraordinary general meeting (egm) on Thursday, even as some small shareholders vented ire as they face being squeezed out under the deal. Almost 98 per cent of voting shareholders, led by McCann-controlled vehicles that already own just over 61 per cent of the stock, cast in favour of a mandatory buyback of stock held by investors holding fewer than 25,000 shares. These account for a combined 22.4 per cent stake in the company and many of them did not vote. The transaction will increase the direct McCann family stakes and indirect holdings, through vehicles they control, to a combined 79 per cent. It is being priced at €10.50 a share, 44 per cent below Balmoral’s most recent reported net asset value per share of €18.72. While it marks a 110 per cent premium to where the shares traded on the grey market last November – before stockbrokers stopped openly facilitating trades due to the burden of paperwork – it is below the €12 level at which a block of over 16,000 shares changed hands last week. That was the first reported trade in 12 months. It is not clear who handled that trade. Colm Whooley, a small shareholder, described the transaction as “corporate greed” at the sometimes tense egm in Dublin. “Balmoral is now a healthy company. There is no justification for the [44] per cent discount to take us out,” he said. “It’s not a company in distress or any difficulty.” Another of four investors to speak – out of about 15 small shareholders that turned up to the meeting – questioned why the company, whose €5 million of administration costs last year equated to 52 per cent of gross rental income, did not opt to sell off its assets instead. He noted that much of Balmoral’s investment assets comprise industrial and warehouse buildings which have outperformed the wider commercial property market in recent years. Balmoral chairman Carl McCann said the €10.50 price was higher than a share redemption price suggested by Davy, the board’s financial adviser, and reflects how most listed property stocks are currently trading at deep discounts to NAV (net asset value). He said the notion of a break-up of the company “wouldn’t be appealing” to directors and other large investors who took a risk committing fresh capital to refinance the business following the financial crisis. “It’s a miracle for the company to be here today,” he said. He suggested take-private deals over the past five years of property companies Green Reit, Hibernian Reit and Yew Grove Reit, each at a slight premium to NAV, would each likely be priced at a deep discount if they took place today. However, some of the vocal investors countered that NAVs across the sector have already declined in recent years, amid a spike in interest rates and other factors. The company was originally named Blackrock International Land when it was spun out by Fyffes in 2006 as a separate publicly-quoted entity. It was delisted in 2011 following a slump in its share price during the property crash, but continues to have thousands of legacy shareholders that have remained on board since the stock market exit. The McCann family sold their decades-held shares in Fyffes in 2017 to Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo. The Tokyo-based firm subsequently sold the 30 per cent interest in Balmoral it inherited to a vehicle led by the McCanns. Mr McCann is also executive chairman of Dole Plc, the Irish-based but New York-listed fresh produce company created in 2021 through the merger of Dole Foods with former Total Produce. Dole and Fyffes are among Balmoral’s main tenants. The fair value of Balmoral’s investment assets, comprised of industrial and warehouse buildings, offices and mixed-use land, edged up to €146.3 million in June from €138 million in December, the company disclosed in a circular in October.

Title: Ireland v Fiji team news: Gus McCarthy, Cormac Izuchukwu and Sam Prendergast all start
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/11/21/ireland-v-fiji-team-news-gus-mccarthy-cormac-izuchukwu-and-sam-prendergast-all-start/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T13:58:18Z
Full Content:
As forecast, Andy Farrell has given Test debuts to the 21-year-old Leinster hooker Gus McCarthy and the 24-year-old Ulster flanker Cormac Izuchukwu in making seven changes to the Ireland starting line-up for Saturday’s Autumn Nations Series game against Fiji at the Aviva Stadium (kick-off 3.10pm). One of those additional changes will see Sam Prendergast make his full Test debut after playing the last 18 minutes of Ireland’s 22-19 win over Argentina last Friday. Jamie Osborne, who made his international debut when seamlessly replacing Hugo Keenan for both Tests last summer in South Africa, returns at fullback after winning his third and fourth caps with eye-catching displays off the bench in midfield against the All Blacks and Los Pumas. Jacob Stockdale has been rewarded for his try-scoring form in an Ulster jersey with a recall on the left wing to earn his 38th cap and his first since Ireland’s final World Cup warm-up game against Samoa in Bayonne, while Bundee Aki also returns to midfield, with Robbie Henshaw shifting to outside centre. Craig Casey, who started the first Test in South Africa before being ruled out of the second due to a head injury, starts at scrumhalf, while McCarthy and Izuchukwu are the two changes in personnel up front, with Tadhg Beirne reverting to the secondrow in a positional switch. Save for the retention of Thomas Clarkson, one of two debutants last week, it is a completely rejigged bench, with Tom O’Toole, Iain Henderson, Conor Murray, Ciarán Frawley and Stuart McCloskey all returning. So too does the Connacht captain Cian Prendergast, who is in line to win his fourth cap and first since the World Cup warm-up win over England, thus ensuring a memorable day for himself, his younger brother and his family. Mindful that Ireland have undertaken a fourth November game against Australia on Saturday week, Farrell has rested Keenan, Garry Ringrose, James Lowe, Jack Crowley, Jamison Gibson-Park and James Ryan, while Cian Healy will have to wait another week to eclipse Brian O’Driscoll as Ireland’s most capped player of all time. The 21-year-old McCarthy, a product of Blackrock College, was captain of the Ireland Under-20 side which won the Grand Slam and reached the final of the Under-20 World Cup in Cape Town two seasons ago, with Prendergast the team’s star turn. McCarthy has been exposed to plenty of rugby this season, due to injuries for Dan Sheehan and Rónan Kelleher, and has backed up his dynamic and mobile performances on the Emerging Ireland tour in September by impressing the Irish coaches at training in this November window. Born in London to an Irish mother and Nigerian father, Izuchukwu started playing in Tullamore RFC and has made a rapid rise since the latter stages of last season. After completing his Leaving Cert cycle in Roscrea College, Izuchukwu had notions of travelling the world playing rugby. But a video compilation of his highlight reels while playing with Kelso in Scotland was sent to Anthony Eddy and he brought Izuchukwu into the Ireland Sevens fold, which in turn led to a place in the Ulster academy. Given a run of games by Richie Murphy toward the end of last season, Izuchukwu caught the eye with his ball-carrying and athleticism, and also impressed the Irish coaches on his second Emerging Ireland tour. “Izzy has been in and around the squad now for a while actually. The first Emerging Ireland is when we first came across his ability, his athleticism,” said Farrell. “The difference between the first [Emerging Ireland] tour and the second tour was chalk and cheese. His ability, point of difference, his potential with that maturity, he deserves a shot to show what he’s got. “Gus, what a rise in such a short space of time,” added Farrell of McCarthy, and citing the maturity that came with captaining the Irish Under-20s, albeit he was first named in this November squad as a training panellist. “But rugby is a strange thing. You think there’s a pecking order and all of a sudden, a couple of players get an injury then a kid gets an opportunity, and he shows up really well when we take him on the training week with us as a development player. He showed up unbelievably well and he’s forced our arm to keep him in the squad, first and foremost. And he deserves a shot to see what he can do as well.” As ever, Farrell was also bullish about Sam Prendergast’s potential. “I’m confident from what we’ve seen. We took him on the Emerging tour and he played in all of those games and the aim of that was for him to grab hold of that team and make sure that he treated it like his own as though he was in charge. He did that in spades and this week we’ve seen the benefit of that. We need to see it transfer obviously. “His character is composed, he is confident but yet not over-confident. He’s assertive in what he wants, and he has a nice way in how he goes about his business.” Farrell said he would encourage Frawley to be himself, adding: “He’s super excited that he gets another chance to right the wrongs of a couple of weeks ago and we’re excited about seeing him play because he’s a top-quality player.” As for Stockdale, the Irish coach said: “He’s chomping at the bit and this is his chance to show us what he’s about at this level again.” It’s been a frustrating month so far for Tadhh Furlong, who still hasn’t recovered from his hamstring strain. “He’s tried his best,” said Farrell. “I feel for him. It’s been tough because everyone is desperate to play for Ireland and he’s worked really hard to try and get back there and we were hoping it was going to be this week. You’re always trying to push on to the next stage and get through that and he didn’t quite manage that.” IRELAND (v Fiji): Jamie Osborne (Leinster); Mack Hansen (Connacht), Robbie Henshaw (Leinster), Bundee Aki (Connacht), Jacob Stockdale (Ulster); Sam Prendergast (Leinster), Craig Casey (Munster); Andrew Porter (Leinster), Gus McCarthy (Leinster), Finlay Bealham (Connacht); Joe McCarthy (Leinster), Tadhg Beirne (Munster); Cormac Izuchukwu (Ulster), Josh van der Flier (Leinster), Caelan Doris (Leinster, capt).

Title: Is Bioceres Crop Solutions (BIOX) the Best Fertilizer Stock to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Fertilizer Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) stands against the other fertilizer stocks. The fertilizer industry is a crucial sector in agriculture that focuses on the production and distribution of substances that enhance plant growth. By supplying necessary nutrients, fertilizers help improve crop yields and quality, which are essential for feeding the growing global population. The industry has evolved significantly over time, with modern practices relying heavily on chemically manufactured fertilizers to support large-scale farming and meet the global demand for food. According to Mordor Intelligence, the global fertilizer market is estimated to have reached a value of $381.7 billion in 2024. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.99% during 2024-2030 to reach $541.2 billion by ​the end of the forecast period. READ ALSO: 10 Undervalued Chemical Stocks to Invest In and 7 Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Right Now. There is a strong sense of optimism within the industry. The Fertilizer Institute’s 2023 Industry Trends Survey highlighted a positive outlook within the fertilizer sector, with many respondents expressing confidence in future growth. About 40% of those surveyed believe that market conditions have improved over the past five years, despite challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. Companies attribute their resilience to strategic practices such as precommitment purchases and careful planning. Nearly 80% of participants are optimistic about their businesses being equally or more profitable in the next five years. The fertilizer industry is currently experiencing several key trends that are shaping its future. Advances in technology are transforming how fertilizers are produced and applied. Innovations such as precision agriculture, which uses data analytics and sensors, help farmers optimize fertilizer usage based on specific soil conditions and crop needs. Additionally, there is a growing demand for fertilizers that offer more nutrients while reducing their environmental impact. The emphasis on maximizing the efficiency of fertilizer application to promote sustainable farming practices is increasing, which is driving the development of new and innovative solutions. On August 13, CNBC reported that Windfall Bio, a California-based startup, is addressing methane emissions using "mems," or methane-eating microbes. These microbes naturally consume methane and convert it into fertilizer. This innovative approach helps reduce harmful methane from sources like agriculture, landfills, and oil production. Farmers can use the fertilizer produced, while companies generating waste methane can sell it back to Windfall, creating a new revenue stream. These trends indicate a dynamic shift in the fertilizer industry, balancing the need for increased food production with environmental sustainability and innovation. To compile our list of the 8 best fertilizer stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest fertilizer companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best fertilizer stocks. We carefully verified our list to remove any companies that can not be classified as fertilizer stocks. From an initial pool of over 15 fertilizer stocks, we focused on the stocks that analysts believe possess the greatest potential for growth. Finally, we ranked the 8 best fertilizer stocks to buy now based on their average price target upside potential according to analysts, as of November 18, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A farmer in a field, inspecting freshly planted crop seeds using advanced biotechnological tools. Average Upside Potential According to Analysts: 113.82% Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) is a key player in the agriculture industry that provides solutions to enhance crop yields and promote sustainable practices. The company offers a range of products, including patented seed technologies and microbial agricultural inputs. Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) Crop Nutrition segment features innovative solutions like nitrogen-fixing biologicals, micro-beaded fertilizers, and biofertilizers. In the fiscal first quarter of 2025, Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) reported revenues of $93.3 million, down from $116.6 million in the same quarter last year. This decline was largely due to a slow start to the summer crop planting season in Argentina, affected by adverse weather conditions. The sales of micro-beaded fertilizers in Argentina faced challenges due to an unexpected change where more corn land was converted to soybeans. However, Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) experienced growth in North America and Brazil, demonstrating the effectiveness of its geographic diversification strategy to manage risks associated with weather fluctuations. In Q1 2025, a notable achievement for the company was the regulatory approval of its HB4 technology for soybean production in Uruguay and Bolivia. This expands the company’s market and positions it well for future growth. Additionally, Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp.

November 21, 2024 08:00 ET | Source: Ubitium Ubitium Düsseldorf, Nov. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- For over half a century, general-purpose processors have been built on the Tomasulo algorithm, developed by IBM engineer Robert Tomasulo in 1967. It’s a $500B industry built on specialised CPU, GPU and other chips for different computing tasks. Hardware startup Ubitium has shattered this paradigm with a breakthrough universal processor that handles all computing workloads on a single, efficient chip - unlocking simpler, smarter, and more cost-effective devices across industries - while revolutionizing a 57-year-old industry standard. Alongside this, Ubitium is announcing a $3.7 million in seed funding round, co-led by Runa Capital, Inflection, and KBC Focus Fund. The investment will be used to develop the first prototypes and prepare initial development kits for customers, with the first chips planned for 2026. Ubitium founders Martin Vorbach and Hyun Shin Sho Ubitium was founded by semiconductor veterans dedicated to revolutionizing processor architecture. CTO Martin Vorbach, who holds over 200 semiconductor patents licensed by major U.S. chip companies, spent 15 years developing this groundbreaking technology. Drawing from his pioneering work in reconfigurable computing, he created a workload-agnostic microarchitecture that allows the same transistors to be reused for different processing tasks—eliminating the need for multiple specialized cores and enabling AI at no additional cost. Working between Germany and Cupertino, California, Vorbach's innovation forms the foundation of Ubitium's mission. Vorbach met CEO Hyun Shin Cho at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). After two decades of gaining insights across various industrial sectors, Cho reunited with Vorbach to commercialize the technology. Completing the team is Chairman Peter Weber, a veteran of Intel, Texas Instruments, and Dialog Semiconductor, who brings extensive industry expertise. "The $500 billion processor industry is built on restrictive boundaries between computing tasks," says Hyun Shin Cho, CEO of Ubitium. "We're erasing those boundaries. Our Universal Processor does it all - CPU, GPU, DSP, FPGA - in one chip, one architecture. This isn't an incremental improvement. It is a paradigm shift. This is the processor architecture the AI era demands." “For too long, we’ve accepted that making devices intelligent means making them complex. Multiple processors or processor cores, multiple development teams, endless integration challenges—today, that changes. Our Universal Processor delivers workload-agnostic and AI-enabling compute capabilities to edge devices with a single chip, at a fraction of the cost to develop and manufacture compared to today’s offerings.” With the semiconductor market projected to exceed $700 billion by 2025, Ubitium's technology initially targets embedded systems and robotics. By simplifying system architectures and reducing costs, Ubitium's processor makes advanced computing capabilities accessible across all industries without requiring specialized hardware for each application—enabling advanced AI at no additional cost. Dmitry Galperin, a Berlin-based General Partner at Runa Capital, commented: "We're impressed by Ubitium's unique approach to processor microarchitecture, which is now able to adapt to any type of workload—from simple control logic to massive parallel data flow processing." "What Ubitium brings will provide a real breakthrough to develop and launch any new product with embedded electronics. Their approach will reduce the cost as well as the complexity, allowing a much faster time-to-market. What previously required multiple teams to collaborate on hardware and software design now becomes purely a software project," said Rudi Severijns, Investment Director at KBC Focus Fund. "Ubitium was a perfect fit as a contrarian bet on a stellar team working on generalized compute capacity in a world of chip specialization," said Jonatan Luther-Bergquist, Partner at Inflection. “We are excited to see Ubitium leveraging the flexibility and scalability of the RISC-V architecture,” said Calista Redmond, CEO of RISC-V International. “Their innovative approach to universal processor design exemplifies the freedom of innovation made possible by the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture and highlights the potential for RISC-V to drive advancements in edge computing and AI applications.” Looking ahead, Ubitium plans to develop a complete portfolio of chips that vary in array size but share the same microarchitecture and software stack—enabling solutions from small embedded devices to high-performance computing systems. This super-scalable approach allows customers to scale their applications without changing their development process, while the workload-agnostic design ensures the processor can adapt to handle any computing task without specialized hardware modifications. The company's goal is to establish its universal processor as the new standard that finally breaks down the cost and complexity barriers that have limited the deployment of advanced computing and AI capabilities across industries. "We envision a future where every device operates autonomously, making intelligent decisions in real time and transforming the way we interact with technology," added Hyun Shin Cho.

Title: Exclusive: Arcade, visual storytelling platform, raises $14 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins

Caroline Clark’s first word was “up.” Every child’s first word is seismic, and it was especially so for Clark: At the age of two, she was diagnosed as deaf. In a taped 2019 talk from her time in business school at Stanford, Clark tells the story of how her mother taught her to speak, starting word by word. And because no one’s more equipped to improve communication than someone who has truly spent time thinking about it deeply, Clark is now the cofounder and CEO of Arcade, a visual storytelling platform. “That experience learning how to speak from my mother has taught me how precious it is to choose every word,” she said. “I’ve used words to tell myself what’s possible. They’re powerful. In many ways, I think Arcade is helping you achieve that power—not only coming up with the right words but showing them in the most creative way possible.” It’s fitting that, in some sense, Clark’s job is helping companies find their voices, visuals, and stories. Arcade’s customers currently include Salesforce, Zapier, Atlassian, New Relic, Superhuman, and Carta, all of whom use the platform to develop interactive demos. “I think that people underestimate Arcade,” Clark told Fortune. “They say ‘Oh, it’s just a demo tool,’ but I think the word ‘demo’ is limiting. It’s really about content, collaboration, and creativity.” The company probably won’t be underestimated much longer, with more than 14,000 companies using the platform—and a new milestone. Arcade has raised a $14 million Series A, led by Kleiner Perkins, Fortune can exclusively report. Upfront Ventures and Foundation Capital, both existing investors, also participated in the round. Founded in 2021, Arcade draws inspiration from video games in both its name and product, which includes features like pulsating dots and load times. That’s not an accident—Clark and I talked about comic books (she recently read video game designer Jordan Mechner’s graphic memoir Replay) and her belief in “playfulness and going through the product as adventure.” Aditi Maliwal, Upfront Ventures partner, wrote the first check into Arcade in March 2021, and she’s watched Clark grow the company from a product into an enterprise sales company. “It’s really hard to cross that chasm and it takes a long time, but she’s a force of nature,” said Maliwal, who’s known Clark for seven years. “I wear this bracelet every day that says ‘resilience’ and, to me, Caroline signifies resilience. She truly had to learn how to hear and how to speak. She’s learned how to hear through her eyes.” Arcade’s opportunity fundamentally ties back to “the sea of software everywhere we go,” said Kleiner Perkins partner Mamoon Hamid. Clark had for years specifically wanted to work with Hamid, drawn to his track record investing in gorgeous workplace efficiency juggernauts like Slack, Figma, and Box. Hamid, who will join Arcade’s board, draws a parallel between Arcade and the evolution of tools like Slack, which brought a new level of visual and interactive communication to workplaces. “What I love about Arcade is that it’s creating this market where, if you describe the category, it doesn’t sound all that interesting,” he told Fortune. “Enterprise chat doesn’t sound interesting, but when you overlay a great product you can use, it drives some enjoyment—like communicating via Slack ten years ago with colleagues when the alternative was chat inside of Gmail or text messaging. There’s a richness these tools offer… and in the same vein, Arcade is very powerful yet beautiful in the way it helps you tell stories.” And, yeah, there’s an AI angle here—Arcade is currently investing in AI features like synthetic voice, automated translations, and recommendations that enhance the content creation process. But it’s all in the service of something that Clark speaks about more clearly than just about any professional storyteller I know: Precise communication not only matters but also makes a difference in real-world outcomes. “This is a really big statement, but broadly there’s so much happiness in words, but also pain that comes from miscommunication when you hear the wrong set of words,” said Clark. “You hear the right set of words, and you’re inspired and motivated. It really matters because there’s just so much more joy that could come from being measured and thoughtful about words.” To tell a story, you need to learn to hear, listen, and then talk. In its way, Arcade is about learning to speak—and it’s ready to be heard.

Title: QCP Capital: Nasdaq’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Launch Signals Institutional Boom
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/11/qcp-capital-nasdaqs-spot-bitcoin-etf-options-launch-signals-institutional-boom/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T10:57:13Z
Full Content:
On 19 November 2024, Nasdaq began listing options on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (ticker: IBIT). According to a report by Bloomberg, this launch follows over 10 months of collaboration between Nasdaq, BlackRock, and regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Options Clearing Corporation. Alison Hennessy, Nasdaq’s Head of ETP Listings, confirmed the launch, highlighting strong demand from investors seeking greater flexibility in managing Bitcoin exposure. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed over $30 billion in assets since its debut, making it the largest spot Bitcoin ETF in the market. Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, noted that while spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT have succeeded on their own merits, the addition of options provides a significant tailwind. Options offer investors a way to express precise views on Bitcoin’s price movement, ultimately driving greater volumes and assets into the product. In a recent blog post, Singapore-based crypto-focused proprietary trading firm and market maker QCP Capital emphasized the broader significance of this launch in their blog post, pointing out how institutional investors could benefit from regulated derivatives tied to IBIT. They noted that spot Bitcoin ETF options could attract a wave of institutions that face barriers to native crypto options platforms like Deribit. QCP Capital said that derivatives in traditional markets often grow to 10-20 times the size of the underlying asset’s market capitalization, and a similar trend could unfold in Bitcoin. Institutions may use these options to generate yield on long-term holdings, potentially compressing implied volatility in Bitcoin markets. Drawing parallels to the growing use of MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy, QCP Capital cited Q3 2024 filings showing a surge in institutional holders of MicroStrategy from 667 to 738. Vanguard alone increased its holdings by nearly 16 million shares—a 1,000% jump. QCP Capital noted that Bitcoin was stabilizing above $90,000, with the December 100k strike holding the highest open interest among IBIT options. Narrowing implied volatility spreads reflect growing confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory, potentially setting the stage for upward momentum. The firm also pointed to broader trends in institutional adoption, such as Goldman Sachs’ plans to spin off its digital asset platform, as further evidence of the integration of digital assets into traditional finance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Climate Change Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NYSE:NOVA) stands against other best climate change stocks. According to a report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the state of the climate in 2023 was marked by record-breaking levels of greenhouse gas emissions, ocean heat, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. The observed concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide reached record levels in 2022 and continued to increase in 2023. CO2 levels are now 50% higher than in the pre-industrial era, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to the long-term increase in global temperature. The global mean near-surface temperature in 2023 was 1.45°C above the pre-industrial 1850-1900 average, making it the warmest year on record. Sea level rise also continued to accelerate, with global mean sea level reaching a record high in the satellite record (since 1993). This reflects continued ocean warming and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. The rate of global mean sea level rise in the past ten years (2014-2023) is more than twice the rate of sea level rise in the first decade of the satellite record (1993-2002). Extreme weather and climate events had major socio-economic impacts on all inhabited continents, including major floods, tropical cyclones, extreme heat, and drought. The number of people who are acutely food insecure worldwide has more than doubled, from 149 million people before the COVID-19 pandemic to 333 million people in 2023. Weather and climate hazards continued to trigger displacement, with 1.8 million people displaced across Ethiopia, Burundi, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia, and Kenya in addition to the 3 million people displaced internally or across borders by the five consecutive seasons of drought in Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia.

According to a report published by Bloomberg on October 21, hedge funds are increasingly betting against the green economy despite significant global investments in clean energy and green technologies. Analysis of data from Hazeltree, which tracks disclosures from roughly 500 hedge funds, reveals that more funds are net short on green sectors such as solar, electric vehicles (EVs), batteries, and hydrogen than are net long. Conversely, fossil fuel sectors such as oil, gas, and coal have attracted more long bets. This shift reflects skepticism about the profitability and short-term viability of green investments, even as governments and scientists emphasize their necessity for addressing climate change. Higher interest rates have made capital-intensive projects such as offshore wind farms less viable, while geopolitical tensions, particularly around China's dominance in green technology supply chains, have deterred investments in areas like solar energy and EVs. Solar energy has seen a sharp decline, with hedge funds shorting 77% of companies in the Invesco Solar ETF as of the third quarter of 2024, compared to 33% in early 2021, when momentum for the green transition hit a peak. However, US-based companies that avoid reliance on China-dominated technologies, are exceptions. Similarly, the EV and battery sectors have seen a slowdown, with net short positions exceeding longs on 55% of companies in relevant ETFs. Fossil fuels, by contrast, have gained favor. Hedge funds are long on 53% of companies in the S&P Global Oil Index and 73% of major thermal coal companies. Rising global energy consumption and geopolitical instability have bolstered the case for these investments, even as green energy struggles to meet demand reliably. Hedge fund managers argue that fossil fuels remain essential for stable energy supplies. Hedge funds have shown optimism about wind energy, with long bets on nearly 60% of companies in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF, supported by growing government orders. Power infrastructure, including transmission grids, has also attracted interest, with long bets outnumbering shorts on 65% of companies in the sector. This sub-sector is considered crucial for meeting increasing electricity demands, including those driven by AI data centers. As the energy landscape continues to evolve, investors are closely watching the impact of the new administration on the renewable energy sector. With the global demand for clean energy on the rise and innovation in renewable technologies driving growth, the sector's long-term outlook remains compelling.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Climate Change Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) stands against other best climate change stocks. According to a report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the state of the climate in 2023 was marked by record-breaking levels of greenhouse gas emissions, ocean heat, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. The observed concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide reached record levels in 2022 and continued to increase in 2023. CO2 levels are now 50% higher than in the pre-industrial era, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to the long-term increase in global temperature. The global mean near-surface temperature in 2023 was 1.45°C above the pre-industrial 1850-1900 average, making it the warmest year on record. Sea level rise also continued to accelerate, with global mean sea level reaching a record high in the satellite record (since 1993). This reflects continued ocean warming and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. The rate of global mean sea level rise in the past ten years (2014-2023) is more than twice the rate of sea level rise in the first decade of the satellite record (1993-2002). Extreme weather and climate events had major socio-economic impacts on all inhabited continents, including major floods, tropical cyclones, extreme heat, and drought. The number of people who are acutely food insecure worldwide has more than doubled, from 149 million people before the COVID-19 pandemic to 333 million people in 2023. Weather and climate hazards continued to trigger displacement, with 1.8 million people displaced across Ethiopia, Burundi, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia, and Kenya in addition to the 3 million people displaced internally or across borders by the five consecutive seasons of drought in Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia.

According to a report published by Bloomberg on October 21, hedge funds are increasingly betting against the green economy despite significant global investments in clean energy and green technologies. Analysis of data from Hazeltree, which tracks disclosures from roughly 500 hedge funds, reveals that more funds are net short on green sectors such as solar, electric vehicles (EVs), batteries, and hydrogen than are net long. Conversely, fossil fuel sectors such as oil, gas, and coal have attracted more long bets. This shift reflects skepticism about the profitability and short-term viability of green investments, even as governments and scientists emphasize their necessity for addressing climate change. Higher interest rates have made capital-intensive projects such as offshore wind farms less viable, while geopolitical tensions, particularly around China's dominance in green technology supply chains, have deterred investments in areas like solar energy and EVs. Solar energy has seen a sharp decline, with hedge funds shorting 77% of companies in the Invesco Solar ETF as of the third quarter of 2024, compared to 33% in early 2021, when momentum for the green transition hit a peak. However, US-based companies that avoid reliance on China-dominated technologies, are exceptions. Similarly, the EV and battery sectors have seen a slowdown, with net short positions exceeding longs on 55% of companies in relevant ETFs. Fossil fuels, by contrast, have gained favor. Hedge funds are long on 53% of companies in the S&P Global Oil Index and 73% of major thermal coal companies. Rising global energy consumption and geopolitical instability have bolstered the case for these investments, even as green energy struggles to meet demand reliably. Hedge fund managers argue that fossil fuels remain essential for stable energy supplies. Hedge funds have shown optimism about wind energy, with long bets on nearly 60% of companies in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF, supported by growing government orders. Power infrastructure, including transmission grids, has also attracted interest, with long bets outnumbering shorts on 65% of companies in the sector. This sub-sector is considered crucial for meeting increasing electricity demands, including those driven by AI data centers. As the energy landscape continues to evolve, investors are closely watching the impact of the new administration on the renewable energy sector. With the global demand for clean energy on the rise and innovation in renewable technologies driving growth, the sector's long-term outlook remains compelling.

Upside Potential: 95.20% Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) is a leading residential solar energy company in the United States, offering solar-as-a-service solutions that allow homeowners to adopt solar power with minimal to no upfront costs. On October 23, Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) announced the launch of New York’s largest residential power plant in partnership with Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc., (O&R) a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. This innovative virtual power plant utilizes more than 300 solar-plus-storage systems, with home batteries providing stored solar energy to stabilize the grid during peak demand events throughout the summer. Sunrun Inc.’s (NASDAQ:RUN) synchronized batteries are designed to discharge energy to alleviate grid stress while ensuring backup power for participating customers. Through this program, the company offers free or discounted home batteries in exchange for a 10-year commitment to support grid reliability, facilitated by upfront payments from O&R based on installed battery capacity. Participating customers also receive bill credits for excess energy shared with the grid and retain at least 20% of battery power for personal backup use. Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) is also in discussions with data center developers to supply solar power for their operations. Sunrun Inc.’s (NASDAQ:RUN) multi-channel strategy, which includes direct-to-consumer sales and strategic partnerships, enables the company to attract a wide customer base efficiently. This diversified approach strengthens customer acquisition efforts while enhancing Sunrun Inc.’s (NASDAQ:RUN) market position. Overall, RUN ranks 2nd on our list of best climate change stocks to invest in right now.

Title: Bitcoin Soars To New Highs Near $95,000: Analyst Reveals Bullish Price Targets Ahead
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-soars-to-new-highs-near-95000-analyst-reveals-bullish-price-targets-ahead/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T10:00:57Z

Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new record high of $94,730, continuing a significant uptrend that began on November 5. Analysts are dubbing this rally the “Trump trade,” as the recent political developments surrounding Donald Trump’s victory have instilled renewed confidence among investors in BTC and the broader crypto market. Despite the impressive surge, analysts believe Bitcoin’s price discovery is far from complete, indicating substantial potential for further growth. Among those sharing this bullish sentiment is analyst Ali Martinez, who draws parallels between Bitcoin’s current price movements and those seen in December 2020, before the notable uptrend that ultimately led to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. Martinez notes that the relative strength index (RSI), a key technical indicator used to gauge momentum, is currently mirroring the patterns observed in late 2020. This similarity suggests that the BTC price may be poised for significant upward movements in the coming months. According to Martinez, if this trend continues, Bitcoin could target the $108,000 mark, followed by a potential correction to around $99,000, before bouncing back to a predicted milestone of $135,000. This forecast represents an increase of over 42% from current levels, although Martinez did not specify a timeline for these movements, indicating they might occur anywhere between now and the first quarter of 2025. In even more optimistic projections, market expert Timothy Peterson, who identifies as a network economist, suggests that Bitcoin’s current bullish trend could persist until November 2025, with ambitious targets set for the future. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Peterson predicted that Bitcoin could reach $275,000 per coin by Thanksgiving Day 2025. He bases this projection on Metcalfe’s Law, which posits that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its number of users. This indicates that as more individuals adopt Bitcoin, its value is likely to increase significantly. Looking further ahead, the economist also asserts that the Bitcoin price could achieve the coveted valuation of $1,000,000 per coin by 2029, representing a staggering 954% increase from current levels. Trading at $94,730 as of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has seen massive gains in recent weeks, with a 26% and 39% increase in the fourteen and thirty day time frames, respectively. Furthermore, BTC has reached a market cap valuation of $1.8 trillion, making it one of the most valuable assets in the world, currently ranked 7th, just behind companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Google and Amazon. But quite far from the leading asset in this matter which is gold with a market cap of $17 trillion.

Title: Energy Transfer (ET): Fueling America’s Future Under $25

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks Under $25 To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) stands against other best stocks under $25 to invest in right now. As reported by NPR, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to a record high, and so did the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. Wall Street investors consider this victory beneficial for business interests. While businesses have been victims of excessive regulations under the Biden administration, Trump is expected to ease restrictions and lower taxes. Investors were also glad to see the timely results of the election. Commenting on the scenario, Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, stated: “The market’s not only welcoming a Trump victory, but [also] the decisiveness of the victory. The clouds of uncertainty have really parted” With shareholders expecting lighter government oversight of the financial sector, the sector climbed 6.16% and emerged as the best-performing of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors. The S&P 500 bank index was up 10.68%, posting its largest daily jump in two years. Companies issuing credit cards performed especially well. A particular sector that appeared bright after Trump’s win was crypto. The price of Bitcoin rose above $80,000 for the first time ever after the win. Other cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin which is the favorite coin of Elon Musk, a strong Trump supporter, are also posting gains, as reported by BBC. Regarding the future outlook for Bitcoin, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan told CNBC that there is a clear path right up to $100,000 by 2024’s end while $200,000 is completely reasonable for 2025 considering that the trend is up and is going to stay intact for a while. Simultaneously, the conventional energy sector surged keeping in mind the new President’s goal to boost fossil fuel production. However, the clean energy sector suffered with at least half a dozen developers putting projects on hold as many projects await more clarity from the new administration. The new President had stated that he would pull back the unspent funds from Biden’s climate law, calling it a ‘green new scam’. While Trump’s win has been deemed as a setback for climate protection, analysts and activists believe that the transition to cleaner sources of energy will continue regardless, considering the fact that customers and investors want companies to deal with climate change. The economic benefits from new factories and power plants that have received government support can be seen in both states led by Democrats and Republicans. Since Trump has plans to increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US, the retail stocks that have their products produced outside the country posted declines after the election. However, other retail sector stocks especially department stores and others that derive revenue from issuing branded credit cards joined in on the post-election rally, as reported by Barron’s. To compile a list of the 12 best stocks under $25 to invest in right now, we used the Yahoo stock screener to acquire a list of stocks with the highest market caps and share prices below $25. We then examined analysts’ average upside potential of the shortlisted stocks. Our list is in ascending order of average upside potentials, as of November 18. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An oil rig in the middle of the ocean, its towering structure standing stout in the horizon. Average Upside Potential: 15.67% Share Price: $17.29 Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in North America. The firm is a publicly traded limited partnership with core operations encompassing transportation, storage, and terminalling for natural gas, crude oil, NGLs, refined products, and liquid natural gas. 80 countries and territories receive the firm’s exports. Energy Transfer was formed in 1996. Energy Transfer has one of America’s largest energy portfolios, with nearly 130,000 miles of pipelines and associated energy infrastructure in 44 states transporting the oil and gas products that make lives possible. The firm has been supplying America energy for more than two decades, representing a journey from a small intrastate natural gas pipeline operator to one of the largest investment-grade master limited partnerships in the US. The firm has a leading natural gas pipeline footprint well positioned to cater to the growing electricity demand as it pursues opportunities to serve growing power loads from new demand centers across its pipeline network. Additionally, the well-balanced asset mix tends to offer strong earnings support. In this regard, the firm’s segments include Crude Oil, NGL & Refined Products, Midstream (Gathering & Processing), Natural Gas Interstate Transport & Storage, and Natural Gas Intrastate Transport & Storage. For Q3 2024, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) reported a net income of $1.18 billion, up 103% compared to Q3 2024. Volumes on the firm’s assets continued to increase in the quarter with the addition of new organic growth projects and acquisitions. Crude oil transportation volumes were up 25%, NGL fractionation volumes were up 12%, NGL transportation volumes were up 4%, and Midstream gathered volumes and produced volumes were up 6% and 26%, respectively. With a unique nationwide footprint, a portfolio of assets with exceptional product and geographic diversity, and export capabilities, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) ranks as one of the best stocks currently trading below $25. Overall, ET ranks 12th on our list of best stocks under $25 to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of ET as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than ET but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks Under $25 To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA) stands against other best stocks under $25 to invest in right now. As reported by NPR, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to a record high, and so did the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. Wall Street investors consider this victory beneficial for business interests. While businesses have been victims of excessive regulations under the Biden administration, Trump is expected to ease restrictions and lower taxes. Investors were also glad to see the timely results of the election. Commenting on the scenario, Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, stated: “The market’s not only welcoming a Trump victory, but [also] the decisiveness of the victory. The clouds of uncertainty have really parted” With shareholders expecting lighter government oversight of the financial sector, the sector climbed 6.16% and emerged as the best-performing of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors. The S&P 500 bank index was up 10.68%, posting its largest daily jump in two years. Companies issuing credit cards performed especially well. A particular sector that appeared bright after Trump’s win was crypto. The price of Bitcoin rose above $80,000 for the first time ever after the win. Other cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin which is the favorite coin of Elon Musk, a strong Trump supporter, are also posting gains, as reported by BBC. Regarding the future outlook for Bitcoin, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan told CNBC that there is a clear path right up to $100,000 by 2024’s end while $200,000 is completely reasonable for 2025 considering that the trend is up and is going to stay intact for a while. Simultaneously, the conventional energy sector surged keeping in mind the new President’s goal to boost fossil fuel production. However, the clean energy sector suffered with at least half a dozen developers putting projects on hold as many projects await more clarity from the new administration. The new President had stated that he would pull back the unspent funds from Biden’s climate law, calling it a ‘green new scam’. While Trump’s win has been deemed as a setback for climate protection, analysts and activists believe that the transition to cleaner sources of energy will continue regardless, considering the fact that customers and investors want companies to deal with climate change. The economic benefits from new factories and power plants that have received government support can be seen in both states led by Democrats and Republicans. Since Trump has plans to increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US, the retail stocks that have their products produced outside the country posted declines after the election. However, other retail sector stocks especially department stores and others that derive revenue from issuing branded credit cards joined in on the post-election rally, as reported by Barron’s. To compile a list of the 12 best stocks under $25 to invest in right now, we used the Yahoo stock screener to acquire a list of stocks with the highest market caps and share prices below $25. We then examined analysts’ average upside potential of the shortlisted stocks. Our list is in ascending order of average upside potentials, as of November 18. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The firm’s high-quality medicines serve almost 200 million people across six continents every day. The company has a portfolio of over 3,600 medicines and produces nearly 76 billion tablets and capsules a year. Additionally, Teva has shown consistent quarterly revenue growth since Q1 2023. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA) closed a strong third quarter. The company posted revenues of $4.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Its innovative portfolio and generics business drove the strong quarterly performance. Other updates included Teva’s biosimilar candidate to Prolia (denosumab) being accepted for review by the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency, the UZEDY launch gaining momentum, and AUSTEDO demonstrating continued growth. UZEDY was approved by the FDA on April 28, 2023, for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Meanwhile, AUSTEDO is targeted at tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington’s disease. In conclusion, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA) is one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world with a global reach and scale as well as a fully integrated R&D function. The firm remains on track to deliver meaningful access to medicines as well as continued growth for its shareholders. Overall, TEVA ranks 4th on our list of best stocks under $25 to invest in right now.

(NYSE:CVE) is an integrated energy company headquartered in Calgary, Canada. The firm operates through various segments including Oil Sands, Conventional, and Offshore as its Upstream segments while Canadian Refining and US Refining serve as its Downstream segments. For the third quarter of 2024, Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) recorded total revenues of approximately $14.2 billion which declined year-over-year, primarily due to lower commodity prices affecting both upstream and downstream results. Total upstream production was 771,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a decrease over the year due to turnarounds at Christina Lake, Rainbow Lake, and other Conventional facilities. In the downstream, total throughput rose by about 20,000 barrels per day from the second quarter to almost 643,000 barrels per day, and a major turnaround was completed at the Lima Refinery. Additionally, Cenovus is progressing well on many projects that are expected to improve shareholder returns for the long term. While the firm started production from two new well pads at Sunrise which will ramp up in the 4th quarter, it progressed the tie-back of Narrows Lake, constructing a 17-km pipeline connecting the reservoir to the Christina Lake processing facility. Furthermore, the optimization project at Foster Creek is on track for startup by the middle of 2026. Thus, Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) is pursuing bright growth prospects and currently trades at a price below $25. Overall, CVE ranks 3rd on our list of best stocks under $25 to invest in right now.

Title: Ripple Labs Future Under Trump: CEO Brad Garlinghouse Outlines Vision For 2025
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/ripple-2/ripple-labs-future-under-trump-ceo-brad-garlinghouse-outlines-vision-for-2025/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T06:30:03Z
Full Content:
In a recent interview with FOX Business, Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, shared insights on the so-called “Trump trade” impacting crypto prices, as evidenced by Bitcoin’s recent streak of consecutive all-time highs over the past 48 hours. Garlinghouse also discussed how Ripple, and the broader digital asset industry, fit into the upcoming regulatory landscape expected under President-elect Donald Trump in the coming year. Garlinghouse emphasized that since its inception, Ripple has focused on addressing the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, which he described as “slow and expensive.” By utilizing XRP, the company aims to streamline these transactions, making them faster and more cost-effective. However, the CEO criticized the Biden administration’s stance on digital assets, referring to it as an “unlawful war” against the industry. He expressed optimism that with Trump’s pro-crypto approach, the landscape may be transforming. When asked about the potential for increased revenue opportunities in the US under the upcoming regulatory changes, Garlinghouse explained that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against XRP had effectively “frozen” Ripple’s market potential in the country. Currently, 95% of Ripple’s customer base is located outside the US, with Garlinghouse pointing out that the company cannot fully realize growth in a market where regulatory clarity is lacking. Garlinghouse observed that while the cryptocurrency industry is flourishing in countries like China, Japan, the UK, and Switzerland, the US has lagged behind in embracing digital assets. Ripple’s CEO expressed hope that the anticipated deregulation under Trump would lead to clearer guidelines, allowing agencies like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to play a constructive role in shaping the industry. Garlinghosue criticized the existing regulatory framework, particularly the application of the Howey Test, which he believes fails to adequately address the unique characteristics of the crypto sector. He also underscored the need for updated regulations that reflect the realities of an industry that has developed significantly over the past decade. During the interview, FOX Business highlighted comments from Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer, Faryar Shirzad, regarding the private meeting between Trump and Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase. Shirzad noted that Trump has expressed a willingness to engage with the crypto industry, fostering a vision for the US to become the global leader in digital assets. Garlinghouse echoed these sentiments, recognizing Coinbase’s influential role in advocating for the cryptocurrency agenda during the election campaign. As speculation mounts regarding potential candidates for the SEC chair position under Trump—names like Dan Gallagher, Teresa Goody, and Commissioner Mark Uyeda have surfaced—Garlinghouse emphasized the importance of the new chair working collaboratively with Congress to address regulatory gaps that contribute to confusion in the market. Garlinghouse concluded with an optimistic outlook, stating that he believes a new era for cryptocurrency is on the horizon in the US. He envisions the country becoming a central hub for digital assets and blockchain technology over the next five to ten years. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.10, marking a massive 104% surge in just two weeks since Trump’s election victory. However, the token is still trading 67% below its all-time high of $3,040, which it reached nearly seven years ago.

Speculators on the crypto-powered Polymarket prediction platform now see a more than 40% chance that Trump will create a bitcoin strategic reserve, with the odds climbing sharply following the leak of Trump's crypto czar discussions.

Trump has surrounded himself with heavily pro-bitcoin and crypto advisors through 2024, with some of his high-profile cabinet appointments known to be supporters of bitcoin and crypto. This week, Trump named Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive Howard Lutnick, who claims to "have hundreds of millions of dollars of exposure to bitcoin," to be his Commerce secretary. "Bitcoin, which is rare and is special, will become ever more rare, ever more valuable, over time it'll be financed just like gold [and] oil.

Title: Forêt restaurant review: A masterclass in French classic cooking in Dublin 4
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/restaurants/review/2024/11/21/foret-restaurant-review-a-masterclass-in-french-classic-cooking-in-dublin-4/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
I’ve been banging on about the lack of proper French restaurants in Dublin for years. Loudly. And, until recently, to absolutely no avail. If dining trends are cyclical, the 2015 closure of Racine in London – where I once dined on Henry Harris’s famed tête de veau with sauce ravigote, minus the calf’s brain (something to do with supply, I was told, though it didn’t stop the obvious jokes) – marked the end of bourgeois cooking and the dominance of new Nordic cuisine and its small plates. Now, London has gone full bouchon (Lyonnaise style restaurant). Harris is back, rattling pans at Bouchon Racine (good luck getting a booking), and bouchon-inspired spots are springing up faster than champignons after a downpour: Josephine Bouchon, Henri, Café Francois, Marceline – proof, if it were needed, that the Gallic revival is in full swing. And Dublin? Rien du tout. Until now. John and Sandy Wyer got wind that the space above O’Brien’s pub, conveniently next door to their fine dining spot, Forest Avenue, on Sussex Terrace, had become available. Formerly The Sussex, the room came pre-loaded with bistro charm: Victorian flourishes, casual wooden tables, and banquettes you can sink into. A few tweaks later, et voilà – a proper bistro, at last. They’ve named it Forêt, staying true to their woodland theme (see also: Little Forest in Blackrock). The menu is a celebration of French cooking at its most confident. Petites Assiettes (snacks) include house-made saucisson, leek vinaigrette, Bayonne ham and oysters mignonette (€3 each), a bright and briny opener. From the tempting Les Entrées, comes the terrine de campagne (€16). This rustic staple, straight from the bouchon playbook, is robust, slightly coarse, and made with Oxford Sandy and Black suckling pig from Dermot Allen’s Winetavern Farm in Wicklow. It’s crowned with an amber gelée, lightly laced with sherry (if I’m not mistaken), delivering a rich, savoury depth when spread onto the toasted sourdough. The violet mustard on the side is sharp enough to jolt you awake, while the cornichons add just the right tangy crunch to balance the richness. For our other starter, a salad of green beans (€12) mingles with rocket, lettuce, hazelnuts and potato in a velvety dressing that pools on the plate, topped with grated mimolette, the nutty Edam-style cheese from Lille. It’s simple but beautifully executed. [ Ballyfin restaurant review: ‘Downright dazzling, one of the most delicious things I’ve eaten this year’Opens in new window ] The French wine list is a salute to tradition, carefully chosen without falling into populist clichés and favouring low volume producers. There are eight wines by the glass (which are also available as half bottles), and the Forest Avenue house wine, a very good Burgundian Chardonnay (€48), carries us happily through the meal. The fish, halibut Grenobloise with artichoke purée (€28), is stunning. The skin is gloriously crisp, and the pearlescent flakes of fish are so perfectly cooked they practically glow. Capers and chives bring a bright, salty punch, while pickled celery adds crunch and a vinegary bite. A creamy, lemon-spiked sauce ties everything together, while the artichoke purée sits quietly on the side, offering an earthy counterpoint to the fish, fondant potato and sauce. It’s the dish of the evening, without question. Across the table, my daughter Belle has the chicken au vin jaune (€26) which is also very tasty. The bronzed, crackling skin hides succulent free-range breast meat, while the sauce – enriched with Jura’s famed Savagnin wine, aged under flor for six years – delivers nutty, rounded depth. It’s paired with kale, finely chopped morel mushrooms, and riz à la paysanne: buttery rice laced with tarragon and dotted with tender nuggets of chicken. Desserts walk the line between indulgence and restraint. The crème brûlée is tempting, but there’s only room to share, so croissant pudding (€8) it is. Croissants from the Wyers’ Una Bakery are transformed into a luxurious bread-and-butter pudding: crispy on top, custardy in the middle, and swimming in Cointreau caramel and custard. The vanilla ice-cream, with an intriguing touch of buckwheat, is bold yet balanced. [ Parrilla restaurant review: With happy diners and cocktail shaker at full throttle, Tuesday is the new Friday at this new Mexican spotOpens in new window ] Forêt is a masterclass in why the classics endure. Why butter, cream and meticulously sourced produce remain the holy trinity of good taste – and why a perfect croissant is never just a croissant. It’s a love letter to the French bistro, where every dish is cooked with precision, seasoned with authority, and served with an unwavering respect for tradition. The attention to detail goes beyond the plate, from the well-considered wine list to the understated ambiance, making it more than just a meal. It’s an experience. And with prices so thoughtfully pitched, it’s poised to become a firm favourite. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine and water was €148. The Verdict: It’s Lyonnaise bouchon in spirit and pure joy on the plate. Food provenance: Glenmar, Kingsbury Wagyu, Winetavern Farm, McNally Farm, and Castleruddery Farm. Vegetarian options: Leek vinaigrette, egg mayonnaise with celeriac rémoulade, onion velouté, green bean salad and vegetarian pithivier for main course. Wheelchair access: No accessible room or toilet. Music: French classics, from Georges Brassen to Gillian Hills.

Bitcoin broke through $95,000 this evening. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin prices attained their latest all-time high this evening when they climbed to $95,000 for the first time ever. The world’s most prominent digital currency, which has been enjoying some very compelling upside in recent weeks, rose to $95,000.20, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. The cryptocurrency has notched a series of fresh records recently as it benefits from very strong momentum and a wide range of bullish factors. Several analysts commented on the digital asset’s strength as of late, as well as developments that have helped fuel its aggressive gains. “It seems that almost every day Bitcoin makes a new all time high!” the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O said via emailed comments. “There are rumors circulating that Bitcoins latest push could be due to 1) Bitcoin ETFs recording over $1 billion inflows in 48 hours with ARKS ARKB leading the way with $267.3 million in inflows and 2)BlackRock Bitcoin ETF options launching with $1.9 Billion dollars traded on it’s first day!” she stated in reference to today’s upward movement. The market observer emphasized the strong inflows enjoyed by bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the significant interest in options contracts based on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol IBIT. Interestingly enough, the total bitcoin held by U.S. bitcoin ETFs recently surpassed 1 million units, according to figures that CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno supplied via Telegram chat. The chart below illustrates this milestone: U.S. bitcoin ETFs' total bitcoin holdings recently passed 1 million units. One analyst emphasized how intense demand for bitcoin is right now as the digital currency benefits from a very compelling combination of bullish factors. “Bitcoin’s climb to $95,000 feels like humanity finally boarding a lifeboat while the legacy financial system’s Titanic takes on water,” Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, said via emailed comments. “Persistent inflation, fiat instability, and a lack of trust in central banks are driving both individuals and institutions toward Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value,” he added. “Today’s surge likely stems from a perfect storm: rising demand, a supply crunch, and unwavering conviction from long-term holders.” One market observer spoke to just how bright bitcoin’s future seems to be. George Kailas, CEO of Prospero.ai, spoke to the digital currency’s current situation, emphasizing that “Typically you have at least some reasonable Bull and Bear case on anything.” “For example we have followed COIN through BTC to profit heavily off the ‘Trump trade’ the other stock we targeted before the election was Tesla,” he noted. “We said it would move around full self driving and sure enough it did around positive news this week. But you see things like this questioning the viability of FSD.” “There is some Bear case that is being made,” stressed Kailas. “I don't see a Bear case over the next 4 years right now for BTC so that is invariably going to create an environment where more and more major players jump on that bandwagon because it is glaring them in the face.” Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL.

Title: Bitcoin breaks $95,000 for first time on optimism over Trump crypto plans

By Tom Westbrook, Samuel Indyk and Suzanne McGee SINGAPORE/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bitcoin came within a whisker of closing above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president spurred expectations that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading between $98,000 and $99,000 in late afternoon trading in the U.S. on Thursday, after briefly touching $99,073. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up about 40% in the two weeks since Trump was voted in as the next U.S. president and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress. Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Crypto investors see an end to increased scrutiny under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom Trump has said he will replace. Trump also unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September. Although details about the business have been scarce, investors have taken his personal interest in the sector as a bullish signal. Billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Over 16 years after its creation, bitcoin appears on the cusp of mainstream acceptance. "Everyone who’s bought bitcoin at any point in history is currently in profit," Alicia Kao, managing director of crypto exchange KuCoin, said. "But those who bought it early, when there were significant obstacles to doing so and there was the might of the world’s financial and governmental forces intent on crushing it, are the real winners. Not because they’re rich, but because they’re right.” Bitcoin's rebound from a slide below $16,000 in late 2022 has been rapid, boosted by the approval of U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission had long attempted to block ETFs from investing in bitcoin, citing investor protection concerns, but the products have allowed more investors, including institutional investors, to gain exposure to bitcoin. CRYPTO RUSH More than $4 billion has streamed into U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds since the election. This week, there was a strong debut for options on BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s ETF, with call options - bets on the price going up - more popular than puts. "There is a persistent bid in the market," said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a digital assets hedge fund in Miami. "$100,000 is a foregone conclusion." Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price and shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings were up nearly 2.3% on Thursday. “Once you break out to new highs, you attract a lot of new capital," John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, said. "It's like gold in the 1970s, where this new high is in a price discovery mode. You don't know how high it's going to go," he said. Yet the rise is not without critics. Two years ago, the industry was wracked by scandal with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the jailing of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The cryptocurrency industry also has been criticized for its energy usage, with miners under scrutiny over their potential impact on power grids and greenhouse gas emissions due to their energy-intensive operations. Crypto crime also remains a concern, with an analysis by crypto researchers Chainalysis finding that at least $24.2 billion worth of crypto was sent to illicit wallet addresses last year, including addresses identified as sanctioned or linked to terrorist financing and scams.
