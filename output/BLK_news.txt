Title: Zuckerberg, other moguls say they're backing off ESG and DEI but are they for real?

'Hannity' panelists Riley Gaines, Joe Concha and Leo Terrell give their take on DEI and the Trump transition team. Over the past 18 months, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) agenda has suffered setbacks in corporate DEI programs, declining investment dollars, and the collapse of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance. In just the last month, major banks withdrew from net-zero alliances and Meta dismantled many of its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs. ESG seems to be coming unglued. But don’t be fooled. A closer look at what the banks have said reveals that they are still full of unrepentant ESG financiers. Many of the touted changes are superficial or cosmetic rather than indicative of an underlying philosophical shift. Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives have been the subject of heated opinions of praise and rebuke. (Adobe Stock) Dozens of Fortune 500 companies (including McDonald's and Walmart) representing trillions of dollars of market cap and millions of employees rolled back or nixed their DEI programs in 2024. ESG-labeled investment funds hemorrhaged cash over the past two years. And the incoming administration has promised to jettison DEI in federal agencies. DEI IS LIKE A WOKE IED FOR THE LEFT’S WAR AGAINST OUR MILITARY. WE MUST DEFUSE IT The Net-Zero Insurance Alliance has fallen apart with the mass exodus of insurance companies over the past year and a half when many state attorneys general expressed concern that participating in such an alliance might violate anti-trust and anti-collusion laws. U.S. states have withdrawn billions of dollars from Blackrock due to concerns about ESG. These changes are welcome corrections to the flawed and deeply ideological goals of ESG advocates. The latest dominos to fall are large American financial institutions. Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, and JP Morgan have all withdrawn from the global Net-Zero Banking Alliance. Even Blackrock, once a vocal advocate of ESG, withdrew from Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. Though this may appear to be of a piece with other rollbacks of ESG, cynicism is warranted. If you look at the press releases from these large financial institutions, you’ll find that they are unrepentant and still intend to pursue net zero goals. For example, Goldman stated: "Our priorities remain to help our clients achieve their sustainability goals and to measure and report on our progress." Citigroup was even more blunt: "we remain committed to reaching net zero." I WAS FORCED TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST MY SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HALT COMPELLED SPEECH, RACIST DEI Blackrock has been the most explicitly unrepentant. "[O]ur memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion… and subjected us to legal inquiries… [But this] does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios." Translation: "We just want to distance ourselves from problematic PR, but we are not changing a single thing about how we do business." The moves by these large banks seem to imitate Blackrock CEO Larry Fink’s strategy of not using the term "ESG" because it was a political hot potato, but remaining committed to "sustainability." Blackrock remains heavily invested in green infrastructure and renewable energy projects. That’s fine if their clients explicitly ask for such investments. But as American Airlines learned last week, pension fund managers have a fiduciary obligation to pursue the best financial returns for their clients and they can be held liable for using the funds they manage for other ends. NEARLY HALF OF ALL US COLLEGE STUDENTS REJECT MANDATORY DEI COURSES ON CAMPUS: STUDY While superficial progress has been made with U.S. financial institutions withdrawing from destructive global net-zero alliances, they appear insincere when it comes to truly changing their ways. This should not be surprising given that bank personnel have not changed much. Nor do we see evidence of a change of heart when it comes to ESG. Instead, they seem concerned about public pressure and criticism from the incoming federal administration and from state government officials. Withdrawing from these alliances also gives them a freer hand to signal net zero intentions without having to deliver on them by a fixed date. But if ESG policy was distracting and destructive before, it is still so now. Ideological ESG priorities detract from companies’ ability to function well and benefit their contractual stakeholders. Companies have a hard enough time being profitable without pursuing various social justice priorities. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Banks would do better to clarify their commitment to maximizing shareholder value and doing business with everyone. Pursuing long-term profit successfully benefits shareholders, workers, suppliers and customers. Most corporations, especially the unrepentant financiers, need to clean house in their human resources departments to focus on value creation rather than racial identity politics or costly virtue-signaling on environmental and social issues. And as the American Airlines case shows, companies that fail to do so may very well be violating their fiduciary duty to clients and to shareholders.

Title: US President-Elect Donald Trump Said to Plan Elevation of Cryptocurrency as a National Priority
URL: https://www.gadgets360.com/cryptocurrency/news/donald-trump-plan-designate-cryptocurrency-national-priority-7493915
Time Published: 2025-01-17T07:15:44Z

Photo Credit: Unsplash/ Ewan Kennedy The US government currently holds nearly $20 billion worth of Bitcoin, President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority and giving industry insiders a voice within his administration, according to people familiar with the plans. The order is expected to name crypto as a national imperative or priority — strategic wording intended to guide government agencies to work with the industry, according to people familiar with the matter. It is also slated to create a crypto advisory council to advocate for the industry's policy priorities, said the people who requested anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public. Trump has enjoyed strong support from the crypto industry, which has a powerful presence in Washington, backed by well-funded political action committees. A slew of companies, including Coinbase and Ripple, have donated to Trump's inaugural committee in recent months. On Friday, days before the inauguration, the industry is hosting an “Inaugural Crypto Ball” in support of Trump. The executive order would mark a sea change for crypto, which has been a target for investigations during President Joe Biden's administration following a spate of high-profile fraud cases, including the bankruptcy of the FTX exchange. Federal agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission filed more than 100 enforcement actions against the sector in recent years, and banking regulators made it difficult for crypto companies to work with financial institutions. Still under discussion for inclusion in the executive order is a directive for all government agencies to review policies about digital assets and possibly pause any litigation involving crypto, the people said. Stopping legal actions that have targeted a range of companies from Binance Holdings Ltd., the world's biggest crypto exchange, to startup Ripple Labs Inc. is a top priority for the industry. Also under consideration is the creation of a national Bitcoin stockpile, which would encompass the government's existing holdings of the world's biggest cryptocurrency, the people said. The US government currently holds nearly $20 billion worth of Bitcoin, confiscated as part of various investigations, according to analytics company Arkham. Bitcoin has rallied almost 50%, to above $100,000, since the November election in part on hopes that such a stockpile would be created. The token more than doubled in price in 2024. The people cautioned that the executive order, which could come as soon as Monday, is not final and could change before it is made public. A representative for Trump did not immediately respond to a request to comment. Trump has vowed to issue a bevy of executive orders across a range of disparate industries and issues within his first few days back in office. “What I think Donald Trump is going to do is signal that the United States is back and we are ready to lead in this industry,” said Kara Calvert, vice president for US policy at Coinbase Global Inc., the country's biggest cryptocurrency exchange. “What it's signaling to other countries is be careful, or you won't keep up.” Despite regulatory setbacks under Biden, crypto in the US expanded, with major financial companies including the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock Inc., launching spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds last year. BNY has been working to expand its crypto custody effort, and Cantor Fitzgerald announced plans to launch a Bitcoin financing business. Trump embraced the crypto industry during the presidential campaign last year. In July, he headlined a Bitcoin conference, where he promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Trump-branded collections of nonfungible tokens have been coming out for several years, and last year he and his sons announced a crypto effort called World Liberty Financial, which is supposed to let people earn and borrow crypto, but has yet to provide those services. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Factbox-Trump's inauguration marks new era for cryptocurrency

By Tom Wilson (Reuters) - Advocates and holders of crypto will soon influence U.S. policy on the emerging technology after a slew of nominations and advisory appointments by President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. The crypto industry has spent years fighting lawsuits and enforcement actions by the U.S. government. It hopes the incoming Trump administration will mark a shift in policy. Political appointees will be vetted for potential conflicts. Some have committed to selling their interests. The industry is hosting a sold-out black tie ball in Washington on Friday, with tickets ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. David Sacks, Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, is scheduled to attend. Below are some facts on the crypto positions of key members of the incoming administration and Trump's inner circle. SCOTT BESSENT A billionaire hedge fund manager, Trump's pick to be Treasury Secretary has spoken favorably about crypto. "Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay," he told Fox News in July. "I think everything is on the table with bitcoin." According to a financial disclosure filed last month, Bessent holds shares in a BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) bitcoin exchange-traded fund worth between $250,001 and $500,000. Bessent will divest his interests in the fund and other investments within 90 days of his confirmation, he wrote last week to the U.S. Treasury. Bessent did not respond to a request for comment. HOWARD LUTNICK Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce is a vocal supporter of bitcoin. Lutnick is CEO of New York brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which earns fees to manage billions of dollars' worth of U.S. Treasuries for Tether, the company that issues the eponymous stablecoin. "Do I own bitcoin? Of course I do," Lutnick said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. "Does Cantor Fitzgerald own bitcoin? A shedload of bitcoin." Lutnick did not respond to a request for comment. ELON MUSK The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief and world's richest man, chosen by Trump to oversee a government cost-cutting effort, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has long championed crypto including bitcoin and dogecoin. His public comments and actions of his companies have in recent years influenced the price of bitcoin and dogecoin, a smaller token conceived as a joke during an earlier crypto bubble. The acronym for Musk's cost-cutting agency, DOGE, is a nod to dogecoin, which is now the world's seventh-biggest crypto token based on its circulation of $4.5 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko. In 2021 Tesla bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, becoming one of the biggest companies to own crypto before selling most of its holdings. It held unspecified digital assets totaling $184 million in September 2024, a company financial report showed. Musk did not respond to a request for comment sent via Tesla on what crypto assets he may hold. VIVEK RAMASWAMY Set to work with Musk at DOGE, the former presidential candidate and entrepreneur is the founder of Strive Asset Management. Strive, which said in September it managed over $1 billion in assets, last month filed to launch an exchange-traded fund that invests in corporate bonds for bitcoin investments. The company's wealth management arm, launched in November, seeks to integrate bitcoin into Americans' investment portfolios, Ramaswamy said in a press release. In June 2023, Ramaswamy held $100,001 to $250,000 of bitcoin and $15,001 to $50,000 worth of the smaller token ether, according to a financial disclosure. He did not respond to a request for comment. DAVID SACKS A former PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) executive, Sacks was appointed White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar in December, tasked with developing a U.S. legal framework long sought by the crypto industry. Sacks is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures. The firm has invested in crypto firms including BitGo and Bitwise, its website shows. Sacks did not respond to requests for comment. STEVE WITKOFF Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate tycoon and donor to the incoming president, founded crypto venture World Liberty Financial in November. World Liberty, which sells a proprietary token, lists on its website Trump as among those entitled to a large share of any of the company's revenues. Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment. ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP JR., BARRON TRUMP Eric Trump told Reuters last year he was very involved in World Liberty, which he, his elder brother Don Jr. - seen as the most influential family member in the presidential transition - and younger half-brother Barron helped to form. Eric told a bitcoin conference in December the technology was a "financial revolution," and that his father would make the United States the crypto capital of the world. JD (NASDAQ:JD) VANCE U.S. Vice President-elect Vance held between $250,001 and $500,000 in bitcoin in August 2024, according to a financial disclosure. The venture capital firm co-founded by Vance, Narya, has made investments in Strive, Ramaswamy's asset management company, and video platform Rumble, its website shows. In November, Rumble said it would allocate its excess cash reserves to bitcoin. The company also received last year a $775 million investment from stablecoin firm Tether. Asked for comment on the crypto stances of Vance and Trump's sons, Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said - without providing evidence - that bureaucrats in Washington had sought to stifle innovation with more regulation and higher taxes. "President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto and other emerging technologies," he said in a statement to Reuters. PAUL ATKINS Atkins, a lawyer and former top SEC official, is Trump's choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and has advocated for deregulation. He is expected to take a softer approach to crypto than current Chair Gary Gensler. Atkins is chief executive of Patomak Global Partners (NYSE:GLP), a consultancy. Patomak advises "cutting-edge crypto-native companies" and traditional financial firms on how to "leverage digital assets for growth," its website says. Atkins did not respond to a request for comment.

With President Donald Trump’s inauguration just a few days away, Bitcoin and blockchain supporters are bracing for crypto-friendly policies. Leading the charge is Texas, with Senator Charles Schwertner announcing a bill to launch its first state-level Bitcoin reserve. In a Twitter/X post, Senator Schwertner announced the filing of SB 778, making Texas the first state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. According to the Texan legislator, creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve will position the state as a blockchain leader, drive economic growth, and secure everyone’s economic freedom. Texas is the 10th largest economy globally and has over $194 billion in general revenue that will fund the state’s operations from 2026 to 2027. In addition to its huge budget, the state has a growing Bitcoin and blockchain economy. It’s also home to several crypto mines, including the one in the city of Rockdale, which is acknowledged as the biggest Bitcoin mining operation in North America. It’s time for Texas to lead the way in establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. That’s why I filed SB 778, which, if passed and signed into law, would make Texas the first state in the nation to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This would position our state at the… pic.twitter.com/dRdCt86Otr — Charles Schwertner (@DrSchwertner) January 15, 2025 According to Schwertner, it’s about time that Texas led the way in approving and launching a crypto reserve. In addition to the proposal to start a reserve fund, SB 778 also outlines a recommendation to set up the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Advisory Committee. This committee shall include the House chairs for Appropriations and Finance, a comptroller, a member of the Senate and the House, among others. Although the general aim of establishing the state’s crypto reserve is to leverage the blockchain and use it as a hedge against inflation, SB 778 also outlines its specific purposes. According to Section 403.703, the state aims to hold BTC as a financial asset. The document also specifies that persons, including Texans, can donate Bitcoin to advance shared ownership and a sense of community. The document also highlights specific transactions that will not be allowed. For example, Section 403.705 indicates that the comptroller cannot approve transactions to buy BTC to be held in other countries. Although some questions and risks are associated with creating a reserve, many states are pushing forward. Aside from Texas, Oklahoma has shared its plans to hold the premiere digital currency as part of its currency reserves. Representative Cody Maynard filed HB 1203, the Strategic Reserve Act, which aims to allocate a portion of the state’s pension funds to buy these digital assets. Pennsylvania lawmakers also submitted their plans to invest in Bitcoin. The state’s policymakers suggest that the state’s Treasury allocate up to 10% of the funds to buy crypto. Representative Mike Cabell says the state can follow the lead of private financial firms like Fidelity and BlackRock.

Layoffs: The United Kingdom's biggest asset manager Schroders Plc plans to layoff as much as 3 per cent of its workforce, or 200 jobs, as new Chief Executive Officer Richard Oldfield looks to revive growth, according to a Bloomberg report on January 17 citing sources. The source added that the layoffs would mostly be in technology and is one of the major changes being implemented by new CEO Oldfield, who took over from former and long-time chief Peter Harrison in November 2024, as per the report. “Our priority is to reposition the business at pace, as we transition to growth,” a spokesperson for the London-based firm said in a statement, Bloomberg added. As of June 30, the nearly 220-year-old Schroders managed around £774 billion ($947 billion) of assets. The job cuts will help it “improve delivery and ensure we are well-placed to meet our 2025 objectives, which are centered on reinforcing our active investment proposition,” the spokesperson added. Schroders' share price has sunk by around 50 per cent since its 2021 peak as it faced criticism for relatively high cost base and slower organic growth. The talk points also came amid wider woes facing traditional active fund managers as investors flock to lower-cost passive funds, the report noted. Other firms in the industry have trimmed their workforces in recent months, including Wellington Management and Manulife Financial Corp. Earlier this month, BlackRock Inc. told employees it’s cutting about 1 per cent of its over 21,000 employees. This means around 200 jobs are on the chopping block. “The cuts are part of BlackRock’s efforts to realign its resources with the firm’s strategy… As part of these firmwide efforts, we will be making changes today that will see approximately 1 per cent of our colleagues leave the firm… This is never easy,” BlackRock President Rob Kapito and COO Rob Goldstein told staff in a memo on January 8.

Today’s KevinMD article is “Leveraging Your Medical Career for Long-Term Wealth Building.” Amir, welcome to the show. Amir Baluch: Hey, thanks for having me on. So I’ll start by briefly sharing my story and journey. Kevin Pho: Go right ahead. Amir Baluch: Well, it was kind of not the smoothest journey to get to where I am. So right now, I’m a semi-retired anesthesiologist and mainly focus on wealth strategies and alternative investments. But unlike most people listening to the show, I actually did not get into medical school the first time I applied. That was kind of painful. And so I decided to put my life savings in my first business, electronic payments. After about a year, that didn’t work either. So then I’m like, OK, what am I going to do? I guess I’ll move back in with my parents in Midland, Texas. My dad was an internal medicine doctor, so I figure, hey, they’ve got a spare bedroom for me. But two months later, he declared bankruptcy—clinic wasn’t doing well, some failed investments—and we actually ended up moving to a one-bedroom apartment, the whole family, and kind of started from scratch. So I was just sitting there thinking to myself: How do I prevent this, or where is the lack of financial education? I definitely didn’t get it in college or in high school. So, you know, I started learning a lot just from books and audio books as well. There weren’t really that many masterminds or anything like that. So Rich Dad Poor Dad was a book that was pretty popular around that time, like a quarter of a century ago, actually. And eventually I figured out that most people make their first million in real estate. So I started getting into real estate at the age of 21 while I reapplied. Eventually, I did get into medical school, thankfully, on the second attempt, but I kept going with those alternative investments in real estate. And eventually, when I was 25, I got into my first multifamily deal as an LP with a private REIT. In 2008, when I was a resident in Miami doing anesthesia, we did a short sale flip in Dallas. I eventually moved to Dallas in 2010–2011. I got my securities license because I love to learn. I joined a boutique investment bank. It had a broker-dealer arm and also a mergers and acquisitions arm. So I learned from them for about half a decade before I went off on my own to create Baluch Capital and help educate other physicians, so they wouldn’t end up like my family did, you know, 25 years ago, and also present some opportunities for growth and passive income. Kevin Pho: All right. So you’re an anesthesiologist, and of course, you have your focus on wealth building as well. What’s your life like between those two careers? Amir Baluch: Well, a few years ago, I went down to about doing 8 days a month of anesthesia. I took a year off to kind of formalize our company, make my brother systematize on the real estate development side, and brought in some underwriters from BlackRock, JP Morgan. Then I went back into anesthesia about 4 to 5 days a month. So, you know, every other Friday and maybe every other Tuesday, I’ll be in the OR, just picking up shifts or, you know, helping out friends if they’re on vacation—I’ll cover them. That way, I still have one foot in the game and get some free food every now and then, and don’t let my Figs scrubs go to waste that I spent so much money on, right? But most days, I’m waking up at 4 a.m. and I’m online with my team. We’re doing Zoom calls, we’re preparing for the day, and usually by 9 a.m. I’ve pretty much got a whole day’s worth of work done. The rest is pretty much the bonus round. We just work a lot on acquisition of real estate development, so we’re constantly working with underwriters and brokers and wholesalers. On the private equity side, we’re constantly in meetings with companies that we’ve already invested in. And a lot of times, I’m a strategic partner with them. So we’ve got to sit in on these quarterly meetings and help, you know, either if they need to pivot or need to scale up or wherever they are in their process. Then we also do acquisitions, buying out e-commerce stores and creating fixed income products for passive cash flow for people. So all that structuring, organization, and team building is usually the space that I live in. Kevin Pho: All right. So let’s talk about your KevinMD article, “Leveraging Your Medical Career for Long-Term Wealth Building.” Tell us what this article is about for those who didn’t get a chance to read it. Amir Baluch: Well, you know, physicians are in such a unique space because they study for about 12 years, and they go into debt, which is kind of a disadvantage, but then they cash flow pretty significantly, and they usually have pretty good credit. So they have the cash flow, but they don’t have the time. So now, how can you use this to your own benefit? Well, you know what, whenever we become doctors, we kind of have a systematic approach for diagnosis and treatment, right? But a lot of times, we don’t apply that to investing. People kind of just shoot from the hip, but I think if doctors started applying that to their investments, they could actually diversify and create a systematic plan. “Hey, let me have a certain amount of private equity, a certain amount of private credit, a certain amount in real estate, a certain amount in the public stock markets,” and build a portfolio just as if they were trying to build a medical plan with somebody with multiple comorbidities. “Hey, we’ve got to treat your diabetes; we’ve got to treat your blood pressure; use this; use this.” You bring in specialists when you need them, right? You consult with other people when you get stuck. You don’t try to make a diagnosis or decide what the plan is on your own. So I think a lot of that mindset is actually embedded in the back of a doctor’s head, but sometimes they don’t use it because they’re so pressured with time, which is really their greatest asset. That’s the one that they really have to protect. So what I feel that a lot of physicians should do is, you know, if they have the strong cash flow and they can live a little bit below their means and start generating passive income, if you start focusing more on assets that create passive income instead of just focusing on net worth, you could buy your time back. For example, we’ve helped a lot of doctors just take one day off a week. Let’s say you can just take a Wednesday off, or maybe two afternoons—maybe Tuesday, Thursday afternoon. You can just work on your practice or work on something outside of medicine, like if you are going to go into real estate or you have another type of side hustle, just to kind of clear your mind. But it does help to get that extra maybe 5,000 to 10,000 dollars a month first, so you can back off a little bit and get a big perspective on what’s going on. Don’t miss out on the big picture, because when you’re working as a doctor—I don’t know how it was for you—but you’re just like, man, it’s work, work, work. It seems to never end. So I think that’s a good strategy that doctors can use to get their time back, which will help them make better investment decisions, maybe help grow their practice if they’re private practice. If you’re W-2, that’s a little bit different, but they could start building a second stream of revenue and kind of have some more control in life and also diversify from some of the pitfalls of medicine, which a lot of people don’t like to talk about, like decreasing reimbursement rates and a lot more corporate control and feeling the squeeze from these mergers. Kevin Pho: So you talk about alternative sources of income, passive sources of income. Normally, that tells me that this is real estate-based—that’s part of your background as well. So let’s say we’re a physician, or a physician is listening to you here, interested in hearing more. Tell us how they can get started. What are some examples of some of these passive income streams that you’re talking about? Amir Baluch: Well, I think that an easy one to get into is anything involving real estate, just because we’re a little bit more familiar with it. So I tried to get in with just doing a single-family rental. It’s kind of easy to get your mind wrapped around it, and it’s a business, but it’s very simple. The cash flow comes in from rent; your expenses are mainly the mortgage and maybe a little bit of upkeep. And that’s a pretty small business model but very easy to understand. And for a physician, it comes with a little bit of cash flow and some decent tax benefits. So you’re working on both offense and defense there. That’s a good place to go. The next probably would be private equity, which just means private business. So there’s public equity, like public stocks, and there’s private. It just happens that private equity has made more money than public equity every year for the last 35 years. So at some point, somebody should have some exposure to it. And physicians can team up and buy into these businesses. Even some mom-and-pop businesses, you could buy at maybe three to four times the net income of a business, which means your return is, you know, the inverse of that, which is 25 percent cash-on-cash return from day one. So imagine if you could buy into something that’s maybe medically related—maybe it’s an existing medical spa, which, you know, is a little bit medical, but maybe you might not have aesthetics involved in it. Or maybe it’s a joint venture with a pharmacy or something like that, that’s a little bit medically related but not what you’re trained to do. There’s actually good cash flow from there. And then, as they get older, it’s usually better. You know, then you’re trying to just protect what nest egg you’ve created, and you’re just looking for even more cash flow to bring your time back, and maybe something less risky. So usually private credit offers that, where it’s fixed debt against lending on a hard asset like real estate. Also, there are things like municipal bonds and corporate bonds. There are some public stocks that put off dividends, but it’s not that great. And then also just traditional fixed income products as well that you could get from either a financial advisor or even online. You could find those things where you could be a debt partner into a different type of entity. Kevin Pho: Now let’s talk about the first thing you mentioned—single-family homes. How does one get started in that? You say that it’s a simple business, but let’s say a physician, like you said, is at a time deficit, may not know a lot about real estate. How does one learn enough to have the confidence to purchase a single-family home for passive income purposes? Amir Baluch: Well, there are a couple of ways. One, if somebody wanted to partner on the money side and the lending side and have somebody else kind of manage it from a distance, you could do that. And usually there are realtors out there that specialize in it. So how I got started—I got my real estate license in 2011. I don’t think anybody needs to do that. But even then, I worked with another realtor that specialized in single-family rentals. And so you can find these people online, and there are also these real estate meetups that you’re going to find in almost any city. So networking with people that are in that space is probably the first place to go. And whenever you find somebody there, as soon as you are collaborating with them, they’re going to open up their Rolodex. They’ve got people that lend on it, they’ve got people that find the properties, they’ve got people that manage the properties, because eventually you need some type of a team. If you’re wondering who those team players are, probably the best book you could get—now, I’ve actually just bought and given away copies of this; I wish it was my book—but it’s called The Millionaire Real Estate Investor by Gary Keller. It’s like a blue and white book on Amazon, probably 10 bucks or something like that. But they show you step by step on what team members you need to make this pretty smooth. And so, you know, once you start putting your team together and pull the trigger on your first one, and you get through a year or two of that first one, you kind of know, hey, what to look for, how to hire a proper property manager. And, you know, you rarely get any phone calls. So I think that’s the first thing to do: put together your team of a realtor that knows what they’re doing, get your lender—then the lender might have some contacts for you to help get you some deals too—and then a property manager. Kevin Pho: Now, contrast that option with, say, real estate syndications, because I hear a lot of physicians who may not want to make that effort in constructing their own team and directly purchasing a property, then go into real estate syndications. So contrast those two options. Amir Baluch: That’s a good topic. So the most important thing that a lot of people don’t talk about—the most important difference—is the valuation method. Most businesses, including a multifamily syndication or any commercial real estate syndication, the whole enterprise is valued at a certain multiple of the net income. Now, in commercial real estate, though, it just happens that instead of using a multiple of the net income or the multiple of EBITDA, you basically get the inverse of that, which is cap rate. And so cap rate is your, you know, if you bought a property all cash, what is your cash-on-cash return for a year? It’s usually like 4, 5, 6 percent, something like that. So that’s how those things are valued. So if you don’t increase the net income, if you don’t increase the rents, the value of that property is not going to go up. And you get a little bit of cash flow, but that value is really not going up that much. And sometimes it can go down, even if you increase rents, which is what’s happened in the last couple of years in multifamily. Now, if you contrast that with single-family, why does the value of the house go up? Well, it’s actually not the value, but the price of the house goes up because the value of the dollar goes down, and houses are always a good hedge against inflation. So houses will adjust for inflation, and the valuation is based off comps. So if your neighbor next door sold for a million bucks, and you’re right next to them, and you have about the same square footage, you’re probably going to sell for a million bucks. And it happens that, you know, all the components to make a house—wood, steel, labor, wages—that all goes up. So, you know, the replacement cost goes up, which makes these houses more valuable over time as well. So the valuation method is a little bit different, and you have to just go in there knowing what the plan is. So on a single-family, if you just buy and hold, and the cash flow is more than your monthly payment to the bank, you’re pretty much going to be OK no matter what, as long as you don’t get huge expenses coming in or too much vacancy. In commercial real estate, the difference is you’re going to be a lot more passive, so you can sit back and not do much work, but you’ve got to be careful about the valuations going in. You need to know a little bit more about how they’re going to increase those rents. In any commercial thing, it’s all about increasing the rents and decreasing expenses. You kind of have to have a better grasp of that and not just blindly invest in that, because if it’s not managed correctly, the overall property can go down in value—or maybe just not go up in value as much—compared to a single-family rental, which is pretty much always going to go up in value because it’s just hedging against inflation, sometimes a little bit better or oftentimes, in my opinion, better than commercial real estate. Kevin Pho: Now let’s talk about the second option you mentioned, which is private equity. How do physicians dip their toes into that potential option? Amir Baluch: So this is a little bit trickier. You know, sometimes they’ve done it and didn’t even know that they’re in it. For example, a lot of my surgery buddies are partners in a surgery center—that’s technically private equity. Or maybe if somebody opened up or partnered on a coffee shop down the street or anything that’s a private business, they might be in it but not thinking that it’s private equity, but it is, just on a very small scale. A lot of times when people think private equity, they think of businesses that are, you know, 10 million, 50 million, maybe even a few billion dollars. That one, at least for me, is just a lot of networking. Luckily, because of my securities license, I was networked with a bunch of broker-dealers, and we just get deals all the time. Most of these things involve issuing securities in the private market. And so through them, I’ve gotten a lot of deal flow in at least life sciences and biotech. But if somebody wants to get into private equity, you really have to go out there and basically take action and look for it. So you could go find some business brokers. For example, let’s say I really wanted to get into a pharmacy, because as an anesthesiologist, I just liked the pharmacology, right? And maybe I just wanted a pharmacy. You could find business brokers that are selling it and get on those email lists and say, “Hey, I’m looking for this. I can get an SBA loan for about a million, so I have this much down payment. If you find somebody that’s willing to owner-finance, I could do that.” And you actually go out there and have to hunt. It’s way easier to do public equity, right? You just push a button online and buy stocks. But the downside of that is those are very efficient markets, and in an efficient market, it’s hard to get good risk-adjusted returns. In the private market, there’s a lot more inefficiencies. You have to deal with brokers, and the deals take a long time to close. It’s not like if somebody puts a Twitter post online that the valuation changes in milliseconds or anything like that. So it’s a little bit more work but a lot more stable. Over time, the data has shown it’s more profitable and higher risk-adjusted returns. Kevin Pho: Now, is there a certain type of physician personality trait who would be more amenable to these alternative investments versus just sticking with low-cost index funds? Because from what I’m hearing, not all physicians may be cut out for these alternative investments that you’re talking about. Amir Baluch: Right. I think, you know, at the end of the day, you can make it through either path. I’d say if you are going to do a set-it-and-forget-it with index funds, you’re going to have to save a lot more and have a longer timeline. Right now, I mean, these people—nobody has a crystal ball—but JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are predicting that the next 10 years, the S&P and indices should be averaging around 3 percent, 2 to 3 percent a year returns after adjusting for inflation because of the bull run we’ve had and P/E ratios, you know, two standard deviations above where they usually are, and things like that. So if you just have a longer timeline, you could set it and forget it if you don’t want to spend the time to learn about alternatives or if you don’t have the network to find some mentors that could help guide you. Now, if somebody has more time on hand and wants to diversify—which I think diversification is really key because you can never put all your eggs in one basket, right? So if somebody wants to diversify, it is a little bit more active. Even if you end up being a limited partner in some type of alternative syndication, there’s still some active role in there. You need to do some minimal due diligence. And if anybody has questions about that, they could email me on an asset class. I’ll at least show, you know, 20 or 30 things you should look at in every asset class before you pull the trigger. But you do have to take a little bit more active role or maybe put together a small investment group where everybody is putting in their two cents and dividing up the work and pooling their money together to invest as a group. That’s another way to do it if people are constrained for time. But for sure, people that have more time, which in my experience has been anesthesiologists and emergency doctors—it’s more like shift-work-oriented—or even hospitalists that are one week on, one week off, are now really getting into alternatives and having the time to do the due diligence on these deals and increase their deal flow. Because it just depends on your time, the time involvement you want to take, and your timeline. If you can look further out and save more money, you could go with the indices route—just a little bit more risk. Kevin Pho: We’re talking to Amir Baluch. He’s an anesthesiologist. Today’s KevinMD article is “Leveraging Your Medical Career for Long-Term Wealth Building.” Amir, let’s end with some take-home messages that you want to leave with the KevinMD audience. Amir Baluch: You know, in anything you want to accomplish in life, if you work hard enough and you’re around the right people, you’re going to get it. So if being financially savvy or getting enough passive income so you can maybe just take one or two days off—not really retire early, because I think if you like your job, you should keep doing it—but, you know, you want to just find some mentors out there, read as much as you can, and hang around people who have been there, done that, that pretty much already are where you want to be. And if anybody wants any other resources, we’ll have a link for anybody watching where they can get a free copy of my book, Prosperity Prescription. It has a little bit of a blueprint on how to get that started. Or if somebody wants to book a quick 10-minute call with me—just like a clarity call, I call it—where in 10 minutes, we kind of find out what the next step would be for them. Those two options will be available somewhere on a link, either on my website or somewhere after this podcast. Kevin Pho: Amir, thank you so much for sharing your perspective and insight.

Samara Cohen, the firm's ETF and index instruments chief investment officer, thinks cryptocurrency deregulation will "absolutely" propel bitcoin to another historic year. "There will be progress made on… FIT21 ["Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.] There will be progress made on stable coins. There will be progress made just on definitions in taxonomy," she told CNBC's "ETF Edge" this week. Cohen is behind the firm's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) – which is up 114% since its January 2024 debut and up almost 8% year to date. It comes as bitcoin briefly traded above $100,000 this week. Despite the strong performance, she suggests cryptocurrency investors need an iron stomach. "Bitcoin is a risky asset. So, 15% in the context of Bitcoin is not an enormous move. Investors should expect volatility," said Cohen. "But in the long term, the price of bitcoin is really going to be determined by the level and pace of adoption." On Monday, BlackRock announced the official launch of its iShares Bitcoin ETF on CBOE Canada. And, it's not the only firm making an early year push deeper into cryptocurrency. Calamos Investments plans to launch its Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF next Wednesday – two days after Trump's inauguration. According to the press release, it's the "world's first 100% downside protected bitcoin ETF." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Research released by New York Digital Investment Group shows that in Q4 2024, Bitcoin broke away from major assets following the election of Donald Trump in November—but it could still move back in line with them. Bitcoin has often moved in line with U.S. equities—particularly tech stocks—as it is considered by many to be a “risk-on” asset. It has also typically done well in a low-interest rate environment. Bitcoin ETFs registered $16.5B of net inflows, but the lion’s share of flows is going to BlackRock and Fidelity while some ETFs registered outflows during the quarter. pic.twitter.com/Z1Kz1Z7GkW — NYDIG (@NYDIG) January 13, 2025 “With Bitcoin increasingly owned by traditional market investors, it’s natural to expect correlations to change,” the NYDIG report read, referring to the new Bitcoin ETFs trading on stock exchanges. “Still, the promise of a non-sovereign issued store of value is an appealing investment in the current geopolitical climate, one that should not be driven by the same macroeconomic levers of say the U.S. stock market,” it added. Bitcoin surged to new highs after President-elect Trump’s November 5 victory. The incoming leader campaigned on a promise to slash regulation and help the digital asset industry, and NYDIG credits Trump's win as the "main driver" for Bitcoin's surge. By December 17, the biggest digital coin had hit a new all-time of $108,135, CoinGecko data shows. It has since retreated and is now trading for $99,600. Earlier this week, it briefly dipped below the $90,000 mark before a resurgence back above $100,000. NYDIG added in its research that Bitcoin outperformed all asset classes by a wide margin in 2024, rising by more than 47% in the final quarter, and by nearly 120% from January to the end of the year. The biggest cryptocurrency has in the past moved both with the stock market and gold. Is it slowly becoming an asset class of its own?

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, an LA Native, Weighs In on Wildfire’s Impact on Insurance
URL: https://observer.com/2025/01/damage-la-wildfires-10-years-repair-blackrock-larry-fink/

The ongoing Los Angeles wildfires have destroyed or damaged some 12,000 structures, incinerated entire neighborhoods and wiped out businesses and landmarks alike. The extensive damage, which took place in less than ten days, could take up to ten years to repair, according to Larry Fink, CEO and chairman of BlackRock (BLK), which manages enormous assets for insurance companies affected by the natural disaster.

During the company’s third-quarter earnings call yesterday, Fink pointed to insurance as “one of the primary areas of growth for us.” The sheer amount of damage wrought by the Los Angeles fires will make homeowners insurance an increasingly pertinent topic in the U.S. going forward, Fink said. The devastating event is also a personal one for the BlackRock executive, who is a Los Angeles native. Hiking the Santa Monica Mountains, where one of the ongoing wildfires broke out, was “one of my pleasures of growing up, looking for snakes and reptiles as a kid, walking through the chaparral,” he said, recalling living in Los Angeles during the great Bel Air Fire of 1961. “We’ve always had fires in Los Angeles, but we’ve never seen destruction like this.” The ongoing wildfires have killed at least 25 people and brought unprecedented economic damage. Losses for the insurance industry could climb as high as $40 billion, according to analysts from Keefe Bruyette & Woods, while Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have estimated $30 billion in costs to insurers. These numbers surpass the $12.5 million in losses from California’s 2018 Camp Fire—the largest insured wildfire loss to date. The sheer amount of destroyed homes—many of which were in well-to-do neighborhoods like the Pacific Palisades or Altadena, which Zillow estimates have average home values of $3.5 million and $1.2 million respectively—will shine a spotlight on the role of homeowners insurance across America, according to Fink. In recent years and months, numerous insurance companies have withdrawn coverage from wildfire-prone areas in California. Los Angeles County, for example, has reportedly seen 531,000 homeowner policies canceled between 2020 and 2022. The pullback has forced many California residents to turn to the California FAIR plan, the state’s last-resort insurance program. The FAIR plan’s total exposure as of September was $448 billion—a 61 percent increase year-over-year and a 123 percent jump compared to 2020. Besides potentially spurring a redefinition of event risk throughout the U.S., the aftermath of the Los Angeles fires means homeowners insurance will become a key topic for governments going forward, Fink told CNBC. “This is going to be one of the bigger issues that we’re going to have to be tackling over the next four years.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Litecoin ETF Could Attract Up to $580M of Inflows If Adoption Mirrors That of Bitcoin ETFs
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/16/litecoin-etf-could-attract-up-to-usd580m-of-inflows-if-adoption-mirrors-that-of-bitcoin-etfs
Time Published: 2025-01-16T21:33:47Z
Full Content:
While a litecoin (LTC) exchange-traded fund is still only theoretical, investor demand for the product could soar as high as $580 million if Wall Street adopts it at the same rate it did LTC’s better-known cousin bitcoin. That calculation is based on the roughly 6% of bitcoin’s total supply now locked up in a variety of ETFs. Similar performance by a LTC product would yield more than $500 million of inflows for the token, which has a similar Proof of Work consensus mechanism to that of BTC. These possibilities came into focus Thursday as market participants began sizing up the likelihood that LTC might become the third crypto asset to get its own ETF in the U.S., after BTC and ETH. Canary Capital, a new digital asset-focused investment firm founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg, is best positioned to issue such a product. It got the ball rolling on a litecoin ETF in October. On Thursday, Nasdaq stock exchange filed a 19b-4 document with the Securities and Exchange Commission, officially putting the regulator on the clock to make a decision. Bloomberg’s Balchunas expects LTC to garner SEC approval given industry chatter he said he’s been hearing. Litecoin’s similar tech specs to bitcoin may also prove a factor, assuming their reliance on proof of work consensus mechanism spell better likelihood of being considered a commodity. The question is whether there is enough investor demand to make a litecoin fund a success or not. “Even if demand is comparatively low, it could still see some demand,” said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Just because the success won’t be as crazy as the bitcoin or even the ethereum ETFs doesn’t mean that it can’t be successful. The market and investors will make that determination.” The bitcoin ETFs set unprecedented records in their first year of trading, with the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Fund (IBIT) becoming the most successful launch in the history of U.S. ETF launches. “The key question here remains the uncertainty of investor demand for additional products and whether new crypto ETP launches will matter,” JPM analyst Kenneth B. Worthington wrote in a note on Monday. Worthington believes that tokens beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum or Solana oftentimes lack depth as they “may capture incremental attention for a limited time.” About 6% of bitcoin total market capitalization, which stands at a whopping $1.97 trillion, is locked up in the ETFs, according to a report by JPMorgan earlier this week. In comparison, the ethereum (ETH) ETFs comprise about 3% of ether’s $401 billion market cap. He used this so-called “adoption rate” to determine how much inflows the proposed XRP (XRP) and Solana (SOL) ETFs could attract which Worthington concluded could add up to a combined AUM of up to $14 billion. When applying this calculation to Litecoin, which stands at a $9.6 billion market cap, Canary Capital’s fund could attract anywhere between $290 to $580 million in the first year of trading, depending on how well investors will adopt the fund. While $290 million seems disappointing compared to the $108 billion that the spot bitcoin ETFs have gathered or the $12 billion that the ether ETFs currently hold, it is a larger amount than most ETFs in the U.S. handle. According to Seyffart, only about 1,330 out of roughly 4,000 ETFs in the U.S. have an AUM greater than $300 million.

Title: GFL Environmental’s (GFL) $6 Billion Stake Sale – Here’s Why Jim Cramer Thinks It’s a Smart Move

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Watching These 8 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GFL Environmental (NYSE:GFL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer is watching. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently highlighted a surge in merger activity, pointing out that we’ve seen a significant uptick in deals over the past few days. He explained that this wave of mergers and acquisitions aligns with what he’s been predicting, a shift in M&A activity due to the change in administration. Cramer noted that under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department’s antitrust division have been very strict on mergers, often taking an aggressive stance against any form of corporate consolidation. According to Cramer, companies had grown increasingly reluctant to pursue mergers under Biden’s regulatory approach, as they faced the uncertainty of lengthy court battles with little assurance of success. “And that’s why when Trump won in November, it became very obvious that we were looking at a deluge of M&A deals and these companies couldn’t even bring themselves to wait for inauguration day.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 12 Stocks in Focus This Week and 7 Consumer Goods and Retail Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar “Alright, so what do we make of this wave of deals? First, I gotta say, it’s just nice to see some mergers again and while this deluge was widely anticipated because of the change in administrations, it’s still good to see some confirmation.” Cramer said it made him more confident in predicting that M&A deals will continue to increase, which is one reason why he recently added Goldman Sachs stock to his Charitable Trust portfolio as it has a major M&A advisory business that had been relatively dormant under the previous administration. He urged investors to consider buying the stock, noting that it’s an excellent opportunity. More generally, Cramer expressed satisfaction in seeing so many companies once again pursuing mergers that make sense for their businesses. When examining the deals announced in early January, Cramer pointed out that while some of these deals might have faced challenges under Biden’s administration, most appear justifiable. “So the bottom line: Gotta tell you, I’m just glad we’re back to a place where reasonable arguments like this will be considered fairly by the antitrust regulators rather than the situation we had under Biden where every takeover is considered anti-competitive until proven otherwise. For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 8. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An excavator at a landfill site operating amidst a pile of solid waste. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32 Cramer mentioned GFL Environmental Inc.’s (NYSE:GFL) sale of its majority stake in its Environmental Services business. “Yesterday, a waste management company called GFL Environmental announced that it’s selling the majority of its environmental services business to a pair of private equity firms for over $6 billion… Looking at the transactions we’ve seen just this week, while some of them likely would’ve been challenged by Biden’s ideologically driven regulators, most of them seem pretty justifiable. All of them make great business sense.” GFL Environmental (NYSE:GFL) provides non-hazardous solid waste management and environmental services in Canada and the United States, including collection, transportation, recycling, disposal, liquid waste management, and soil remediation. Recently, it announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Environmental Services business for an enterprise value of $8.0 billion. As part of the deal, the company will retain a $1.7 billion equity interest in the business and expects to receive approximately $6.2 billion in cash proceeds after accounting for the retained equity and taxes. As per Reuters, the transaction follows months of pressure from activist group ADW Capital Management, which had urged GFL to divest its environmental solutions business and focus solely on waste management. The company plans to use up to $3.75 billion of the net proceeds from the deal to reduce debt, with up to $2.25 billion allocated for share repurchases. Following the debt repayment, it expects its net leverage to stand at 3.0x. CEO Patrick Dovigi stated that the transaction will significantly strengthen the company’s balance sheet, moving it closer to achieving an investment-grade credit rating. Additionally, GFL Environmental (NYSE:GFL) has the option to repurchase the Environmental Services business within five years of the deal’s expected close in the first quarter of 2025, which will also lead to a reduction in its cash interest expenses by approximately C$200 million. Overall, GFL ranks 6th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer is watching. While we acknowledge the potential of GFL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GFL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Trump will keep TikTok from ‘going dark’, adviser says

TikTok is planning to shut its app in the US on Sunday when a ban kicks in. United States President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security adviser has said the new administration will keep TikTok alive in the US if there is a viable deal. “We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,” US Representative Mike Waltz told Fox News on Thursday. He noted that the law gives authority for a 90-day extension for the app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to complete a divestiture. This is the case, said Waltz, “as long as a viable deal is on the table. Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going.” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor on Thursday that TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, should be given more time to find a buyer. “It’s clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans,” Schumer said, adding that Senate Democrats tried to pass a bill to extend the deadline to come up with a solution. “I will work with the Trump administration and with both parties to keep TikTok alive while protecting our national security.” TikTok is used by more than 170 million Americans monthly. The New York Times reported on Thursday that Trump is considering an executive order that would seek to allow TikTok to continue operating despite a pending legal ban until new owners are found. It was not immediately clear if Trump has the authority to do so given the legal divestiture requirements imposed by Congress. A group of US lawmakers is also pushing for a 270-day extension as well, warning that a ban could hurt Americans who make a living from using TikTok. TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Trump transition, Karoline Leavitt, said, “President Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to save TikTok, and there’s no better dealmaker than Donald Trump.” Reuters has previously reported that TikTok plans to shut US operations of its social media app on Sunday, when a federal ban is set to take effect, barring a last-minute reprieve, according to people familiar with the matter. A White House official told Reuters on Wednesday that outgoing President Joe Biden has no plans to intervene to block a ban in his final days in office if the US Supreme Court fails to act. The official added that Biden is legally unable to intervene absent a credible plan from ByteDance to divest TikTok. The law signed in April mandates a ban on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores if ByteDance fails to divest the site. Users who have downloaded TikTok would theoretically still be able to use the app, but the law also bars US companies from providing services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of it once any ban begins. The president can issue a one-time, 90-day delay to the ban if he certifies to Congress that there has been evidence of significant progress and there are binding legal agreements in place to allow a complete divestiture in three months. Separately, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the US presidential inauguration on January 20 and sit among high-profile guests invited by Trump, a source told Reuters. Representative Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, criticised the decision to invite Chew on social media platform X. “Trump talks a big game on China & wanted to ban TikTok—just like many Republicans voted to do,” Pallone said. “But now he’s inviting TikTok’s CEO to sit beside him at his inauguration even though TikTok is linked to the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] & is a threat to our national security. What message does this send?” The US Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday, overturn the law, or pause the law to give the court more time to make a decision. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 percent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 percent each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the US. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is advancing 5% after the huge, Taiwan-based chip manufacturer reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results today. A Look at TSM's Q4 Results and Statements The company's Q4 sales jumped 37% versus the same period a year earlier to $26.88 billion. That was $890 million above analysts' average estimate. Further, TSM's earnings per share rose to $2.24, compared with $1.44 in Q4 of 2023. Analysts, on average, had expected the firm's Q4 EPS to come in at $2.23. "With our strong technology leadership and differentiation, we are well-positioned to capture the multiyear structured demand from the industry megatrends of 5G, AI, and" high-performance computing (HPC)," CFO Wendell Huang asserted on the company's Q4 earnings call. HPC accounted for 53% of its Q4 revenue, versus 43% in Q4 of 2023. For Q1, the chip maker provided revenue guidance of $25.0 billion to $25.8 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected the company's sales to come in at $24.75 billion. “Moving into first quarter 2025, we expect our business to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand.” Huang said in a statement.

Title: Italy's Largest Bank Takes First Step into Bitcoin with $1 Million Purchase

More Info Italy’s biggest bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, has made history by becoming the first Italian financial institution to buy 11 bitcoins for a "test" purchase worth $1 million. Initially a widespread rumor, Bloomberg has confirmed that Italy’s largest banking giant has indeed dipped its toes in Bitcoin. According to an internal memo, the financial institution completed its first proprietary Bitcoin trade, investing the funds into the world’s largest digital currency. “It’s very small amounts, considering we have 100 billion euros in our securities portfolio,” Intesa CEO Carlo Messina told reporters on the sidelines of an event in Milan on Tuesday. “It’s an experiment, a test.” Intesa set up a proprietary trading desk for digital assets in 2023 and started handling spot trades with cryptos last year. The news first surfaced when the bank’s employees leaked an internal email on the image-sharing platform 4Chan. Following the leak, Niccolo Bardoscia, Intesa Sanpaolo’s head of digital assets trading and investment, officially confirmed the acquisition in an email to the media, revealing that the bank now holds 11 BTC. While Bardoscia confirmed the purchase, the executive did not reveal exactly why the bank had acquired BTC. Therefore, it is still unclear if the purchase was to diversify Intesa Sanpaolo’s investment portfolio or if it was a pilot to offer crypto services, according to CryptoRank. The acquisition is not the bank’s first foray into blockchain. In July last year, Intesa Sanpaolo pioneered a $25.7 million digital bond issuance on the Polygon network in collaboration with state-owned bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA. In addition, Intesa Sanpaolo broadened its crypto desk to allow spot trading. Before then, it only offered clients crypto options, futures, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Intesa Sanpaolo’s purchase came as Europe eased regulations. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory guideline came into full effect in December, a milestone that’s expected to pave the way for more digital-asset adoption among financial companies. While Intesa is currently only prop trading — buying and selling using its own balance sheet rather than on behalf of clients — the crypto desk’s activities fit with the bank’s broader blockchain projects, and it may be a stepping stone for eventually trading digital assets for institutional customers. “We won’t become a Bitcoin provider but we need to know how to do so if our bigger clients ask us to,” Messina told reporters on Tuesday. Intesa carried out the Bitcoin purchase through Boerse Stuttgart Digital’s institutional trading platform, a spokesperson from the German exchange group said in a statement. After rallying in the wake of Donald Trump’s US election win in early November, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have had a shaky start to the year, hurt by concerns that persistent inflation will curtail the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy easing. Bitcoin briefly slid below $90,000 on Monday — a drop of almost 5% from the start of 2025 — before a rebound that left it slightly up for January. The largest cryptocurrency soared to a record high of $108,316 last month. This BTC acquisition signals a shift in sentiment within Italy. As the country’s largest bank leads the way, other financial institutions may follow suit, potentially accelerating adoption. The move stands out in Italy, where the central bank governor, Fabio Panetta, has consistently cautioned against digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, describing them as “unsecured.” That said, the bank has a long way to go to catch up with its US peers: BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has amassed $51 billion in assets in the spot Bitcoin ETF it launched a year ago, and is pushing to have its money-market digital coin more widely used as collateral for crypto derivatives trades. JPMorgan is preparing to offer instant settlement for foreign-exchange conversions between the dollar and the euro through its blockchain platform. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s value continues to surge, with optimism growing about easing regulatory hurdles under incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. Some analysts expect it to more than double in value by the end of this year.

Title: Is Applied Materials (AMAT) the Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. The NASDAQ, heavily comprised of technology stocks, has been on a consistent upward trajectory for some years. In 2023, it experienced remarkable growth, marking its best performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. In 2024, the index continued to surpass market expectations with a 28.64% gain. This impressive performance is largely driven by the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has significantly boosted major tech stocks and the broader market throughout 2023 and into this year. Analysts suggest that the NASDAQ could be the index of the future, as its companies have shown a strong ability to adapt to evolving market trends. NASDAQ’s consistent outperformance can be observed over several years. According to a report by Invesco, since January 1, 2008, the Nasdaq-100 Index has delivered a cumulative total return of 750%, significantly outpacing the broader market’s 315% return. This success is largely attributed to the innovation driven by tech companies, which continues to attract investors. For instance, the technology sector in the broader market has achieved an annualized total return of 20.65% over the past decade, compared to 12.80% for the market. This leadership is understandable given the rapid adoption of technology in recent years. The Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) noted that the Nasdaq-100 has approximately 55% exposure to the tech sector, in contrast to about 32% for the broader market. READ ALSO: 12 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield and Warren Buffett’s 10 Cheap Stock Picks Tech companies are not only driving innovation but are also swiftly adjusting their dividend strategies. In 2024, many prominent tech firms began issuing dividends, significantly boosting the overall dividend pool. Although dividends are traditionally linked with value stocks rather than the high-growth companies fueling the AI surge, analysts suggest this shift broadens the appeal of these stocks to new investor groups while putting surplus cash to use. Typically, growth-focused companies prioritize reinvestment over returning earnings to shareholders. However, experts like Ted Mortonson from Baird argue that these dividend payments won’t undermine the companies’ future dominance. Here are some other comments from the analyst: “I don’t view it as a problem. I view it as they’ve won. They’ve won the technology side. They’ve won on the business-model side, and they’re going to win on the Gen AI cycle.” Overall dividends are becoming increasingly popular among investors, with many US companies either raising or maintaining their payouts. Howard Silverblatt, a Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, suggested that with an anticipated reduction in interest rates by the FOMC in 2025, coupled with record earnings forecasted for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the entire year of 2025, companies might allocate more funds towards substantial dividend hikes in the upcoming year. He further mentioned that February, traditionally the peak month for dividend increases, is expected to see even more significant growth as some firms may look to compensate for previous conservative strategies. In 2024, the large-cap companies in the broader market outperformed many others, achieving record levels in earnings, sales, and dividends. For 2025, a projected 8% rise in dividend payments is expected, up from a 6.4% increase in 2024. For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders. From that list, we picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment toward them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician in a clean room assembling a semiconductor chip using a microscope. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a global leader in semiconductor equipment manufacturing, supplying critical tools for creating advanced chips used in AI, data centers, automotive technology, and other sectors. The global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market is projected to more than double by 2032, with Applied Materials likely to be a major beneficiary of this growth. Beyond just selling its equipment, the company has seen a significant boost in revenue from its equipment servicing segment. As manufacturing equipment becomes more complex and specialized, the demand for expert maintenance continues to rise, contributing to this fast-growing part of the business. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 16%. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) reported revenue of $7.05 billion, which showed a 5% growth from the same period last year. The company’s net income for the quarter came in at $1.73 billion. Its diverse range of products and services strategically positions the company to support its customers in advancing AI and energy-efficient computing. As these critical areas of semiconductor innovation gain prominence, the industry’s progress increasingly relies on materials engineering, a field where Applied Materials holds a leading position. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) also showed a strong cash position in FY24. The company reported an operating cash flow of $8.68 billion during the year. Its free cash flow amounted to $7.5 billion. Moreover, the company returned approximately $5.01 billion to shareholders, including $1.19 billion in dividends. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for seven consecutive years. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.89%, as of January 15. Vltava Fund highlighted Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its recently published Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “In the quarter just ended, we added to the portfolio two new companies from the technology sector: Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research. Both are in the same industry as is another of our investments that we have held for some time, KLA Corporation. This industry is termed semiconductor devices and materials. One chapter in Hidden Investment Treasures is devoted to investing in technology companies and, among other things, the controversy over what really constitutes a technology company. As investors, we try to view technology companies not according to the industry into which they are formally classified but by whether the technologies and technological processes used in the production of their products and services are an essential element in value creation or if they are a source of long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Among the companies that are formally categorized as technology-based and fall into either the Information Technology or the Communications Services sector, we find some that can be said to be just that but also others for which this classification is at least debatable. Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it. In the cases of Applied Materials and Lam Research, there can be no doubt that these are technology companies not only as a formality but also in fact. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 74 funds held stakes in Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), compared with 77 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4.6 billion. Overall, AMAT ranks 6th on our list of best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for AMAT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How Hola Prime Is Changing The Future Of Prop Trading

Time Published: 2025-01-16T17:39:08Z

For decades, proprietary trading firms have been cloaked in opacity, leaving traders in the dark about critical processes like pricing, risk management, and payouts. Hola Prime is challenging the status quo. With users across 175+ countries and a suite of innovative features, the firm is redefining the future of prop trading by prioritizing transparency and creating an ecosystem tailored to the needs of modern traders. In prop trading, traders can showcase their skills without risking their own capital. They begin by participating in a firm’s challenge, trading in a demo environment to meet profit targets while staying within risk limits. Once they succeed, traders gain access to a “Funded Account,” where they trade with the firm’s capital and share the profits. Traders just pay a small fee, while the prop firm provides the platform. The firm’s business model revolves around identifying disciplined traders and mirroring their trades. By scaling up the trade volume, the firm can double the potential profit, benefiting both the trader and the firm. Hola Prime is transforming the prop trading industry by creating a transparent and trader-focused ecosystem that sets new benchmarks in the prop trading industry. Leading Hola Prime is Mr. Somesh Kapuria, the firm’s Managing Director and CEO, whose extensive experience in Forex and securities spans decades. A former senior executive at Citibank, New York, and Blackrock, Mr. Kapuria consistently drove revenue growth and spearheaded innovations widely adopted by Wall Street asset managers. “When we launched Hola Prime, it wasn’t about starting just another prop trading firm,” Mr. Kapuria shares. “It was about giving traders a fair shot, free from hidden costs and confusing practices. We’re not just fixing problems; we’re reshaping the future of trading. When traders win fairly, we win too.” Prop trading is not a regulated industry, as of today. But Hola Prime has taken a proactive approach by establishing a dedicated Risk and Compliance Department. This is unheard of in the industry. The purpose of this Department is to ensure that the internal policies at Hola Prime are as robust as they can be, and are always complied with. This Department ensures that there are Daily Accounts Reconciliations, payouts are always accurate and available for processing, and there are always additional funds available for cushion. It also ensures strong KYC and AML implementation, seamless Order flow management into live markets, along with effective management of the firm's market risk, at all times. This approach helps in building a sustainable business with a solid foundation, and builds deep trust with the customers. Prop trading has historically faced criticism for its lack of clarity, especially in pricing and execution. Traders often question whether they’re being treated fairly, but finding answers has been difficult. This absence of transparency erodes trust and causes trust deficit. Recognizing this gap, Hola Prime stepped up with an innovative solution - the Price Transparency Report. By providing traders with tick-by-tick data compared against market benchmarks, Hola Prime empowers them to verify the integrity of pricing and execution. “We are proud to be the first and the only prop firm to publish a Price Transparency Report,” says Mr. Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Risk and Compliance at Hola Prime. “This report is just as crucial for us as it is for our traders, as it guarantees that our liquidity providers offer prices that are in line with the market, fostering accountability at every level,” he adds. “We share this report with all active traders, and we’re proud to report a 99.63% match rate between our data and leading market benchmarks,” Mr. Ashutosh continued. “With over 10 million price ticks analyzed every month, we ensure that our pricing accuracy and transparency remains unmatched in the industry.” Unlike many competitors, Hola Prime was designed by traders who have experienced the pain points of traditional prop trading firsthand. This insider perspective has enabled the firm to create solutions that directly address these challenges - from delayed payouts to insufficient risk management tools. Mr. Somesh Kapuria, Managing Director and CEO, Hola Prime “Our mission is simple - to eliminate uncertainty for traders and empower them to focus on strategy and execution,” says Mr Somesh Kapuria. “Every feature we’ve developed is rooted in feedback from our global trading community” he adds. Payout delays have long been a sore spot for prop traders. Hola Prime tackles this head-on with its industry-leading 1-hour payout system, with over 99% success rate. For traders, this means no more waiting days to access their hard-earned profits. “We follow a 10-point payout system and complete our calculations at the end of each day to ensure payouts are ready promptly,” says Ms. Sumedha, CFO at Hola Prime. “Our average payout time is just 45 minutes. Our partnerships with PSPs, including Paypal, Rise and some crypto PSPs, are integral. These PSPs offer fast and reliable transfers, enabling quick multi-currency and multi-network payments for traders who prefer crypto withdrawals" she adds. Furthermore, Ms Sumedha reveals, “Hola Prime has launched Hola Prime Visa Cards, now available as a standard payout withdrawal method for all traders. The cards provide effortless access to earnings, allowing traders to make online purchases, shop in-store, and withdraw cash from ATMs. This innovative payout method is designed to provide a smooth and hassle-free experience for all Hola Prime traders.” Hola Prime is committed to providing traders with the tools they need to succeed in a competitive market. The firm offers funding options of up to $300K, with the potential to scale accounts to $4 million, ensuring traders have access to the capital they need to execute their strategies effectively. The firm emphasizes a lot on education and continuous improvement. Through extensive training resources and expert guidance, Hola Prime equips traders with the knowledge and skills to refine their strategies and make informed decisions. Hola Prime’s innovative features extend beyond technology. The firm has introduced a 95% reward structure and a 200% fee reimbursement policy, designed to reduce financial risks and foster a supportive trading environment. “Our focus is on creating a safer and more reliable trading environment,” says Mr. Kapuria. “By integrating advanced risk management measures and leveraging technology, we aim to support traders in their journey of growth and success.” The prop trading industry has long operated in a cloud of ambiguity, leaving many traders uncertain about fairness and reliability. Hola Prime is addressing these challenges head-on, redefining the industry with its emphasis on transparency, efficiency, and trader empowerment. With a clear and equitable framework, Hola Prime offers traders access to industry-leading platforms, innovative tools, and unparalleled support systems, in addition to 24/7 Live Human Customer Support. By prioritizing fairness and innovation, the firm is setting many new standards for prop trading — that benefit traders and the industry as a whole. Hola Prime’s transformative approach to prop trading is paving the way for a more transparent and equitable future. By combining cutting-edge technology, proactive risk management, and a commitment to trader success, the firm is empowering traders to thrive in an ever-evolving market.

Title: Trump will keep TikTok from ‘going dark’ if deal is on table, adviser says

President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security adviser said Thursday the new administration will keep TikTok alive in the US if there is a viable deal. “We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,” Rep. Mike Waltz told Fox News, noting the law gives authority for a 90-day extension for the app’s Chinese owner ByteDance to complete a divestiture “as long as a viable deal is on the table. Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going.” TikTok is used by more than 170 million Americans monthly. The New York Times reported on Thursday that Trump is considering an executive order that would seek to allow TikTok to continue operating despite a pending legal ban until new owners are found. It was not immediately clear if Trump has the authority to do so given the legal divestiture requirements imposed by Congress. A group of lawmakers is also pushing for a 270-day extension as well, warning that a ban could hurt Americans who make a living from using TikTok. TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Trump transition, Karoline Leavitt, said “President Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to save TikTok, and there’s no better deal maker than Donald Trump.” Reuters reported TikTok plans to shut US operations of its social media app used by 170 million Americans on Sunday, when a federal ban is set to take effect, barring a last-minute reprieve, according to people familiar with the matter. A White House official told Reuters on Wednesday that President Biden has no plans to intervene to block a ban in his final days in office if the US Supreme Court fails to act. The official added that Biden is legally unable to intervene absent a credible plan from ByteDance to divest TikTok. The law signed in April mandates a ban on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores if Chinese parent ByteDance fails to divest the site. Users who have downloaded TikTok would theoretically still be able to use the app, but the law also bars US companies from providing services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating itonce any ban begins. The president can issue a one-time, 90-day delay to the ban if he certifies to Congress there has been evidence of significant progress and there are binding legal agreements in place to allow a complete divestiture in three months. Separately, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will attend the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 and sit among high-profile guests invited by Trump. Chew is set to be in Washington on Monday, a source told Reuters. Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, criticized the decision to invite Chew on social media platform X. “Trump talks a big game on China & wanted to ban TikTok—just like many Republicans voted to do,” Pallone said. “But now he’s inviting TikTok’s CEO to sit beside him at his inauguration even though TikTok is linked to the CCP & is a threat to our national security. What message does this send?” The US Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday, overturn the law, or pause the law to give the court more time to make a decision. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the US. Advertisement

By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -TikTok's fortunes took a positive turn on Thursday as a growing number of U.S. officials said its Chinese owner should have more time to sell the app and stop it from being banned ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House. Trump's incoming national security adviser said the new Republican administration will keep the social media app used by 170 million Americans alive in the U.S. if there is a viable deal and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer urged President Joe Biden to extend by 90 days a deadline to shut it down on Sunday. A law passed in April mandates TikTok's owner, ByteDance, divest TikTok's U.S. assets by Sunday to a non-Chinese buyer, or be banned on national security concerns. "We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark," U.S. Representative Mike Waltz told Fox News, pointing to a provision in the law allowing for a 90-day extension if there is "significant progress" toward a divestiture. "Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going," said Waltz, who was picked by Trump to be his national security adviser. A White House official said on Thursday the Biden administration does not plan to enforce the ban on Sunday leaving it up to the Trump administration, though it is not clear if the app will remain online absent a formal extension. "Given the timing of when it goes into effect over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement," the official said. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday absent a divestiture, overturn the law or pause it to give the justices more time to make a decision. The court said it may issue rulings on Friday, but as is customary, did not state which case or cases would be decided. Trump once supported a ban on the app but changed his stance last year. His shift came amid growing signs of support for his presidential campaign among tech executives and overtures from Republican donor Jeff Yass, who owns a big share of ByteDance. In a sign of warming ties between Trump and TikTok, the video app's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, will attend the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 and be seated on the dais among other high-profile invitees, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. BIPARTISAN SHIFT "It's clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans,” Schumer said on the Senate floor, adding that Democrats tried to pass a bill extending the deadline to find a solution to 270 days. "I will work with the Trump administration and with both parties to keep TikTok alive while protecting our national security," he added. The comments by Schumer, who was a strong supporter of the law to force a sale, are a sign of the growing concern among prominent Democrats about the potential impact and political fallout of shutting down TikTok. The New York Times (NYSE:NYT) reported Trump is considering an executive order that would seek to allow TikTok to continue operating despite a pending legal ban until new owners are found. It was not immediately clear if Trump has the authority to do so given the legal divestiture requirements imposed by Congress. TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Trump transition, Karoline Leavitt, said, "President Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to save TikTok, and there's no better deal maker than Donald Trump." 'TALKS A BIG GAME' Still, several Republicans and Democrats remain concerned about Chinese ownership of the app, worried the Chinese government could use it as a tool to collect data on U.S. citizens and to spread propaganda to the public. "Trump talks a big game on China & wanted to ban TikTok - just like many Republicans voted to do," Representative Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, wrote on the social media platform X. "But now he's inviting TikTok's CEO to sit beside him at his inauguration even though TikTok is linked to the CCP & is a threat to our national security. What message does this send?" The prospect of a TikTok ban has already triggered some users to seek alternatives, with Chinese social media app RedNote gaining nearly 3 million U.S. users in one day earlier this week, according to analytics firm Similarweb (NYSE:SMWB). Reuters reported that TikTok plans to shut U.S. operations of its social media app on Sunday barring a last-minute reprieve, according to people familiar with the matter. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States.

US stock indexes were slightly lower on Thursday after posting strong gains on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid around 75 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite gave up early gains to edge lower shortly before 10:00 a.m. ET. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday: The mixed performance comes after the indexes posted sharp gains on Wednesday, with the Dow up over 700 points to mark the best trading day since a euphoric post-election rally in November. Stocks benefited from encouraging inflation data and strong earnings beats from big financial firms including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and BlackRock. Results from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley rounded out strong big bank results before Thursday's opening bell, both reporting that profits more than doubled last quarter. Meanwhile, fresh data showed retail sales climbed 0.4% in December, coming in slightly below consensus forecasts of a 0.5% increase. In Europe, indexes traded higher as luxury stocks finally got some relief, posting strong gains after Cartier's owner Richemont announced a quarterly sales record. Luxury stocks had largely struggled in 2024 amid weak consumer demand in China, with companies like Kering posting a 40% decline. Here's what else is happening: Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Worried old husband hugging anxious wife How are we feeling about the stock market, my fellow contrarian? More importantly, should we have an opinion on the market-at-large at all? I don’t think so. Trump 2.0 will create a “market barbell” of big winners and sad losers. Let’s focus on the dividend payers that will be propelled higher—and step over the laggards. There are some dandy dividends ready to dart higher. Today they sit in the bargain bin thanks to investor reservations about the Federal Reserve. When Chairman Jay Powell took the stage in December, he delivered a sober discourse to investors: Don’t expect as many rate cuts as you were hoping for. The lecture was not well received and seriously scared the herd. Fear is prevalent, per CNN’s Fear and Greed Index (FGI): Fear Greed Index Here at Contrarian Outlook we tend to fade the FGI. When emotions are running scared, we buy the bargains from the weak hands. They always have a reason for selling low. Granted, the narrative usually crumbles in the rearview mirror with the passage of time. But the vanilla financial websites must publish some reason that stocks are down today. These days, it’s the hawkish Fed. But is this really bad news? The 10-year Treasury yield has been (paradoxically) rising with each Fed rate cut. That’s not supposed to happen. This is the bond market screaming at Jay that there is no need for these cuts. The economy is fine. It absorbed the rate hikes, and we have seen neither a hard nor safe landing. In fact, we have seen no economic landing at all! Last Friday’s strong jobs report showed this. The unemployment rate fell once again to 4.1%. Remember the August pullback, when pundits and Fed officials alike were sure that we were heading into a recession? It triggered the “Taylor Rule”—a formula that is supposed to predict a recession. Last summer the Fed members seemed to hold the Taylor Rule as Gospel. The Taylor Rule is newer than the Gospel, however. It has been around since… 1992. That surprised me too, as it’s spoken of as if handed down in biblical times. I’m in favor of most trend comebacks from the 90s, but the Taylor rule should have stayed behind. So, the economy is humming, and the Fed finally admits it. Short-term rates will stay “higher for longer.” If this helps “contain” the 10-year yield below 5%, then I’m all for it. Higher short-term rates should contain the economy from overheating. (The path of constant rate cuts combined with “no landing” was not going to do it.) Which brings us to President-Elect Trump, who takes office in five days. The most Dow-friendly president in recent history takes office with a healthy dose of fear in the markets. It is tempting to buy the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average and be done with it—but we can do better. I’ve been running the numbers on how certain stocks performed during Trump 1.0 for clues how investing history may “rhyme” for the next four years. There are a few surprises not appreciated by the mainstream narrative. First, conventional wisdom says to dump healthcare stocks. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be running the Department of Health and Human Services. Sell ‘em all, right? Wrong! The top five holdings of this discounted 14%-paying dividend fund returned 126%, 141%, 179%, 227% and over 1,000% during Trump’s first administration, benefiting from lower regulation and a strong economy: BMEZ Holdings Yet the BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (BMEZ) fund sits at an 11% discount to its net asset value (NAV) on fears that RFK Jr. will obliterate the entire sector. Let’s take a deep breath. RFK does not determine what the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) does, which traditionally operates on its own independent of politics. Plus we have sector blue chips like UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) who are likely to roll along merrily as they did in Trump’s first term. UNH and ABT sailed 135% and 199%. Their businesses were good then, and they remain good now! UNH/ABT Total Returns What about energy? Crude oil rallied last Friday on the latest round of US sanctions against Russia. Is reduced supply coupled with a strong economy bullish for energy, or does Trump’s “drill baby, drill” mantra ultimately put a lid on prices? I’ve heard from careful readers concerned that Trump “drilled so much in the first term, he tanked oil.” It’s true that energy prices trended down all four Trump years, but the bear market in oil started in 2014—two years before 1.0—triggered by the US shale oil supply boom that began years prior. So, by the time Trump was inaugurated in 2017, these trends were already in motion. So I would not draw many conclusions from these two ugly charts, which feature two of our favorite dividend growers in the energy patch, EOG Resources (EOG) and EQT Corp (EQT): EOG/EQT Total Returns We must deal with government contractors on a case-by-case basis. The new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is looking to eliminate $500 billion in spending. This is a potential headwind for federal-powered gravy trains. It’s possible we see a “peace dividend” as well. Trump may cut a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine or with China to ease tensions in the Pacific. Given these headwinds contractors are now generally in “stay away” territory. One exception I am making is for General Dynamics (GD), which is a backdoor play on AI automation at the federal government level. GD flatlined during Trump 1.0 but we have higher expectations this time around given the AI angle. AI plays a central role in General Dynamic’s IT strategy. It has deployed a Luna AI system that uses machine learning to draw insights from large reams of data. Luna is designed specifically for government and defense applications. The “Luna lift” is evident in GD’s new orders and total sales backlog. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: How blowout bank earnings and a promising inflation report gave the market a much-needed boost

Time Published: 2025-01-16T14:14:52Z

Hello there! A product going viral can be a double-edged sword for retailers. Just ask Walmart. The big-box store's e-commerce marketplace got a boost from an imitation Hermès' Birkin bag making the rounds, but dupes also cause headaches for brand relationships. In today's big story, US banks' impressive earnings and a hopeful inflation report have stocks back on the rise. What's on deck Markets: Anthony Scaramucci offers some economic predictions for Trump's second term. Tech: The VC world is starting to heal as Insight Partners raises a massive new fund. Business: Billionaires are booked and busy next week thanks to a scheduling conflict between the inauguration and Davos. But first, we're so back. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's alive! After a slow start to the year, the stock market finally showed signs of life thanks to blowout bank earnings and better-than-expected inflation data. The S&P 500 finished Wednesday up 1.83%, while the Dow (1.65%) and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite (2.45%) posted strong days. Let's start with Wall Street. Big US banks represent the unofficial kickoff to earnings season, and they didn't disappoint. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all beat analysts expectations. JPMorgan saw a 50% year-over-year increase in profits for the fourth quarter while Goldman's profits jumped an incredible 105%. The banking boom was largely driven by classic Wall Street businesses like corporate dealmaking, capital raising, and trading. December's inflation report also put extra wind in the market's sails. At first glance — inflation rose for the third straight month — the reading might not seem great. But a closer look showed the consumer price index's year-over-year increase matched consensus expectations, which is good. What's even better, though, is core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was slightly below expectations. It also came in lower than November's number. Before you get ahead of yourself, don't expect a slew of rate cuts. Instead, the data calmed investors' nerves by slowing the troubling rise of the 10-year Treasury yield, which dropped 0.14%. "Core Inflation isn't accelerating and that's the story. The market may have had its hair on fire about inflation running away again, but the data do not support that conclusion," said Jamie Cox, Managing Partner for Harris Financial Group. So what's next for Wall Street? In the short term, bankers might finally enjoy some healthy bonuses after a few slim years. Workers are starting to find out about their year-end comp. Bigger picture, it's more momentum for the industry's job market. After a lull in activity, firms are bolstering their ranks across the board for what appears to be an active 2025. The private markets are one area that'll remain in the spotlight. The sector, which includes less-liquid investments like private equity and private credit that come with higher fees, is of particular interest to BlackRock. The $11.6 trillion asset manager sees it as the key to its next stage of evolution, according to CEO Larry Fink. One evolution Fink didn't discuss was who will take over when he's gone. That's despite the recent departure of executive Mark Wiedman, which reignited questions about what life after Larry will look like at BlackRock. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was a little bit more forthcoming with his own retirement plans … sort of. When asked by an analyst who his successor was, Dimon said there are a number of great candidates, but a decision hasn't been made. And even if the bank did have someone in mind, there's no guarantee things won't change, Dimon added. 1. One of Trump's opps is feeling good about the economy. Despite being a longtime Trump critic, Anthony Scaramucci is pretty optimistic about the economy under the incoming 47th president. He sees Trump's pro-growth policies and potential crypto legislation as an economic boon — but he's still concerned about some of Trump's other promises. 2. Hindenburg Research is tapping out. Nate Anderson, founder of the short-selling firm, said he's disbanding it, once they've completed all outstanding projects. Hindenburg gained fame for its forensic financial research, often focusing on what it argued to be fraudulent or misleading corporate behavior. Anderson said he plans to share the firm's investigation tactics publicly. 3. Dividend stocks are so back. Large-cap stocks have dominated the market, but a change could be coming, according to Morningstar. As their valuations continue to climb, dividend stocks might become more palatable. Morningstar highlighted dividend stocks in four specific sectors savvy investors should pay attention to. 1. Mark Zuckerberg lost $60 billion in five years — and he's going to keep spending. Despite persistent predictions that the VR and AR headset market will boom, consumers just aren't interested. Meta lost big on the tech in the last few years, but that hasn't deterred Zuck, who keeps telling investors they should expect more losses in the future. 2. Exclusive: Insight Partners raises $12.5 billion for its newest set of funds. It's the largest sum raised by a venture capital firm in over two years, according to PitchBook data. Insight's $12.5 billion may be less than its initial funding goal, but it's still an impressive get as the industry looks to mount a comeback. 3. "TikTok refugees" flock to Chinese app RedNote. While some Americans are coping with a possible TikTok ban through memes, competitors like Texas-based app Clapper are seizing the moment. Other Americans are heading to the Chinese app Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote. It might be worth learning how to use it — but some members of Congress are already taking aim. 1. WFH + Fridays = OOO. For some remote workers, the W in WFH Friday is a bit of a stretch. They're turning every weekend into a three-day weekend, and they don't feel particularly bad about it, either. 2. Home Depot cofounders were investigated by the FBI in the '70s and '80s, new public records show. The FBI was investigating Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank over claims they used a slush fund in an attempt to bribe California Handy Dan employees to decertify their union, newly obtained records show. The investigation ended in 1983 when a prosecutor determined the case was too old and evidence was "insufficient." 3. Double-booked billionaires. January 20 is not only Trump's inauguration but also the first day of the World Economic Forum's high-profile conference in Davos, Switzerland. Conflicted guests will have to choose between missing potential face time with the new president or a day of brushing shoulders with the global elite. Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi won't be missing out on Trump's big day. Boeing's dismal 2024 deliveries show just how much of a challenge CEO Kelly Ortberg faces. UnitedHealth Group, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley report earnings.

Title: No Country For Young Fintechs: The U.K.’s Debanking Of Crypto Blockchain And Web3

Access denied rubber stamp. A survey of U.K. fintech and crypto firms found that 50 percent of the firms surveyed have been rejected from opening a bank account or had an account closed by a major U.K. bank. Only 14 percent managed to successfully apply for a bank account with one of "the CMA 9” - the nine biggest mainstream banks in the U.K. - without it being closed at a later date. These figures will shock policymakers following a decade of promoting the U.K. ecosystem as the global home of fintech and crypto, as well as the new Labour Government, with its stated intention of supporting innovation and digitization. The lack of access to this basic universal service has meant that firms from across the fintech, crypto, blockchain, and Web3 ecosystems have faced challenges in innovating and scaling, limiting their capacity to introduce new products and services while remaining competitive on a global scale. Katie Harries, who leads Stand With Crypto’s U.K. initiative commented, “The growing difficulties firms face is a huge barrier to growth. It’s not an issue reserved for start and scale-ups but also one medium and large companies face too. We are hugely supportive of Labour’s ambitious growth and investment plans but we currently have a situation where some of the U.K.’s most innovative companies are effectively being deprived of access to basic banking services – hampering these objectives.” The survey, conducted by the Startup Coalition , the U.K. Cryptoasset Business Council (UKCBC), and Global Digital Finance (GDF) found that 81 percent of respondents were legally based in the U.K. with 98 percent having activities in the U.K. “These challenges pose a significant threat to the U.K. Government's ambition to lead the global race in digital assets, as highlighted by the City Minister in a recent speech. Without meaningful action and progress in tackling barriers such as this, this vision will fall short,” commented Simon Jennings, executive director of the UKCBC. On the debanking crisis, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stated in their report in September last year, “given the limitations of the data, [they] had not been able to draw detailed conclusions on the types of personal or business customers affected by suspensions, terminations and declines.” One firm surveyed and rejected by HSBC indicated on their survey response that they were “[rejected because of our] business profile (despite that we are an FCA Regulated firm).” The survey found 81 percent of firms agreed that difficulties accessing banking services are a significant barrier to their company succeeding in the U.K. and 70 percent had found that this made it more likely they would leave the U.K. “This obstacle has pushed many U.K. based firms to consider expensive alternatives like setting up accounts in locations such as Estonia, Poland, and Bulgaria,” says Marcus Foster, head of policy campaigns at the Startup Coalition. Adds Foster, “In the absence of adequate banking services, these firms are being pushed to seek out riskier financing and banking options. This also makes the U.K. a less attractive place to found a crypto or Web3 startup.” In France, the law governing cryptoasset regulation has a specific provision for the treatment of Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) or crypto-related businesses, to ensure that they cannot be discriminated against in terms of banking services. The law specifically states that they cannot be denied a bank account by virtue of being a designated VASP. Elise Soucie, executive director of global policy and regulation at GDF says, “Beyond France, other jurisdictions have implemented clear policies to enable access to banking for fintechs. For example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued guidance stating that banks should endeavour to support licenses virtual asset service providers (VASPs) their legitimate need for bank accounts in Hong Kong, and the incoming U.S. administration has also made it clear that they plan to support the crypto and broader tech industry.” The U.S. crypto industry was prepared, to some extent, for regulation by enforcement in 2023, following the collapse of FTX, but evidence of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 sent a chill down the spines of crypto CxOs and financiers. Yet, in the past year, with Blackrock and a growing list of financial institutions launching hugely successful bitcoin ETPs and strong crypto overtures from a new incoming U.S. administration, positive changes appear afoot in the U.S. In public remarks leading up to the election, President Elect Trump made his stance clear vowing to create a “bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council.” A promise he has already delivered on with the nomination of David Sacks, the crypto and AI czar and Bo Hines as executive director of the incoming administration’s new “Crypto Council.” “The rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry,” stated Trump. If the U.S. does create crypto and fintech friendly rules, the U.K. risks falling further behind and losing firms, not only due to lack of clear regulatory frameworks, but also due to lack of access to basic needs such as a bank account. The U.K.’s 2021 ban on crypto derivatives, which was in contrast to industry consultation data including its own consumer survey data, and also in contrast to U.S. policy that saw the CFTC approve bitcoin options contracts on the CME in 2017, was a setback for the U.K. in it claim to be a global fintech hub. A clumsy start to the FCA's crypto registration scheme was another significant setback. Following the optimism for fintech created by the competition mandate granted to the FCA more than a decade ago, in response to the Great Financial Crisis and the failure of two of the four big U.K. banks, there is again much work to do in the U.K. to make Digital Britain attractive to fintechs and crypto firms across both retail and wholesale markets. Legislative progress has been made to promote the growth of digital assets. The Financial Services and Market Act (FSMA), 2023 aims to reform the capital markets, bring payment stablecoins into the scope of regulation, and strengthen the objectives of the financial services regulators including international competitiveness and growth. A new Property (Digital Assets Etc.) Bill, seeks to clarify that certain digital assets, such as crypto tokens, can be recognised as property, even if they do not fit into the two traditional categories of personal property in English and Welsh law. The Digital Securities Sandbox is also a positive development by the Bank of England and the FCA to help to deliver a smooth transition to the issuance, trading and settlement of digital securities in the U.K. While progress has been made laying the legal foundation to position the U.K. as a leading financial hub, much of this new policy and legislation often appears to favour incumbents, especially when taking into account that the U.K. fintech and crypto debanking issue is driven by the nine biggest banks in the U.K. This month, and following significant industry advocacy, HM Treasury amended a law to clarify that crypto staking doesn’t fall under the definition of a “collective investment scheme,” which is typically heavily regulated. While this is a welcome step, more is needed to close the crypto gap with other jurisdictions. Let's get back to first principles: For the U.K. to position itself as a hub for new fintech innovators in crypto, blockchain, and Web3, and to deliver on the promises of growth from the new Government, the debanking problem must be effectively addressed, and now. Fixing fintech debanking is Labour's opportunity to make a tangible change for digital innovators so that they will commit to build and grow new and transformational businesses in the U.K. Following the election, the Labour government now has their chance to fix this problem and fix it for good. With U.K. fintech funding down by a reported 68 percent in 2023, and global fintech funding down a further reported 20 percent in 2024, the U.K. is going to have to increase its incentives to fintechs and digital firms to attract both more homegrown talent and foreign interest and investment. A key action to remedy the debanking problem is to promote transparency, competition, and growth, and to mandate U.K. banks to move away from using generic statements justifying account refusal, especially on the grounds of being engaged with innovative digital technologies. This is especially relevant to innovative digital firms that have already demonstrated their compliance with regulatory and registration requirements. The big concern for fintechs is, that despite the progress the U.K. is making to deliver greater legal and regulatory as it relates to digital assets, it is being undermined as fintechs are further debanked and the crucial on-ramp from fiat to digital assets is choked off. As importantly, fintech debanking is making a mockery of the U.K. Government and its agencies, including the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), with the U.K.'s claim to be the “home of global fintech”, "crypto friendly", and "a global digital hub”. It appears none of these now, if it ever actually was. A web search of the top ten global fintech, crypto, blockchain, and Web3 companies is telling. The U.K. is likely to have future challenges competing for fintech talent and capital in the global digital space race, especially in crypto, blockchain, and Web3, where the largest market players are domiciled or headquartered outside of the U.K. This is not going to be made easier now that the U.K. Government has shifted its digital priorities to Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the digital solution to transform the economy and the lives of its citizens, where the big players are U.S. based. U.K Prime Minister Keir Starmer this week set out a blueprint to turbocharge AI with the promise that AI will deliver a decade of national renewal. While governments and their agencies are always keen on big new and exciting announcements, the fintech industry is set on holding the U.K. Government's feet to the fire on the debanking issue. It is time to fix fintech and crypto debanking in the U.K., now. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 68.42 points, or 0.2%, ending at 43,153.13. The S&P 500 index lost 12.57 points, or 0.2%, ending at 5,937.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 172.94 points, or 0.9%, closing at 19,338.29. A rough patch for stocks has left the Dow up only 2.2% since the Nov. 5 election, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Its peak "Trump bump" close of 45,014.04 on Dec. 4 had the index up 6.6% from its Nov. 5 close. Shares of Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. both fell more than 3% Thursday, even as longer 10-year Treasury yields logged a three-session decline of nearly 20 basis points. That was its biggest such drop since Aug. 5, according to Dow Jones Market Data — with the August three-day decline coming on the heels of a drastic unwind of the Japanese yen carry trade. The 10-year yield fell to 4.606% Thursday, retreating from its one-year high of 4.802% set on Monday. But a cautious tone remained in markets, with investors focused on what policies might be a top priority under the incoming Trump administration — and the Treasury market's likely reaction to them.

AAPL (U.S.: Nasdaq) Tesla TSLA (U.S.: Nasdaq) 1 day ago By Joseph Adinolfi (SpotGamma) On Friday, options traders will face the first expiration of monthly contracts of 2025. Contracts tied to $4.2 trillion worth of stocks, ETFs and indexes will either be exercised, or expire worthless, according to data from SpotGamma. The $4.2 trillion figure is smaller than December's record-breaking "triple witching" expiration, which came in at $6.6 trillion, according to data from Asym 500. Still, SpotGamma founder Brent Kochuba pointed out that the value of single-stock options expiring is "unusually large," owing to Wednesday's strong stock-market rally. He added that the expiration could mark a near-term top for the market. "Relative call values surged due to yesterday's large rally, and the expiring of these calls may mark a short-term top in the market, particularly ahead of the inauguration and FOMC," Kochuba said in emailed commentary. 1 day ago By Vivien Lou Chen U.S. government debt rallied for a third session on Thursday, pushing yields to their lowest closing levels in weeks, after Fed governor Christopher Waller opened the door to the possibility of three or four rate cuts in 2025. The 2-year yield ended at 4.237%, the lowest since Dec. 12. The 10-year rate finished at 4.606%, the lowest since Jan. 3.

Small-caps, utilities and real-estate stocks were being bought on the back of easing Treasury yields. The same wasn't the case for rate-sensitive technology stocks, including megacap names like Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. "We do think equity markets will continue to move up," said Luke Tilley, chief economist and head of economics, asset allocation and quantitative services for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors, in an interview. But Tilley is also cautious on large-cap stocks due to uncertainty about policies from the second Trump administration that could drive the 10-year Treasury yield higher. He also expects the labor market to weaken from here and for inflation to ease further, opening up the potential for 100 basis points of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts in 2025.

AAPL (U.S.: Nasdaq) Tesla TSLA (U.S.: Nasdaq) Russell 2000 Index RUT (US Composite) U.S. 10 Yr BX:TMUBMUSD10Y (XTUP) 1 day ago By Joy Wiltermuth The big three U.S. equity indexes were modestly lower Thursday, but small caps were bucking the trend. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.1% in the final hour of trade, but also outperforming its large-cap counterparts with a 3.5% gain so far this week, according to FactSet. The S&P 500 was struggling to secure a fourth straight day of gains Thursday, and was up 2.1% so far in the week. S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) Russell 2000 Index RUT (US Composite) 1 day ago By Joy Wiltermuth Bank earnings set a positive tone this week as more major corporations gear up to roll out their quarterly results. Net interest margins, credit trends and overall consumer and business lending look very solid, said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. "I think that’s given investors a needed catalyst to say: Things are okay," he told MarketWatch. But any big disappointments in earnings, especially from highflying tech stocks, could deliver a shock to markets, he added. So could any aggressive rollout of tariffs by the Trump administration or any strong retaliatory response from U.S. trading partners, Saglimbene said. Inflation progress might be stalling in some areas, but Saglimbene said that isn't his main concern for 2025.  DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) 1 day ago By Christine Idzelis An equal-weight measure of the S&P 500 was rising Thursday afternoon, even as major U.S. stock indexes traded down. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which tracks an index that equally weights stocks in the broad U.S. large-cap equities index, was up 0.6% in afternoon trading, according to FactSet data, at last check. The ETF was outperforming the S&P 500, which has heavy exposure to stocks in the information-technology sector. The S&P 500 was down 0.1% in afternoon trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%, according to FactSet data, at last check. S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP (U.S.: NYSE Arca) DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) 1 day ago By Joy Wiltermuth The tech-driven selloff in stocks was gathering some steam in afternoon trade, leaving the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 near their session lows. Dow was off about 115 points, or 0.3%, near 43,101. S&P 500 was 0.3% lower, near 5,932. Nasdaq Composite shed about 160 points, or 0.8%. S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) 1 day ago By Joy Wiltermuth Investors were "holding tight" as the nation's biggest banks kicked off fourth-quarter earnings season on a positive note and ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Management. "Basically, it's a bit of sideways movement" in stocks on mixed economic data and as the "earnings season is getting off to a good start," Cardillo told MarketWatch. The parade of earnings due to get under way next week could be a catalyst for a pullback — or it could pave the way for fresh record highs for stocks, he said. The bond market, however, has been paying close attention to Thursday's Senate confirmation hearing for Scott Bessent, the nominee for Treasury secretary, in order to get a sense of the incoming Trump administration's policy priorities. "He's making a big pitch for the extension of 2017 tax cuts," Cardillo said of Bessent. S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) U.S. 10 Yr BX:TMUBMUSD10Y (XTUP) 1 day ago By Joy Wiltermuth Stocks and bond yields were meandering Thursday afternoon as investors tuned in to a Senate hearing for Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent for clues about the policy priorities of the incoming Trump administration. Standouts, however, in stocks were the S&P 500's rate-sensitive utilities and real-estate sectors, which were up 2.1% and 1.5%, respectively, according to FactSet. The broader S&P 500 was up less than 0.1%. The sharp rise in longer Treasury yields since November pulled both sectors lower. But they were getting a nice bounce as the 10-year yield pulled back to about 4.6% from a high of 4.8% earlier in the week.

Title: Flockerz Presale Hits $10.2M Before Launching in Less Than a Week. Next Meme Coin to Explode?

Things have never looked better for the crypto sector. According to CoinMarketCap figures, the global crypto market cap sits at $3.5T, with a 20.37% increase in the 24-hour trading volume and over $800M in EFTs net flow over the past 30 days. This new bullish movement comes after a series of Trump’s pro-crypto policies and upcoming TradFi innovations like Clearpool’s upcoming real-world asset (RWA) blockchain, Ozean, which are accelerating blockchain technology adoption. This blockchain integration with traditional finance (TradFi) could see RWA tokenization hit $50B in 2025 — an increase in liquidity that could drive growth across not only Bitcoin and stablecoins but also altcoins and emerging crypto projects. We’ve seen this positive trend extending to the meme coin sector, which has seen an 8.79% increase in market cap over the past week. New presales like Flockerz ($FLOCK), which already surpassed its $10M milestone, even have some traders speculating 100x returns post-listing. According to Clearpool CEO Jakob Kronbichler, for Decrypt, tokenized treasuries and stablecoins currently dominate the RWA sector. However, we could see other assets like commodities and real estate gain traction soon. As more use cases for RWA crop up and big companies like Clearpool and BlackRock pioneer the adoption of blockchain technology, it’s only a matter of time before other TradFi providers join in. For the broader crypto market, this could mean increased trust and widespread adoption of blockchain technology, as well as a bridging of the TradFi and DeFi sectors. This could increase adoption and liquidity in the DeFi sector, lifting new DeFi crypto projects to new heights. Upcoming crypto projects like Flockerz ($FLOCK) are already capitalizing off of the DeFi wave. $FLOCK, the project’s utility token, surpassed $10.2M in presale, attracting investor interest with its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and Vote-to-Earn system. According to the project’s whitepaper, Flockerz plans to redefine decentralization, giving all members of the FlockTopia (the project’s DAO) a voice in all project decisions, like: So far, the project has aced the first step of its roadmap, securing audits from both Coinsult and SolidProof and garnering the attention of thousands of followers on X and Telegram. Considering the presale’s momentum and Flockerz’s partnership with the upcoming DeFi product Best Wallet, some crypto traders and influencers think the token is poised for 100x returns post-listing in 2025. The meme coin could follow a similar trajectory to other DeFi meme projects before it, like $AI16Z, which saw an 84,500.95% one-year rise since its all-time low in October 2024, or $PENGU, which is still up 575.16% since its listing in early December. The Flockerz presale will end in six days (January 22), when $FLOCK will be officially listed on exchanges, after which the price is expected to boom. Until then, investors can buy $FLOCK at the current price ($0.0066883) and enjoy staking rewards of up to 271%. To join the presale, you just have to connect a hot wallet to the presale widget on the official Flockerz website. You can choose among hot wallets like Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, and Best Wallet, or use Wallet Connect to buy with any other compatible wallet. You can pay using $ETH, $USDT, or $BNB. Input the number of $FLOCK tokens to buy and confirm your transaction. Then, sit back and wait for the presale to end so you can claim your tokens. Just remember to save some crypto for the gas fees when the time comes. If you don’t yet have a crypto wallet, you can also set up a free Best Wallet account through Flockerz’s page. Considering the hype surrounding DeFi projects, meme coins, and a potential altcoin season, Flockerz could indeed become the next meme coin to explode in 2025, joining the ranks of other successful projects like $AI16Z and $PENGU. So far, the project’s presale success and marketing efforts suggest strong engagement and community support. But remember that crypto is a highly volatile market, and the trajectory of new tokens post-listing is often unpredictable.

Title: Carlyle lines up bankers for possible sale of British fund network Calastone, sources say

By Amy-Jo Crowley LONDON (Reuters) - Carlyle has lined up bankers to explore a sale of its British funds network and data business Calastone, which would be the latest deal in a sector that has attracted billions of pounds from investors, four people familiar with the matter said. The U.S. buyout group is working with Barclays (LON:BARC) to explore a sale of the London-headquartered business, a marketplace for trading and settling investment funds underpinned by blockchain technology, the people said. It also provides data on fund flows. The process is in its early stages and Carlyle is expected to proceed with an auction before the summer, two of the people said. It could fetch more than 20 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, or 600 million pounds ($731.52 million), in the event of a sale, based on deals in the wider financial technology and data sector, one of the people added. The four sources said a deal was not certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Carlyle and Calastone did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Barclays declined to comment. Calastone is expected to attract attention from global exchange and market infrastructure groups as well as private equity firms, three of the people said. A sale would mark the latest in a series of deals for companies that provide specialised financial technology and data to clients including banks, asset managers and investment groups, and that have changed hands at elevated valuation multiples. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) agreed to buy Preqin last year for 2.55 billion pounds. Calastone's customers span 4,000 fund distribution and fund manager clients in 57 countries, processing 270 billion pounds of investment value each month, the group's website said. It uses blockchain among other technologies to automate manual tasks including order routing, settlement and transaction reporting for asset and fund managers, which have been hampered by rising costs and inefficiency in the past, according to its website. Carlyle, which has $447 billion under management, bought Calastone from venture capital investor Octopus Ventures and Accel in 2020 for an undisclosed sum. Management, led by CEO Julien Hammerson (LON:HMSO), hold a minority stake in the business. Revenues at Calastone were 68.3 million pounds in 2023, up from 60.3 million pounds a year earlier, according to Companies House filings. ($1 = 0.8202 pounds)

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Pizza Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where YUM! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) stands against other best pizza stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Pizza is one of the most popular foods in North America. According to the Global Pizza Analysis Report 2024 released by Research and Markets, the global pizza market size was valued at around $148.6 billion in 2023. It is expected to reach $222.5 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.59% between 2023 and 2032. The primary reasons behind this growth are the shifting consumer dietary patterns influenced by rapid westernization, the increasing popularity of online pizza ordering platforms, and the introduction and popularization of healthier product variants, such as gluten-free, vegan, and low-calorie pizza options. Pizza Today surveyed 748 pizza business owners from across the US to develop the Pizza Industry Trends Report 2024. The report showed that online ordering was becoming the most popular norm in the industry, with 24.91% of respondents investing to upgrade their online ordering technology. In addition, pizzeria owners are directing around 78% of their advertising budgets to social media apps to boost growth and prominence. Around 65% of business owners surveyed showed signs of optimism regarding their annual sales, expecting growth in the next 12 months. Frozen pizzas are also a significant force in the industry due to their ease of availability, affordability, and convenience. According to Grand View Research, the US frozen pizza market was valued at $6.62 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% between 2023 and 2030. Consumers are increasingly shifting to this variety due to hectic lifestyles and other factors such as increased disposable income and a rise in the standard of living. In addition, frozen pizzas are becoming popular because they offer the same varieties as fresh pizza options, such as cheese pizza, meat pizza, veggie pizza, and more. Gluten-free frozen pizzas are also increasing in popularity due to the growing health consciousness among consumers and the increasing prevalence of gluten allergies, celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and other health reasons. The gluten-free segment is expected to grow with the fastest CAGR among all pizza categories, increasing by 9.2% between 2023 and 2030. Chicken dominated the toppings segment in the pizza market, with the highest share of more than 30% in 2022, according to statistics by Grand View Research. Companies offering chicken produce and toppings are benefitting from this trend. The popularity of chicken topping has also been supported by the increasing preference for healthier eating and the growth of fast-casual restaurants. However, the fastest growing segment remains to be bacon. The bacon segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.5% between 2023 and 2030. The regular/restaurant-style pizza segment dominated the market with the highest share, 55%, as of 2022. Furthermore, supermarkets and hypermarkets are the most prominent distribution channels for the pizza market. They had the highest share, more than 30%, in 2022. The primary reason behind this trend is the increasing convenience and variety offered by these channels. We sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 pizza stocks. We also considered cheese and flour stocks. We then selected the top 12 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders that have stakes in them as of fiscal Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Hedge Fund Holders: 34 YUM! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) operates around 58,000 restaurants in 155 countries and territories under four operating segments: Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell, and The Habit Burger Grill Divisions. Its Pizza Hut concept specializes in the sale of ready-to-eat pizzas. Although the company is facing a complex consumer environment due to the conflict in the Middle East, it grew profits by 3% year-over-year. Taco Bell US and KFC International are the two primary growth engines for the company. In fiscal Q3 2024, Taco Bell US outperformed the industry on comparable sales, and KFC International outperformed on unit growth. YUM! Brands, Inc.

While policymakers have, since late September, cut interest rates and announced broad stimulus plans, details on highly anticipated fiscal support won't likely come until an annual parliamentary meeting in March. Official GDP figures for 2024 are due Friday. "China's fiscal stimulus is not yet enough to address the drags on economic growth ... We are cautious long term given China's structural challenges," BlackRock Investment Institute said in a weekly report Tuesday. The firm, which is modestly overweight Chinese stocks, indicated it was ready to buy more if the circumstances changed. Of growing urgency in the meantime is the drop in domestic demand, and worries about deflation. Consumer prices barely rose in 2024, up by just 0.5% after excluding volatile food and energy prices. That's the slowest rise in at least 10 years, according to records available on the Wind Information database. "Consumer spending remains weak, foreign investment is declining, and some industries face growth pressure," Yin Yong, Beijing city mayor, said Tuesday in an official annual report. The capital city targets 2% consumer price inflation for 2025, and aims to bolster tech development. While nationwide economic goals won't come out until March, senior economic and finance officials have told reporters in the last two weeks that fiscal support is in the works, and issuance of ultra-long bonds to spur consumption would exceed last year's. China's announced stimulus will begin to take effect this year, but it will likely take time to see a significant impact, Mi Yang, head of research for north China at property consultancy JLL, told reporters in Beijing last week. Pressure on the commercial property market will continue this year, and prices may accelerate their drop before recovering, he said. Rents in Beijing for high-end offices, called Grade A, fell 16% in 2024 and are expected to drop by nearly 15% this year, with some rentals even nearing 2008 or 2009 levels, according to JLL. New shopping centers in Beijing opened in 2024 with average occupancy rates of 72% — previously such malls would not be opened if the rate was below 75% or much closer to 100%, JLL said. Within a year, however, the new malls have seen occupancy rates reach 90%, the consultancy said. Unlike the U.S. during the Covid-19 pandemic, China has not handed out cash to consumers. Instead, Chinese authorities in late July announced 150 billion yuan ($20.46 billion) in ultra-long bonds for trade-in subsidies and another 150 billion yuan for equipment upgrades. China has already issued 81 billion yuan for this year's trade-in program, officials said this month. It covers more home appliances, electric cars and an up to 15% discount on smartphones priced at 6,000 yuan or less. Consumers who buy premium phones tend to upgrade and recycle their devices more frequently than buyers on the lower end of the market, indicating the government may want to encourage a new group to shorten their upgrade cycle, said Rex Chen, CFO of ATRenew, which operates stores for processing smartphones and other secondhand goods. Chen told CNBC on Monday he expects the trade-in subsidies program can boost recycling transaction volumes of eligible products on the platform by at least 10 percentage points, up from 25% growth in 2024. He also expects the government to carry out a similar trade-in policy for the next few years. However, it's less clear whether the trade-in program alone can lead to a sustained recovery in consumer demand. Nomura's Chief China Economist Ting Lu said in a report Tuesday that he expects the sales boost to fade by the second half of this year, and that tepid new home sales will limit demand for home appliances. Real estate and related sectors such as construction once accounted for more than a quarter of China's economy. When central authorities started cracking down on developers' high debt levels in 2020, that had ripple effects on the economy, alongside the Covid-19 pandemic. China shifted its stance on real estate in September following a high-level meeting led by President Xi Jinping that called for halting the sector's decline. Measures to prop up the sector include using a whitelist process to finish construction on the many apartments that have been sold but yet not been built due to developers' financial constraints. New apartments in China are typically sold ahead of completion. Jeremy Zook, lead analyst for China at Fitch Ratings, said the real estate market had yet not reached a bottom, and that authorities might provide more direct support. He pointed out that it was difficult for the economy to transition away from real estate, despite China's wishes to reduce its reliance on the sector for growth. The government's latest measures have helped the broader stock market rally, and lifted sentiment slightly. Sales of new homes in China's largest cities over the last 30 days have surged by nearly 40% from a year ago, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a Jan. 5 report. But they cautioned that high inventory levels in smaller cities indicate property prices "have further room to fall" and that homebuilding is "likely to remain depressed for years to come." In the relatively affluent city of Foshan — near Guangzhou city in southern China — housing inventory could take 20 months to clear in one district, and seven months in another district, according to a 2024 report from Beike Research Institute, a firm affiliated with a major housing sales platform in China. The city overall saw floor space sold last year fall by 16% to the lowest in 10 years, the report said. Complicating China's economic challenges are tensions with the U.S. Similar to Washington's export controls, Beijing has also made efforts to ensure national security by prioritizing domestic players in strategic sectors such as technology. That stance has pressured an increasing number of European businesses in China to localize — despite added costs and reduced productivity — if they are to retain customers in the country, the EU Chamber of Commerce in China said in a report last week. Official Chinese statements have also emphasized coupling security with development. A slogan for part of Beijing's efforts to support growth is an effort to build "security capabilities in key areas," pointed out Yang Ping, director of the investment research institute within the National Development and Reform Commission. She was speaking at a press event Wednesday. This year, "boosting consumption has been prioritized ahead of improving investment efficiency," Yang said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. "Expanding and boosting consumption are the main focus of this year's policy adjustment." She dismissed concerns that the impact of trade-in subsidies on consumption would fade after an initial spike, and indicated more details would emerge after the March parliamentary meeting.

We recently published a list of Bitcoin Miners, Quantum Computing Lead Rally: A Look at Wednesday’s Top 10 Gainers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Hut 8 Corp. (NASDAQ:HUT) stands among Wednesday’s top gainers that lead rally. Wall Street’s main indices closed in the green territory on Wednesday, posting gains of more than 1 percent as investors cheered news of a tamed inflation rate for November. The Dow Jones jumped by 1.65 percent, while the S&P 500 surged by 1.83 percent. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite index soared 2.45 percent. Ten companies mirrored the broader market optimism, led by the quantum computing and bitcoin mining sectors. Today, let’s take a look at what buoyed investor sentiment for each of the top gainers. To come up with Wednesday’s top advancers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A close-up of a cryptocurrency mining rig in a large warehouse facility. Shares of Hut 8 Corp. (NASDAQ:HUT), a Bitcoin mining firm, increased by 10.06 percent on Wednesday to finish at $26.26 apiece as investor sentiment was buoyed by positive developments surrounding the cryptocurrency industry ahead of the Trump administration. Hut 8 Corp. (NASDAQ:HUT)’s stock price rallied in line with higher Bitcoin prices, which as of Wednesday was retesting its resistance level of $100,000, over news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is set to begin overhauling cryptocurrency policies as soon as President-elect Donald Trump assumes office next week. Among the measures likely to be considered are initiating a process that could result in clearer guidance and rules on when the agency deems a cryptocurrency to be a security, as well as reviewing pending crypto enforcement cases in the courts. The news sparked optimism for a stronger cryptocurrency market and the potential end of regulatory crackdowns, particularly with the appointment of pro-cryptocurrency former SEC official Paul Atkins to lead the commission. Overall, HUT ranks 6th on our list of Wednesday’s top gainers that lead rally. While we acknowledge the potential of HUT as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Photo Credit: Reuters RIL Chairperson Mukesh Ambani first hinted at a blockchain integration plan for Jio in August 2023 Jio Platforms Ltd. (JPL) has announced a partnership with the Polygon blockchain as it plans its venture into Web3 technology. Reliance's telecom subsidiary, Jio is looking to introduce features that rely on Web3 technology, on its existing features that are available to over 450 million users. JPL is looking to explore new capabilities offered by Web3 technology and offer an enhanced digital experience to its users, according to the company. Over the last eight years, Reliance Jio has expanded from offering telecom services to like online and offline shopping stores, media streaming platforms, video conferencing, a web browser, cloud gaming service, and security services. Jio and Polygon have yet to reveal which of the operator's applications and services will be the first to be upgraded with blockchain capabilities. It is expected to be one of the biggest efforts to integrate Web3 technology with existing services in the country. Speaking to Gadgets 360, Aishwary Gupta from Polygon said this development marks a big move for Web3 in India. Gupta is the global head of payments and fintech at Polygon. “This is one of the biggest partnerships we have in India and the idea for us is to help Jio to enable Web3 components in its existing product suite,” Gupta said. “There are a couple of products we are working to integrate on as we speak. From an Indian perspective it's a big move where we want to get India web3 enabled and this helps us in that direction,” he added. RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani first hinted at a blockchain integration plan for Jio in August 2023. During the 46th annual general meeting of Reliance Industries, Ambani had said that the Jio Financial Services (JFS) will be the brand's point of entry into the Web3 sector. At the time it was disclosed that through JFS, Reliance will offer management services for digital assets. Details about JFS' foray into Web3 have not been out since. Last year, media reports suggested that JFS and BlackRock were planning a wealth management venture and had filed with the National Stock Exchange of India in April 2024. While Reliance has chosen not to expose its users to services around volatile crypto assets, the company has worked with other Web3 technologies. In 2023, Reliance General Insurance said it had begun accepting the eRupee CBDC for premium payments. The same year, Reliance Retail had also announced that it would let shoppers pay via the eRupee CBDC across its stores in Mumbai. Commenting on the partnership with Polygon, JPL CEO Kiran Thomas said in a prepared statement that, "Joining forces with Polygon Labs marks a significant milestone in Jio's journey towards digital excellence. We are excited to explore the boundless possibilities of Web3 and bring unparalleled digital experiences to our users."

January 16, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: SAGA Metals Corp. SAGA Metals Corp. VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SAGA Metals Corp. ("SAGA" or the "Company") (TSXV: SAGA) (OTCQB: SAGMF) (FSE: 20H), a North American exploration company focused on critical mineral discovery, is pleased to provide a complete overview of the Radar Titanium-Vanadium (Ti-V) Project as equipment, fuel, diamond drill and personnel begin to arrive in Labrador for the maiden drill program set to commence in a weeks time. Radar Titanium-Vanadium (Ti-V) Project – Labrador, Canada The Radar Ti-V Property is located 10km south of Cartwright in Labrador, Canada. The project spans 17,250 hectares and benefits from road access, supporting efficient exploration and development. Radar’s Hawkeye zone is the most prospective target on the property. Detailed geophysics and surface samples are suggestive of a complex and multi-phased layered mafic intrusion that may be upwards of 1km wide, 4km long and potentially over 600m deep. Recent geophysics completed on the property show very detailed correlation to the rock samples and observed phase changes in the system. SAGA aims to complete a 1,500m drill program at the Hawkeye zone over the area encompassing the anomalous TiO2 and V2O5 surface samples. Radar Project Surface Assay Highlights Include: Radar Project Target Zones: Radar Project and corresponding geophysics highlight multiple anomalies across the property Assay results have confirmed the magnetic anomalies within both the Hawkeye and Trapper zones are mineralized, establishing a combined strike of just over 8km in length between the two zones. Preliminary indications suggest a possible connection between the trends through a transitional zone, which increases the mineralized strike to ~9.5km through verified samples. Maiden Drill Program Q1 2025: Drilling is scheduled to commence this month with a minimum 1,500m program at the Radar Ti-V Projects. The Hawkeye zone is the most advanced zone with both surface samples and detailed geophysics creating clear drill targets. Assays have returned consistent values between 2.5 - 11.1% TiO2 and 0.2 - 0.66% V2O5, confirming the presence of high-grade titanium & vanadium across a potential 1km wide and 4km long trend further confirmed with geophysics. Recent Geophysics of the Hawkeye Zone Highlights: SAGA Metals successfully completed a detailed magnetic and electromagnetic (EM) survey over the northwest section of the Hawkeye Zone at the Radar Project. Utilizing ground-based equipment on a tightly spaced grid, with 25 meters between stations and 50-meter line spacing, the survey delivered high-resolution magnetic and conductivity data. This effort has proven highly effective in mapping magnetite-rich zones within the Gabbro Norite host rock, a key indicator of titanium (TiO₂) and vanadium (V₂O₅) mineralization. The magnetic survey was so successful that the high-resolution imagery combined with sample assays and field observations can be used to map some of the most distinguishing features of the system throughout this zone. Spanning nearly 1km in width with a near-vertical orientation the Hawkeye zone is the most prospective target on the property with geophysics now defining the phases of a layered mafic intrusion sampled in the 2023-2024 field programs. The results of this survey provide exceptional clarity, combining high-definition imagery with sample assays and field observations to identify distinct geological phases within the Hawkeye Zone. The eastern portion of the zone is characterized by alternating silica-rich (magnetite-depleted) bands and high-grade magnetite layers, with titanium and vanadium grades ranging from 5 to 11% TiO₂ and 0.3 to 0.66% V₂O₅. Moving westward, the system transitions into gabbro norite rocks containing disseminated magnetite. These rocks exhibit consistent but lower grades, averaging 3 to 5% TiO₂ and 0.1 to 0.2% V₂O₅. Geophysics completed over a targeted area within the Hawkeye Zone increasing width to 1km and a projected 4km strike Magnetic Inversion Interpretation: SAGA continued to update its geophysics with the magnetic inversions of the Hawkeye zone. Completed by Chris and David Mark of Geotronics, the magnetic inversions can project, with a high degree of certainty up to 400 meters in depth, what the mineralized magnetic body looks like beneath the surface. Magnetic inversion of the Hawkeye zone looking north-northeast. Range of > 0.02 susceptibility cut off. Same magnetic inversion of the Hawkeye zone looking east at profile cross section with > 0.02 susceptibility cut off. Petrographic Analysis at the Radar Ti-V Project: Recent petrographic work completed by Dr. Al Miller on rock samples from the Hawkeye zone have increased the understanding of the mineralogical host of titanium and vanadium mineralization at the Radar project. This sets the foundation for the metallurgical work the team hopes to be able to build on during the 2025 drill programs. First look at the petrography of the Hawkeye zone reveals more than one composition of magnetite; evidence which contributes to the hypothesis of multiphase mineralization events. Additionally, petrographic evidence reveals that much of the titanium and vanadium mineralization occurs within magnetite with a lack of ilmenite in many of the layers. This is key to understanding how these elements are locked up together and ultimately how they’ll separate during extraction. These layers have assayed high TiO2% and V2O5% leading to the use of Vanadium Titanomagnetite (VTM) classification of several mineralized layers of the Hawkeye zone. Ilmenite with exsolution lamellae of the magnetite was observed but only in a few cases. This has contributed to what can be called differential compositional layering and multiple mineralization magmatic layering events. VTM’s are a mineralization style that has not received much attention in North America but is a pivotal piece of China’s iron, titanium and vanadium mining and production industry. Trapper Zone Shows Promising Titanium and Vanadium Anomalies Despite Limited Exposure: The Trapper Zone spans a strike length of ~4.3km, slightly longer than the Hawkeye Zone, though it has significantly less surface exposure. The lack of outcrop and subcrop initially posed challenges for the exploration team; however, the implementation of an extensive soil grid successfully yielded the first geochemical confirmation of the Trapper Zone’s correlation with previously identified geophysical anomalies. Key findings from the Trapper Zone include: Although only 30 rock samples were collected due to limited exposure and ground cover, the consistent anomalies found in both soil and rock samples provide compelling evidence to justify targeted exploration in this zone. Further work, including additional surface sampling, trenching, and geophysical surveys, is planned to unlock the full potential of the Trapper Zone in 2025. Transition Zone Presents Key Opportunity for Further Understanding of Radar Ti-V System: A possible third, transitional zone, located between the Hawkeye and Trapper zones, presents a significant opportunity for further exploration. While its relationship to either zone remains unclear, this transitional area could help determine whether the Hawkeye and Trapper zones are folded limbs of the same system or represent different phases of a multi-phase, complex layered mafic intrusion. Comparable Projects in the Grenville Geological Province: A Map of the Grenville Geological Province The Grenville Geological Province is known for its significant deposits of iron, titanium, vanadium (Fe-Ti-V), and Platinum Group Metals (PGM). A key comparison point is North America's largest titanium-vanadium project, located at Lac Tio in Quebec, just southwest of SAGA's Radar Project. Notably, both projects share the same rich geological setting. Strategic Resources is a Montreal-based development company focused on vanadium, high-purity iron ore and titanium with their BlackRock project located in Quebec west of Lac Tio right on the Grenville Front (as seen in the map above). Like, the Radar Ti-V project, these projects all have basement rock dated over 1 billion years old, and all share components of the deep-rooted mafic rock of the Grenville Province. Strategic Resources completed an amended feasibility study1 on March 26, 2024, on the Southwest deposit hosted within the BlackRock project confirming a proven and probably reserve of 127.8Mt with 0.46% V2O5, 40.2% Fe2O3 and 7.8% TiO2. The Southwest deposit spans 2.5km in length and averaging 110m in mineralized thickness with a projected mine life of 39 years. The projected financial outcome of the mine estimates after-tax cashflows of C$12.055 billion with a 5.4-year payback period including an after-tax net-present-value (8%) of C$1.932 billion and an 18.2% after-tax internal rate of return. Michael Garagan, CGO & Director of SAGA Metals Corp. commented: “All the final preparations are underway in Labrador. Equipment and fuel have been shipped and will arrive any day. Core logging and on-site lay down areas are being prepared. Our team, including myself, and the drilling contractors are all set to arrive early next week with our first diamond drill turning shortly thereafter. This project is a testament to our corporate mandate of completing the necessary due diligence and robust investigation to find exploration worthy grass roots projects. Radar has the potential of unlocking value with our first zone; one of potentially multiple zones on our property confirming high-grade mineralization at surface in a 1km by 4km area and potentially over 600m at depth. Needless to say, we are very excited to commence drilling on two projects in Q1.” About SAGA Metals Corp.

Asian markets extended a global rally Thursday after below-forecast US inflation provided a much-needed shot of relief to investors and revived hopes for interest rate cuts this year. Strong earnings from Wall Street banking titans and a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas added to the optimistic mood on trading floors. Still, there remains a certain amount of caution ahead of Donald Trump returning to the White House next week, having promised to ramp up tariffs on imports, and slash taxes and regulations that many fear could reignite inflation. Data on Wednesday showing core consumer prices rose less than expected in December helped spur a surge in New York-listed stocks led by tech giants including Nvidia, Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet. The S&P 500 and the Dow piled on more than one percent and the Nasdaq more than two percent, putting them back in the green for 2025, with healthy earnings reports from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon also lifting sentiment. The inflation figures tempered worries that the Federal Reserve might not cut rates this year — or possibly even hike them — following a blockbuster jobs report on Friday. Swap traders are now eyeing a reduction in July, having been looking at September or October at best. New York president John Williams also provided some soothing comments, saying “the process of disinflation remains in train”. Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, said: “Data on economic growth has continued to roll in stronger than expected, contributing to the upward revision in our 2024 expectation. “However, strong growth has helped generate a large rise in bond yields. If it persists, higher borrowing costs will seriously degrade (gross domestic product) growth in 2025 and 2026. “Still, we expect the Fed to respond adroitly to decelerating growth in 2025 and 2026 with hefty rate cuts, ultimately triggering a growth rebound in 2027 and 2028.” Asian markets rose across the board. Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Jakarta all piled on more than one percent, while there were also gains in Shanghai, Singapore and Wellington. Tokyo also edged up but was limited by a pick-up in the yen against the dollar after the inflation data and as investors assess the chances of a rate hike by the Bank of Japan at its meeting next week. Oil prices also extended a surge this week fuelled by fresh US-UK sanctions on Russia’s energy sector and amid fears Trump will ramp up measures against key producer Iran when he takes the Oval Office. Meanwhile, data Wednesday showed US inventories fell for an eighth week to their lowest since April 2022, with the International Energy Agency saying a colder winter has pushed global demand higher.

Title: Meta just flipped the switch that prevents misinformation from spreading in the United States

The company built effective systems to reduce the reach of fake news. Last week, it shut them down I. Last week, Meta announced a series of changes to its content moderation policies and enforcement strategies designed to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration. The company ended its fact-checking program in the United States, stopped scanning new posts for most policy violations, and created carve-outs in its community standards to allow dehumanizing speech about transgender people and immigrants. The company also killed its diversity, equity and inclusion program. Behind the scenes, the company was also quietly dismantling a system to prevent the spread of misinformation. When the company announced on Jan. 7 that it would end its fact-checking partnerships, the company also instructed teams responsible for ranking content in the company’s apps to stop penalizing misinformation, according to sources and an internal document obtained by Platformer. The result is that the sort of viral hoaxes that ran roughshod over the platform during the 2016 US presidential election — “Pope Francis endorses Trump,” Pizzagate, and all the rest — are now just as eligible for free amplification on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads as true stories. In 2016, of course, Meta hadn’t yet invested huge sums in machine-learning classifiers that can spot when a piece of viral content is likely a hoax. But nine years later, after the company’s own analyses found that these classifiers could reduce the reach of these hoaxes by more than 90 percent, Meta is shutting them off. Meta declined to comment on the changes. Instead, it pointed me to a letter and a blog post in which it had hinted that this change was coming. The letter was sent in August by Zuckerberg to Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. In it, Zuckerberg expressed his discomfort with the Biden Administration’s efforts to pressure the company to remove certain posts about COVID-19. Zuckerberg also expressed regret that the company had temporarily reduced the distribution of stories about Hunter Biden’s laptop, which Meta and Twitter had both done out of fear that they had been the result of a Russian hack-and-leak operation. The few hours that the story’s distribution was limited would go on to become a Republican cause célèbre. As a kind of retroactive apology for bowing to censorship requests in the past, and for the company’s own actions in the Hunter Biden case, Zuckerberg said that going forward, the company would no longer reduce the reach of posts that had been sent to fact checkers but not yet evaluated. Once they had been evaluated, Meta would continue to reduce the reach of posts that had been designated as false. In hindsight, this turned out to be the first step toward killing off Meta’s misinformation efforts: granting hoaxes a temporary window for expanded reach while they awaited fact checking. That brings us to the blog post: Joel Kaplan’s “More speech, fewer mistakes,” which was published last Tuesday and among other things announced the end of the company’s US fact-checking partnerships. Buried toward the bottom were these two sentences: At the time, Kaplan did not elaborate on which of these demotions the company planned to get rid of. Platformer can now confirm that misinformation-related demotions have been eliminated at the company. The company plans to replace its professional fact-checking program with volunteers from the user base appending information to posts in a system modeled after X’s community notes. But Meta has offered few details on how the program will work, and has not said when it will become available. As a result, Meta has chosen to open a window for viral hoaxes to spread unchecked on its properties while it works to build a new system to mitigate their impact. II. Meta’s efforts to detect misinformation had their roots in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election. In response to outrage over the spread of “Pope endorses Trump” and other hoaxes in the run-up to Trump’s election, Meta promised lawmakers and regulators around the world that it would take steps to improve the quality of information on its platforms. From the start of that initiative, Meta’s integrity teams worked hand-in-hand with the third-party fact checkers it hired after the election. In a 2018 blog post, the company explained the variety of signals it used to determine whether its ranking algorithms might be showing you something false: Notably, none of these changes actually eliminated anyone’s freedom of expression. Instead, they restricted what the technologist Aza Raskin has termed “freedom of reach.” Fact-checking and down-ranking obviously false stories allowed liars and hoaxsters to express themselves but sought to limit the negative effects of those lies on Meta’s customers. In May 2020, at the height of the pandemic, Meta boasted about how well this effort was working. In a blog post, the company said that 95 percent of people who saw labels warning that a post contained misinformation declined to view it. The company said that in March 2020 alone, it displayed warnings related to COVID-19 on 40 million posts. Going forward, Meta will instead ask users to add their own annotations to these and other posts. Academics, journalists, lawmakers, and other interested parties will undoubtedly still conduct their own reviews of viral posts on Meta platforms in the coming months to assess the misinformation landscape. But they’ll be doing it without a critical tool they used in the past: CrowdTangle, a free services that exposed what posts on Facebook and Instagram were most popular via searchable real-time dashboards. Meta killed off CrowdTangle in August, directing users instead to an alternative that lacks many of CrowdTangle’s core features. In publishing this story, I realize that I may be giving ammo to those who believe that misinformation is a root cause of our polarization in the United States. As Joe Bernstein wrote in Harper’s 2021, discussions of misinformation sometimes lend too much credence to the idea that algorithms are all-powerful shapers of reality, and fail to reckon with the fact that people will always seek out information that aligns with their worldview. Their demand for that information, whether it is true or false, may be the most important factor leading to its creation and its spread. But it’s possible to believe that a total fixation on misinformation is counterproductive and also believe in the idea of harm reduction: that sophisticated systems that accurately identify hoaxes and then show them to fewer people ought to be left in place, at least until their replacement has been rolled out and evaluated for its effectiveness. For now, these changes only apply to the United States — though you get the sense that Zuckerberg would happily roll them out anywhere else he’s allowed to.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Experian's significant retail investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 37% ownership Institutions own 48% of Experian Every investor in Experian plc (LON:EXPN) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 51% stake, retail investors possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Meanwhile, institutions make up 48% of the company’s shareholders. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Experian, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Experian Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Experian does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Experian's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Experian. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 4.8% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 4.7% and 4.4% of the stock. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Experian plc. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own UK£61m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 51% stake in Experian, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Experian better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Experian , and understanding them should be part of your investment process. Ultimately the future is most important.
