Title: Bitcoin May See Gains from Soft U.S. CPI, Major Risk-On Surge in BTC Appears Unlikely

A soft U.S. inflation report later Wednesday will likely bode well for risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC). But those expecting bullish fireworks may be disappointed. The Labor Department will publish January's consumer price index (CPI) report on Wednesday at 13:30 UTC. It's expected to show that the cost of living increased by 0.3% month-on-month in January, slowing down from December's 0.4% rise, according to Reuters estimates tracked by FXStreet. The annualized figure is expected to match December's 2.9% reading. The core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have risen to 0.3% month-over-month from 0.2%, resulting in an annualized reading of 3.1%, down from December's 3.2%. Lower-than-expected data, particularly the core figure, will likely bolster expectations for further Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cuts, which could lead to lower Treasury yields and a weaker dollar index, ultimately boosting demand for riskier assets. According to CME's FedWatch tool, the market currently estimates a 54% chance that the Fed will either cut interest rates once or not at all this year. While a potential adjustment in Fed rate cuts could lift BTC, it is unlikely to be the sole catalyst for a breakout from the ongoing consolidation between $90,000 and $110,000. This is due to forward-looking market metrics indicating higher inflation in the coming months amid trade war fears, suggesting that the Fed may have a limited window to implement aggressive rate cuts. Data tracked by Mott Capital Management shows that two-year inflation swaps have climbed to nearly 2.8%, the highest since early 2023. The five-year swap is exhibiting a similar trend. Higher inflation swaps indicate that the market is expecting inflation rates to rise in the future, prompting investors to pay a higher premium to protect themselves against potential purchasing power loss by entering into swap contracts tied to CPI. In other words, the ongoing uptick in these metrics indicate that the progress in inflation toward the Fed's 2% target has stalled, and price pressures are likely to increase over the coming years, probably due to Trump's tariffs. Plus, some investment banks believe a soft January CPI reading won't see the Fed move away from its hawkish rate guidance. In his testimony to Congress Tuesday, Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is in no hurry to cut rates. "We don’t expect that progress on inflation will be enough to prompt additional interest rate cuts from the Fed this year," RBC's weekly note said, adding that January's report will show limited easing in price pressures. BlackRock said the persistent services inflation will keep the Fed from cutting rates. "We get U.S. CPI for January this week. Even as December’s CPI report showed signs of inflation pressures easing, wage growth remains above the level that would allow inflation to recede back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, in our view. We see persistent services inflation forcing the Fed to keep rates higher for longer," BlackRock said. Lastly, BTC may move closer to the lower end of its $90K-$110K trading range should the CPI print hotter than expected.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO): Among the Best International Dividend Stocks to Buy Now

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against the other international dividend stocks. Dividend stocks have been grabbing investors' attention for a while now. According to JP Morgan, over the last two decades, global dividends per share have increased at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts expect this to rise to 7.6% in the future, driven by historically low payout ratios. During the 2020 pandemic, many companies cut dividends, but as earnings have recovered, especially in Big Tech and AI, dividends have not kept up. With payout ratios at 25-year lows, simply returning to normal could add 2% annual growth over the next five years. After slowing down post-COVID, global dividend growth made a surprising comeback last year, increasing 8% and adding an extra $180 billion in payouts despite ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges. According to S&P Global, this was largely driven by record dividend initiations in US tech, European banks, Japan’s auto industry, and solid growth from China. Even oil and gas companies held strong despite market volatility. Looking ahead, experts predict global dividends will hold steady at $2.3 trillion in 2025. Regionally, developed Asia, which includes Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea, and Singapore, is looking at a 3% rise in dividends this year. Europe, on the other hand, is expected to see a 3.4% decline. In emerging markets, the trends are mixed. Asia, led by China, India, and Taiwan, is on track for a 5% increase, while dividends in the Middle East and Africa could drop by 20%, mainly because Saudi Aramco’s special dividend program ended. Latin America is also expected to see a small dip of around 4%. When it comes to sectors, banks and energy companies remain the biggest dividend payers. Banks are expected to distribute around $380 billion globally, but after four years of rapid 20% growth, they are now down to just 2%. Banks are playing it safe, waiting to see how interest rates move. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best international dividend stocks. Our Methodology For this article, we used the BlackRock International Dividend ETF to filter out dividend stocks listed on US exchanges but headquartered internationally. We focused on picking stocks that were most popular among hedge funds. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of Q3 2024 hedge fund sentiment, and dividend yields are mentioned as of February 11. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) An elderly couple receiving insulin from a pharmacist, representing healthcare company's successful pharmaceutical products. Dividend Yield as of February 11: 1.75% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61 Founded in 1923, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a Danish pharmaceutical company that provides insulin, obesity medications, and hormone therapies. 2024 was a strong year for Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), with sales climbing 25% to $40.6 billion, but the company expects growth to slow in 2025. The stock has dropped 40% since last June, as investors worry about demand for obesity drugs and mixed trial results. Analysts observe that the first half of 2024 was exciting, but things cooled down when US prescription growth slowed and some drug trials underperformed. Political uncertainty, especially with Trump’s election, has also made investors nervous. In 2024, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) raised its total dividend per share by 21.3% to DKK 11.40, which includes an interim dividend of DKK 3.50 distributed in August. This is the 29th consecutive year of dividend growth at NVO. Novo Nordisk is one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Looking ahead to 2025, the company expects capital expenditures of around DKK 65 billion but has no plans for share repurchases. In 2025, Novo Nordisk expects a free cash flow of around DKK 75 to 85 billion and sales growth of 16-24% at constant exchange rates. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 61 hedge funds held stakes in Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), compared to 67 funds in Q2. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder in the company, with 13.3 million shares worth $1.58 billion. Overall NVO ranks 4th on our list of the best international dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Unilever PLC (UL) the Safest Dividend Stock in the UK?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unilever-plc-ul-safest-dividend-035350534.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Safest Dividend Stocks in the UK. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) stands against other safest dividend stocks in the UK. In recent years, investors have increasingly shifted away from UK equities, favoring global stocks, particularly high-growth sectors like US technology. The UK stock market is shrinking at its fastest pace in over a decade, largely due to a wave of takeovers involving London-listed companies. Bloomberg data showed that around 45 firms have been delisted from the London market in 2024 through mergers and acquisitions, reflecting a 10% rise from last year’s total. This marks the highest level of delistings since 2010. At the same time, the value of deals involving UK companies has climbed 81% this year, surpassing $160 billion. Over the last ten years, the British index has delivered an annual total return of 6%, significantly lagging behind the 13% return of the broader US market. Analysts attribute this weaker performance to sluggish earnings growth, political uncertainty within the UK, and the lack of a dominant technology sector. However, a key factor has been the sharp drop in valuations as investors have increasingly moved away from UK stocks. According to Goldman Sachs, the issue is not a lack of foreign investor interest—who currently account for roughly two-thirds of the UK market capitalization—but rather the low engagement of domestic investors in UK equities. Also read: 10 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now That said, several factors seem to be contributing to a shift in investor sentiment. In November 2024, UK equity funds saw inflows after more than three years of continuous monthly withdrawals and a large sell-off leading up to the Budget. According to data from Calastone, retail investors invested a net £317 million into UK-focused stock funds that month. This marks a significant change, halting a streak of 41 months of net outflows, during which over £25 billion had been pulled from these funds since May 2021. Analysts also believe that the UK stock market may be on the verge of recovery, although the exact timing and pace of this shift are unclear. In this context, dividend stocks are crucial. Focusing on stocks with growing dividends can offer stability and consistency across different market conditions. These stocks also provide long-term growth potential, compounding returns as share prices recover. The UK market offers some of the highest dividend yields among major markets, with the “Footsie” yielding 3.46%, and the FTSE 250 offering slightly lower but still attractive yields. This setup enables investors to focus on high-growth areas, like smaller companies, while enjoying the benefit of increasing dividends. According to BlackRock, UK market dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, roughly in line with long-term inflation. Companies with growing dividends typically have strong cash flows, allowing them to increase payouts over time. Janus Henderson’s 2023 annual dividend report highlighted a significant increase in dividend growth, revealing that the UK paid out roughly $86 billion in dividends last year, up from $63.1 billion in 2020. Looking ahead, the UK’s stock market index is projected to distribute about £83.6 billion in dividends in 2025, marking a 6.5% rise from the £78.5 billion expected in 2024. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks. For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 to find FTSE stocks that are also traded on US exchanges. Our focus was on companies that have strong dividend policies and consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment toward them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A supermarket shelf overflowing with a variety of fast-moving consumer goods. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22 Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL), established in 1860 and based in London, is a multinational consumer goods company with operations across Asia Pacific, Africa, the Americas, and Europe. The company provides a wide range of products, including hair and skincare items, soap, fabric care products, cooking aids, and ice cream. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) has decided to abandon its plans to sell its €15 billion ice cream division to private equity firms and will now focus on achieving an independent public listing for the unit. Earlier in 2023, in March, the consumer goods giant announced its intention to spin off its ice cream business and gauge interest from private equity buyers for well-known brands like Ben & Jerry’s, Magnum, and Wall’s. In the first half of 2024, Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) saw a 4.1% increase in sales on an underlying basis, supported by three consecutive quarters of positive volume growth. Pricing adjustments aligned with expectations, showing a steady decline. The improvement in gross margins allowed the company to invest more in innovation, significantly boosting overall profitability. Operating profit reached €6.1 billion, marking a 17.1% year-over-year increase. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) reported robust performance in its cash segment, with free cash flow reaching €2.2 billion during the period. By the end of the first half, the company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled €4.97 billion, an increase from €4.1 billion at the end of December 2023. It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.4755 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.2%, as of February 10. Overall, UL ranks 7th on our list of safest dividend stocks in the UK. While we acknowledge the potential for UL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The trio's collaboration, which was detailed by the MoonPay President Keith Grossman on the ”When Shift Happens” podcast, required MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright to “sign away his life” and the company to “promise” it had no liens on its reserve funds. “The volumes were just gigantic,” Grossman said, “All of the liquidity that we use to sort of wire the crypto was locked in BlackRock accounts in a traditional finance sort of manner… and it's Saturday.” How to borrow $160m in $USDC on a holiday weekend @KeithGrossman, president of enterprise at @Moonpay, reveals the crazy story behind how he managed to borrow $160m with @novogratz and @bgarlinghouse’s help in order to make sure the $TRUMP launch would succeed… And the… pic.twitter.com/8zKugL2idN — MR SHIFT 🦁 (@KevinWSHPod) February 11, 2025 The crypto funds it did have handy were being used up rapidly thanks to the Trump meme coin team’s direction that users could use mobile meme coin trading app, Moonshot, for which MoonPay is the exclusive crypto payments provider. Moonshot simplifies the meme coin buying process, allowing users to sign up with an email address, and allowing them to fund their accounts with credit or debit cards. The app eschews the complexities that crypto novices may face with trading on-chain via decentralized exchanges, making it an ideal option for newcomers. Therefore, when new users were looking to buy the TRUMP token on the app, they were exchanging their funds for MoonPay’s crypto reserves, notably stablecoin USDC, which was then used to purchase Trump’s meme coin on the Solana blockchain. If the company didn't have the liquidity to continue facilitating purchases of the token, then new consumers—of which MoonPay says it onboarded 750,000 of during the week of the TRUMP launch—may not have been able to gain access to the token. That may have hindered the token’s rapid growth in the early days, and impacted other MoonPay users as well. Grossman said the app would’ve said, “Sorry, doesn’t work,” had MoonPay run out of funds. To avoid the issue, Grossman said that he and Soto-Wright worked with MoonPay CFO Mouna Siala to forecast the amount of funds it would require, with the initial estimate of $50 million quickly doubling to $100 million after reevaluating the token’s growth in the first 24 hours. With its reserves locked in traditional financial systems, Grossman said he texted Galaxy’s Mike Novogratz, and after a brief conversation, a loan was agreed upon and underway, forcing MoonPay’s teams to scramble on paperwork while verifying it had the funds to pay back a loan thanks to a connection through BlackRock. But the $100 million wasn’t enough. As demand continued to surge for TRUMP the following day, Grossman said that MoonPay turned to Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse. “We underestimated the demand of this Trump token,” the MoonPay team told Garlinghouse, per Grossman. The Ripple chief agreed to help if MoonPay could get Novogratz to agree to the arrangement, given the previous deal in place—and ultimately, Grossman said, the additional $60 million was sent by Ripple to Galaxy, and then ultimately transferred to MoonPay. As traditional financial players came online in Europe and the United States on the following Monday and Tuesday, MoonPay was able to reestablish access to its funds, paying back its loans in full by Tuesday afternoon according to Grossman. The TRUMP token saw more than $20 billion in trading volume on average across its first five days after launch, according to data from CoinGecko, growing quickly to a fully diluted valuation of more than $73 billion in less than 48 hours. In the days after its launch, Trump’s meme coin gained spot listings from notable centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, further aiding the ability for inexperienced users to gain access to the token. A MoonPay representative confirmed to Decrypt that Grossman’s telling of the situation was accurate, though representatives from Galaxy and Ripple did not immediately reply to Decrypt’s requests for comment. TRUMP is now trading at $15.37, down more than 79% from its all time high.

Title: Dave Portnoy Holds Millions In Bitcoin And XRP, But Here's Why He Concluded His Heart Is 'Too Big For This Space'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy is doubling down on his commitment to the meme coin Stool Prisondente (CRYPTO: JAILSTOOL), even as traders question its future. What Happened: Portnoy, who initially invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the token, insists he remains committed, despite the coin's struggles. In an X post Monday evening, he emphasized his dedication, saying, “The fact I'm still putting my own money into #Jailstool cause I don't want people losing money shows that my heart is too big for this stupid space. I need a blacker heart. Rise #Jailstool rise.” His statement comes after scrutiny from crypto traders, some of whom argue that Jailstool's decline has hurt retail investors. Don't Miss: Coinbase’s latest promo gets you up to $200 in crypto (Seriously!) — Here's everything you need to know to take advantage of this offer. ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. However, Portnoy maintains he's stayed true to his word, refusing to take early profits and continuing to support the project. "I put 100's of thousands of my own money into #Jailstool and promised up to 1 million more as it grew," Portnoy wrote in another post. "I coulda cashed out for 6 million. I didn't. But I'm not just gonna promote forever for free while sharks eat Minos. I've done exactly what I promised to do like I always do. 100% transparent." The price of Jailstool crashed around 82% on Monday evening European time to 2 cents, after making a high of 21 cents a day earlier, according to CoinGecko data. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Why It Matters: Portnoy's approach has divided the crypto community. Some traders see his investment as a genuine attempt to back the community, while others remain skeptical about his long-term credibility in the space. Crypto analyst Stats said that Jailstool has nearly returned to its pre-promotion price, raising concerns about the effectiveness of Portnoy's marketing. "His marketing plays didn’t work out. People lost real money (which is 100% their own fault). But I think his credibility in this space is pretty ruined," he wrote. Others, like Kaleo, speculated that Portnoy might keep investing in Jailstool to try and stabilize its price. "With how much he’s talked about ‘not even thinking of selling this until it hits >$500M,' feels like there’s a solid chance he lets his pride get the best of him," Kaleo tweeted, predicting that if Portnoy loses money, he'll turn against meme coins altogether. See Also: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Despite the backlash, Portnoy remains a major investor in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), recently revealing that he holds $1.5 million in Bitcoin and $1.3 million in XRP. His Bitcoin investment followed a conversation with Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) chairman Michael Saylor, who convinced him of Bitcoin's long-term value. During their interview, Saylor explained Bitcoin through sports analogies, saying, "Satoshi created a game that is rigged in favor of the individual... Bitcoin is that game." Portnoy, once a skeptic, has since embraced Bitcoin, stating, "I’m gonna bet it and set it, not trading." However, his latest Jailstool debacle has reignited doubts about his role in crypto, with many traders now questioning whether he should be taken seriously in the space.

Title: Bitcoin Reserve proposal: Florida and North Carolina eye crypto for state treasuries

Florida and North Carolina lead U.S. states in Bitcoin adoption with Senate Bill 550. Lawmakers aim to allocate public funds into Bitcoin. As discussions about a Strategic Bitcoin [BTC] Reserve gain traction in the U.S., several states are already exploring ways to integrate Bitcoin into their financial systems. Florida is emerging as a frontrunner, with lawmakers advancing Senate Bill 550, aimed at incorporating Bitcoin into the state’s public investment strategy. Introduced by Senator Joe Gruters, the bill seeks to authorize Florida to allocate up to 10% of specific public funds into Bitcoin. This positions Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a means of increasing financial autonomy. The Florida Bill SB 550 proposal noted, “Throughout its history, Bitcoin has greatly risen in value and is becoming more widely accepted as an international medium of exchange, and countries around the world, including the United States, hold Bitcoin within their treasury departments […] The bill further noted, Bitcoin is viewed as a hedge against inflation by sovereign nations and prominent investment advisors, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton […] The state should have access to tools such as Bitcoin to protect against inflation.” If enacted, the legislation would empower the state’s Chief Financial Officer to manage Bitcoin holdings through qualified custodians, exchange-traded products, or direct ownership. Beyond its potential economic benefits, the initiative signals a broader shift toward Bitcoin adoption at the state level, reinforcing its role as a viable asset. Florida isn’t alone in its Bitcoin push, as interest in cryptocurrency adoption is growing beyond U.S. borders. North Carolina and South Dakota are also actively exploring Bitcoin investments, joining a growing list of states considering digital asset reserves. In North Carolina, the House Speaker’s staff recently engaged with industry advocate Dan Spuller, who asserted that the state aims to secure the “top spot” in Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, South Dakota Representative Logan Manhart is pushing for legislative action, emphasizing that “now is one of the few chances government has at being proactive.” Hence, with at least 18 states currently assessing Bitcoin investments, the momentum for state-level adoption of cryptocurrency continues to build. That being said, a recent Reuters report highlights a surge in crypto usage across South America, particularly in Brazil, where digital assets are playing an increasingly prominent role in financial transactions. Gabriel Galipolo, Brazil’s Central Bank Chief, noted that the country has witnessed a significant rise in cryptocurrency adoption over the past three years, with stablecoins emerging as the preferred choice for payments. While this reflects a shift toward decentralized financial systems, it also raises concerns among regulators regarding oversight and financial stability. Speaking at an event in Mexico City, Galipolo emphasized the need for a balanced regulatory framework to address these challenges while fostering innovation in the digital asset space. He said, “Most of that is to buy things and to shop things from abroad. [This] maintains some kind of opaque vision for taxation or for money laundering.” Thus, as the momentum for state-backed Bitcoin reserves gains traction, Utah is emerging as one of the top states in passing formal legislation on the matter. In fact, Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, recently suggested that Utah could be the first state to successfully implement such a policy. Additionally, in a discussion with “Simply Bitcoin” and Senator Cynthia Lummis, Porter revealed that 11 states have already introduced bills to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves, with expectations that this number could rise to 15 by year-end. This growing interest underscores a broader shift toward Bitcoin’s role in state financial strategies, signaling a potential wave of adoption that could reshape traditional investment models across the U.S. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Ireland head coach Scott Bemand has named a 40-player extended squad ahead of the 2025 Women’s Six Nations which gets under way next month. Ireland will kick-off their Championship in Belfast on March 22nd, hosting France at Kingspan Stadium. Bemand has included eight uncapped players in the squad, including Sophie Barett, Jane Neill, Beth Buttimer and Jane Clohessy who impressed for the Ireland under-20s last season. Making the jump to senior from the Ireland under-18s panel is Alma Atagamen, while Amy Larn, Katie Heffernan and Caitriona Finn round out the uncapped contingent. Last season’s co-captain Sam Monaghan misses out through injury. “We’re delighted to select a really strong blend of 40 players to assemble and prepare for the start of the Guinness Women’s Six Nations, while also building towards Rugby World Cup 2025,” said Bemand, announcing the squad on Tuesday. “We’ll come together in Dublin next Monday and reconnect as a group, laying the foundations for the opportunities ahead. “Following on from successes during the WXV1 campaign in Vancouver, we have been impressed by the hard work and application of the players as they have returned to club action in recent months. “The focus and determination of players as they’ve attacked Celtic Challenge training with the Clovers and Wolfhounds has been particularly pleasing, and a number of players have earned their opportunity in National Camp off the back of those performances as we grow our wave. “We showed positive growth and evolution over the course of 2024 and the group are excited to get back in together to continue that work as we look towards the opening game against France in Belfast, which will provide a big challenge for us but we’re relishing the opportunity to perform in green while taking the home support along with us.” Forwards (22): Alma Atagamen (Balbriggan RFC)* Aoife Wafer (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster) Beth Buttimer (UL Bohemian RFC)* Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster) Christy Haney (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster) Claire Boles (Railway Union RFC/Ulster) Cliodhna Moloney (Exeter Chiefs) Deirbhile Nic a Bháird (Old Belvedere RFC/Munster) Dorothy Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster) Edel McMahon (Exeter Chiefs/Connacht) Erin King (Old Belvedere RFC) Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster) Grace Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby) Jane Clohessy (UL Bohemian RFC/Munster)* Jane Neill (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster)* Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Neve Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury) Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Ruth Campbell (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Sadhbh McGrath (Cooke RFC/Ulster) Siobhán McCarthy (Worcester Warriors/Munster) Sophie Barrett (Railway Union RFC/Ulster)* Backs (18): Amee-Leigh Costigan (Railway Union RFC/Munster) Amy Larn (Athy RFC)* Anna McGann (Railway Union RFC) Aoibheann Reilly (Blackrock College RFC/Connacht) Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College RFC/Connacht) Caitríona Finn (UL Bohemian RFC/Munster)* Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Emily Lane (Blackrock College RFC) Enya Breen (Blackrock College RFC/Munster) Eve Higgins (Railway Union RFC) Katie Corrigan (Old Belvedere RFC) Katie Heffernan (Railway Union RFC/Leinster)* Méabh Deely (Blackrock College RFC/Connacht) Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Leinster) Nicole Fowley (Galwegians RFC/Connacht) Stacey Flood (Railway Union RFC) Vicky Elmes Kinlan (Wicklow RFC) *uncapped players March 22nd: Ireland v France, Kingspan Stadium, Belfast – 1pm March 30th: Italy v Ireland, Stadio Sergio Lanfrachi, Parma – 3pm April 12th: Ireland v England, Virgin Media Park, Cork – 4.45pm April 20th: Wales v Ireland, Rodney Parade, Newport – 3pm April 26th: Scotland v Ireland, Hive Stadium, Edinburgh – 12.15pm Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Who Owns the World? The Boom-Bust Bailout Process that Placed Nations in Debt

There are systemic aspects about the banking, monetary, and economic system that are not taught in the schools and universities of the world and are rarely discussed on corporate owned news and media networks. Knowledge of these aspects is absolutely essential for everyone in the world that wishes to understand how the economic world ‘actually’ works and how worldwide society has been brought to the brink of financial ruin (currently almost all governments of the world are in vast debt) while the vast resources of human productivity and of nature are continually exploited by a small group of people that control these systems. See also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. This article explores: Without GDP growth the (privately owned) debt-money banking system fails. The real reason governments prioritise GDP growth is so that sufficient tax monies can be collected so that interest can be paid to the international banking system. Governments often maintain that the ultimate purpose of economic GDP growth is in fact to improve wellbeing. This is not in fact so. John Jopling (RIP) of the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability wrote in 2003: “The real reason why governments regard growth as desirable is that, with a debt-based money system, if the economy does not grow, it collapses. This is something all politicians are naturally and rightly extremely keen to avoid. Growth is an absolute imperative imposed on governments by the nature of the current money system. Thus, it is in the nature of the money system, not the choice of government, that growth must be maintained.”[1] Governments are buried under the lie, they do not admit or have the awareness that the need for GDP growth is imposed by the debt-money system controlled by private banks nor that the creation of debt money by private banks is unnecessary and is against the public interest (because governments could create and issue debt-free money themselves as has been done in the past). It is rarely acknowledged by politicians that the main reason for the constant drive for GDP growth is to pay interest to the banking system. The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability has stated: “The way in which the global economic system is designed automatically ensures that the economy operates in such a way that: a. inequality is bound to increase, b. the economy is unstable and c. the economy is blind to the limits of natural resources and the need for humanity to live in symbiosis with the rest of the natural world.” – The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainabilit[2] GDP growth is prioritised by governments and debt-money is the basis of the banking system – yet both are significant drivers of environmental degradation, resource depletion, and social inequity. A government prioritises growth, yet whether it is ‘good’ growth or ‘bad’ growth is not the focus (good growth would not impact on environmental and social resilience.) The pseudo-science of neo-classical economics (that all governments adhere to) proposes that increased GDP growth can reduce pollution in what is called the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). This EKC argument is false. The EKC posits that pollution increases with economic growth in the early stages of development and that beyond a certain level of development the trend reverses, and economic growth improves environmental conditions by creating the resources to do so. However, the EKC has never been validated. Vastly excessive consumerism has been required to keep the system from derailing. The debt-money system increases and reduces the availability credit at will often creating ‘boom, bust and bailout’ cycles – this means that the economic system is unstable by nature. If sufficient loans are not repaid to a commercial bank it will become insolvent. This has happened in many countries, for example in various countries in Europe during the banking crisis of 2008. . The collapse of Lehman Brothers (headquarters pictured), the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, on September 15, 2008, is often considered the climax of the 2008 financial crisis. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . [Aside: Bear in mind that these private banks never held the original monies in the first place, and, the cruel bait and switch is that it is actually the people that are the grantors of credit when they sign a mortgage or loan (a promise to pay), however, the bank typically never pays back the grantor of the credit. Including interest one typically pays the bank about twice the amount of the loan or mortgage. Yet, the bank does not pay equity for that promissory note, and presumes that we have abandoned our securities]. Typically a national government then intervenes to bail out those commercial banks, being under pressure to do so from the international banking system. Furthermore, by controlling the availability of credit the private banking cartel created boom-bust-bailout cycles, at will, which placed nations in further debt. For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) exerted pressure on the Irish government to bail out private banks and unsecured bondholders in 2010. In 2012 RTE, Ireland’s National Television Service reported that the ECB informed an Irish Government Minister that “a bomb will go off in Dublin” if Anglo bondholders are not paid. “He [Minister for Transport and Tourism, Leo Varadkar] said that the Troika told the Government that “we don’t want you to default on these payments, it is your decision ultimately but a bomb will go off; and the bomb will go off in Dublin and not in Frankfurt.” – RTE reporting Minister Varadkar’s comments 22nd January 2012. [Note: The Troika is a term used to describe the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).] Furthermore, a letter was sent by the ECB to pressure the Irish Government to accept a bailout. In that letter then ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet told Ireland in November 2010 that it would not extend further emergency funding to the country’s banks if Dublin did not sign up to a bailout, according to the letter which was finally released after years of lobbying. The so-called global banking crises of 2008 represented an opportunity for a re-evaluation of the values that our banking system and economic system are based on. Moreover, it represented an ideal opportunity for transition toward a more sustainable, resilient, just, and, perhaps even, a more ethical society. Alas, this opportunity was spurned, and almost all governments bailed out the banks. This results in increased taxes, national austerity measures and/or the privatisation of national assets due to conditionalities on credit. For example, in Ireland the government must pay around €6 billion to €10 billion per annum in interest on the national debt of €235 billon[3] – a significant portion of this debt (€85 billion) was incurred due to bailing out private commercial banks in Ireland in 2008[4]. To understand the magnitude of this debt if you convert into U.S. dollars and lay $1 bills on top of each other they would make a pile 28,581 km, or 17,760 miles high. These debts will never be fully repaid and the annual interest payments alone are, in effect, a never-ending shackle of debt servitude and a form of slavery for the Irish people. Similar bailout situations have occurred in many other countries worldwide. “There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt.” – U.S. President John Adams The banking system can and does control the availability of credit (i.e., debt-money loans). It can expand or contract the availability of credit in a nation or worldwide. Over the past decades the more credit that is available the more an economy is likely to grow (there are also other factors including the availability of a cheap energy source, such as oil). When the availability of credit is contracted/reduced by the banking system the money supply shrinks, the availability of money to repay loans plus interest is reduced, foreclosures begin to occur and the economy may start to shrink rather than grow. This expansion and contraction of credit is known as the business cycle. “The fact that the necessary growth can be achieved only by increasing the total level of debt makes the economy heavily dependent on confidence… The economy therefore constantly moves between boom and bust; it is systemically unstable.” – John Joplin and Roy Madron, authors of ‘Gaian Democracies’[5] “The bankrupt country must borrow from international banks and the IMF, which impose a condition of debt relief that the national government may not issue its own money. If the government tries to protect its resources or its banks by nationalizing them for the benefit of its own citizens, it is branded communist, socialist or terrorist and is replaced by one that is friendlier to free enterprise.” – E.H. Brown, Author of the book ‘The Web of Debt’ Author Bob Djurdjevic associates these cycles, which have been experienced by many countries, to what he calls the Wall Street dominated New World Order terrorists: “The Wall Street dominated New World Order (NWO) Empire is being built by colonizing other countries with foreign loans or investments. When the fish is firmly on the hook, the NWO financial terrorists pull the plug, leaving the unsuspecting victim high and dry. And begging to be rescued. In comes the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Its bailout recipes – privatisation, trade, liberalization and other austerity reforms – amount to seizing the target countries’ natural resources, and turning them over to the NWO elites – just as surely as the British Empire did by using cruder methods.” – Bob Djurdjevic, Chronicles Journal[6] The boom-bust-bailout process can be summarised, as follows: Many people’s perceptions are that social programs are targeted to assist poorer people lower down the socio-economic scale. However, the 2008 banking crisis in Europe and the U.S. was a clear example of socialism for the banks and extremely wealthy bondholders. The failing banks that were reckless with their lending and investment practices still got “rewarded” with vast quantities of government bailout monies because they were regarded as “too big to fail”. The attempted justification for such bailouts is that it is in the people’s interests that the banks are kept alive. However, in reality it is the working-class and middle-class tax-payers that are typically forced to shoulder the disproportionate brunt of the bailout, which is in effect a huge transfer of people’s labour and money to the already mega-wealthy bondholders and private owners of the banks. In summary, a private-banking cartel has been able to create booms and busts and drive nations into bankruptcy and bailout using the Problem, Reaction, Solution approach or the Hegelian Dialectic. The reality of this flawed monetary system became apparent to many millions of people in 2008 when the so-called banking crises hit in the U.S. and in Europe. As usual, it was the people that were forced to pay for the debts of privately owned banks. In Ireland, the debts of the private banks were the controversially guaranteed by the Irish government, thereby placing the debt burdens onto the Irish citizens. According to a poll by the Irish Independent in 2010 a substantial majority of the Irish people wanted the State to default on debts to bondholders (See endnote 38). Furthermore, as I noted in a blog in 2010 [7] the people of Ireland did not agree to the use of billions of their monies being used to bail out privately owned banks. There was no national referendum on the issue. The bailout of the private banks by the Irish government prompted much public anger, yet, the mainstream media in Ireland appeared to be generally aligned with the government narrative. A number of commentators and bloggers had criticised the government’s bailout plans to no avail. For example, the following is an extract from an article titled “We must face down the jackals who control the international banking system to save our nation and protect our children’s future” by Robert Pye, a former Irish Department of Finance Analyst: “THERE IS considerable truth in the view that Ireland is no longer a sovereign state but an impoverished suburb of Brussels. Four million people are mired deep in a collective debt that is not of their own making… They call us PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) because that is what you do with a pig: tie him upside down, slit his throat and drain him dry. Well, I for one reject this disgusting epithet. I also reject utterly the despicable arrogance with which this country is being treated, and the servile ineptitude of those who pose as our leaders. Unless we take a stand and defend our sovereignty, our integrity and our children, we will be destroyed as a nation.”[8] Richard Douthwaite (1942 – 2011) an economist and writer, wrote a relevant article in relation to the planned bailout in Ireland titled “Bailout talks: four truths Ireland can’t ignore”[9]. The following is an extract: “Ireland’s negotiations with the ECB and the IMF are perhaps the most important talks that this country has engaged in… If Ireland has to pay interest on the loans being negotiated at a rate which exceeds the rate at which the economy grows over the next few years, it will make the country’s situation worse, not better… The ECB bears a large share of the responsibility for the regulatory failure which led to the property bubble… There is a Plan B. Ireland doesn’t have to take anything that is offered. It can leave the euro quickly and easily… If the deal offered by the ECB/IMF negotiators is unsatisfactory, the Irish government can simply announce… a new currency… and all wages, rents, debts and other payments are to be paid in harp with immediate effect… After the announcement the government would issue itself with the new currency on a debt-free basis so that it no longer needed to borrow to cover its budget deficit… Ireland has no alternative but to renege on the guarantees and to build itself a future within the EU but outside the eurozone.” An article on broadsheet.ie in 2010 titled “The Senior Bondholders: An Analysis”[10] provided an analysis of who the bondholders actually were that were benefitting from the Irish tax-payer funded government bailout of privately owned insolvent banks. Many of the bondholders were privately held banks “mostly” owned by extremely wealthy individuals. An extract from the article is as follow: “SO…. on one side we have Ireland whose bond holders, its people, have between them a total GDP wealth of 0.207 trillion euros. Who are being FORCED, against their will, to pay Anglo Irish bank’s debts to its bond holders, who between them hold 20.8 Trillion euros. The people of Ireland are paying to, and protecting the wealth and power of, people who have 100 times more wealth!… So who are they? Well many of the bond holders are privately held banks, which list their activities as asset management for off-shore, non-resident and high value individuals.” The following is also a relevant excerpt from an article[11] written by author and blogger Charles Hugh Smith in November 2010 that summarises the situation and the opportunity Ireland had to dis-empower “the vampire banks” which had the world by the throat: “When a nation such as Ireland is running a State deficit equal to 32% of GDP, austerity cannot generate the stupendous surpluses needed to make good the vast sums which are already lost… Ireland, and indeed the world, will survive if all the vampire banks are liquidated. That is the end-state, and “buying time” just increases the misery of the citizens who have been yoked to save their “betters.” Ireland, please drive a stake through the heart of the vampire banks which have the world by the throat. By defaulting, you would be doing the world (and your own nation) an immense favor.” The following extract from a wiki project[12] describes the different responses to the debts of private banks in Iceland and Ireland. Iceland is an interesting example of how a country can stand up against the IMF. “The “Icelandic Solution” involved repudiation. Private banks were allowed to fail and social security measures for the poor and indebted were increased… The UK went so far as to trigger anti-terrorism legislation against Icelandic banks in a bid to pressure Iceland to pay out claims against its private banks… Self-interested bankers are therefore often desperate to avoid government debt default, and generally much prefer an economy to be strangled by debt rather than be freed of it… The Irish government on the other hand, guaranteed private bank debt and in doing so subjected the taxpayers of that country to decades of payments for debts that were not incurred on their behalf or for their benefit. This could be interpreted as theft through the taxing of future generations tomorrow to pay off creditors of private bankers today. Many commentators have observed that in 2010. Iceland recovered much faster than other countries such as Ireland.” When you get a mortgage, loan, or a credit card, the debt money is created out of thin air when you sign on the dotted line of the contract, yet you will have to work (maybe for years) to generate the money to pay back to the bank plus interest – in essence, this is a form of slavery as the bank never had the money in the first place. Income tax monies collected by governments from the people is one of the methods used to service the debt governments owe to the international finance system, money that was originally created entirely from nothing by privately-owned mega-banks. “Federal income tax was instituted specifically to coerce taxpayers to pay the interest due to the banks on the federal debt. If the money supply had been created by the government rather than borrowed from the banks that created it, the income tax would have been unnecessary. … There is a way out of this morass. The early American colonists found it and so did Abraham Lincoln and some other national leaders: the government can take back the money-issuing power from the banks. “ – Ellen Brown, Author of the book ‘The Web of Debt’ “Between usury and taxes the consumer is really played for a sucker. God’s law permits no property tax for it is discriminatory… It discourages stability and brings about a shifting, irresponsible citizenry with no ties to the land. Under our present system, accident, sickness, or old age easily dispossesses a man of his home but in no way reduces his expense….” – Dr. Franklin Snook, Author of America Needs the Divine Law Over decades the power to create debt-money has resulted in the power to own, control and manipulate the assets of the material world, as well media and politics. Those that control the money creation process wield the power to control the corporate media and own the material world, regardless of which political party is elected, or which system is utilised (capitalism, socialism, communism, etc). This mean that many aspects of our lives are in reality controlled from a moneyed source not from a democratic source. This power grab was achieved not by creating more value, but by fully controlling the source of money and the world of finance. A pyramid of control has existed. The higher up you go the closer you get to the source of money creation. At the bottom level we are all going about our daily lives. At the next level up are governments. These are people who are given a monopoly on force and use it to tax and control the population whether or not we agree. The election of new government leaders via representative democracy is an illusion of people power. The vast regulatory systems of government in essence never change. But who controls the governments? It is not the people of the nations that control governments, this is evidenced by the banking bailouts in Europe after 2008. There was no referendum on the subject, the governments simply complied with the wishes of international private banking corporations. At the next level up are the mega corporations and at the next level beyond the corporations is the privately owned worldwide banking cartel. Over decades the mega-corporations have acquired the world’s resources and controlled the markets. To do so they needed access to cheap money. The mega corporations got their loans at special rates from the mega banks. We can conclude that those who control the mega banks ultimately control the mega corporations. “Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.. when you realise that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.“ – James Garfield (20th President of the U.S. – assassinated 1881). “The … bankers rule the world through debt, which is money they create out of nothing. They need world government to ensure no country defaults or tries to overthrow them. As long as private bankers, instead of governments, create money the human race is doomed. These bankers and their allies have bought everything and everyone.” – Henry Makow, Author Also note the comments of Congressman Charles McFadden, Chairman, House Banking and Currency Committee, June 10, 1932: “Some people think the Federal Reserve Banks are U.S. governments institutions. They are not… they are private credit monopolies which prey upon the people of the U.S. for the benefit of themselves and their foreign and domestic swindlers, and rich and predatory money lenders… These twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully foisted upon this Country by the bankers who came here from Europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our American Institutions… The sack of the United States by the FED is the greatest crime in history. Every effort has been made by the FED to conceal its powers, but the truth is the FED has usurped the government. It controls everything here and it controls all foreign relations. It makes and breaks governments at will.” – Congressman Charles McFadden. The major shareholders in the commercial banks are other banks and asset management companies and trusts. For example, asset management company Blackrock has large shareholdings in mega-banks Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase and other banks[13], yet those same banks have major shareholdings in Blackrock. The list of shareholders is diversified amongst various privately owned financial and asset management corporations. In essence, all these various financial entities are interlocked and own each other – the current dominant worldwide privately owned financial orthodoxy is one large self-reinforcing entity under the tentacles of many financial corporations. A study[14] was conducted at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, on the relationships between 37 million companies and investors worldwide, and there is a ‘super-entity’ of just 147 tightly knit mega-corporations that controls 40 percent of the entire global economy. and all of their ownership was held by other members of the super-entity. According to James B. Glattfelder, one of the authors of the study: “In effect, less than 1 per cent of the companies were able to control 40 per cent of the entire network,” Most were financial institutions and included Barclays Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and The Goldman Sachs Group. The dominant players appear to be the banking families that have been operating private banking for generations. The involvement of certain banking families in private banking for generations is mentioned in books including ‘The Web of Debt’ by Ellen Brown, chair of the U.S. Public Banking Institute. Families that are often mentioned in relation to the banking industry include the Rothschild banking dynasty[15] (associated with US Trust owned by Bank of America), The Rockefeller world business empire (associated with Citigroup), the Schiff’s, the Morgan’s[16] (associated with Morgan Stanley, etc.), and the Warburg’s. Author Dean Henderson writes in an article[17]: “The Four Horsemen of Banking (Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo)… According to company 10K filings to the SEC, the Four Horsemen of Banking are among the top ten stock holders of virtually every Fortune 500 corporation… One important repository for the wealth of the global oligarchy that owns these bank holding companies is US Trust Corporation – founded in 1853 and now owned by Bank of America. A recent US Trust Corporate Director and Honorary Trustee was Walter Rothschild… [18]” Furthermore, according to Ellen Brown, chairperson of the Public Banking Institute in the U.S. asset management companies, such as Blackrock, literally own much of the U.S. and the world. She states: “BlackRock has a controlling interest in all the major corporations in the S&P 500, it professes not to “own” the funds. It just acts as a kind of “custodian” for its investors — or so it claims. But BlackRock and the other Big 3 ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) vote the corporations’ shares; so from the point of view of management, they are the owners. And as observed in a 2017 article from the University of Amsterdam titled “These Three Firms Own Corporate America” they vote 90% of the time in favor of management.”[19] In a 2018 review titled “Blackrock – The Company That Owns the World’[20], a multinational research group called Investigate Europe concluded that BlackRock “undermines competition through owning shares in competing companies”. The major shareholders of Blackrock are all mega-banks and financial corporations, such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citi Group, Wells Fargo and Company, Morgan Stanley, and other various other banks[21]. So, privately owned commercial banks own Blackrock and the other major asset management companies that own most of the world. Author Karen Hudes, who worked in the legal department of the World Bank for more than 20 years, has cited the above Swiss study during an interview with the New American[22] pointing, out that a small group of entities, mostly financial institutions and especially central banks, exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. According to Hudes “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” and that “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. According to Hudes, the power grabbers also dominate the organizations that control the creation and flow of money worldwide and control the finances of virtually every nation in the world. These organizations include The World Bank, the IMF and central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, all of which are unelected and unaccountable. Author E.H. Brown states that: “Secrecy has been maintained because the robber barons have been able to use their monopoly over money to buy up major media, educational institutions, and other outlets of public information. While Rockefeller was buying up universities, medical schools, and the Encyclopedia Britannica, Morgan bought up newspapers… By 1983,.. fifty corporations owned half or more of the media business.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) - Air-taxi maker Archer Aviation said on Tuesday it has raised $300 million in a funding round that consisted of institutional investors including accounts managed by BlackRock. Archer expects the capital raise to help it accelerate the development of its hybrid aircraft platform and further reinforce its balance sheet. "We are raising additional capital to help us invest in critical capabilities like composites and batteries to help enable us to capture this opportunity and more," CEO Adam Goldstein said. The additional capital brings Archer's total liquidity to about $1 billion currently, the company said on Tuesday. The company's statement did not disclose the valuation at which the new capital was raised. The latest fundraising comes amid a cash crunch in the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) industry, driven by technological and regulatory challenges. However, analysts believe Archer is well positioned to endure these difficulties and achieve certification. The company previously raised $430 million in December through an equity offering that had defense technology company Anduril and existing investors such as United Airlines and Stellantis, as well as new backers such as Wellington Management and Abu Dhabi investment holding company 2PointZero, participate in the fundraising. Santa Clara, California-based Archer said in its preliminary fourth-quarter results that its adjusted operating expenses were in line with its forecast range of $95 million to $110 million. It also said it does not expect its total adjusted operating expenses for the first quarter of 2025 to materially increase above its Q4 guided range.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Escalating geopolitical tensions and a new administration with a hawkish defense agenda have led many startups to embrace dual-use strategies to secure revenue through military applications. It’s a trend that is already heating up in aerospace. Take Archer Aviation, a California-based startup building eVTOLs (electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles). Until very recently, Archer’s go-to-market strategy was an air taxi network across several cities in the U.S. and abroad. Archer’s focus is now more acutely on defense, and it has attracted fresh capital to further that mission. The company, which went public in September 2021 via a special purpose acquisition merger (SPAC), on Tuesday announced a $300 million equity raise from institutional investors like BlackRock and Wellington. The raise brings Archer’s total funding to around $3.36 billion. This fresh capital comes off the back of a $430 million round in December to fund its new Archer Defense program. As part of that program, Archer signed an exclusive deal with weapons manufacturer Anduril to jointly develop a hybrid gas-and-electric-powered VTOL aircraft for critical defense applications. Together, the two are targeting a program of record from the Department of Defense, which is a budgeted acquisition program with guaranteed funding over a set period. “As we dug into the work we were doing on the defense front, we realized that the market was a lot larger than we initially expected, both in terms of scope as well as timing,” Nikhil Goel, Archer’s chief commercial officer, told TechCrunch. “We’re the only company in the space that I think is targeting a sizable defense program of record,” Goel continued. “So we really want to be strategic with the investments we’re making and go full steam ahead on this.” Rivals in the space like Joby Aviation and Beta Technologies also have military contracts to test their aircraft for surveillance, logistics, and reconnaissance missions. Archer has such contracts with the military, but what it’s chasing now via the program of record is guaranteed funding, a path to scale, and a serious competitive moat. Goel confirmed that the $300 million from investors will mainly be used to accelerate the work Archer is doing with Anduril to build a hybrid craft (VTOL), though he didn’t share any updates on the company’s bid with the DOD. Archer’s decision comes at a moment of industry momentum. The Trump administration has vowed to “rapidly field emerging technologies” like AI, drones, and counter-drone systems to modernize the military. The very qualities that make eVTOLs perfect for urban and regional flight are also attractive for defense use cases. Cruising at 300 feet, Archer Aviation’s electric aircraft, Midnight, makes less noise than a passing car on the highway. In an urban environment, it blends into other transportation sounds in a way that helicopters cannot. “The sound profile is why we are so well positioned to [build aircraft] for defense,” Goel said. “If you look at the traditional helicopters that the defense industry uses, they’re very loud and have very noticeable heat signatures. And so that makes helicopters not a great fit for more discreet missions.” Archer’s Midnight is built with 12 sets of engines and propellers – six in the front, six in the back. That distributed propulsion among smaller rotors that spin slightly slower — rather than a single large main rotor and tail rotor that operate at high speeds — creates much less noise. VTOLs are also designed to transition from a vertical lift to a winged horizontal flight like an airplane. When in forward flight, the Midnight generates all the lift from the wing, rather than from downward thrust, which also reduces overall rotor noise, Archer’s CEO and founder Adam Goldstein told TechCrunch during a recent flight demonstration. While Archer is gunning to supply the defense industry with aircraft, the company still intends to launch its first limited commercial air taxi network in late 2025 in the United Arab Emirates. In 2026, Archer says it will expand air taxi services to several other cities and countries, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, South Korea, and India. The company has partnered with major airlines to facilitate air taxi networks like United, Southwest, and IndiGo. In November 2024, a joint venture from Japan Airlines and Sumitomo conditionally agreed to purchase up to $500 million worth of electric aircraft from Archer. But 2026 isn’t that far away, and Archer has pushed out its timelines before. That’s partly because Archer is still working toward validating the safety of its eVTOLs and securing the necessary certification from the Federal Aviation Administration. In the U.S., eVTOL companies need to secure type certification to approve the design of an aircraft, production certification to prove they can mass-produce a vehicle that meets its approved design, and airworthiness certification to ensure an aircraft is safe for flying. Goel says Archer is far along in the process for those certifications but has yet to receive any of them. Nor has Archer flown with a pilot in its aircraft yet, which is a necessary step toward testing the aircraft with passengers. He adds that Archer will put a pilot in one of its Midnights “imminently.” The process of certifying aircraft and scaling production is an expensive one. Construction on Archer’s Georgia factory, built with its strategic investor, Stellantis, is nearly complete, with production expected to begin this quarter. Archer hopes to build 650 aircraft annually by 2030. For this year, though, Archer’s goal is to produce eight to 10 aircraft between the Georgia facility and its prototype facility in California. Goldstein told TechCrunch back in October that most of the capital expenditures to get the factory up and running have already been spent, so the focus is on scaling Midnight eVTOLs while also developing the hybrid defense aircraft. Today’s raise brings Archer’s total liquidity to well over $1 billion, extending its runway for “multiple years” through commercialization and the initial phases of defense work, according to Goel. Archer has yet to share its 2024 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings, but the company’s total operating expenses hit $385 million in the first three quarters of the year, or $281 million on an adjusted basis. Archer anticipated adjusted operating expenses for Q4 to be between $95 million and $110 million. It’s not yet clear how much Archer’s development of a hybrid aircraft for warfare will increase the company’s expenses.

UPDATED 08:30 EST / FEBRUARY 11 2025 by Duncan Riley Electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. announced today that it has raised $300 million in new funding via an equity capital raise. The $300 million in funding, raised through a securities purchase agreement, came from Blackrock Inc. and other leading institutional investors. The funding will be used to strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow the company to accelerate the development of its hybrid aircraft platform, particularly for defense applications. While perhaps better known for its attempts to bring a flying taxi to market — which it is still pursuing — Archer has more recently shifted much of its focus to the defense sector. The company announced that it had signed a partnership with Anduril Industries Inc., a startup active in the defense sector, in December, alongside an announcement that it had raised $430 million to develop military aircraft. Archer’s main offering, be it one still under development, is an electric flying taxi dubbed Midnight. The aircraft offers vertical takeoff and landing and is powered by propellers that can cover up to 100 miles per trip at a top speed of 150 miles per hour. Notably, Archer signed a $142 million contract to deliver six Midnights to the U.S. Air Force in July 2023. The aircraft, which can carry approximately 1,000-pound payloads, offers the U.S. military a rapid response aircraft with effectiveness across a wide range of mission profiles, from personnel transport and logistics support to rescue operations and more. As part of its shift into defense, Archer also launched a dedicated unit, Archer Defense, to develop next-generation aircraft for defense applications. The first product from the division is planned to be a hybrid-propulsion vertical-take-off-and landing aircraft. The proceeds from the equity raise today are planned to be used for the development of next-generation aircraft manufacturing capabilities related to the new aircraft, including batteries and composites, with the remainder of the funding going for general corporate purposes. “The opportunity for advanced vertical lift aircraft across defense appears to be substantially larger than I originally expected,” said Archer founder and Chief Executive Adam Goldstein. “As a result, we are raising additional capital to help us invest in critical capabilities like composites and batteries to capture this opportunity and more.” THANK YOU Archer Aviation raises $300M from Blackrock to expand defense sector focus F5 targets AI-era IT challenges with ADC 3.0 reference architectures Cisco embeds security services in new line of programmable switches Amplitude integrates in-app surveys into its behavioral analysis platform Consortium led by Elon Musk makes $97.4B offer for OpenAI NXP buys Kinara for $307M to power AI workloads at the network edge Archer Aviation raises $300M from Blackrock to expand defense sector focus EMERGING TECH - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 1 MIN AGO F5 targets AI-era IT challenges with ADC 3.0 reference architectures AI - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 2 HOURS AGO Cisco embeds security services in new line of programmable switches INFRA - BY PAUL GILLIN . 5 HOURS AGO Amplitude integrates in-app surveys into its behavioral analysis platform AI - BY PAUL GILLIN . 8 HOURS AGO Consortium led by Elon Musk makes $97.4B offer for OpenAI AI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 14 HOURS AGO NXP buys Kinara for $307M to power AI workloads at the network edge AI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 14 HOURS AGO

Pushing for an end to the nearly three-year war with Russia, Trump discussed the conflict in an interview with broadcaster Fox News that aired yesterday. "They may make a deal, they may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,” he said. Trump also emphasised reaping a return on investment with US aid to Ukraine, suggesting a trade for Kyiv’s natural resources, such as rare minerals. (Excerpt) Read more at malaymail.com ...

We spend our precious resources taking on the rest of the planet while countries like China and others focus on their own and not take on the rest of the world. Why do they have better math and science education systems and challenge the world with better products and production capabilities -- while we spend massive sums on worldwide military bases and invasions around the world they're not burdened with? Hell, we're $35 trillion in debt and growing, which can lead to all kinds of very unpleasant and dangerous outcomes -- including collapse. We attempt to save the world at the cost of our own country.

We've done all the things and more that we now preach to the world that THEY should NOT do! In other words, "do as I say, not do as I do." History is strewn with perfect examples of civilizations that outran their headlights, like the Great British Empire (GONE), The Roman Empire (GONE), and many others. Is that where you want us to be?

Title: Forbes Daily: Why Elon Musk And Tesla Could Have A Perception Problem

Full Content:
Today’s Forbes Daily newsletter covers El Segundo’s defense tech movement, Trump’s funding violation, Eric Adams update, Tesla’s negative perception, Musk’s bid to buy OpenAI and more. A key line item in Meta’s plan to invest $65 billion in AI this year is 2,250 acres of flat farmland in northeast Louisiana. There, the tech giant has begun work on a $10 billion data center in Richland Parish, the grandest of Meta’s 20 data centers worldwide. The center will need 2.23 gigawatts of 24/7 electricity, enough to power more than 2 million homes. That seems like a lot, but even if AI efficiency significantly improves, the energy-hogging technology will still need those server farms and some, thanks to a dynamic known as Jevons Paradox, which predicts that increased efficiency causes increased demand. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump Administration violated his order calling for a stop on spending freezes for a broad range of federal funds—the latest in a slew of legal actions against the president and cost-cutting czar Elon Musk. The judge ordered the Trump Administration to “immediately restore frozen funding” that Congress approved. A top Justice Department official asked federal prosecutors to drop their case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, multiple outlets reported Monday. Adams faces charges based on allegations that he received illegal donations from the Turkish government for his 2021 mayoral campaign. But in recent weeks, Adams has gotten publicly closer to President Donald Trump, meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago and attending the inauguration last month. Charlie Javice JPMorgan bought fintech startup Frank in 2021, but just a year later claimed its founder Charlie Javice invented millions of customers to close the deal. Now, the Forbes 30 Under 30 alum will stand trial in a New York federal court, and prosecutors have said the case will serve as a cautionary tale for early-stage CEOs and aspiring tech founders everywhere. As Tesla CEO Elon Musk grows further embedded in the White House, his electric vehicle company’s public perception is weighing on shares, according to polling by investment research firm Stifel. “The negative downturn in consumers’ perception of Elon Musk … potentially results in a headwind to sales,” a Stifel analyst wrote as the firm lowered its price target for the stock. Gold hit another record high Monday, extending a yearslong rally as President Donald Trump’s tariffs upend global trade policy and investors search for a safe haven. Gold is up 44% over the last year, by far the best-performer across a basket of 12 leading global asset classes over the period, according to the BlackRock Investment Institute. Abu Dhabi-based startup AppliedAI has raised one of the region’s largest early-stage venture funding rounds. Founder and CEO Arya Bolurfrushan’s pitch is that his AI, and human reviewers, can process complex medical billing records or insurance claims faster and more accurately than traditional outsourcing companies. Elon Musk and other investors made a $97.4 billion unsolicited bid to buy the nonprofit group that controls OpenAI, escalating a longstanding feud between Musk and OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman. Altman quickly rejected the offer, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, and mocked Musk on X. Elon Musk Democrats and student loan borrowers have raised concerns about reports suggesting billionaire Elon Musk and his DOGE associates may have access to sensitive student loan information at the Department of Education. Students at University of California schools filed a federal lawsuit against the Education Department arguing DOGE’s access to that data violates federal laws that maintain strict privacy regulations around sensitive financial aid information. But despite some posts circulating on TikTok, borrowers are unlikely to receive any financial relief if Musk’s access is ruled unlawful. Last week, Musk attacked a Wall Street Journal reporter on X after she revealed that a 25-year-old DOGE staffer had a history of racist and pro-eugenics online posts. But he confused the journalist with another from Politico, illustrating again how misinformation has run rampant on X under his ownership. Fox drew 126 million viewers for its broadcast of Super Bowl LIX on Sunday across platforms, according to multiple outlets, marking the most-watched matchup in Super Bowl history. The record-breaking viewership included audiences who tuned into Fox’s free streaming platform Tubi, which generated 13.6 million viewers. Photographs of some of those taken hostage by Hamas during the October 2023 attack. Hamas said it will delay the next planned release of Israeli hostages and accused Israel of not following the terms of its ceasefire agreement, a move that could potentially disrupt the ceasefire that paused the 15-month war in Gaza. Since the ceasefire went into effect on January 19, both Hamas and Israel have accused the other of violating its terms. After President Donald Trump signed an order placing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from all countries on Monday, the president of the European Commission issued a statement expressing regret at the decision. Ursula von der Leyen said the tariffs were “bad for business, worse for consumers,” and warned that the “unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered—they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures.” Two storms this week are expected to dump snow across the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, and major airlines are allowing some travelers to rebook their flights without a fee. Winter Storm Harlow will bring heavy snow over the Central Plains and Ohio Valley into the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service, followed by Winter Storm Iliana, which will develop Tuesday night in the Plains before spreading eastward. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday announced Fort Liberty in North Carolina will be renamed once again to Fort Bragg—the base’s previous name, which was changed in 2023 as a part of a Pentagon effort to rescind special honors given to officials linked to the Confederacy. However, Hegseth said the new name does not honor the Confederate general Braxton Bragg, but that it pays tribute to Private First Class Roland L. Bragg, a World War II veteran who was awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart for “exceptional courage during the Battle of the Bulge.” ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; PHOTOS BY ANDY RYAN, TAEK-SANG JEONG/GETTY IMAGES TOPLINE A new generation of startups in El Segundo, California, which has become the center of Silicon Valley’s defense tech movement, are leaning into a MAGA-fied, pro-Christian, mostly male-led vision of Silicon Valley. El Segundo’s founders, or self-identified ‘Gundo bros,’ are commanding the attention of some of the biggest venture capital outfits around. Lux Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Point72 Ventures are among those who have backed more than half a dozen founders from Discipulus Ventures’ first cohort alone. They’re pouring money into seed-stage companies Durin, which is developing autonomous drilling equipment for the mining industry; Rune Technologies, which is building software for military units to manage supply chains; and Vanguard Defense, which is building a data product for electronic warfare. Now, Discipulus has launched its own fund to back the second cohort of entrepreneurs that it plans to host for a weeklong event in coming months, raising $6 million from investors. It’s a small fund, but one with big Y Combinator-style ambitions that align with the Trump Administration’s priorities. For Augustus Doricko, one of several very online Gundo bros, this second Discipulus cohort is further evidence of a shift away from an era of investment in consumer apps and B2B solutions toward a new one that favors America’s national security interests and military prowess. WHY IT MATTERS It’s a so-called “vibe shift” that has inspired a MAGA-fied, pro-Christian vision of Silicon Valley tightly aligned with Elon Musk and the Trump Administration’s goals. The billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, for example, has backed a venture firm called New Founding, which is building a Christian real estate enclave, and hopes to be part of an effort to “forge new models and institutions that can shape the direction of Western civilization.” MORE The Tech Bros Powering Silicon Valley’s Military Fever Dream With Energy Drinks, God And Nicotine Early data from the IRS shows this tax season is off to a sluggish start, though the average tax refund is up. There’s been confusion among taxpayers amid recent changes at the IRS, including a hiring freeze: 13,177,000: The number of individual income tax returns the IRS has received in 2025, a 14% drop from early 2024 34.8%: The decline in web visits to IRS.gov from last year $1,928: The average refund per taxpayer as of January 31, an increase of 38% compared to this time last year Women’s fatigue is often underestimated due to gender bias, but unrecognized fatigue can lead to burnout, decreased productivity and long-term health issues. It’s critical that managers lead by example and prioritize incorporating short, regular breaks, and normalize taking mental health days. When companies prioritize rest, they can cultivate a culture that supports employee well-being and promotes productivity.

Title: Bitcoin’s MVRV score nears danger zone – Are short-term holders at risk?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoins-mvrv-score-nears-danger-zone-are-short-term-holders-at-risk/
Time Published: 2025-02-11T12:30:44Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s short-term MVRV shows investors are still in profit but a drop cannot be ruled out. The Short-Term Holder (STH) MVRV score for Bitcoin [BTC] recently dropped to 1.05. This crucial threshold indicated investors were just above the break-even point. The drop in the MVRV score suggested a potential cooling-off in buying enthusiasm among short-term holders. Despite this decline, the score remaining above 1 implied that the selling pressure may not be as intense yet. This could potentially prevent another drop. Source: Bitcoin Magazine PRO The STH’s approximate cost basis of around $92,000 serves as a critical support level for the market. BTC could drop to $92K, but if it maintains above this cost basis, it could indicate continued confidence among short-term investors, supporting stable prices or an uptrend. Conversely, if the MVRV score falls below 1, it could signify that most STHs are at a loss. This could lead to increased selling pressure as investors attempt to minimize losses. This scenario would put the $92,000 support level at risk of breaking down, possibly triggering a sharper decline in Bitcoin’s price. Further analysis shows that Bitcoin continued with its pattern of interacting frequently with liquidity zones. This pattern persisted, with BTC initially maintaining levels just above the long clusters before inevitably dipping to sweep the liquidity at $95,000. However, the recurrent tests of these liquidity pools suggested a bearish undertone as the price failed to sustain higher levels, especially near the $100,100 short liquidity zone. Source: Hyblock Capital This consistent pull towards lower liquidity zones, now below $94K, signals a potential setup for further drops, potentially down to the $92,000 level, crucial for short-term holders (STHs). If Bitcoin continues this pattern, the $92K level could soon play a pivotal role. Breaking below this level could lead to a shift in market sentiment, possibly causing short-term holders to capitulate, adding downward pressure on the price. Conversely, a successful defense of this level might reinforce confidence, possibly stabilizing or driving up prices as accumulation occurs at these lower levels. Lastly, this drop is supported by the fact that the prices declined despite significant purchases by Michael Saylor’s, MicroStrategy, and BlackRock, alongside the movement of 14,000 dormant Bitcoins. These large transactions might have signaled a potential increase in supply, even if not immediately sold, causing uncertainty and thus a price drop. Source: CryptoQuant Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 If these Bitcoins are seen as long-term holds, not sell-offs, it might suggest less selling pressure. This could potentially stabilize or boost the price. Future price moves hinge on whether these Bitcoins stay off exchanges. This could indicate a bullish outlook if viewed as a store of value.

Title: XYZVerse, Ondo, Solana & More — Best Crypto Buys in the February 2025 Dip
URL: https://zycrypto.com/xyzverse-ondo-solana-more-best-crypto-buys-in-the-february-2025-dip/

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Digital currencies experienced an unanticipated decline in February 2025, yet there are hidden prospects. As many pull back, smart eyes focus on a few cryptocurrencies that exhibit potential and resilience. This article reveals top choices like XYZVerse, Ondo, and Solana. Find out how these tokens could produce remarkable gains amid the market decline and defy the trend. XYZ is your unique VIP pass to a revolution driven by memes and sports. Consider it the XYZVerse ecosystem’s MVP, where cryptocurrency aficionados can profit greatly from the rising demand for meme currencies. However, every revolution requires a hero—someone prepared to overcome all obstacles and elevate the $XYZ token to the top. That hero is XYZepe, the masked warrior, the steadfast $XYZ holding, the genuine believer, whose goal is to propel XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap. The goal is to demonstrate that underdogs can achieve greatness. The XYZVerse ecosystem is expected to grow as millions more sports lovers prepare to play, and your rewards will be incredible! Here is an example of a highlight reel moment: XYZVerse has been named the Best NEW Meme Project, highlighting its enormous potential in the meme coin space. The indisputable leaders in the cryptocurrency space are meme coins, and XYZ is poised to overtake them. With a current price of $0.002, $XYZ is still a cheap cryptocurrency gem that could increase to $0.1 during the last presale phase. Victory, however, requires commitment, strategy, and a fighter prepared to battle to the end. XYZepe is taking $XYZ to a legendary level with the community’s support, even if he knows the challenge ahead. Thanks to its fully vetted workforce, rock-solid protection in the form of audited smart contracts, and impending listings on key CEX and DEX platforms, XYZ is already ahead of the game. Here, the first mover advantage is crucial; if you enter the market before the crowds do, you stand to gain far larger profits! In the realm of cryptocurrencies, Cardano is attracting attention. This blockchain infrastructure is adaptable and long-lasting, designed for smart contracts. This implies it contributes to developing new cryptocurrency tokens, games, and defi apps. ADA, its native coin, is a formidable rival to Ethereum’s ETH. Users can stake their ADA on the network, store value, and make payments. Cardano’s green approach is what sets it apart. It uses Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake mechanism far more energy-efficient than other people’s conventional proof-of-work models. Cardano’s technology is cutting-edge. It is divided into two layers: one for smart contracts and one for transactions. It can process up to a million transactions per second because of this split. Cardano launched native tokens in March 2021, enabling safe and inexpensive smart contract interactions. This establishes Cardano as a pioneer in scalability and efficiency. ADA is appealing in the present market cycle, particularly for consumers seeking sustainable solutions. Despite the established status of coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Cardano may have an advantage in the ever-changing cryptocurrency market due to its emphasis on sustainability and scalability. Solana is turning heads in the blockchain arena, focusing on speed and scalability. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana offers a foundation for stand-out decentralized applications. Its unique architecture delivers faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. SOL isn’t just a token; it powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. The potential of SOL is tied to the impressive capabilities of the Solana platform. Solana doesn’t rely on sharding or second-layer solutions to scale, unlike some networks. This design choice attracts developers seeking a high-capacity network that can handle bustling products and services. SOL looks increasingly attractive in the current market cycle, where scalability and transaction speed are crucial. While the crypto market is crowded, SOL’s strong technology and ambitious approach make it a standout option among digital currencies. Avalanche is a brand-new, quick, and environmentally friendly blockchain technology. It can complete transactions in less than two seconds and process up to 4,500 transactions per second. This implies that money can be sent and received almost instantly. Additionally, users can design their own subnets—customizable networks—with Avalanche. It employs a unique approach to transaction agreement, combining traditional and modern techniques for increased speed and security. The platform’s three primary components—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—cooperate to handle smart contracts and transactions. The token that drives Avalanche is called AVAX. It facilitates the operation of subnets, pays for transactions, and stakes the network to keep it secure. Speed and minimal fees are crucial in the current market, and Avalanche satisfies these requirements. AVAX enables quick, affordable, and environmentally friendly transactions compared to other cryptocurrencies—a significant factor as more people become concerned about the environment. Developers and companies seeking adaptable solutions may be drawn to Avalanche’s bespoke token and blockchain creation capabilities. Platforms like Avalanche that prioritize speed, scalability, and sustainability may become increasingly significant as the cryptocurrency market develops. Ondo Finance is making waves by blending the reliability of tradfi with the efficiency of blockchain technology. It does this by tokenizing stable, income-generating assets like US Treasuries. This means more people can access high-quality products that were once out of reach. Ondo has two main parts: an asset management arm that creates these tokenized products and a technology arm that builds DeFi protocols to make them work better and reach more people. In a market where trust and security are significant concerns, Ondo stands out by partnering with well-known firms like BlackRock and using Coinbase for custody. It sets high standards for transparency and closely follows legal rules. One of its notable products, USDY, offers stablecoin accessibility with the added yield benefit from US Treasuries and bank deposits. This approach could appeal to those looking for regulated and transparent options in the crypto space. As the market evolves, Ondo’s focus on real-world assets and compliance might make it an interesting player compared to other more volatile coins. ADA, SOL, AVAX, and ONDO are solid choices, but XYZVerse stands out. As the first all-sport meme coin, it aims for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans in crypto.

Title: Michelin-starred restaurants in Ireland, 2025: The complete guide
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/restaurants/2025/02/11/michelin-starred-restaurants-in-ireland-2025-the-complete-guide/
Time Published: 2025-02-11T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
The Michelin Guide says: “Mickael Viljanen’s basement restaurant is a stylish, elegant spot decorated with eye-catching art. Superb service complements cooking that focuses on prime luxury ingredients – like Donegal lobster or Limousin sweetbreads – and sees classic French techniques combined with subtle modern touches. Mickael’s creativity and personality shine through in perfectly balanced, immaculately executed dishes with sublime natural flavours and beautiful presentation. The Irish Coffee is made in the diningroom and is, like everything else, an experience to remember.” chapteronerestaurant.com The Michelin Guide says: “Chef Ahmet Dede’s warm, inviting restaurant in this West Cork coastal village is a masterful marriage between his Irish surroundings and his Turkish heritage. Superb local produce is the bedrock of the cooking, enhanced by skilful, judicious spicing which delivers multiple layers of authentic Turkish flavours while never overpowering the core ingredients – as with a refined take on street food ‘îçli köfte’. The charismatic Ahmet and his mostly Turkish brigade deliver their dishes with pride, while co-owner Maria runs the service with a friendly charm.” customshousebaltimore.com The Michelin Guide says: “There’s a slightly magical feel to this stylish, cosy restaurant. With just a handful of tables, it makes for a personal dining experience, with Damien Grey and his small team offering a genuinely warm welcome and explaining the dishes personally. The surprise tasting menu showcases bold, original dishes centred around the five tastes – salty, savoury, sweet, bitter and sour – which come together in perfect harmony. First-class ingredients are present throughout, treated with precision and strong modern technique by the chefs. Excellent wine pairings further enhance the experience.” liathrestaurant.com The Michelin Guide says: “This iconic restaurant has been thriving since 1981, thanks to both the eponymous chef and the exceptional team he has around him. It sits hidden away within a Georgian town house and oozes sumptuousness and sophistication thanks to features such as a gilt barrel ceiling and handcrafted marquetry. The accomplished cooking isn’t to be upstaged, however: it is French at heart yet has a restrained modernity and showcases some bold yet superbly balanced flavours. The Irish ingredients are certainly luxurious and the baba flambé with your choice of rum provides an inviting, classical way to finish.” restaurantpatrickguilbaud.ie The Michelin Guide says: “In the Manor House of this breathtaking resort, you’ll be warmly welcomed by the kitchen team before enjoying a procession of original and elaborate snacks which more than hint at the quality of the surprise menu in store. The striking and sophisticated dishes showcase the best of the local larder alongside more international flavours which highlight the chef’s time and travels in Asia; the sauces are superlative. Dishes are often finished off at your table in the elegant diningroom. This is an experience to remember.” terre.ie [ Terre restaurant review: One of the best – and most expensive – meals I’ve ever eatenOpens in new window ] The Michelin Guide says: “It takes some doing for a restaurant to stand out when it’s in a hotel as beautiful as this. Ballyfin Demesne is a spectacular, lovingly restored Regency-era manor house that screams luxury at every turn. The opulence continues into the diningroom, where the chefs serve fittingly impressive dishes. Broths, purées and sauces are a real highlight and underline the technical skill of the kitchen team, be it a rich, glossy reduction or a roasted onion consommé with bags of flavour. Charming and attentive service completes the rather special picture.” ballyfin.com The Michelin Guide says: “Lignum is Latin for ‘wood’ and, as such, it’s the ancient method of cooking over an open flame which takes centre stage at this immensely likeable restaurant. It’s housed in a modern barn conversion which has a distinctly Scandic vibe, from the large windows and minimalist furnishings to the roaring fire and throws on the chairs. The wood-fired cooking lends a delicious smoky dimension to the creative dishes, which – informed by the chef’s heritage – blend ingredients from Ireland (such as sweet lobster tail) and Italy (Amalfi lemon). It all comes in the form of a surprise tasting menu.” lignum.ie The Michelin Guide says: “We all need a little luxury in our lives and this beautiful restaurant in the heart of the impressive Carton House mansion ticks all the boxes. The breathtaking room features a high curved ceiling, Greek Corinthian columns, ornate plaster cornicing and sweeping banquettes, while the menu matches it for opulence with an abundance of first-rate produce, be it Union Hall crab or Achill lamb. The cooking is rooted in the chefs’ strong classical technique, but some wildcard flavour combinations work wonders thanks to their fine judgment.” cartonhouse.com The Michelin Guide says: “The high ceilings and original plasterwork of this restored landmark building contribute to the appeal of the contemporary restaurant within. The well-travelled, Australian-born chef prepares a surprise menu and, while there are multiple global techniques and influences at play, the focus of the dishes remains firmly on the top-notch main ingredients. There are seats at the counter for those wanting to see how the beautifully composed dishes are created, and the wine pairings are a great way to go.” dolierstreetrestaurant.com [ D’Olier Street review: This new restaurant has a great team. They should stop being cautious, let rip and enjoy the rideOpens in new window ] The Michelin Guide says: “A vaulted ceiling and flagstone floors combine with sumptuous, colourful furnishings at this striking restaurant that provides a fair amount of both character and luxury. It helps, of course, that it’s located in the cellars of Cashel Palace, a magnificent Palladian manor house which was once home to the Archbishops of Cashel. Desserts are a highlight among cooking that keeps a focus on each central ingredient, which is then skilfully enhanced with complementary flavours. Service comes from an impeccable team, who work with the utmost pride.” cashelpalacehotel.ie Michelin Guide says: “A charming 200-year-old cottage houses this rural restaurant that counts the Atlantic Ocean as its neighbour. The lovely terrace allows you to enjoy a spectacular sunset over drinks, before moving inside to the characterful interior with stone floors, cookery books and rustic wooden tables. Wonderful Irish produce – such as superbly fresh, beautifully roasted Aran monkfish – is used in equally impressive dishes that are clean and modern, with no unnecessary frills.” homesteadcottagedoolin.com [ Homestead Cottage review: An incredibly beautiful new restaurant from a talented chefOpens in new window ] The Michelin Guide says: “Aniar means ‘from the west’ and indeed the local area is a key inspiration for both the ‘back-to-nature’ cooking and the chic, moody décor here. The micro-seasonal menus are finalised based on the day’s locally sourced produce, which is showcased in pure, delicate and well-balanced dishes such as exceptional raw beef dressed with top-notch nasturtium oil. The cooking cleverly blends traditional and modern techniques, while contrasts in texture, temperature and acidity are also a feature. Many courses are served by the chefs themselves, some with accompanying poems.” aniarrestaurant.ie The Michelin Guide says: “This vibrant little restaurant with a lively spirit boasts an open kitchen, from which you’ll find the chefs engaging with guests and delivering some of the dishes themselves. The modern set menu features top class Irish produce at the height of season and each main ingredient is given the space to shine. Dishes are stripped-back, flavours are bold and servings are generous: this is cooking that comes from the heart. Start with an aperitif while you enjoy the delicate snacks.” bastible.com [ Bastible review: Want to try a Michelin star restaurant in Ireland? This is the place to startOpens in new window ] The Michelin Guide says: “Set in the very centre of town, Bastion is a contemporary restaurant owned and run by a talented couple: Paul McDonald cooks, while his wife Helen looks after the service. A large bar splits the room in two and twinkling candles add a welcoming touch. Paul is Scottish born but his cooking has a strong Irish base. Natural flavours are kept to the fore and local seafood is a highlight. The skilfully prepared, exacting dishes take on a modern style and often exhibit a playful, innovative element, while at the same time showing depth in their flavours and textures.” bastionkinsale.com The Michelin Guide says: “This long-standing restaurant is owned and run by experienced chef Garrett Byrne – who really knows his craft – along with his partner, Brid Hannon, who provides relaxed, friendly service. The modern interior is sleek, with curved banquettes, spot-lit dark wood tables and striking local artwork hanging on the walls. Top quality Irish ingredients are showcased in richly flavoured, classic dishes: you won’t find foams or smears on your plate here – just confidently cooked, skilfully balanced dishes, with exemplary plating, saucing and seasoning.” campagne.ie The Michelin Guide says: “There’s a laid-back feel to this sweet, intimate restaurant where the shelves are laden with wine, mead and all manner of jars full of produce marinating, curing or fermenting. Skeaghanore duck is among the County Cork produce championed on the constantly evolving tasting menu, where skilfully prepared dishes show a great understanding of textures and tastes, and are pleasingly understated in their pure, natural flavours. Smaller growers are present in the wine pairings, while they make their own juices and cordials for the non-alcoholic option.” restaurantchestnutwestcork.ie The Michelin Guide says: “Set in a prime spot on the second floor of The Fitzwilliam Hotel, overlooking St Stephen’s Green, is this chic, elegant restaurant with subtle 1930s overtones. Pink and green hues and pretty flower arrangements bring a certain softness to the surroundings; in contrast, Andy McFadden’s cooking is characterised by boldness – both in its flavours and textures – and his experience shines through in creative, modern dishes which are skilfully prepared and artfully presented.” gloversalley.com The Michelin Guide says: “Located in the Cliff House Hotel – a modern, glass-fronted building which, unsurprisingly, hugs the cliffside – this restaurant benefits from a stunning view across Ardmore Bay. Fortunately, the cooking is a match for its surroundings, taking exceptional Irish produce and building on it using skilled technique and a smattering of global influences. Terrific lobster caught in Ardmore Bay, for example, might come with rogan josh sauce and garlic naan for a distinctly Indian touch. Throughout the cooking, the dishes are attractively presented without being showy.” cliffhousehotel.ie The Michelin Guide says: “The 1,500-acre Mount Juliet Estate, now housing an impressive country house hotel, is one of the best examples of Georgian architecture in Ireland; it still boasts its original stuccowork and hand-carved marble fireplaces, and its luxurious, high-ceilinged restaurant comes with all the comfort and elegance one would expect. John Kelly’s boldly flavoured, visually impressive dishes are skilfully prepared, underpinned by ingredients from the estate, the county and the coast. The excellent desserts – such as a beautiful hazelnut and chocolate confection – provide a memorable finish.” mountjuliet.ie The Michelin Guide says: “Hidden away in the Cathedral Quarter is this urban, industrial-style restaurant named after a 200-year-old secret society. It’s a simply furnished place, run with palpable enthusiasm by a young team. Chef Gareth McCaughey’s philosophy is to source top ingredients, prepare them well and not overcomplicate things, as proven by the surprise tasting menu spotlighting superb Irish produce like Kilkeel scallops and Wicklow venison. The wine list offers an interesting selection of low-intervention, natural, organic and biodynamic wines, all available by the glass.” themuddlersclubbelfast.com The Michelin Guide says: “This restaurant inside the impressive Adare Manor has all the grandeur you would expect, with wood-panelled walls, lavish chandeliers and a glass-enclosed terrace with views over the 850 acre grounds. The assured, refreshingly understated cooking champions top Irish ingredients, with dishes comprising just 3 or 4 components and allowing each one the room to make an impression. Combinations are refined and well-balanced, and great attention is given to the finer details. The wine list is a labour of love and offers a superb range by the glass.” adaremanor.com The Michelin Guide says: “From the terrific buzz in the air to each element of the carefully constructed tasting menu, dining at this understated restaurant is such a pleasant experience. The starting point for the cooking is always the ingredients, with only the very best selected – and in some cases grown – by the kitchen team. This top-notch produce is elevated by the refined, expertly balanced accompaniments – an approach which is clear in dishes like superb Orkney scallop paired with a curry oil that is beautifully judged in both aroma and flavour.” oxbelfast.com The Michelin Guide says: “You’ll find charming chef-owner Keelan Higgs working calmly in the open kitchen of this tiny restaurant. The long, narrow room has a funky style and the relaxed atmosphere is helped along by brother Aaron and the laid-back service team. Highly original yet unfussy dishes burst with freshness and flavour, and many are cooked over the open fire; Keelan loves this concept, as no two dishes will ever be exactly the same. The 6 course ‘Chef’s Choice’ menu is divided into Snacks, Cold, Warm, Pasta, Mains and Finish, and the monthly changing, mostly organic wine list is passionately compiled.” varietyjones.ie © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Climate reporting presents brands with an opportunity – if it’s done right
URL: https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2025/02/11/climate-reporting-presents-brands-with-opportunity-if-it-s-done-right
Time Published: 2025-02-11T07:00:00Z

Advertisement The Drum Network article This content is produced by The Drum Network, a paid-for membership club for CEOs and their agencies who want to share their expertise and grow their business. February 11, 2025 | 8 min read Listen to article 4 min Climate Transition Plans will become crucial for comms teams thanks to the EU’s directive on ESG, says Olly Lawder at Revolt. See these plans as an opportunity to align company values and let the world – and your investors – know about the great work you do. Climate Transition Plans (CTPs) allow companies to creatively communicate their roadmap to net zero, says Lawder / Explore with Joshua via Unsplash The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) has raised the bar on Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting. It’s estimated that 50,000 companies with a presence in the EU will have to comply with the directive, which requires companies to share information on their monitoring of many ESG issues. The directive is purposefully technical, and this complexity can create a hurdle for communication and engagement. But an opportunity does exist in the shape of the Climate Transition Plan (CTP). The CTP is a mandatory part of the reporting and offers companies an opportunity to creatively communicate their roadmap to net zero. And while marketers may not be creating CTPs, they will certainly be communicating them. The CTP translates sometimes intangible and distant net zero goals into a credible, granular, and powerful business strategy to show to stakeholders. As a mandatory part of CSRD, businesses shouldn’t view the CTP as simply a compliance exercise but as an opportunity to stand out and deliver. Knowing that businesses will be heavily focused on CTPs this year with CSRD coming into force, Revolt conducted quantitative research with over 400 marketing and PR leaders in the US who work at companies with offices in the EU. The aim was to find out just how much marketers know about the directive and whether they will embrace the creative opportunities that CTPs present in their marketing and communications. Reassuringly, we found that nearly 96% of marketeers are aware of CTPs. Given the importance and ramifications of CSRD, we were not surprised by this. However, 30% report that they are either unaware if their company has a CTP or that their company is not developing one. This is a worryingly high percentage, and clearly more needs to be done to ensure that all companies are aware of their climate transition responsibilities. The good news is that all respondents agree – either strongly or somewhat – that CTPs represent good comms opportunities. But when asked about the extent of communications planning around CTPs for the next 12 months, only a third of respondents said they have a specific plan for communicating transition plans. Additionally, 65% reported that CTP communication was not in the broader communications plan, and 71% said they hadn’t budgeted for CTP communications. So, while there is a good understanding of the marketing opportunity with CTPs, there is a real gap in terms of actually making it happen. When we addressed this with respondents, we found a variety of reasons for the slow or lacking movement in communicating CTPs. Concern about accidentally greenwashing is the number one barrier to creatively engaging on climate transition plans. This was followed by a perceived difficulty in engaging audiences in what some consider a ‘depressing topic,’ as well as audiences lacking interest in the subject matter. Other reasons included the complexity of the issues and marketers feeling out of their comfort zone with the topic. However, these barriers can and should be overcome. I believe that there are three things marketers and corporate affairs teams should keep in mind to ensure effective communication of transition plans. Advertisement Climate change isn’t a future concern; it’s already upon us – and investors are looking to invest in businesses that build resilience to climate risks and are ready to take on climate opportunities. Almost 99% of leading global insurance companies have now set a low-carbon transition objective within their investment portfolios, according to Blackrock. While CTPs existed before CSRD, they lacked granularity. The new directive will create a groundswell of information that investors will look at, including the disclosure of climate-related risks, transition-related opportunities, investment plans for low-carbon technologies, impacts on staff, scenario-planning, and financial allocation for activity. The CTP is an opportunity to translate your net-zero strategy into a powerful investment story – a story of resilience, adaptability, and competitive advantage that only your business can offer investors. It forms part of an ongoing dialogue and is a way to update investors on your transition progress. Advertisement Every stakeholder plays a role in delivering on your CTP, but none is as important as your employees. Employees are potential champions and crucial implementers of your transition strategies. Employees play a role across all three principles of the CTP – Ambition, Action, and Accountability – and they act as change agents who can ensure the CTP does not just live in a document. Showcasing how individual roles directly contribute to broader goals creates a compelling narrative that will help retain talent who see sustainability as a personal mission rather than a corporate imperative. To transition successfully, businesses will need people with the right skill sets and CTP comms that hero employees – and show that measurable impact can help to attract future talent who value sustainability. Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team. Stay up to date with a curated digest of the most important marketing stories and expert insights from our global team. Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum. For effective transition planning, businesses must engage their value chain because, in most cases, Scope 3 emissions (all indirect emissions relating to business activity, excluding utilities) represent the largest portion of a business’s carbon footprint. So, while CTPs are individual to each business, they can only be achieved with systemic change across suppliers and geographies. It’s important that CTPs deliver and communicate a detailed and quantifiable picture of the value chain, including its most opaque areas. View the CTP not as a supplier compliance checklist but rather a communication device to highlight a shared purpose between your business and your value chain. Move toward storytelling that demonstrates genuine partnership and success stories, collaborative decarbonization efforts, and, in turn, acts as a confidence-builder for other stakeholders too, including investors. CTPs will become a critical element of the comms suite around reporting going forward, and with the first CSRD disclosures being made in 2025, the time to engage is now. Plans will be scrutinized, so get ready to be vocal and to defend and uphold them, but do not see your comms solely as a form of defense. Instead, engaging and ambitious comms are your opportunity to inspire stakeholders, catalyze investment and innovation, and ensure your plans progress into reality. Revolt The world is on fire. There’s no time to watch from the sidelines. The most successful brands of tomorrow will be the ones that take a stand today. It’s time...

Title: Why is the United States economy so much stronger than Europe’s?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/02/11/why-is-the-united-states-economy-so-much-stronger-than-europes/
Time Published: 2025-02-11T06:00:23Z

Forget about Donald Trump for a moment and consider why the US economy is so much stronger than Europe’s. Most agencies earmark growth of 2.5-3 per cent for the US economy this year against 1 per cent in Europe. And that 1 per cent looks shaky. It may also be revised down if US tariffs against the EU materialise. [ Trump tariffs threaten Ireland’s service economy too ] Without a significant boost in investment – particularly in infrastructure and green technologies – Europe risks falling further behind the US and the global economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is warning. There are several reasons for Europe’s flagging performance and the US’s better-than-expected one. Europe has been more impacted by the energy crisis for one (higher energy costs have dented manufacturing output in Europe’s largest economy Germany, which has also been impacted by weaker Chinese demand). The prospect of tax cuts and less regulation in the US appears to be having an equal and opposite effect on the other side of Atlantic. But these potentially short-term trends aside, there is an endemic productivity gap between the US and Europe. Productivity is one of those glaze-over economic phenomena, but it underpins performance and explains better than any other the reason why the US leads much of the world when it comes to technology. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, gave perhaps the most cogent explanation for the productivity gap between the US and Europe. “The US is marching ahead with high productivity because capital markets allocate money to dynamic firms ... because technology turns into business investment and grows into companies fast and because the US has an abundance of cheap energy,” she said. Her point was echoed by Larry Fink, chief executive of investment giant BlackRock. “Any entrepreneur, any small company, any large company can find capital and that foundation of capital – raising allows much more entrepreneurialism, much more creativity,” he said. The strength of the US’s capital markets allows the US to modify, rebuild itself, change direction faster than any other economy, he said.

Title: Bitcoin And Politics Merge: Florida Moves Toward State Crypto Investment

The American state of Florida could be one of the pioneering local governments that allows a percentage of its state funds for cryptocurrency investments, particularly Bitcoin. Florida Senator Joe Gruters has filed a bill that would permit the US state to use 10% of its funds to buy Bitcoin. This political backing could entice other American states to build their own cryptocurrency investments. My state of Florida introduces a Bitcoin investment bill! 💪 If passed Florida’s CFO may allocate up to 10% of public funds to invest in $BTC or other digital assets. Thank you Senator Joe Gruters 🫡 pic.twitter.com/nF0SoTbT96 — Lucidvein (@Lucidvein) February 8, 2025 Gruters introduced a legislative measure that would allow Florida to invest in Bitcoin using state funds to combat inflation. The senator said that Senate Bill 550 proposed to permit Florida’s chief financial officer to use up to 10% of its funds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The bill aims to incorporate Bitcoin into state financial planning in the US, a legislative action that could reshape state authorities’ investment funds strategy and lead to other states adopting crypto. Gruters eyes that the proposed bill would help financial planners of Florida to hedge against inflation. “Inflation has eroded the purchasing power of assets held in state funds managed by the Chief Financial Officer, and this erosion diminishes the value of the state’s reserves, affecting the financial stability and economic security of this state, its taxpayers, and its residents,” Gruters said. The senator explained in the bill that inflation has “eroded the purchasing power of assets” managed by the state’s chief financial officer, adding that the state is responsible for safeguarding “Florida’s financial resources” against inflation and economic uncertainties. Hence, the American senator explained that Florida should have access to tools like Bitcoin to protect state funds from inflation. Once Gruter’s proposed legislation was enacted, it would be beneficial to the state in several ways. Analysts said that investing in Bitcoin would diversify Florida’s state assets, adding that the state would incorporate in its portfolio an asset that historically provides high returns but with significant volatility. Market observers added that this crypto legislation would help turn Florida into a blockchain hub that promotes cryptocurrency innovation, further establishing Florida as a crypto-friendly state. Florida might become the model state for adopting Bitcoin in state financial planning, making BTC adoption in government finance a reality. Crypto analysts also see that Florida’s success could encourage other states to follow its lead and start incorporating digital assets into their financial systems.

Title: A Trump executive order reportedly has ended a racial discrimination probe at Tesla

Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows By Ja'han Jones Policy proposals from the new administration — and the seemingly unmatched power granted to Elon Musk and his allies — sure do suggest that Donald Trump is trying to serve his megarich benefactor more than nearly anyone else. Whether it’s punishing South Africa for attempting to stem the impact of apartheid racism or giving bigoted white men unfettered access to the upper echelon of the U.S. government, it seems Trump and his allies are ensuring that Musk gets ample returns on the multimillion-dollar investment he made in Trump’s campaign. And the apparent benefits to Musk could also include the suspension of a federal probe into allegations of racial discrimination at his company Tesla. An executive order Trump signed Jan. 21 as part of his crusade against diversity required the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which is part of the Department of Labor and investigates discrimination allegations, to immediately halt “[p]romoting ‘diversity’” and “[h]olding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for taking ‘affirmative action.’” According to The San Francisco Standard, the order essentially required the compliance office to stop an audit of Tesla over allegations of discrimination at one of its automobile factories. The Standard reported: The Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs enforced equal employment laws for federal contractors. The office’s employees now have little to do besides notifying companies that they will no longer be audited for potential discrimination — and, in some cases, that they won’t have to pay outstanding fines. The Standard reported that Tesla was recently notified that the discrimination probe had been halted. Other large corporations were made aware of dropped investigations into their workplaces, too: The OFCCP sent Tesla a letter last week stating that its review had stopped. “We had to mail the companies we audit to tell them they no longer have to comply with our rules or regulations,” said Aliyah Levin, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2391, which represents 1,200 federal workers in San Francisco and eight Western states. Tesla’s letter was one among dozens in California alone, according to Levin. OFCCP investigators were set to review the practices of more than 2,000 U.S. companies this year, including 211 in California, according to federal data that is no longer online. Investigations have been canceled at the San Francisco offices of Google, Meta, Blackrock, Sony, and PG&E, among others. According to The Standard, a federal lawsuit against Tesla from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is ongoing. When the lawsuit was announced in 2023, the EEOC said: “Black employees regularly encountered graffiti, including variations of the N-word, swastikas, threats, and nooses, on desks and other equipment, in bathroom stalls, within elevators, and even on new vehicles rolling off the production line.” The EEOC also said that “those who raised objections to racial hostility suffered various forms of retaliation, including terminations, changes in job duties, transfers, and other adverse employment actions.” Tesla has called the allegations “a false narrative that ignores Tesla’s track record of equal employment opportunity.” It’s unclear how the lawsuit progresses from here. Trump’s acting EEOC chair, Andrea Lucas, has already gotten to work pursuing his priorities of rolling back protections for transgender and nonbinary people. How she’ll approach a discrimination suit against one of Trump’s closest allies remains an open question. Ja’han Jones is The ReidOut Blog writer.

We recently published a list of 10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other best widow and orphan stocks to invest in. Investing in the stock market can be a prudent strategy for widows and orphans seeking financial stability and growth. Widow-and-orphan stocks are typically associated with established companies in sectors like utilities and consumer staples. These companies often provide consistent dividend payments, offering a reliable income stream. This stability is particularly valuable during economic downturns, as these stocks tend to exhibit lower volatility compared to high-growth equities. Investing in stable, dividend-paying stocks can aid in preserving and growing wealth over time. The combination of regular dividend income and potential capital appreciation makes these stocks suitable for individuals aiming for sustainable financial growth without excessive risk exposure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. A study published in July 2024 highlights the critical role of financial literacy in investment decisions and stock market participation. The research indicates that increased financial knowledge enhances investment confidence and decision-making, underscoring the importance of targeted financial education programs to empower individuals to participate effectively in the stock market. Recent trends show that women, particularly baby boomers, are increasingly controlling significant amounts of wealth. As of January 2025, women over 60 control $8 trillion of liquid wealth assets. This shift underscores the importance of financial literacy and proactive investment strategies among women to ensure long-term financial security.

As per the fourth quarter of 2024 result, the company reported earnings of $3.2 billion ($1.84 per share – diluted) compared with $2.3 billion ($1.22 per share – diluted) in the fourth quarter of the previous year. In January, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) announced that its 50% owned affiliate, Tengizchevroil, has started oil production at its Future Growth Project (FGP) located at the Tengiz oil field in Kazakhstan. FGP is the third processing plant in operation at the Tengiz oil field, which expands sour gas injection capability and is expected to ramp up output to one million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Overall, CVX ranks 6th on our list of best widow and orphan stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than CVX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Gold Hits New Record: Trump's Tariffs, Inflation Fears Drive Safe Haven Surge
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/02/10/gold-hits-new-record-trumps-tariffs-inflation-fears-drive-safe-haven-surge/

Gold prices rose to yet another record high Monday, extending a yearslong rally for the precious metal accelerated in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s tariffs upend global trade policy, and investors and central banks search for safety in the evolving global economy. Gold is on a remarkable hot streak. Spot gold rose to as high as $2,938 per troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rising as much as 1.7%. Monday’s rally tied to Trump’s imposition of a blanket 25% tariff on all aluminum and tariff imports, the latest in a scorching stretch for gold. Up 44% over the last year, gold has been by far the best-performer across a basket of 12 leading global asset classes over the period, according to the BlackRock Investment Institute, most notably trouncing the 22% return for the S&P 500 over the last year, including reinvested dividends. And Wall Street largely believes the gains will continue: JPMorgan Chase maintains a $2.950 end-of-2025 price target for gold, Goldman Sachs holds a $3,000 target by the middle of 2026 and Citigroup has a $3,000 target by the end of this year. Gold breaking $3,000, which would only require a less than 3% rally from Monday’s prices, would be the latest milestone for a roaring 2020s for gold, which only crossed $1,000 for the first time during 2008’s great financial crisis and $2,000 for the first time during 2020’s COVID-19 pandemic. It’s rare for gold to have such a strong performance during a time of economic strength globally, especially in the U.S., which has many of the hallmarks of an economy far from recession with a resilient labor market, stock market highs and relatively stable inflation. Though long-held concerns about inflation and geopolitical tensions such as the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and diminished interest rate cut prospects weigh on the minds of gold investors, experts mostly tie the recent gold rally to Trump’s tariffs. Gold “clearly would benefit from universal tariffs,” according to JPMorgan’s head of cross asset strategy Fabio Bassi, while Goldman commodities strategist Lina Thomas wrote of gold’s “potentially persistent boost from elevated US policy uncertainty.” And there’s a continued undercurrent of historic gold purchasing from central banks globally, as those institutions bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold in 2024, the third consecutive year of at least 1,000 tonnes in central bank purchases after never crossing that mark prior to 2022, according to the World Gold Council. The People's Bank of China is the most notable buyer, accounting for 43% of all central bank gold purchases in November, according to Goldman. Central banks typically buy gold to safeguard against inflation or other deterioration of their home currencies. Gold has unexpectedly become one of the hottest financial assets on the market despite being one of the oldest investments in human history. Gold and other commodities do not offer the same potential for dividends or other returned shareholder value like stocks or guaranteed annual interest payments like bonds, making the metal’s rise more stark. Gold and bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency thought by some to be a new-school hedge against economic uncertainty, have gone on divergent paths since Trump announced the 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods and a 10% additional tariffs on Chinese imports (the Canadian and Mexican levies were later delayed). Gold prices are up 2% since Trump signed the tariff executive order Feb. 1, while bitcoin is down 6%. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Barhydt proposed that the price of Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto by market cap, could climb all the way to $700,000 per coin during this market cycle due to an incoming gigantic liquidity injection. He foresees a “cyclical Valhalla” to begin in Q1. Abra founder Bill Barhydt believes that BTC price at a whopping $350,000 is now the “base case” scenario. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading hands at $97,466, representing a 1.2% gain in the last 24 hours. Despite having lost 2.8% of its value over the last seven days, Barhydt thinks the only way is up for the world’s flagship cryptocurrency. Besides predicting that Bitcoin is on pace to hit $700K, the BTC veteran also shared ambitious targets for Ethereum and Solana’s SOL. Specifically, he argues that ETH and SOL could reach $8,000 and $900, respectively, in a base case. “High end of the range is ~2x these values,” Barhydt added. The rationale for Abra CEO’s bullish forecast is the new U.S. government under pro-crypto president Donald Trump. “My model is simple. This administration wants interest rates much lower, and they’ll do whatever they have to achieve that,” he explained. “They also need to refinance over $7T in debt. Tax cuts are coming. All of this equates to a massive liquidity injection whether via QE or some other means.” Barhydt was referring to quantitative easing (QE) — increasing the money supply — which has historically led to a drastic increase in the price of equities and crypto. Trump admin’s proposed tax cuts could boost this liquidity surge, aligning with what he terms the “cyclical Valhalla” — a period where daring investors could earn handsomely from the market’s evolving dynamics. “Cyclical Valhalla is coming. Those with brass balls will be rewarded accordingly,” the Bitcoin OG posited, before highlighting Q1 as the possible deadline for such liquidity injections to start. Barhydt is not the only one who is bullish on Bitcoin’s chances of hitting $700,000. Last month, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested that BTC could hit this lofty price point if it experienced much broader institutional adoption. Fink revealed that many people, including the operators of a sovereign wealth fund he met in Switzerland, are debating whether to have a 2% or 5% allocation to Bitcoin.

Title: ANSON FRERICKS: Let’s All Lift A Glass And Wish For This Famous Beer Company To Become American Again

Anheuser-Busch’s CEO wants to market its beer as “American made,” rather than “domestic”—the term that typically differentiates U.S. beer from “imports.” However, Anheuser-Busch isn’t really an American company. But maybe it’s time to make it one again. Anheuser-Busch hasn’t been American owned since 2008. That’s the year the 156-year-old American brewer was purchased by its Belgium-based, European rival, Inbev. The company was renamed Anheuser-Busch Inbev, and is now the largest beer company in the world, selling one in four beers globally. This globalization might have sounded good on paper, but it was a disaster for Anheuser Busch. In 2008, Anheuser-Busch produced over 100 million barrels of beer in the US and employed over 21,000 people. Today, it produces 60 million barrels and has shed thousands of jobs. The errors compounded over time. Following the takeover, Inbev imported executives from Belgium and Brazil to run sales and marketing in the US. It didn’t work. Marketing execs canceled partnerships with country music festivals and the Ultimate Fighting Championship and replaced them with techno concerts more common in Europe. Then came the forced plunge into Stakeholder Capitalism, ESG and DEI. In the U.S., companies historically operated to serve shareholders—i.e., to generate profits. The European model is different. It compels companies to serve all stakeholders, including activists, governments, the environment and non-profits. Around 2018, that started to change. Wall Street firms like BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, began foisting the stakeholder model on U.S. companies. Given its European roots, Anheuser-Busch Inbev quickly went all in. As the head of U.S. sales and distribution, I felt the changes immediately. Longstanding principles like merit disappeared. Commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion replaced them. A LGBTQ+ advocacy group called The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) monitored progress. By 2022, HRC required companies to make at least three “public commitments to the LGBTQ+ community,” including lobbying, donating to LGBTQ+ charities and favoring LGBTQ+ suppliers. If companies disobeyed, they lost their perfect HRC scores. Brands felt compelled to act. But as Bud Light soon learned, there was much more than an HRC score at stake. On April 1, 2023, the most popular beer in America, Bud Light, entered into a disastrous social media partnership with the transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney. They sent Dylan a commemorative Bud Light can to celebrate Dylan’s 365-day journey of transitioning from a biological male to a female. The reaction was explosive. Customers boycotted. Celebrities chimed in. Kid Rock was among the first to do so, posting a video of himself shooting Bud Lights with an AR-15 rifle. Anheuser-Busch’s CEO, Brendan Whitworth, fumbled the response. He neither apologized to loyal consumers for the controversial ad nor stood by Dylan Mulvaney as more progressive customers demanded. Bud Light was supposed to be “easy to drink, easy to enjoy.” It was the number one-rated beer brand because it was remarkably apolitical. Enjoyed by Democrats and Republicans alike. No more. Millions of customers ditched Bud Light. The stock price nose-dived. Forty-billion dollars of shareholder value was erased. The company still hasn’t recovered. Bud Light sales are down 40% since the controversy and it is now the number three-ranked beer brand in America. But it’s not too late for a comeback—if Bud Light returns to its roots. That means returning Bud Light to American owners. It wouldn’t be an unprecedented move. TikTok is being forced to sell in the US for similar reasons: It is owned by a foreign firm with values antithetical to the US. Is Anheuser-Busch Inbev capturing data of US citizens like TikTok? No. But has it harmed US culture and created job losses? Yes. And in this case, there’s no need for government intervention, since a sale would be in Inbev’s best interests too. Inbev clearly doesn’t know what it’s doing; a sale would allow it to recoup its losses while entrusting Anheuser-Busch’s future to someone who understands the American market. New owners could revive the American icon. A group like Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway or a consortium of private equity firms led by Stephen Schwartzman’s BlackStone could buy the US business for $30 billion to $40 billion. They could hire an American management team dedicated to making Anheuser-Busch the greatest American comeback story in corporate history. Start with a media blitz. Apologize for the failures of past management. Sell a future where beer is fun and apolitical again. Launch or acquire some healthier, non-alcohol brands to become a total beverage company. Hire brilliant marketers. Drive sales growth. Label products “American made” on menus across the country. All Americans can cheers to that.

Title: Conservatives Urge Congress to Confirm 'Strong' Antitrust Advocate Mark Meador for FTC

Conservative leaders on Monday wrote to Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Cruz (R-TX), urging Congress to confirm Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner nominee Mark Meador, who will be a strong advocate for “strong, yet targeted” antitrust and consumer protection enforcement. The conservative coalition contended that President Donald Trump’s landslide election gave him a “clear mission,” which is to “take our country back from the elites, liberal mobs, and deep state directing our country towards certain disaster.” The conservatives wrote that confirming Meador, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation who served as Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) deputy chief counsel for antitrust and competition policy, is essential to realizing Trump’s goal of removing the malign influence of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as well as environment, social, and governance (ESG) corporate policies from unduly influencing America’s children. Read letter here: Meador Conservative Letter by jmanship on Scribd They noted Cruz “rightly said” that “every parent with a young child or a teenager either worries about, or knows first-hand, the real harms and dangers of addicted and anxiety-inducing social media.” The coalition noted other issues the FTC urgently needs to address, including: “If we want to make any headway on any of these important issues, we need a strong FTC; these AGs [attorneys general] cannot do it alone,” the conservatives contended. The leaders include: They continued: Mr. Meador has been a long-time advocate for strong, yet targeted antitrust and consumer protection enforcement. He is a well-regarded and influential antitrust scholar. He also has the resume to back it up spanning across both antitrust agencies and as a staffer on Capitol Hill. President Trump could have not chosen a better champion to assist in him ushering in America’s golden age. “Thus, we respectfully request that the Senate Commerce Committee expedite Mr. Meador’s confirmation, so that we can get back on track,” the conservatives wrote to Cruz and the Commerce Committee.

Title: Michelin star awards 2025: Which Irish restaurants will be recognised?

Gah! Found another newly awarded Bib Gourmand lurking. In our defense it was hiding in the UK listings, whereas we consider our restaurants (and their accolades) on an all island basis. mrDeanes in Belfast is the casual dining option opened by Michael Deane in Belfast last year. Here’s what the inspectors said: “Its full name, ‘mrDeanes Bistro, Bar and Social’, paints a perfect picture of this spacious addition to Michael Deane’s ever-evolving Belfast empire. Grab a cocktail at the bar before taking your seat in a restaurant that’s bursting with vitality. The eminently appealing menu offers well-executed takes on dishes from all over the world, be it Gaeng Phed red curry or ‘entrecôte au poivre’. There’s a palpable generosity to the place too, with the food and wine both offering great value for money.” Well done mrDeanes! Ok, that’s a wrap for another year. Hungry work indeed. I’m off to check out bookings. All current holders of Michelin stars (15 one-stars and 5 two-stars) in Ireland retained their stars. Here’s the updated at-a-glance list. For details go to guide.michelin.com/en/ Two stars One star OK, we’ve ferreted out who the new Bib Gourmands (“good food at moderate prices”) in Ireland went to: Owner Zsolt Lukács was awarded the UK & Ireland Sommelier award, and with it a Bib Gourmand. They inspectors said of Daróg: “There’s a huge amount of passion channelled into this welcoming little wine bar. Hungarian-born Zsolt Lukács has an infectious enthusiasm for wine, which comes across in his carefully curated list that gravitates towards small artisan producers using organic and biodynamic methods. Accompanying the wine is a selection of sharing plates – like kingfish crudo – that are exactingly executed, deliver on flavour and provide brilliant value for money. The regularly changing artwork from local artists is on sale and is curated by co-owner Edel." Owned by chef Ahmet Dede, holder of two stars for his Dede restaurant in Baltimore, this is the more informal baby sister. Here the inspectors said: “With a name meaning ‘Baby Dede’, this second Baltimore venture from Chef Ahmet Dede is an ode to his family and comes with all the homespun charm you’d expect. Located mere feet away from his acclaimed flagship restaurant, this is a more relaxed affair but the great value sharing plates retain the older sibling’s ethos of Turkish flavours married with Irish produce. Each dish – from a unique take on oyster chowder to Ahmet’s signature ‘içli köfte’ – is bright, fresh and wholly satisfying." Well that’s good luck and good night from the Michelin Ceremony in Glasgow. How did Ireland fare? One star: Adam Nevin at the Morrison Rooms in Carton House, Maynooth, Co Kildare. Richard Picard-Edwards, Ballyfin Demesne, Mountrath Co Laois. Danny Africano, Lignum Restaurant, Loughrea, Co Galway. Sommelier of the Year: Zsolt Lukács of Daróg Wine Bar, Galway City. Awwwwwww.... that’s it. Just the one news three star which went to Moor Hall. Another year and Ireland misses out on that elusive third star. Now, the NEW THREE STARS Moor Hall, under Mark Birchall, in Aughton, England (Aughton there be one for Chapter One??? c’mon Ireland!!!) ehhhh ... that should read 40 years the Waterside Inn on the go at three stars (reasons I’m not an accountant) Waterside got its third star in 1985 – so that’s 30 years operating at that level. Alain Ducasse quite emotional. OK the biggest of the biggies now – the 3-star awards. Those retaining three stars: Fat Duck; Waterside Inn; Alain Ducasse at Dorchester, Core by Claire Smyth; Sketch, the Lecture Room and Library; Restaurant Gordon Ramsay; The Ledbury; Hélène Darroze at the Connaught. (might have missed one there, but hopefully not) Last two star to Angelo Sato to the pretty coolly named Humble Chicken in London. Verry young looking guy, of few words, except to say he didn’t have a great start in life, so this means a great deal. John looks like everybody’s lovely uncle. “I’ve waited 50 years for this. I thought we were forgotten. we carried on cooking to the best of our ability, but the experience comes with the service.” OK, now it’s the two-star awards. Will we feature? First up Hide and Fox in Kent – Susan says it’s the perrrrrfect country restaurant. I bet it is! The Ritz, London – John Williams MBE is the chef, and he’s getting a standing ovation. Green stars now. Those restaurants that can minimise their environmental footprint – sustainable gastronomy. Kai in Galway is the only holder of this award in Ireland. Quite the achievement when I don’t think they even have a kitchen garden feeding their restaurant. OK, no new gongs for Ireland in this category. Must try harder ... Interesting segment here about women chefs, first-person stories for a wide selection of women of what it’s like operating in a professional kitchen. How they have to break stereotypes re being serious about a cooking career. Head chef women are expected to do everything in their kitchens, men are usually allowed to “just cook”. Imposter syndrome is rife. The media defer to men for opinions all the time. More women need to enter competitions. general experience is that every man believes they are the best (generally when not), women have to be persuaded. And that’s it for the one-star awards – 22 new winners in total. And a glorious, delicious, well-deserved three for Ireland: Adam Nevin, Carton House; Richard Picard-Edwards, Ballyfin Demesne; Danny Africano, Lignum, Co Galway. And don’t forget Best Sommelier UK and Ireland, Zsolt Lukács of Daróg, Galway. Whoop! Whoop! It’s raining Irish stars(ish)! Great news for Ballyfin. The rumour mill had been rife, and went into overdrive when Ballyfin was awarded three Michelin Keys last year – its new award category for top quality hotels. Chef Richard Picard-Edwards joined Ballyfin in April 2023 from the Mandarin Oriental Bittescombe Lodge in the UK. Since arriving the bar has been set at Michelin-star level, served up in a stunning eight-course menu (€145). The restaurant is now open to non-residents too, so at least you don’t have to remortgage the house for an overnight with dinner. Corinna Hardgrave visited last October, when she described the Jerusalem artichoke cream as “downright dazzling”. Three years ago our restaurant critic Corinna Hardgrave said in her Lignum Review she would be “astonished” if Lignum didn’t land a star in the following year. Well dear reader, she, and many others have been disappointed every year since. Located a bit off the well-trod Michelin track in Loughrea, Co Galway, since opening in 2017 chef/proprietor Danny Africano and wife Molly Keane have been firmly in the sights of the Michelin star judges. With a focus on wood-fired cooking it offers a €145, 10-course tasting menu, showcasing seasonal Irish and Italian ingredients. Well worth a detour – in the truest Michelin sense! Danny Africano of Lignum in Loughrea, Co Galway. They’ve been at it since 2017 – recognition at last! Star for Tom Barnes of Skof in Manchester.This was hotly anticipated Star for Lyla in Edinburgh. Scotland doing verrrryyyy well. Can’t wait for them to host the ceremony in Ireland!!! Cardiff gets its first Michelin Star! Going to Tom Waters of Gorse Gary Foulkes at Cornus in London picks up a star. Adam Nevin is formerly of The Grill at The Dorchester, The Hand and Flowers and The Westbury in London. A Maynooth native he only took up the position at Carton House in September 2023. I was lucky enough to dine here a couple of months ago, and what an experience. The dining room, with Lafranchini brothers stuccowork is sensational and steeped in history, but the food is the real star of the show. The tasting menu is about €135, or you can opt for the €110 chef’s five course menu. Recently Mickael Viljanen of Chapter One sang the praises of Nevin’s informal Sunday lunch menu – high praise indeed. Read Corinna Hardgrave’s review from February 2024 here Waheyyyy!!! First Michelin star for Adam Nevin of the Morrison Rooms at Carton House. This guy is only 30, and playing a stormer!!! The people behind Daróg in Galway are husband-and-wife team Zsolt Lukács and Edel McMahon. Lukács was the sommelier at Aniar for a long time, and McMahon is a sister of JP McMahon, well known chef owner of Aniar, prolific food writer and all round food genius. Fantastic! Sommelier award goes to Zsolt Lukacs of Daróg (we knew Daróg was in there somewhere). Great win for a lovely little Irish operation - well deserved!! Service award goes to Jasmine Sherry of Fish Shop a tiny operation in Ballater in the Scottish Highlands. Mentor chef awards goes to Adam Byatt, Trinity restaurant in Clapham, London. Young chef award going to Ash Venezuela-Heeger from River Rabbit restaurant in Birmingham. 36 new bibs in total across UK and Ireland. Two for Ireland, but we don’t find out until they update the guide after the ceremony. Jeez. Not a very fun teaser - especially if you’re a hopeful chef. It’s possible Daróg is in there, but that’s speculation. More as we can confirm it... Susan is back and reminding us that the guide isn’t just about stars. This year 145 new restaurants have been added to the 3000+ in the guide. Now for the Bib Gourmands - quality food at affordable prices. Glasgow has added two new Bibs. Great. What about the Irish ones? Keep you posted. Ok, we’ve just had Mairi Gougeon, cabinet secretary fo rural affairs, land reform and islands. She makes the important point how there would be no awards without the fabulous fresh produce from our land and seas. Followed by lovely pics of Scotland. Aye, aye here comes Gwendal Poullennec international director of the Michelin Guide, getting to the meat and potatoes now. It’s the 125th anniversary of the Michelin guide, so a landmark year for the principles of culinary excellence. Next up we have councillor Susan Aitken, leader of Glasgow City Council. Delighted she is for she and the city to be hosting. Gotta say there’s a distracting and ominous background music that feels like we’ve all suddenly entered the twighlight zone. Our host is Amanda Stretton, UK motorsports racing driver and broadcaster, who tells us this is the first time the ceremony has taken place outside of England. Well this is lovely. A very atmospheric bagpipe and organ introduction - a nice reminder of our surrounds at the beautiful looking Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum in Glasgow, Scotland. Talk about all sound, no picture. We’re all on tenterhooks waiting for the ceremony to begin.... oh hang, on! here we go!!! Speculation has been mounting all day as to who the lucky new recipients of stars might be. Smart money at this point is on The Morrison Room at Carton House, Maynooth; Ballyfin Demesne in Laois; Library Street, Dublin 2; Lignum, Co Galway. Meanwhile there’s the eternal will we/won’t we ever attain that third Michelin Star in Ireland. In with a shout would have to be Chapter One, and then there’s always Terre at Castlemartyr, or Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud. All will soon be revealed... We may be just 5 minutes away from the awards starting and if you were ever in any doubt as to how closely Michelin holds its cards to its chest, we can tell you, pretty damn close. We don’t know who is hosting, or how the ceremony will play out, ie when will the Bib Gourmands be announced? at the beginning? at the end? Anyone’s guess. Want to know what the Michelin inspectors think of our current Michelin star restaurants, here’s what they said about each in the 2024 edition of the guide Michelin-starred restaurants in Ireland, 2024: The complete guide: As our countdown to 6pm continues, it’s worth noting that the ceremony only awards NEW stars and Bibs. If a current holder of a Michelin-star or Bib Gourmand is unlucky enough to lose its star, this will only become apparent after the ceremony when Michelin updates its listing to add new winners, and omit those who have failed to retain their award. While tonight is all about looking ahead, it’s good to remember too those that blazed the trail. Back in 1974, Declan Ryan won Ireland’s first Michelin star at the Arbutus Lodge restaurant in Cork. This week he spoke to Barry Roche about what it was like to win such an accolade back then, while Alan Betson shot some lovely video of Declan in West Cork cooking up a salmon and foraged sorrel classic. What’s all the fuss about Michelin stars anyway? The awards have a very interesting back story. They were the brainchild in 1900 of the tyre manufacturing brothers André and Edouard Michelin. There are now more than 3,000 Michelin-starred restaurants in close to 40 countries. The inspectors, who book anonymously and pay their bill in full, have been active in Ireland since 1974. There are degrees of recognition within the guide, the highest being Michelin star level. The impact and pressure of achieving and retaining a star is considerable. This article from 2023 give a nice insight to just what’s involved: Michelin stars: The power to make or break careers, businesses – and lives Put simply there are levels of inclusion in the Michelin guide which operate as follows: At the lowest level, a restaurant can simply be listed in the Guide. That’s an achievement in itself. Bib Gourmand: This is awarded for good food at moderate prices. Last year Ireland added five new Bib Gourmands, bringing its tally here to 18. Usually these are announced a week or two before the Michelin stars, but this year they will announce them tonight along with the stars. These are always of interest because realistically they are the restaurants most ordinary diners can hope to afford, and they can be very good without being too formal. Then, the stars: Good evening and welcome to the most exciting night on the fine dining restaurant calendar. Chefs, proprietors, kitchen teams, gourmets and judges are gathering in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum in Glasgow, Scotland for the annual Britain & Ireland Michelin Guide ceremony where this year’s winners of the highly coveted Michelin stars for culinary excellence will be announced. Starting at 6pm the ceremony (whose organisers swear the winners in attendance to secrecy in advance) will reveal those restaurants that have been successful in attaining (or adding) a star following visits and assessments from the judges in the last 12 months.
