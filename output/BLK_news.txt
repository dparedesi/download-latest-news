Title: Future of Work: Intergenerational Insights & Inclusivity at WIL Day

There is something dynamic, inspiring, and almost… magical when you are sitting at the Women in Leadership (WIL) Day’s roundtable table; on your left, there is a senior executive of a renowned company, and on your right, another leader of the industry that you always dreamed of pursuing. Suddenly, all eyes and ears are on you as you share your perspectives of the world, and you feel HEARD. However, the table configuration has not always looked like this—with a mixture of students and industry professionals of both genders, cultures, and backgrounds, exchanging and learning from each other. In the past, not long ago, not everyone had the opportunity to speak up. The configuration has changed, and the WIL Day 2025 has proven the importance of intergenerational conversations on the future of work and inclusiveness at the workplace. WIL Day 2025 was nothing short of “inspiring, enriching, thought-provoking, and relevant”, as described by the CEO and Head of Territory for BNP Paribas Group in Switzerland, Ms. Enna Pariset, and the Chair of the Board of BlackRock Asset Management Switzerland Ltd, Dr. Mirjam Staub-Bisang. As we look toward the future of work, there is relevance in looking back into the past to see how the workplace has evolved. Based on Dr. Mirjam Staub-Bisang’s experience, in the past, earlier generations rarely involved younger voices in conversations at the management level or in the competitive landscape of employment. Today, however, the GenZ seeks not only a seat at the table but also meaningful opportunities to be heard while expecting long-term stability in their careers and purpose in their work. Enna Pariset, who manages over 1,200 people in Switzerland and hired 150 people in the past 2 years, noted the clear importance of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) topics for GenZ, with the new graduates often asking questions about company engagement during the interviews or at university graduate fairs. In the past, women fought the battles for equality to open the doors for the new generation entering the workforce. Today, we walk through those doors with our own challenges, adapting to the ever-changing environments with new technology, balancing choices and options, and, more deeply, searching for a sense of purpose and belonging everywhere. The demand for an environment of inclusiveness for all types of diversity (e.g. gender, age, cognitive and physical diversity) is growing. Hence, the need for companies to adapt to new ways of working, expectations, and giving and receiving feedback is emerging with the nonstop pace of change where tools for inclusiveness shape the workplace. But how do we figure out the type of social change that is happening and where the future of work is heading? By listening, sharing, and building a bridge between curious young leaders of GenZ and seasoned professionals who have been shaping different industries. WIL Day 2025 has been described as an embodiment of reverse mentoring, a pertinent topic that sparked great importance in today’s conversations, workplace, and life in general. There are not just more women leaders but more ages and voices that bring diverse perspectives to the table to show that it is valuable to include everyone. Ms Pariset noted the importance of DEI policies in the workplace and highlighted that BNP Paribas (Suisse) SA received the Swiss LGBTI-label in 2024 for the second consecutive year. Dr. Staub-Bisang expressed that she lacked female role models growing up. Ms Pariset has always looked up to her mother who was an accomplished lawyer. Now, they find themselves as role models for us students, which is exactly what GenZ needs in order to understand that the possibilities are endless. We are encouraged to share our perspectives and curiosity; in return, we receive inspiring stories of valuable experiences and empowerment. The logo of BNP Paribas is the bank for a changing world and Ms Pariset believes that embracing change is key to progress and success and as the CEO, she is often the one who initiates changes, saying that “this is the way the world works, the winners are those who can anticipate change”. Although change can mean uncertainty, it is the only constant in every situation. And now more than ever, we can seek guidance in the lessons learned by our role models. The WIL Initiative promotes ACTION by accompany promising individuals for growth, expanding network and opportunities for development, developing tailored solutions for companies, and creating innovative women-related projects.

Title: Merz Announces New German Government, Cites Concerns About Russia, US Tariffs

By Ray Furlong April 09, 2025 Germany's Christian Democrat leader Friedrich Merz has announced that talks on forming a new coalition government have been completed, stating it would aim to take office in early May. Merz noted the coalition talks took place amid "growing international political tensions," citing Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and US tariffs. "The Russian aggressor, Putin, shows no willingness to end the war and to let the guns go silent. At the same time, economic uncertainties are growing enormously. Just this week, US government decisions have caused new turbulence," Merz said. Merz will be the new German chancellor in a coalition with the Social Democrats, led by Lars Klingbeil, who is expected to be Finance Minister. Support For Ukraine As the new government was announced, its 144-page policy plan was published, pledging strong support for Ukraine. "We will provide comprehensive support to Ukraine so that it can effectively defend itself against the Russian aggressor and assert itself in negotiations," it says. Germany's outgoing government, which is led by the Social Democrats under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has been a key supplier of military and economic aid to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Merz, as opposition leader, has often called on it to be faster and bolder in this. But it's not clear what this will mean in practice. During a recent visit to Berlin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy voiced the hope that the new government would supply Taurus cruise missiles -- a longstanding request. Merz, at the time, was noncommittal. The new government is expected to significantly boost Germany's defense budget, although it's not clear by exactly how much. Even before taking office, Merz has pushed a constitutional reform through the German parliament that means strict limits on government debt no longer apply to defense spending. "Our security is currently more endangered than at any time since the end of the Cold War. The greatest and most direct threat comes from Russia," says the new coalition's policy document. It adds that "Putin's pursuit of power threatens the rules-based international order." Trump Tariffs There's no mention of the US president in the document. But when Merz was asked about US ties by a foreign journalist, he switched briefly to English to say, "The message to Donald Trump is: Germany is back on track, Germany will fulfil the obligations in terms of defense." Asked about US tariffs, Merz said Europe should seek a joint response. His words came hours after EU countries agreed a range of countermeasures, including staggered tariffs on selected imports from the United States beginning on April 15. Merz is a lifelong transatlantacist who also spent four years working for the US investment company BlackRock. After his election victory in February, amid a tense start in ties between Europe and the new US administration, he said Europe must secure "independence" from Washington in terms of defense. Still, the coalition agreement says the relationship with Washington is of "paramount importance." "In trade policy, we seek close cooperation with all of North America. The trans-Atlantic economic area offers the best conditions for success in global competition," it states. Iran's Nuclear Program The document also reaffirms Germany's commitment to working with Washington and other Western partners to end Iran's nuclear program. "We support international sanctions against the Iranian regime and will push for the Revolutionary Guards to be put on the EU list of terror organizations," it says. The new government's domestic priorities include promises to boost growth via economic reforms and to crackdown on illegal immigration. The new coalition needs to be approved by Social Democrat party members and the senior leadership of the Christian Democrats, before a confidence vote in parliament.

Title: China vows response to 'the end' after US' new 50% tariff threat

Global Times Economic coercion and blackmail underscores Washington's hegemonic mindset: expert By Ma Jingjing Published: Apr 09, 2025 12:23 AM Chinese Foreign Ministry and Commerce Ministry on Tuesday vowed to take countermeasures to safeguard rights and interests, in response to US President Donald Trump's recent claims of escalating tariffs unless China withdrew its retaliatory tariffs against the US by April 8. In a post on Truth Social on Monday, the US president has threatened China with an extra 50 percent tariff on goods imported into the US if China does not withdraw its 34 percent counter-tariff on US products, according to CNBC. "We will not let anyone take away the Chinese people's legitimate right to development. We will not tolerate any attempt to harm China's sovereignty, security and development interests. We will continue to take resolute and strong measures to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in response at the regular Foreign Ministry press conference on Tuesday. Lin said that judging from its actions, the US doesn't seem to be serious about having talks right now. "If the US truly wants to talk, it should let people see that they're ready to treat others with equality, respect and mutual benefit. If the US decides not to care about the interests of the US itself, China and the rest of the world, and is determined to fight a tariff and trade war, China's response will continue to the end," Lin said. In a statement published on its website on Tuesday, China's Commerce Ministry said China will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its rights and interests should the US escalate its tariff measures. Citing sources or experts, Niutanqin, one of the self-media accounts, posted on Tuesday that China could take six possible measures against the US' tariffs, including significantly increasing tariffs on US agricultural products such as soybeans and sorghum, banning US poultry imports, suspending China-US cooperation on fentanyl-related issues, imposing curbs on services trade with the US, reducing or banning the import of US films, and investigating the intellectual property benefits of US companies operating in China. China will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its legitimate and lawful rights and interests, Lin said on Tuesday, noting that the ministry does not comment on what's been said on the internet. Escalated pressure While showing no intention to pause the sweeping "reciprocal tariffs," Trump continues to intensify pressure on its trade partners including China, the EU, Japan and Canada. "The European Union's been very bad to us," Trump told reporters at the White House, accusing European nations of not buying enough US goods. "They're going to have to buy their energy from us, because they need it and they're going to have to buy it from us. They can buy it, we can knock off $350 billion in one week," Reuters reported, citing the US president. On Monday evening, the European Commission proposed its first retaliatory tariffs at 25 percent on a range of US imports in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, Reuters reported, citing an internal document. The tariffs on some goods will take effect on May 16 and others later in the year, on December 1, the document said, Reuters reported. In addition, Trump wrote in another post on Truth Social on Monday that Japan has "treated the US very poorly on Trade. They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs." The US Department of Commerce, as part of an annual review process, plans to hike duties on Canadian lumber from 14.4 percent to 34.45 percent, CNN reported on Monday, citing published and unpublished filings in the Federal Register. "The economic coercion and blackmail underscores Washington's hegemonic mindset - seeking 'America First' and 'American exceptionalism' by forcing others to make sacrifices," He Weiwen, a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The US' unilateral and protectionist behaviors run counter to the WTO's multilateral trading rules as well as other countries' legitimate rights and interests, He said, stressing that China's resolute countermeasures against US bullying are necessary to safeguard true multilateralism and maintain the multilateral trading system. Self-inflicted isolation "By imposing high tariffs on all of its trade partners, including China, the US risks trade and economic isolation," Yu Miaojie, president of Liaoning University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. In the short term, global trade may be adversely affected and global growth may be dragged down. However, the US' tariffs will have limited impact on China's exports, given that the country has made efforts to diversify export destinations over the past several years and form a new pattern of all-round opening-up in various fields and sectors, Yu said. "Instead, US tariffs will lead to higher prices, adding to inflationary pressure while slowing US economic growth," he said. Larry Fink, CEO of US multinational investment firm BlackRock, said US stock markets could fall another 20 percent as steep US tariffs will lead some investors to believe the US economy may already be contracting, Reuters reported. "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," Fink told the Economic Club of New York on Monday, Reuters said. Ken Langone, co-founder of US home improvement specialty retailer Home Depot, blasted the tariffs, describing the 34 percent tariff rate on China as "too aggressive, too soon," the Financial Times reported. "I believe he's been poorly advised by his advisers about this trade situation - and the formula they're applying," said Langone The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents millions of US businesses big and small but which is heavily funded by industry titans, is considering suing the Trump administration to block the implementation of Trump's new tariffs set to go into effect Wednesday, Fortune reported on Tuesday, citing sources with direct knowledge of the discussions. The US Chamber could argue that Trump's invocation of emergency powers to impose the new tariffs is illegal. Last week a nonprofit called New Civil Liberties Alliance took a similar approach, filing suit on behalf of a small business owner who imports goods from China, arguing that the US President did not have the legal authority to impose his February tariffs on China, according to the report. "Faced with the US' bullying practices, all other economies will have to figure out how to overcome challenges. Thus, those economies should unite, and continue to promote bilateral and multilateral cooperation," Chen Fengying, a research fellow at the Beijing-based China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Tuesday. China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) hosted a roundtable meeting with US-funded companies on Sunday, reaffirming the country's commitment to reform and opening-up amid global trade tensions, according to a statement on the MOFCOM website on Monday. Regardless of global uncertainties, China remains resolute in its path toward reform and opening-up, Ling Ji, vice minister of commerce and deputy China international trade representative, said at the meeting, noting that multilateralism is the inevitable solution to the challenges facing the world and that China's door to the outside world will only open wider.

Title: BTC
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2025/04/10/btc/
Time Published: 2025-04-10T05:59:47Z
Full Content:
As of April 10, 2025, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at approximately $82,107 USD. The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price is attributed to President Trump’s announcement on April 9, 2025, of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, which led to a broad market rally benefiting digital currencies and crypto-related stocks. Despite this uptick, Bitcoin remains about 24.68% below its all-time high of $109,225 reached in January 2025. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and external factors such as geopolitical events and regulatory changes can significantly impact prices. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. … Key Points Current Price As of recent checks, Bitcoin’s price is approximately $81,975 USD, but given its volatility, this may have changed. For the latest price, you can check Coinbase or CoinMarketCap. What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, meaning it operates without a central bank or authority. It uses blockchain technology, a public ledger, to record transactions securely and transparently. Created in 2008 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it began use in 2009 and is often seen as an investment, though some countries, like El Salvador, have adopted it as legal tender. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Bitcoin (BTC) This section provides a comprehensive overview of Bitcoin (BTC), addressing the user’s query with detailed insights derived from recent data and analysis. The focus is on the current price, a description of Bitcoin, and additional context to ensure a thorough understanding. Introduction to Bitcoin Bitcoin, abbreviated as BTC, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency, introduced in 2008 by an unknown entity using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It began operational use in 2009 with the release of its open-source implementation. The currency is based on a free-market ideology and operates on a peer-to-peer network, utilizing blockchain technology to record transactions. This decentralized nature means it functions without central oversight, relying on nodes (computers) that maintain a public distributed ledger. Transactions are validated through cryptography, making it secure and resistant to fraud, provided users protect sensitive data. Bitcoin has been adopted as legal tender in El Salvador since 2021, marking a significant milestone in its acceptance. However, it is primarily viewed as an investment, with some scholars describing it as an economic bubble due to its volatility. Its pseudonymous nature has also attracted regulatory scrutiny, leading to bans in several countries by 2021 due to concerns over criminal use. Current Price Analysis The current price of Bitcoin, as of recent data gathered on April 9, 2025, at around 10:59 PM PDT, is approximately $81,975 USD. This figure is derived from multiple sources to ensure accuracy, given Bitcoin’s high volatility. Specifically: These prices were checked across different platforms to account for potential discrepancies, which can arise due to the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. The slight variations ($81,640.27 to $82,031) reflect real-time market fluctuations, and the chosen figure of $81,975 USD represents a reasonable average based on the most recent data. Given the time of checking (late evening on April 9, 2025), and the rapid changes in crypto prices, users are advised to verify the latest price on platforms like Coinbase for real-time updates. Market Context and Recent Developments Bitcoin’s price has been subject to significant volatility, influenced by global economic events. Recent news highlights include: These events underscore Bitcoin’s sensitivity to macroeconomic factors and regulatory news, contributing to its price swings. The circulating supply is approximately 19,849,081 BTC, with a maximum supply capped at 21,000,000 BTC, which is expected to be fully mined by around 2140, affecting long-term scarcity and value. Additional Metrics and Technical Details To provide a fuller picture, here are some additional metrics from recent data: These figures, particularly from CoinMarketCap, illustrate Bitcoin’s market size and trading activity, which are crucial for investors. The all-time high of $109,114.88, reached earlier in 2025, shows the potential for significant gains, while the all-time low reflects its early days. Regulatory and Social Context Bitcoin’s adoption has been controversial. While El Salvador’s adoption as legal tender in 2021 is notable, other countries have banned it due to concerns over its use in criminal activities, given its pseudonymous nature. This regulatory landscape adds complexity to its market dynamics, with ongoing debates about its role as a currency versus an investment asset. Recent news also mentions potential U.S. crypto regulations and European financial stability concerns, highlighting the interplay between crypto and traditional finance. Conclusion In summary, Bitcoin (BTC) is a pioneering decentralized cryptocurrency with a current price of approximately $81,975 USD, subject to rapid changes. It operates on blockchain technology, offering secure, peer-to-peer transactions without central authority. Its market is volatile, influenced by global events and regulatory developments, and it remains a significant topic in both investment and regulatory discussions.

Title: Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama bases

Time Published: 2025-04-10T05:46:25Z
Full Content:
During a visit to Panama, Hegseth suggested that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Since coming to power in January, Trump has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the interoceanic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth on Wednesday suggested the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could again be used to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The US has long participated in military exercises in Panama. But a longer-term rotational force -- like the one the US maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino.

Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He stated that the United States is not looking for war with China, but will counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," the secretary said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. The canal is run by an independent Panamanian authority and is legally bound to be open to all nations. But Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has for decades operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors like energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. On Wednesday the firm rejected an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison last month announced a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal.

Since coming to power in January, Trump has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the interoceanic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth on Wednesday suggested the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could again be used to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride.

Title: Hegseth says China's military presence in Western Hemisphere is 'too large'

U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has again put China at the center of U.S. priorities in the Western Hemisphere, one day after calling the world power a threat to the Panama Canal PANAMA CITY -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth focused again on China's presence in the Western Hemisphere Wednesday, one day after calling the world power a threat to the Panama Canal. Speaking at a regional security conference, Hegseth said that China-based companies were controlling land and critical infrastructure in strategic sectors. “China’s military has too large of a presence in the Western Hemisphere,” Hegseth said. “Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain.” He called on the region’s governments to work together to deter China and address threats posed by transnational drug cartels and mass immigration. Hegseth was speaking a day after meeting Panama's President José Raúl Mulino and touring the Panama Canal. The two countries agreed to step up security coordination and appeared to say they would work toward a way to pay back fees that U.S. warships pay to pass through the Panama Canal. The visit comes amid tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated assertions that the U.S. is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations — allegations that Panama has denied. Shortly after Hegseth and Mulino met, the Chinese Embassy in Panama criticized the U.S. government in a statement on X, saying Washington had used “blackmail” to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a “sovereign decision of Panama ... and something the U.S. doesn’t have the right to interfere in.” On Wednesday, Hegseth said, “I don’t know anything about blackmail." The concern about China's influence over the waterway was provoked by Hong Kong-based consortium CK Hutchison holding a 25-year lease on ports at either end of the canal. The Panamanian government announced that the lease was being audited and late Monday concluded that there were irregularities, which CK Hutchison denied in a statement Wednesday. CK Hutchison has already announced that it would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete. Later Wednesday, Hegseth said that he would sign an agreement with Panama concerning the security and operation of the Panama Canal that would allow U.S. warships to “sail first and free.” The fact that the U.S. has a treaty obligation to protect the canal, but also had to pay to move its warships between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans had been one of the Trump administration’s complaints. Panama's Canal Affairs Minister José Ramón Icaza, said the two governments would look for a mechanism to repay the fees from U.S. warships to use the canal. He said annually they had paid on average $5 million to $7 million. The canal generated about $2.4 billion for the government in the last fiscal year, he said. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: ​​Pete Hegseth announces ‘framework’ of Panama Canal deal agreed to – will permit US warships to travel ‘first and free’

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Wednesday that U.S. and Panama officials would sign a “framework” agreement allowing U.S. warships to travel “first and free” through the Panama Canal. Hegseth said the two countries had already signed a memorandum of understanding on security cooperation and that they would finalize a document guaranteeing U.S. warships and auxiliary vessels priority, toll-free passage through the canal. When Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama earlier this year, the State Department claimed it had secured a deal for the free passage of U.S. warships. But Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino denied any such agreement had been reached. “I completely reject that statement,” Mulino said at the time. The Panama Canal Authority also said it had “not made any adjustments” to its fee structure. Earlier Wednesday, Hegseth warned that China’s military presence in the Western Hemisphere is “too large” as he visited Panama to meet with the nation’s officials, visit U.S. troops and tour the canal ports. “Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain,” Hegseth said in brief remarks to the press. “China’s military has too large of a presence in the Western Hemisphere. They operate military facilities and ground stations that extend their reach into space. They exploit natural resources and land to fuel China’s global military ambitions. China’s factory fishing fleets are stealing food from our nations and from our people.” He added that war with China is “not inevitable,” and the U.S. does not seek war in any form. “Together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China’s threats in this hemisphere.” To strengthen military ties with Panama and reassert influence over the canal, the U.S. will deploy the USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship, to the region. Hegseth vowed Tuesday that the U.S. will “take back” the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, pointing to port operations controlled by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. The secretary later said Wednesday that he and Panamanian officials would be signing an agreement that U.S. warships would travel “first and free” through the Panama Canal. Last month the conglomerate agreed to a $19 billion deal to sell a group of 43 ports, including two in Panama, to U.S.-based BlackRock, Trump hailed the agreement, seen as a solution to his complaints that the canal was owned by China, but now that deal may fall apart. China has criticized the deal, opening up antitrust probes, and a Panamanian official has accused CK Hutchison of failing to properly renew its contract in 2021 and owing the country $300 million. After meeting with Mulino, Hegseth said Tuesday the U.S. will not allow China to threaten the canal’s operation. “To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defense and security cooperation than we have in decades,” he said. Hegseth alluded to the ports owned by CK Hutchison. “China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area,” he said. “That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable.” The Chinese embassy in Panama hit back: “The U.S. has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the ‘theoretical Chinese threat’ in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United States’ own geopolitical interests.” The war of words in Panama comes as China and the U.S. are now locked in a trade war, where Trump slapped Chinese goods with a total 104% tariff. China retaliated with 84% tariffs on U.S. goods.

Title: XRP ETF Launch Impresses Even In Bear Market, Says Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Teucrium’s newly launched 2x XRP ETF on the New York Stocks Exchange recorded $5.43 million in turnover during its first day of trading on April 8, despite XRP prices hitting a five-month low. The ETF, trading under the ticker XXRP, achieved this milestone as cryptocurrency markets faced widespread selling pressure. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called the performance “very respectable” given the current bearish market conditions. According to market data, XRP’s price dropped to $1.61 on Monday, marking its lowest point in five months. The price briefly recovered to over $1.87 on Tuesday before falling again to $1.69 by evening. Even with these unstable price movements, Teucrium moved forward with its ETF launch, aiming to give investors a way to profit from price swings in either direction. $XXRP (2x XRP ETF) saw $5mil in volume on Day One, very respectable, esp considering the mkt conditions. That puts it in approx top 5% of new ETF launches, and about 4x what the 2x Solana ETF $SOLT did (altho both 200x less than King IBIT). pic.twitter.com/u3QQq5yuHv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 8, 2025 Based on reports from Bloomberg’s Balchunas, the XXRP ETF’s first-day trading volume was about four times higher than what Solana’s similar 2x ETF saw on its launch day. This performance puts Teucrium’s product in the top 5% of all new ETF launches. However, the $5.43 million figure still pales in comparison to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF debut, which saw trading volume roughly 200 times larger. The altcoin community has responded positively to the ETF launch, especially considering the harsh market conditions. Data shows that 137,000 traders faced liquidations in the 24 hours surrounding the launch, with total losses exceeding $413 million across cryptocurrency markets. Some XRP supporters have suggested that while XXRP’s volume was much smaller than BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), a potential spot ETF (which some have dubbed “IXRP”) could provide stronger competition. Unlike spot ETFs that directly hold the underlying asset, Teucrium’s XXRP does not invest directly in XRP tokens. Instead, it’s designed to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP’s price movements, which amplifies both gains and losses for investors. Community figure Crypto Eri warned about the ETF’s built-in risk factors, noting that even if XRP’s price stays flat, volatility alone could cause significant losses. For example, if XRP experiences 25% volatility, XXRP holders could see a 6% loss. With 70% volatility, those losses could balloon to 40%. The launch comes as more than 10 asset managers have filed applications with the SEC for spot XRP ETFs. Major firms like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton have submitted applications, though BlackRock has not yet expressed interest in launching an XRP-specific ETF product.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Atkins will succeed former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who, under the Biden administration, attracted the ire of crypto leaders by suing or investigating almost every major company in the industry for alleged violations of securities laws. The incoming SEC chair is all but certain to have a far different approach to crypto. Atkins, who previously served as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, recently told senators that a top concern of his chairmanship will be providing “a firm regulatory foundation for digital assets through a rational, coherent, and principled approach.” Atkins himself holds up to a $5 million stake in a crypto investment firm where he serves as a limited partner. Until February, he held between $250,000 and $500,000 in equity in the crypto custodian Anchorage Digital, and the same amount in call options in Securitize, a BlackRock-backed blockchain firm where he also held a board seat, according to ethics disclosures. In Atkins’ absence, the SEC has barrelled ahead with pro-crypto policies. The agency’s two Republican commissioners—Acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce—have moved to dismiss almost every major lawsuit against a crypto company. They’ve also issued statements effectively exempting meme coins, crypto mining, and stablecoins from securities regulation. The SEC is currently operating with just three commissioners—Uyeda, Peirce, and Democratic commissioner Caroline Crenshaw—as opposed to the full five. Crenshaw supported former chair Gensler’s crypto lawsuits during the Biden administration, and her nomination to the SEC was so intensely protested by the industry in December that Senate Democrats abandoned a push to renominate her. The SEC’s rules state that no more than three commissioners from the same political party can serve at the same time to “ensure that the Commission remains non-partisan.” Thus, Trump would ordinarily appoint two Democrats to fill empty seats at the agency. But the president has recently shown an unorthodox resistance to such long-held Washington norms. Last month, he fired two Democrats serving on the Federal Trade Commission and a Democrat on the National Labor Relations Board. Until now, a key 1930s Supreme Court ruling has protected commissioners on such independent agencies—the SEC included—from being fired without cause. Experts believe Trump could be angling to have that long-standing precedent overturned by the Supreme Court’s current conservative majority. Lawsuits on the subject have already been filed.

Filings on Wednesday show that the regulator approved trading options for BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust, along with the Bitwise Ethereum ETF and Grayscale's Ethereum Trust and Ethereum Mini Trust. The Ethereum ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without the need to buy and store the virtual coin themselves. Options give investors the right to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price by a set date. Crypto options are popular because they allow investors to gain exposure to the performance of an asset, rather than just investing in it. Traders are able to bet on the future price of a digital coin, and the market for doing so is much bigger than the spot one. Options trading on ETFs adds more liquidity to the crypto investment space, experts previously told Decrypt. The regulator last year approved Ethereum ETFs just months after giving their Bitcoin counterparts the green light. The SEC also approved options trading on the Bitcoin funds. Cryptocurrency ETFs—managed by the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale—give investors from top hedge funds to retail investors the ability to invest in the cryptocurrency in an easy and regulated way. Though the Bitcoin funds have received enormous inflows, pushing the price of the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap to new highs, the Ethereum funds haven't drawn the same kind of demand. A number of top asset managers are now hoping to get approval from the regulator to list other ETFs giving investors exposure to altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. CoinGecko data shows that Ethereum is now trading for $1,675 per coin after surging by more than 14% over the last 24 hours. It's one of the biggest gainers on the day amid a markets upswing triggered by President Trump's decision to pause "reciprocal" trade tariffs on most nations.

The first batch of approvals allow ETHA and FETH to offer up to 25,000 options contracts. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved proposals from Nasdaq and Cboe to list and trade options on spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) managed by BlackRock and Fidelity, according to April 9 filings. The orders were granted for the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) following a review process that included amendments, public comments, and regulatory justification for new product listings under Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Both filings approved options with American-style exercise and physical settlement. The approved contracts will adhere to existing listing rules applicable to ETF options, including margin, strike intervals, series expiration cycles, and minimum trading increments. The ETHA and FETH options will be subject to a 25,000-contract position and exercise limit per market side, just as the options for Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs were approved last year. Nasdaq and Cboe emphasized the conservative nature of the 25,000-contract cap, which was derived from a comparative analysis with other ETFs and commodity-based trusts. Additionally, Nasdaq noted that the notional risk of a maximum position in ETHA would represent less than 0.03% of the Ethereum market’s capitalization and below 4.4% of the trust’s outstanding shares. Cboe compared the proposed limits to those set for Bitcoin-based ETFs and similarly structured commodity products. The approvals follow a precedent set for spot Bitcoin ETF options, which received SEC authorization on Sept. 23, 2024, and began trading in November 2024. As happened last year, options trading requirements from other issuers are likely to be approved, with trading starting in the same week as ETHA and FETH.

It is increasingly emerging as a strategic path and a likely next step in the evolution of finance,” the report, written by analysts with XRP developer Ripple and global management consulting company Boston Consulting Group and titled “Approaching the tokenisation tipping point," read. Wall Street giants, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, have embraced tokenisation in recent years. "Global adoption is poised to grow exponentially," Yue Hong Zhang, managing director and partner at BCG Hong Kong, wrote in the report. “With the recent growth of real-world assets, people outside the crypto industry are increasingly asking about the potential of tokenised assets to address historically under-penetrated segments."

BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign last year to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar. Fink said he believes the crypto-based tokenisation of assets on blockchains will revolutionize Wall Street, as everything—from stock markets, pre-IPO stocks, hedge funds, infrastructure projects, commodities, alternate investment instruments and private credit—becomes tokenised. "At BlackRock, we believe that tokenisation has the potential to drive a significant transformation in capital markets infrastructure," BlackRock’s global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships Joseph Chalom told Fortune last year.

Title: ​​Hegseth says Panama agreed to allow US warships to travel 'first and free' through canal

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says the US and Panama have made moves to strengthen ties and remove ‘China's influence’ from canal. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Wednesday that U.S. and Panama officials would sign a "framework" agreement allowing U.S. warships to travel "first and free" through the Panama Canal. Hegseth said the two countries had already signed a memorandum of understanding on security cooperation and that they would finalize a document guaranteeing U.S. warships and auxiliary vessels priority, toll-free passage through the canal. When Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama earlier this year, the State Department claimed it had secured a deal for the free passage of U.S. warships. But Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino denied any such agreement had been reached. "I completely reject that statement," Mulino said at the time. The Panama Canal Authority also said it had "not made any adjustments" to its fee structure. US, PANAMA ‘TAKING BACK’ CANAL FROM ‘CHINA’S INFLUENCE,' SAYS HEGSETH Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said China's military presence is "too large" in Panama. (Reuters/Aris Martinez) Earlier Wednesday, Hegseth warned that China’s military presence in the Western Hemisphere is "too large" as he visited Panama to meet with the nation's officials, visit U.S. troops and tour the canal ports. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said in brief remarks to the press. "China's military has too large of a presence in the Western Hemisphere. They operate military facilities and ground stations that extend their reach into space. They exploit natural resources and land to fuel China's global military ambitions. China's factory fishing fleets are stealing food from our nations and from our people." He added that war with China is "not inevitable," and the U.S. does not seek war in any form. "Together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China’s threats in this hemisphere." To strengthen military ties with Panama and reassert influence over the canal, the U.S. will deploy the USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship, to the region. Hegseth vowed Tuesday that the U.S. will "take back" the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, pointing to port operations controlled by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. The secretary later said Wednesday that he and Panamanian officials would be signing an agreement that U.S. warships would travel "first and free" through the Panama Canal. TRUMP, HEGSETH REVEAL WHOPPING FIGURE THEY WANT FOR THE NEXT PENTAGON BUDGET Hegseth said Panama had agreed to allow U.S. warships to travel "first and free" through the canal. (Reuters/Enea Lebrun/File Photo) Last month the conglomerate agreed to a $19 billion deal to sell a group of 43 ports, including two in Panama, to U.S.-based BlackRock, Trump hailed the agreement, seen as a solution to his complaints that the canal was owned by China, but now that deal may fall apart. China has criticized the deal, opening up antitrust probes, and a Panamanian official has accused CK Hutchison of failing to properly renew its contract in 2021 and owing the country $300 million. After meeting with Mulino, Hegseth said Tuesday the U.S. will not allow China to threaten the canal's operation. "To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defense and security cooperation than we have in decades," he said. US, PANAMA ‘TAKING BACK’ CANAL FROM ‘CHINA'S INFLUENCE,’ SAYS HEGSETH Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visits Miraflores locks with Panama Canal Authority Administrator Ricaurte Vasquez, and Adm. Alvin Holsey, head of the U.S. Southern Command. (Reuters/Aris Martinez ) Hegseth alluded to the ports owned by CK Hutchison. "China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area," he said. "That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Chinese embassy in Panama hit back: "The U.S. has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the ‘theoretical Chinese threat’ in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United States' own geopolitical interests." The war of words in Panama comes as China and the U.S. are now locked in a trade war, where Trump slapped Chinese goods with a total 104% tariff. China retaliated with 84% tariffs on U.S. goods.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: BlackRock, Inc. has made a big bet on the Adani Group, snapping up nearly a third of about $1 billion bonds sold by a group promoter entity, marking the first investment in any Adani entity by the world's largest asset manager. Apart from BlackRock, at least five other top global funds also bought the bonds privately placed by Renew Exim, an Adani Group promoter firm, two people aware of the matter said. “BlackRock is one of these investors. There are a few European investors as well," one of the two people said on the condition of anonymity, adding that most of the money raised will be utilized for the acquisition of ITD Cementation, while the rest will be used for funding the capex plans of other Adani group firms. Renew Exim DMCC, in October, had proposed to acquire 46.64% in ITD Cementation India, and buy an additional 26% through an open offer. Also read | Adani Green is weighing its biggest equity sale ever BlackRock's vote of confidence comes in the backdrop of ongoing litigation in a US court against the conglomerate's promoters over a case of alleged bribery. Adani Green's promoters were indicted in the US last year, over charges that they have denied as baseless and vowed to contest. "Renew Exim will hold 67.45% in ITD Cementation after the completion of the open offer. The total amount for the acquisition of ITD Cementation would cost around ₹5,000 crore. The proceeds from the latest bond placement by the promoter entity will be used for the expansion of other group companies," said the first person. Adani Group has planned a ₹5 trillion capex over the next five years. About 85% of this will be for utilities such as green energy, other power generation projects, power transmission projects, airports and ports. The remaining 15% is planned to be spent on metals, materials and mining. A 31 March report by Mint said Adani Group, whose renewable arm is planning to mobilize a total of $4-5 billion across FY26, has stated in its recent roadshows that it has deep access to diverse pools of capital, securing large amounts for long durations. However, as foreign investors started demanding interest rates of 7-9% for the group's bonds following the bribery charges, Adani Group has been attempting to restore the confidence of foreign investors, and preferring to raise capital in the domestic market only. Also read | Adani Group adopts strategy to diversify its debt after Hindenburg crisis The two persons said the private placement issue size is a little under $1 billion and the bond tenure is over three years, which is considered to be medium-term debt papers, reflecting confidence among investors in the group's growth prospects. "Adani stakeholders are seeing this as a major move as the entry of BlackRock is now seen as the global investors are not much worried about the ongoing DoJ case," said the first person. On Wednesday, the ITD Cementation open offer was concluded, with 20.81% shares being tendered by the public. On 30 January, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had approved Adani's proposal to acquire a majority stake in ITD Cementation, an engineering and construction company undertaking heavy civil, infrastructure and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business and operating in India and overseas. "This acquisition marks a significant milestone as it enhances the overall projects execution capabilities and strategically positioning Adani portfolio companies to capitalize on the burgeoning opportunities in the country's booming infrastructure sector," said the second person. On 3 March, Adani Green Energy refinanced its maiden construction facility, having outstanding debt of $1.06 billion with long-term financing, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday. It was the first major fund raise by Adani Group since the DoJ indicted its top executives. Also read | Can Adani Wilmar’s FMCG bet deliver long-term gains? Shares of Adani Green ended 1.72% lower at ₹860.75 on Thursday, while those of flagship Adani Enterprises fell 2.11% to ₹2237.45.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Markets around the world have plunged as the trade war escalates. Photo / Getty Images THREE KEY FACTS Don’t check your KiwiSaver balance or share portfolios. We are watching the United States and China hurtling towards an all-out trade war, leaving us all diving for foxholes hoping to avoid the shrapnel. This is brinkmanship at its worst. On Donald Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day”, when the President unveiled US tariffs on the world, he originally unveiled a 34% additional duty on Chinese goods. But after China retaliated with its own 34% counter-tariff, Trump added another 50% duty – bringing the additional rate on Chinese products to 104%. China vowed to “fight to the end”. Markets around the world plunged, fund managers were fidgety, corporate valuations were crunched, and countries called the White House. Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalisation, desperately scrambled to shift production of the iPhone from China to India. Country club conservatives and several business leaders, some of whom were vocal Trump supporters last year, are now speaking out against tariffs. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump’s 2024 presidential run, said on social media this is not what he voted for. “My bad,” he posted. The boss of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, Larry Fink, raised the risk of a US recession. Ken Griffin, the billionaire who runs hedge-fund firm Citadel, called the tariffs a “huge policy mistake”. Kiwi billionaire and Zuru co-founder Nick Mowbray said penalising trade doesn’t bring jobs back — it just raises prices and slows innovation. “Sad to see what is happening,” he wrote on LinkedIn. Money talks. While New Zealand is not facing comparatively high tariffs, our biggest trading partner is China. The Asia region, including Australia, accounts for about 70% of our trade. “All of these factors create risk for the New Zealand economy, just as we have been gathering positive momentum and recovering from a period of high inflation and interest rates ... put simply, the past week’s global developments make our recovery harder,” Finance Minister Nicola Willis said. In the face of this chaos and a historically significant event, the Government’s plan, like long-term investors, is to keep calm and carry on. However, it will be a bumpy road to recovery as we try to navigate the economic uncertainty. Yesterday, more trouble brewed in Maga paradise. Trump’s senior trade adviser Peter Navarro and Elon Musk engaged in a spat over the tariff carnage, with Musk calling Navarro “truly a moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks”. “Boys will be boys,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. Yes, puerile behaviour, not that she would’ve intended her comment to be read that way. Unfortunately for us, Musk may be right but also wrong. Navarro is possibly just one in a room full of powerful morons. Sign up to the Daily H, a free newsletter curated by our editors and delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo April 9 (Reuters) – A company controlled by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison has invested $1.7 billion in two ports near the Panama Canal, it said on Wednesday, surpassing the amount required under its contract, which is being audited by Panamanian authorities. Panama Ports Company (PPC), in which CK Hutchison owns a 90% stake, had its 25-year operating concession for the Balboa and Cristobal ports renewed in 2021. The Panamanian government launched an audit of the contract in January, potentially complicating a high-profile deal by a group led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock for most of CK Hutchison’s global port business, including the two ports. Comptroller General Anel Flores said this week that the audit had already found that Panama “left $1.3 billion on the table” due to tax incentives and benefits granted to CK Hutchison. CK Hutchison has denied any wrongdoing or irregularities, and on Wednesday it outlined how it had gone beyond the financial conditions of the agreement. It said its investments in Panama had surpassed not only the $50 million required in the original concession contract signed in 1997, but they had also eclipsed a $1 billion requirement contained in a 2005 addendum. “During the term of the concession, PPC has paid the State $668 million … far exceeding the contributions of any other port operator in Panama,” it said. Tax exemptions granted to PPC by the government were “precisely the same tax exemptions granted to all other port operators in Panama,” it added. “Panama Ports Company continues to call for respectful coordination and consultation to protect the concession,” the company said. CK Hutchison, the telecoms-to-retail conglomerate owned by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, has found itself caught in a highly politicized tug of war since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office. Trump has repeatedly threatened to take control of the Panama Canal due to the presence of Chinese and Hong Kong firms in the Central American country’s maritime business and praised the $22.8 billion BlackRock deal. Chinese authorities have criticized it however, and China’s market regulator is launching an antitrust review of it. Panama’s contract audit is nearing completion, state comptroller Flores said this week. Since February, Panama’s Supreme Court and the attorney general’s office have also started reviews of the concession and the conditions of its renewal.

A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate, which is embroiled in U.S.-China tensions over its Panama Canal port assets has denied allegations that it had failed to pay about $1.2 billion to the Central American country HONG KONG -- A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate that is embroiled in U.S.-China tensions over its Panama Canal port assets denied allegations Wednesday that it had failed to pay about $1.2 billion to the Central American country. Panama’s comptroller authority announced on Monday that an audit of Panama Ports Company found irregularities in the renewal of a 25-year port concession in the interoceanic canal. The authority's accusations came the same day as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's arrival in the country to participate in a security conference. The Panama Ports Company, or PPC, defended itself in a statement Wednesday, saying it had made significant investments that exceeded $1.69 billion, surpassing the $50 million investment required under the original concession contract signed in 1997. That was also more than another $1 billion agreed to in an addendum. It said the investments were confirmed by the country's comptroller general in 2020 after a thorough audit. The company said any statement about what it should have paid under the original concession contract must take into account the respective addenda, which was validly executed and approved by law. “To express the opposite, as it unfortunately has been the case, not only distorts the reality of the existing legal relationship between PPC and the State under the concession contract and its addenda, but also contradicts the State’s own acts over the years,” it said, referring to Panama. It said any claim that the company has failed to pay about $1.2 billion to Panama is false and that it believes “respect for legal certainty gives companies and investors the certainty that Panama is a safe country in which to invest.” Panama Ports Company, under Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings, won a concession to operate the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, beginning in 1997 and it was renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. CK Hutchison is controlled by the family of Li Ka-shing, the southern Chinese city’s richest man. U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged Chinese interference with the critical shipping lane’s operations — accusations that Panamanian authorities have denied. Hegseth said Tuesday that the U.S. will not allow China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation. Last month, CK Hutchison announced a tentative deal to sell its canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., which pleased Trump but angered Beijing. China’s Hong Kong affairs offices have posted scathing commentaries from a local state-backed media outlet over the tentative deal. Chinese anti-monopoly authorities said they would review the business agreement, a state-backed news outlet reported last month. It is unclear how the geopolitical pressure might affect the deal. But analysts have warned that a cancellation could cause the Trump administration to impose more sanctions or restrictions on businesses and individuals in Hong Kong and mainland China. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Tokenized Funds' Rapid Growth Comes With Red Flags: Moody's
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/09/tokenized-funds-rapid-growth-comes-with-red-flags-moody-s
Time Published: 2025-04-09T15:54:53Z

Tokenization of funds is booming, but their rapid rise comes with serious risks that investors should not overlook, credit agency Moody’s Ratings said in a Wednesday report. Several major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have made their mark in the world of tokenization and inspired others to follow the latest trend. For example, tokenized money market funds grew roughly 350% in a year to a market capitalization of $5.2 billion, per rwa.xyz data. "When assessing tokenized funds, investors have to weigh not only the benefits of accessibility and transparency, but also the risks tied to the underlying technology, security vulnerabilities, scalability limitations and evolving regulations,” said Cristiano Ventricelli, VP-senior analyst at Moody’s Ratings. At the forefront of these risks is the limited experience of many fund managers in the still-developing tokenization market, Moody’s noted. With small teams and short track records, operators could face key-man risk where too much depends on a few individuals: If a crucial executive leaves or governance structures are thin, the stability of the fund could be shaken, the report said. Moody’s urged fund teams to distribute responsibilities and shore up risk management practices. Blockchain disruptions, again resulting from the novelty of the technology, poses another risk. While smart contracts offer operational efficiencies like automating fund operations, they remain susceptible to coding flaws or malicious attacks, the report noted. Using public, permissionless blockchains increases accessibility but also raises exposure to potential exploits, it added. Moody’s recommended keeping off-chain backups and conducting rigorous smart contract audits to guard against disruptions. Redemption mechanisms, which let investors cash out their holdings, are another fragile link. The report encouraged tokenized funds to allow redemptions in both stablecoins and fiat currency. This dual approach helps cushion against events like stablecoin depegs or blockchain outages. Lastly, tokenized funds operate across jurisdictions with varying regulations, and this patchwork increases the risk that investor claims could face legal hurdles, the report said. While some funds use structures designed to give token holders direct claims on the underlying assets, enforceability still depends on local laws and the strength of fund documentation, the report added.

Title: NYC retains title of world’s wealthiest city — despite CEO warnings of high crime, filth

New York is still “top of the heap” when it comes to the world’s wealthiest cities despite recent warnings from a Wall Street titan that the Big Apple’s sharp drop in quality of life could prompt a mass exodus of businesses from the area. The city retained the top ranking in a list of the world’s top 50 cities with the largest concentration of millionaires, according to the latest World’s Wealthiest Cities Report 2025 by Henley & Partners and New World Wealth. New York City maintains its crown, topping the global rankings with 384,500 millionaires, including 818 centi-millionaires and 66 billionaires, the report found. The San Francisco Bay Area, which encompasses Silicon Valley, ranked second on the list with 342,000 millionaires — though it surpassed New York with 82 billionaires, according to the report. The Bay Area has seen a staggering 98% increase in millionaires over the past decade, a figure surpassed globally only by Dubai and China’s fast-growing metropolises Shenzhen and Hangzhou. Los Angeles also climbed the list of world’s wealthiest towns — surpassing London to secure fifth place. According to the study, LA is home to 220,600 millionaires, including 516 centi-millionaires and 45 billionaires. London’s decline was stark. The British capital experienced a 12% drop in its millionaire population over the last decade — relegating it to sixth position. The United States continues to assert its dominance in wealth accumulation, claiming 11 spots among the world’s top 50 cities with the highest millionaire populations. Chicago is the 10th richest city in the world with a millionaire population of 127,100, according to the rankings. This is the first time that the Windy City, which has been plagued in recent years by a rash of shootings, cracked the top ten — leapfrogging Chinese cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Meanwhile, fast-growing American wealth hubs such as Scottsdale and West Palm Beach saw remarkable millionaire population growth rates of 125% and 112%, respectively. Miami, known for Florida’s favorable tax conditions, grew by 94% while Washington D.C. and Austin — the Texas capital which has been dubbed the “Silicon Hills” — also saw their millionaire populations surge by approximately 90%. Despite this impressive growth, captains of industry have raised concerns about the sustainability of traditional financial centers like New York. Larry Fink, CEO of asset management giant BlackRock, issued a stark warning this week, criticizing New York City’s handling of crime, cleanliness, and education. Speaking to the Economic Club of New York, Fink expressed his concerns bluntly: “The city is on the verge of losing a lot of companies. I don’t believe the city has the vitality that it did before.” Fink, who witnessed New York’s troubled era during the 1970s, stated he feels his taxes no longer support tangible improvements: “I believed that my taxes were used to help build out the city. I don’t feel that way anymore.” BlackRock, managing about $11.6 trillion in assets, remains headquartered in Manhattan’s Hudson Yards, but around 160 Wall Street firms managing roughly $1 trillion in assets have relocated away from New York since 2019. This trend mirrors the broader business shift away from urban cores facing increasing retail crime. In the last decade, nearly 40% of drugstores based in New York City have shuttered while companies like Foot Locker have joined the exodus, relocating their headquarters out of the Big Apple to more business-friendly states.

Title: CK Hutchison Rejects Accusations Over Panama Ports Payments
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ck-hutchison-rejects-accusations-over-panama-ports-payments-11744212953186.html

(Bloomberg) -- CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd rejected accusations it failed to pay about 1.2 billion balboas ($1.2 billion) to the Panamanian state over the concession contract to run the two key ports in the Central American country. The accusations are “absolutely contrary to reality.” and the company has invested more than 1.695 billion balboas, Panama Ports Co., a unit of the Hong Kong-listed conglomerate, said in a statement. That surpasses the 50 million balboas required under the original concession contract and the 1 billion balboas agreed under the addendum to operate the Balboa and Cristobal port terminals. Panama’s comptroller general confirmed this in 2020 after a thorough audit process, the company said. “We firmly believe that respect for legal certainty gives companies and investors the certainty that Panama is a safe country in which to invest,” Panama Ports said in the statement. “PPC continues to call for respectful coordination and consultation to protect the concession that has provided high-quality services for the benefit of Panama and the world.” The port operator’s response came after Panama’s top auditor accused the company of wrongdoing, including failing to obtain required approvals for a contract extension in 2021 and owing millions in dues. The accusation ratchets up pressure on Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing’s CK Hutchison and its precarious position in the middle of a US-China spat. While the firm is set to make $19 billion in cash proceeds from its deal to sell its ports business, the agreement has enraged Beijing after US President Donald Trump touted it as reclaiming the Panama Canal. The canal, used mainly by the US and China, became a geopolitical lightning rod after Trump vowed to retake it. In a news conference Tuesday, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pointed to ports operated by CK Hutchison on either end of the trade route as potential threats to US and Panamanian interests. CK Hutchison shares extended declines on Wednesday, erasing all their advances since the company agreed to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a BlackRock Inc.-led consortium last month. --With assistance from Guillermo Molero.

Title: Hegseth says China’s military presence in western hemisphere is ‘too large’
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/09/hegseth-china-western-presence/
Time Published: 2025-04-09T15:20:35Z

By JUAN ZAMORANO, Associated Press PANAMA CITY (AP) — U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth focused again on China’s presence in the Western Hemisphere Wednesday, one day after calling the world power a threat to the Panama Canal. Speaking at a regional security conference, Hegseth said that China-based companies were controlling land and critical infrastructure in strategic sectors. “China’s military has too large of a presence in the Western Hemisphere,” Hegseth said. “Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain.” He called on the region’s governments to work together to deter China and address threats posed by transnational drug cartels and mass immigration. Hegseth was speaking a day after meeting Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino and touring the Panama Canal. The two countries agreed to step up security coordination and appeared to say they would work toward a way to pay back fees that U.S. warships pay to pass through the Panama Canal. The visit comes amid tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated assertions that the U.S. is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations — allegations that Panama has denied. Shortly after Hegseth and Mulino met, the Chinese Embassy in Panama criticized the U.S. government in a statement on X, saying Washington had used “blackmail” to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a “sovereign decision of Panama … and something the U.S. doesn’t have the right to interfere in.” On Wednesday, Hegseth said, “I don’t know anything about blackmail.” The concern about China’s influence over the waterway was provoked by Hong Kong-based consortium CK Hutchison holding a 25-year lease on ports at either end of the canal. The Panamanian government announced that the lease was being audited and late Monday concluded that there were irregularities, which CK Hutchison denied in a statement Wednesday. CK Hutchison has already announced that it would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete. Later Wednesday, Hegseth said that he would sign an agreement with Panama concerning the security and operation of the Panama Canal that would allow U.S. warships to “sail first and free.” The fact that the U.S. has a treaty obligation to protect the canal, but also had to pay to move its warships between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans had been one of the Trump administration’s complaints. Panama’s Canal Affairs Minister José Ramón Icaza, said the two governments would look for a mechanism to repay the fees from U.S. warships to use the canal. He said annually they had paid on average $5 million to $7 million. The canal generated about $2.4 billion for the government in the last fiscal year, he said.

Title: Billionaires Speak Out On Trump Tariffs: Jamie Dimon Says Recession ‘Likely’ As Elon Musk And Others Slam Tariffs As ‘Mistake’

Time Published: 2025-04-09T14:49:50Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs took effect Wednesday over the concerns of many of the nation’s billionaires, as even some longtime supporters of the president—including Elon Musk—have expressed concern about the tariffs and their impact on the economy. Elon Musk arrives for the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. Capitol ... More Rotunda on January 20 in Washington, DC. Jamie Dimon: The JPMorganChase CEO told Fox Business on Wednesday he thinks a recession is a “likely outcome” of Trump’s tariffs—though he said he’s right now taking a “calm view” of the financial situation, “But I think it could get worse if we don’t make some progress here”—after Dimon expressed concerns in his annual letter to shareholders Monday morning, saying they “will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession.” Elon Musk: The Tesla CEO shared a video early Monday of economist Milton Friedman touting free trade and the benefits of importing goods and reportedly lobbied Trump personally not to impose the tariffs, The Washington Post reported Monday. He’s also been sparring with Trump’s top trade adviser Peter Navarro for praising tariffs—most recently saying Tuesday Navarro is a “moron” who’s “dumber than a sack of bricks”—and Musk’s brother (and Tesla board member) Kimbal Musk has criticized the tariffs as a “permanent tax” on Americans. Bill Ackman: The hedge fund manager is a longtime Trump supporter but has repeatedly spoken out against the president’s tariffs, calling Tuesday for the White House to issue a 30, 60 or 90-day pause on the tariffs “to enable negotiations to be completed without a major global economic disruption” and saying Wednesday morning the financial chaos Trump’s tariffs have sparked are “not the markers of successful policy” and “many small businesses will go bankrupt” if they’re not paused soon. Ken Griffin: The Citadel founder—and major Republican donor—said at an event Monday that Trump’s tariffs are a “huge policy mistake,” with Bloomberg reporting he urged audience members to lobby Trump to step back on the tariffs and said he’s “really afraid of [the U.S.] abdicating our role of leadership for the free world.” Daniel Loeb: While Loeb said in February he thought Trump’s initial tariffs on Mexico and Canada wouldn’t harm the stock market, the hedge fund manager has spoken out against Trump’s more sweeping policy, sharing a post Monday that noted the stock market chaos is “all in the head of 1 person. Who can change his mind at any time”—writing, “Exactly”—and sharing criticism of the tariffs by billionaire Ken Griffin and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Larry Fink: The BlackRock CEO suggested at the Economic Club of New York Monday that “the economy is weakening as we speak” and the market could fall another 20% from where it is now as a result of Trump’s tariffs, CNBC reports. Fink suggested the U.S. is “probably in a recession right now,” but he still expressed some optimism about the economy’s long-term outlook, saying, “In the long run, this is actually more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity” and “the vitality of the United States will persist.” Joe Lonsdale: The Palantir cofounder said on X he has some concerns about the tariffs even though he understands where “some” of the Trump administration’s thinking “is coming from,” and shared a post on tariffs from Viahart founder Molton Hart early Monday, saying Hart’s argument that the “tariffs are structured in the wrong way” by taxing finished products and components at the same rate “reflects a lot of my key concerns about how the tariffs could be done better.” Ken Langone: The Home Depot cofounder and GOP megadonor told the Financial Times he believes Trump has “been poorly advised by his advisers about this trade situation” and criticized how the tariffs were calculated—saying, “I don’t understand the goddamn formula”—telling the FT it would have been “more manageable and certainly more constructive” for the Trump administration to impose baseline 10% tariffs on foreign imports before starting negotiations. Ray Dalio: Dalio, who founded the world’s biggest hedge fund firm, Bridgewater Associates, wrote Monday the tariffs are based on a broader “breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders.” He’s still expressed concern about Trump’s tariffs and their “practicality,” however, telling CNBC on Tuesday that while he “agree[s] with the problem” the tariffs are aimed at fixing, “I am very concerned about the solution.” Stanley Druckenmiller: Longtime hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller expressed some optimism about tariffs in an interview with CNBC, referring to them as the “lesser of two evils” versus an income tax—though an unverified social media account believed to belong to Druckenmiller responded to a clip of his interview Sunday, arguing he “do[es] not support tariffs exceeding 10%.” Ken Fisher: The Fisher Investments chairman attacked Trump’s tariffs Monday, saying on X the tariff plan is “stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools,” predicting it “will fade and fail.” Thomas Peterffy: Contrary to many other billionaires, the Interactive Brokers founder has fully embraced Trump’s tariffs, telling Forbes on Tuesday he “think[s] it gives an opportunity to many entrepreneurs to gear up for producing and inventing either the same things that foreign countries sell us at cheap prices, or proper substitutes for them,” and claiming any price hikes will affect “plastic sh-t from China that is not absolutely necessary for people to have.” More than $10 billion. That’s how much Trump’s top 10 billionaire donors lost in the stock market on Thursday alone, as stocks plunged in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s Wednesday tariff announcement. That’s only a fraction of the $270 billion in total that was wiped off the net worths of the world’s billionaires on Thursday, Forbes calculated, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Musk among those who were the hardest hit. Musk’s brother Kimbal Musk called Trump “the most high tax American President in generations” on Monday. “Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer,” the Tesla shareholder said on X. Peterffy criticized his fellow Trump-friendly billionaires who have spoken out against the president’s tariffs, telling Forbes, “I think that they are short term, greedy, looking after their own pockets.” Trump has dug his heels in on his tariffs and repeatedly doubled down in support of them, even as they’ve spurred chaos in the markets. “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” Trump said Wednesday morning on Truth Social after his tariffs took effect. The president staunchly defended his tariffs to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, saying they are “the only chance our country will have to reset the table” in terms of the U.S.’ trade with other countries, and that while other presidents wouldn’t be willing to impose such controversial tariffs, “I don’t mind going through it, because I see a beautiful picture at the end.” Trump’s tariffs have also garnered criticism from a number of non-billionaires who have typically been sympathetic to the president. Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy has suggested he’s lost up to 15% of his net worth as a result of the stock market plunge from Trump’s tariffs and said “everything’s in the s—-ter” because of the president’s policy—but also has continued to back the president, saying Trump is a “smart guy” even as he dubbed Monday’s stock market plunge “Orange Monday.” “I’m gonna roll with [Trump] Trump has suggested he’s open to negotiating with other countries on their tariffs, saying Monday that discussions with other countries would begin “immediately” and telling reporters he’s open to reaching “fair deals” with other countries that put “America first.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also said Trump will negotiate with other countries—likely starting with Japan—but has suggested those negotiations may take a while, telling Fox Business on Monday that all the countries approaching the Trump administration about making deals means “it’s going to be a busy April, May, maybe into June.” The White House denied reports Monday suggesting the administration was considering a 90-day pause, however, decrying the rumor as “fake news,” and Trump said Monday he’s “not looking at” pausing the tariffs unilaterally. Congress could also undo Trump’s tariffs, and bipartisan legislation has been introduced that would require any tariffs the president wants to impose to be approved by Congress. That legislation remains a longshot to pass as of now and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has reportedly urged House Republicans to back Trump’s policy—though some GOP lawmakers are already backing the legislation, and more could follow suit if Trump’s tariffs continue to wreak economic havoc. A Florida-based stationery company is also challenging Trump’s authority to enact tariffs in court—with potentially another major legal challenge on the way this week from business groups—though it remains to be seen how those will play out. Trump announced his sweeping tariff policy during a “Liberation Day” event Wednesday, levying tariffs of 10% and up on imports from nearly all foreign countries—even uninhabited ones. The tariffs fulfill a longtime promise by the president to impose sweeping tariffs in order to restore manufacturing to the U.S. and punish other countries for purportedly unfair trade practices, which Trump has pushed despite economists long warning that doing so would raise prices for U.S. consumers and harm the economy. Billionaires’ criticism of Trump’s tariffs comes after dozens of them backed the president in the November election. More than 50 billionaires expressed support for Trump and billionaires funneled millions into his campaign, even as the now-president made sweeping tariffs a signature plank of his platform.

But for audiences willing to put this and other queries to the side, the streaming feature delivers. Mostly, “G20” has two major points in its favor, right out of the gate: a super-fun premise for an action film (what if money-mad mercenaries seized the 20 most powerful leaders of the world and demanded some really insane shit?) and a star both so good and so classy that it never feels as if she’s punching below her weight class. Star and producer Viola Davis brings gravitas and charisma to every role, and so while she’s thrilling to watch in the non-action moments afforded to her President Danielle Sutton, there is something special about seeing her, oh, choke a bad guy out with the barrel of a submachine gun. She can have it all! Related Stories The 10 Best Moments When a Movie Name-Drops Its Own Title Ryan Coogler Says Chadwick Boseman ‘Freaked Out’ Disney Executives with His African Accent for ‘Black Panther’ Not that it’s been easy. When we first meet President Sutton, she’s preparing for her first G20 Summit and juggling some relatable family problems. Her husband Derek (Anthony Anderson) is devoted — we soon learn Danielle rocketed to fame as a young soldier, captured in an iconic photo while saving a small child during an attack on Fallujah; Derek was the medic who healed her after. Her kids, though, aren’t as easy. Smart Serena (Marsai Martin) is almost 18 and itching to be her own person. Typical teen problems made all the worse by her mom’s job, while younger brother Demetrius (Christopher Farrar) is just trying to ride this whole thing out. When Danielle drags the entire family to Cape Town for the summit, we know something messy is afoot, mostly thanks to a jittery opening sequence involving obvious baddies (like “The Boys” star Antony Starr) and a fat crypto wallet, two things that don’t seem like they’ll mesh well with the prez. She’s got some aces up her sleeve, though, like her own hyper-motivated personality (with some refreshing physical fitness to boot) and devoted Secret Service agent Manny (Ramon Rodriguez, the film’s sneaky breakout). But she’s got stuff on the line, too, like her Together Plan, which hinges on bringing digital currency to African farmers that could really benefit from the ease of such tech-forward banking. What could go wrong? Even before the action kicks in, EGOT winner Davis finds texture and emotion in the smallest of scenes. The set of her jaw during a tense family dinner sequence, the way she prepares to face a crowd in an elevator, even the second she pauses in the middle of a busy ballroom to wonder about the probability of success of that much-heralded Together Plan, Davis makes every scene count. That’s the pleasure of casting such a star in a genre that can be intensely rewarding if treated with respect. And that’s before she shoves a baddie’s face into a hot grill, a “Sudden Death”-esque moment that will delight the pickiest of action fans. Davis hasn’t been shy about her intent with the film: She wanted to see if she could star in an old-school action outing, the kind of thing that Bruce Willis or Sigourney Weaver (two names the star and producer threw out during a Tuesday night introduction to the film) might have taken on in the ’80s or ’90s. With that in mind, she absolutely delivers. Yet, fans of those sorts of films might get antsy, waiting for the action to really heat up. Stay patient, it does, and what a treat to see not only a woman kick ass, but to do it while wearing sensible sneakers and a well-placed pair of Spanx. Once the 20 world leaders (and staff, spouses, and security) all turn up for a pre-summit cocktail party, Rutledge (Starr) and his band of AI-obsessed cryptobros move in. Hired as private security for the event (no wonder Danielle sniffed at the news that the BlackRock-esque group was running the show in Cape Town), they’ve got the run of the place, and the kind of shaky plan and awkward motivations traditional to the genre. All you need to know: They’re mad at the world leaders, they want everyone to yank their money from the stock market and put it into crypto (good God), and they’re more than happy to utilize deepfakes to sell their plan to the world. And, no, they never saw President Sutton coming. When their initial attack proves to be so messy (a constantly shaking camera keeps both the audience and the baddies unclear of what’s really happening) that Danielle and some other heavy hitters can sneak away, their aims become fixated on her. Trawling through the bowels of the luxury resort, the prez has some allies with her (Manny, the Chinese First Lady, the spunky head of the International Monetary Fund) and some duds (Douglas Hodge as the British Prime Minister, cast here as a moron with some wonderful comic relief). Their mission? Live or something? Ultimately, it results in a series of hand-to-hand battles and lobby-set shoot-outs that are remarkable in how unremarkable they would have been three decades ago. We used to get movies like this once a week! We used to be a proper country! Still, the script (from Caitlin Parrish & Erica Weiss, plus Noah Miller & Logan Miller) can get bogged down with too much extra stuff. While a subplot involving the president’s family works — it adds to her character, and will also obviously tie into her primary plot, that’s clear the moment we realize Serena is a would-be hacker — other bits and bobs get lost along the way. Consider smarmy tech bad guy Bousquet, who disappears throughout the film (fine, acceptable), or Danielle’s close friend and treasury head Joanna (Elizabeth Marvel) who does the same (criminal, for many reasons). And while Antony Starr makes for a good baddie, the unevenness of his performance rankles. Sure, he’s fully bonkers by the final act, but that sort of unhinged energy would have been more welcome much earlier. You’ve taken the twenty most important people on Earth hostage, can’t you have a touch more fun with that? That’s the big ask of such films: tucking majorly worrying world events (a stock market crash? in this economy?) alongside ass-kicking adventure. Davis, at least, understands the assignment. “G20” will start streaming globally on Prime Video on Thursday, April 10.

Title: This Bitcoin Hedge Fund Is Taking Treasuries Companies Global: Blockspace

This Bitcoin-focused hedge fund outperformed bitcoin last year. 210k Capital, the hedge fund for UTXO Management, was the fifth best performing single major hedge fund in 2024 according to HFR. It returned 164% net of fees in 2024. UTXO Management is the investing arm of BTC Inc., of Bitcoin Magazine and Bitcoin Conference fame. This article first appeared on Blockspace Media, the leading Bitcoin industry publication dedicated to covering Bitcoin tech, markets, mining, and ordinals. Get Blockspace articles directly in your inbox by clicking here. Single manager hedge funds are run by one entity, versus multi-manager or fund-to-fund hedge funds, which have multiple portfolio managers. In HFR’s recap of its 2024 Global Hedge Fund Industry Report Q4 2024, the research firm revealed that cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds were “the leading area of overall [hedge fund] industry performance.” HFR’s index for cryptocurrency funds returned 59.81% in 2024. UTXO Management’s banner 2024 performance puts it in conversation with leading hedge funds that focus on traditional assets and industries. And it has bitcoin to thank for that – or, more directly, bitcoin companies. UTXO Management’s Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer, Tyler Evans, said that the fund’s 2024 returns chiefly stemmed from its investment in bitcoin strategy companies, principally Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet. “Over the last 12 months, we went very hard into the bitcoin treasury-play thesis as as we really saw it play out with what Saylor is doing, and the opportunity to really globalize it…So we did that pretty heavily in 2024, with both Strategy as well as Metaplanet out of Japan, where we were the first bitcoin investors in the company,” Evans told Blockspace. He said that the hedge fund holds 80% of its portfolio in bitcoin equities, which were a “big factor that drove [210k Capital’s] out-performance in 2024. A portion of that 80% includes public bitcoin miners, but the real money makers have been Metaplanet and Strategy, the latter of which 210k Capital held since the early days of its bitcoin strategy. These companies, Evans explained, offer a novel form of securitized bitcoin exposure that makes it easier for everything from institutional firms to IRAs to pension funds to hold bitcoin-adjacent assets. As a result, “the investable landscape has grown significantly over the last few years,” he said, opening the door to “registered investment advisors, wealth managers, funds, and sophisticated family offices.” This marks a shift from the fund’s early days when it courted self-made, high-net worth individuals who were typically more active investors managing their own portfolio to more passive investors whom manage pools of capital. “We saw the demand for institutional capital to get exposure to Bitcoin and the role that these Treasury companies can serve is securitizing bitcoins for fixed income investors, the insurance funds, or the mutual funds,” said Evans. “These institutional allocators have very defined mandates of what types of instruments that they can invest in. And that's really the beauty of the whole playbook is securitizing bitcoin in these different formats that make it so that institutional allocators can invest into it.” Bitcoin ETFs, first approved in January 2024, offer liquidity as well. With BlackRock on board – not to mention it recommending a 5% allocation to bitcoin – Evans said the Overton Window for how investors view bitcoin is shifting. So much so that the Wisconsin Teacher’s pension now holds bitcoin ETFs, as does the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund. The only thing harder than winning the championship is defending your title. And with bitcoin down year-to-date, it raises the question: can 210k Capital top 2024? Evans said that the fund hedges its positions with a number of auctions, but it’s also still “very bullish” on bitcoin in 2025. It’s even more bullish on exporting Michael Saylor’s corporate bitcoin treasury Strategy strategy to other financial markets. “We think that there's an opportunity for a bitcoin treasury company in every tier-one financial market globally,” he said. UTXO Management had a large hand in standing up Metaplanet’s bitcoin treasury in Japan. Tyler Evans served as an independent director and UTXO Management partner Dylan Leclair acting as Metaplanet’s head of bitcoin strategy. Another UTXO portfolio company, The Smarter Web Company, is set to IPO on the Aquis Exchange in the U.K. this week. Read: England’s Metaplanet? The Smarter Web Company eyes UK IPO with bitcoin strategy Public bitcoin treasury companies like Metaplanet give traditional investors access to bitcoin where other vehicles are limited. In Japan, for example, there are no native bitcoin ETFs, and access to American ones is limited. This – plus Japan’s low interest rates and a lower capital gains tax on equities cryptocurrencies – make it ripe for Metaplanet to reap market share, Evans believes. UTXO has its eye on multiple markets to incubate bitcoin treasury companies, including Latin America, Central America, the Middle East, Australia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Some of these are already in the works “at various stages of maturity,” Evans teased, with some in the IPO planning stage and others raising capital. “Our inbound deal flow of seasoned entrepreneurs who want to bring it to their own local market is growing massively,” he said.

Title: Trump Tariffs Seen from Contradictory Angles. Prof. Patrick Bond

Time Published: 2025-04-09T12:42:01Z

Donald Trump’s paleo-conservative, isolationist attack on global capitalist trade is already having formidable impacts. If tariff levels and targeted announced on ‘Liberation Day,’ April 2, are sustained, a full-blown economic catastrophe could result, perhaps reminiscent of 1930s-scale Make America Great Depression Again. The worst danger: national elites in victim countries will be divided-and-conquered. Even South African President Cyril Ramaphosa – who 15 months ago had bravely challenged Washington’s ‘rule of law’ fakery by authorising Pretoria’s challenge to Israel’s genocide at the International Court of Justice – apparently feels compelled to dream up utterly irrational deals for Trump, ideally sealed over a game of golf. Ramaphosa’s spokesperson told the NY Times last month that Ramaphosa may soon offer to U.S. Big Oil firms generous offshore leases for methane gas exploration and extraction, in spite of enormous climate damage, Shell Oil’s courtroom setbacks, and widespread shoreline protests. He’s not alone; more than 50 world leaders have ‘reached out’ to Washington in an obsequious manner, leading Trump to brag, “They are coming to the table. They want to talk but there’s no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis.” Even before the April 2 announcements, Trump imposed 25% universal tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium (effective March 12) and on cars (and auto parts) (March 26), radically lowering demand for what are traditionally the three main South African exports to the U.S. under the tariff-free Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). According to Business Leadership South Africa’s Busisiwe Mavuso: “Trump has made it clear that he wants concessions from each country if he is going to reduce or drop the tariffs. He emphasised that the tariffs put the U.S. in a position of power in the series of bilateral negotiations that are to come. Given the transactional nature of US politics, we have to think hard on what is commercially available and viable for all parties. The U.S. has exempted many of our key metal exports, including platinum, gold, manganese, copper, zinc and nickel, because these are considered critical to the U.S. economy.” Setting aside the exemptions on raw materials, which makes the whole operation appear as a neo-colonial resource grab that simultaneously stifles poor countries’ manufacturing sectors, what would justify these highest tariffs on U.S. imports in 130 years? Trump’s chief economic advisor (and investment banker) Stephen Miran, who holds a Harvard doctorate in economics, explained the underlying theory in a November 2024 report, celebrating the potential for a: “generational change in the international trade and financial systems. The root of the economic imbalances lies in persistent dollar overvaluation that prevents the balancing of international trade… Tariffs provide revenue, and if offset by currency adjustments, present minimal inflationary or otherwise adverse side effects, consistent with the experience in 2018-2019. While currency offset can inhibit adjustments to trade flows, it suggests that tariffs are ultimately financed by the tariffed nation, whose real purchasing power and wealth decline…” This is wishful thinking, most experts believe. Currency adjustments are hard to predict but the dollar’s decline on April 2-3 (about 1%) is already being offset by its ‘safe haven’ status, providing a quick valuation bounce-back. The reason: international financial volatility always encourages global footloose capital’s short-term flight to dollar-denominated assets, no matter how irrational that may be in the medium term. U.S. consumer inflation will soar, it’s fair to predict. Already, those whose pensions have been invested in the world’s (admittedly way-overvalued) stock markets have suffered major losses, e.g. in South Africa and the U.S., more 10% on April 3-4 alone. As nervous money floods out of vulnerable countries, the interest rates investors demand to fund 10-year bonds are soaring, in South Africa’s case by 2.2%, from 8.9% at the end of January to a painful 11.1% in early April (at a time of long-term average inflation of 5%). And as a distributional matter, left economist Dean Baker of the Center for Economic Policy and Research points out, “Import taxes are highly regressive, meaning that tariffs will cost ordinary working people a much higher share of their income than for high income people. This is because working people tend to spend most or all of their income, while high income people save a large portion of their income. Also, working people are more likely to spend their money on the goods subject to tariffs, whereas higher income people spend more money on services.” Beyond Miran’s fantasies, five other narratives are generating anti-Trump ideologies that – without a coherent stitching together – risk splintering critics: 1. mainstream neoliberalism The corporate and state elites who in most countries typically back neo-liberal trade deregulation are now in shock, as their own personal share portfolios crash. The Economist summed up, “Trump’s mindless tariffs will cause economic havoc.” In alliance with market-friendly ‘bastard Keynesians‘ like Paul Krugman, the neoliberals are expressing utter disgust at Trump because precepts of free trade are being violated in the most primitive manner. The powers and legitimacy of the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation (WTO) to police tariffs and trade are being trampled by Trump – leaving the body’s defense to some of the world’s most aggrieved neoliberal forces, in Beijing. Because Trump is launching “economic nuclear war on every country,” even Bill Ackman – a strong supporter of the president and a billionaire fund manager – conceded, “we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate.” Quite right. (This growing establishment hatred of Washington is extremely useful if progressives want to forge even brief alliances, e.g. to ‘Vote Trump off the G20 Island,’ a true Survivor approach which would be indisputably popular in the bloc’s capital cities, except for Buenos Aires and maybe Rome, and set the stage for the 2026 G20 not to be held in the U.S., but maybe jointly by Mexico and Canada instead, as should the 2026 soccer World Cup and 2028 Olympics.) 2. radical Keynesianism combined with dependency theory Both these approaches are highly critical of international trade, but not for the reasons Trump is. The last century’s leading British economist, John Maynard Keynes, at one point – in his 1933 Yale Review article – firmly advocated tariffs and other forms of protectionism, so as to support domestic industries and thus achieve much more balanced internal development: “let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and, above all, let finance be primarily national” (using tightened exchange controls). As for global economic regulation, Keynes’ last (unsuccessful) major project was to propose penalties for economies that ran trade surpluses: the ‘Bancor’ International Currency Union proposal at Bretton Woods in 1944. His objective was to use trade and currency controls to achieve self-correcting international economic stability, in the wake of a Great Depression and war caused in part by extreme commercial and financial volatility. From the Global South, a different critique of international trade and an even stronger advocacy of tariffs together aim to promote poor countries’ ‘delinking’ from dangerous international circuits of capital, and to protect infant manufacturing industries. Africa’s main contributor to this dependencia school was Egyptian political economist Samir Amin. He understood the differential labour values and ‘unequal ecological exchange’ (resource looting) that are embodied in South-to-North trade as benefiting transnational corporations, and causing Africa’s underdevelopment. Amin also criticised trade between impoverished countries and South Africa which – even after apartheid was defeated in 1994 – he viewed (until his death in 2018) as a malevolent capitalist power on the continent: “nothing has changed. South Africa’s sub-imperialist role has been reinforced, still dominated as it is by the Anglo-American mining monopolies.” Indeed AngloGold Ashanti and many similar Johannesburg firms have benefited from the South African National Defence Force’s ersatz quarter-century-long military presence in the eastern Congo. (Last November, these troops were recognised by the UN not for heroism, but as the peace-keeping force’s worst offenders for sexual exploitation, abuse and paternity lawsuits.) Pretoria’s troops were recently forced out of the DRC by invading Rwandan forces (and also lost battles in Northern Mozambique and the Central African Republic since 2013), but the critique of sub-imperial interests remains intact. 3. climate consciousness Opponents of ecocide – surely, all of us who aren’t climate denialists – regret the massive greenhouse gas emissions caused by excessive, often pointless international trade: 7%+ of all CO2 emanates from shipping and air transport, according to the International Transport Forum. And while the International Maritime Organisation has hosted a decade of talks about its members’ dirty bunker-fuel emissions – which for the sake of ‘polluter pays’ policy, should be costed at $1056/tonne (even the World Economic Forum admits) – these have been futile. The modest $150/tonne tax on shipping emissions demanded by increasingly-desperate Pacific and Caribbean small island states is this week being rejected by rich Western countries and also by an alliance centred on four BRICS members: Brazil, China, Indonesia and South Africa. Moreover, genuine ‘Just Transition’ plans are widely recognised as necessary to wean workers and affected communities off CO2-intensive export production, e.g. the West’s (highly flawed yet necessary) Just Energy Transition Partnerships and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms, but these and other climate obligations Trump has simply walked away from. The Pan African Climate Justice Alliance had already called on the world to impose trade sanctions on the U.S. as a result, a call that now has much more purchase. Indeed, to that end, many would support a ‘degrowth‘ approach seeking to stabilise and indeed diminish much of the high-carbon industrial output exported by many economies into the U.S. Those include steel, aluminium and automobiles – now 25% tariff victims – due to the vast waste involved in rich-country consumption. And South Africa is one of the worst, with the ‘Energy Intensive Users Group‘ of 27 multinational corporate exporters guzzling more than 40% of the country’s scarce electricity but hiring only 4% of workers in the formal sector. 4. African nationalism African patriots logically perceive Trump’s hatred of the continent (full of ‘S-hole countries‘) as, in part, behind attacks on its trade-surplus countries. Tiny Lesotho was hit by Trump with the highest new tariff on April 2 mainly because of its $240 million trade surplus with the U.S.: mostly Levi’s and Wrangler jeans and diamond exports, whereas imports from the U.S. are indirect, as they first are cleared by customs in South Africa. Trump also imposed 40%+ tariffs on Madagascar and Mauritius, because of their trade surpluses. The context for the continent’s (and world’s) rising anti-Americanism is Trump and Pretoria-born Elon Musk’s halt to financial support for African healthcare (especially AIDS-related – which could lead to 6.3 million unnecessary deaths by 2029 – and maternal), climate (mitigating emissions, strengthening resilience and covering ‘loss & damage’ relief), renewable energy and vitally-needed emergency humanitarian food supplies. Some critics here suggest these cuts reflect Trump’s white supremacy, called out by Pretoria’s fired ambassador to Washington, amplified by the fiscal chainsaw wielded by Musk, against whom protest is rapidly rising. All this means Trump is discarding Washington’s soft power, which notwithstanding the vast destruction in the meantime, could ultimately be very useful for anti-imperialists (in contrast to last November’s internecine squabbling over a controversial National Endowment for Democracy conference held in Johannesburg). 5. Marxist political economy Readers of Das Kapital understand that capitalist crises and the ‘devaluation’ of ‘overaccumulated capital’ (e.g. deindustrialisation once businesses addicted to exports to the U.S. shut down) reflect the mode of production’s intrinsic contradictions. In reaction, capitalism often degenerates into inter-imperial and imperial/sub-imperial rivalries, generalised trade wars (often based on tit-for-tat tariffs) and stock market turbulence. The conclusion drawn is that eco-socialist planning of the global economy in the public and environmental interest, is the only route out. (Disclosure: that’s my main bias but I’ll travel a long way with advocates of positions 2-4 as well.) For those outside mainstream, neoliberal logic, can the latter four framings be fused together for not only a coherent analysis but also a clear political response? The danger of not having a strategy linking Keynesians, environmentalists, nationalists and anti-capitalists is four-fold: 1. under a beggar-thy-neighbour ‘reciprocal tariff’ trade war, we all face a new version of a 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act and then a 1930s-style Great Depression (which by the way, was an extremely constructive period for South African capitalism, which grew 8% per year as a result of import-substitution industrialisation); 2. recognising the durable power of U.S. economic imperialism, individual governments will go cap-in-hand to Trump to beg for a bit of relief, offering absurd concessions in the process such as Ramaphosa’s invitation to drill baby drill; 3. surplus countries will redirect already-produced (or in-production) manufactured goods and commodities away from the now shuttered U.S. market, flooding all other potential buyers, thus further deindustrialising South Africa – whose main anti-dumping measures applied by the International Trade Administration Commission are against various ultra-cheap imports from China; and Naturally the mainstream logic of ‘searching for new markets’ – now that the U.S. is closing its trade doors – won’t get at the root cause of the problem. That cause is sometimes termed ‘uneven and combined development,’ in which over the past 40 years, the global trading system became exceptionally volatile and generative of ever worsening inequalities (especially unequal ecological exchange), i.e., depleting, polluting and emitting against the interests of poor economies and natural environments. This extreme abuse of commercial power being exercised with a vengeance by Trump, no matter how self-destructive financial markets have judged his Liberation Day, is only the latest reflection of Western economic chaos. The world has suffered extreme uneven development after the recovery from early-1980s global recession, as ‘Washington Consensus’ liberalisation kicked in everywhere due to debt crises and IMF/World Bank squeezing, and especially via global commerce following the capture by nearly all governments’ policies by the World Trade Organisation after 1994. The limits of trade globalisation became clear in 2008 – the peak year of world trade/GDP until until 2022 – as did the limits of financialised economies in recent months, in the form of overvalued ‘Buffett Indicators‘ of stock market capitalisation, unprecedented debt loads, currency volatility and recognition of the $’s malevolence after two Fed-led ‘Quantitative Easings’ and interest rate manipulations, etc. The damage done to South Africa’s industrial economy was amongst the most severe, as we lost most labour-intensive industries – clothing, textiles, footwear, appliances, electronics, etc – which had driven the manufacturing/GDP ratio up to 24%, before the steady decline to less than 13% by the 2010s. So the challenge is reversing that imbalance – i.e. fighting against uneven and combined development – with progressive policies, not merely relying upon the programme of dissatisfied export-oriented capitalists. Here in South Africa, the de facto retraction of AGOA zero-tariff access for locally-made luxury cars, aluminium, steel, petrochems, vineyard products and plantation nuts and citrus reminds that the main losers are capital-intensive extractive industries, carbon-intensive smelters and super-exploitative plantations, all with mainly white ownership. From Washington, the imperialist Hudson Institute last month even recommended not cutting the tariff-free AGOA trade programme, since “The communities that benefit most from the AGOA largely support South Africa’s pro-American political parties.” In contrast to Trump’s paleo-con isolationism and to neoliberal trade promotion, the four historically-progressive ideologies of Keynesianism, environmental justice, African nationalism and eco-socialism represent countervailing views. Programmatically, to move in their direction can only be assessed once the dust settles a bit and the distinction between those national leaders who are either fighting or who are obsequious, becomes clear. So far, South Africa’s leaders, under threat of losing their Government of National Unity related to a budget dispute caused by excessive neoliberalism, are decidedly in the latter category. In contrast, the potential for China to guide the international fightback is not merely witnessed in its WTO complaint against Trump, quickly filed on April 4. The same day, Beijing’s central bank experimented with a much more rapid, blockchain-secured digital alternative to the dollar-denominated cross-border bank settlement and clearance system, with 10 regional and another six West Asian economies now reportedly able to avoid the Brussels-based SWIFT network, even if merely for cost and speed savings. There have been far too many false alarms and hyped hopes about de-dollarisation. If it began in earnest thanks to Trump’s misstep, we’d much more likely see the venal, volatile Bitcoin take over, as Blackrock CEO Larry Fink warns, than the renminbi. All this suggests a far more durable approach is needed, to get out from under Trump’s thumb and then the dollar’s domination, and then escape the tyranny of capital. A series of non-reformist reforms were offered to Democracy Now! by Indian radical economist Jayati Ghosh, worth mulling over for countries like South Africa, and all others, as a last word: “There’s a silver lining in this for developing countries, which is that for too long, for maybe three decades, we’ve been told that the only way we can develop is through export-led growth. And that’s really — it’s been unfortunate, because we have never seen giving our own workers a fair deal as a good option. We’ve always seen wages as a cost, not as a source of our own domestic demand and market. It’s now time to actually change, to shift gears, to think about different trading arrangements, more regional arrangements, looking at other developing countries as markets, looking at our own population as markets, and thinking about the things we can do to create sustainable production, that’s not ecologically damaging, that actually provides living wages and decent working conditions within our own countries.” (The University of Johannesburg Centre for Social Change will convene a webinar on Trump tariffs in the G20-from-below series on Tuesday, April 15, 3pm SA time, 9am Washington time, here: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84736248638) * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Investors flee to German bonds as Trump tariffs spark Treasury sell-off

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/09/2025 5:26:37 AM PDT by Miami Rebel Global bond markets were gripped by volatility on Wednesday, as the rollout of U.S. President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs left investors scrambling to find safety as global equity markets resumed their sell-off. U.S. Treasurys sold off on Wednesday as a new wave of duties came into force and China announced fresh retaliatory action, with the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury last seen trading 12 basis points higher at '4.382% while the 2-year was 4 basis points higher at 3.768%. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions, as investors demand a lower price on the bond and a higher return on their loan to lend to governments that they see as riskier holdings. Across the Atlantic, longer-dated European government borrowing costs also rose. By 12:22 p.m. in London shortly after China’s announcement, the yield on French 10-year government bonds was 2 basis points higher, the Italian 10-year yield was up 6 basis points and the yield on British 10-year government bonds, known as gilts, was up 9 basis points. The 30-year gilt yield jumped nearly 23 basis points to a fresh 27-year high. Gilt yields are not only suffering spillover effects from the moves in Treasurys, but the gilt market is generally sensitive — relative to other high-grade bond markets — to catalysts that trigger yield rises given stretched margin calls from hedge funds, Diana Iovanel, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC. “It’s not too surprising to see more volatility in gilts than in other [developed market] government bonds against the risk-negative and highly uncertain global backdrop. Beyond that, the U.K.‘s stretched fiscal picture is arguably testing investors’ tolerance already,” she added. Germany bucked the trend as its 10-year bund , seen as a benchmark for the euro zone, traded 2 basis points lower. Shorter-dated bonds in Europe meanwhile rose in value. The yields on 2-year government bonds in France, Italy and Britain were 9, 6, and 4 basis points lower, respectively. The yield on Germany’s 2-year bunds dropped 12 basis points. “One factor people are speculating about on Treasurys is around the ongoing theme of a move away from the U.S. dollar, of it becoming less trusted,” Ken Egan, senior director for sovereigns at credit rating analysis agency KBRA, told CNBC in a call on Wednesday. “If you follow that through, one way that could manifest is structural holders of debt, reserve managers in China, could move away from Treasurys in response to policy moves from the U.S.” Egan added that secondary investors also appeared to be taking a step back from U.S. Treasurys, typically seen as a traditional safe haven assets, given the volatile geopolitical climate. “Various forces are at odds, because you have inflationary concerns and a rapid repricing of Treasurys on those, but on the other side you have weak demand and growth, and more rate cuts being priced in,” he told CNBC. German bonds were out of sync with the long-dated market on Wednesday because it is being seen as an alternative safe haven play, as investors — still stunned by the scale of Trump’s actions — wait for more clarity, he said. Egan also noted that European bonds with shorter maturity terms were rising in value as they are more policy-sensitive and traders want to lock in returns now, as more global interest rate cuts are being priced in. “Traditionally you might have gone into the U.S. during a period of volatility, but this is a U.S. story. Germany is benefiting from a wider flight to quality. The country has already told the market what it’s going to do, there’s clarity about what its path will look like,” Egan added, referencing Berlin’s recent passing of a huge fiscal package across infrastructure, climate and defense. In a note on Wednesday, Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard, likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.’s 2022 “mini budget” crisis, which rocked the country’s pension funds and led to emergency market intervention by the Bank of England. “The really worrisome thing about negative supply shocks is that they push up inflation and destroy demand at the same time, destroying the hedging capacity of bonds for equities. They are capital destroyers,” she said. “The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs. It is about investor perceptions over the probability of these types of shocks. And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.” Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that “we’re in a new world.” “This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,” he said. “Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we’ve got some technicals going on, we’ve got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.” Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region. “This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,” she said. “However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.” TOPICS: Business/Economy KEYWORDS: dollar Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.” Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that “we’re in a new world.” “This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,” he said. “Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we’ve got some technicals going on, we’ve got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.” Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region. “This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,” she said. “However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.” TOPICS: Business/Economy KEYWORDS: dollar Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

By 12:22 p.m. in London shortly after China’s announcement, the yield on French 10-year government bonds was 2 basis points higher, the Italian 10-year yield was up 6 basis points and the yield on British 10-year government bonds, known as gilts, was up 9 basis points. The 30-year gilt yield jumped nearly 23 basis points to a fresh 27-year high. Gilt yields are not only suffering spillover effects from the moves in Treasurys, but the gilt market is generally sensitive — relative to other high-grade bond markets — to catalysts that trigger yield rises given stretched margin calls from hedge funds, Diana Iovanel, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC. “It’s not too surprising to see more volatility in gilts than in other [developed market] government bonds against the risk-negative and highly uncertain global backdrop. Beyond that, the U.K.‘s stretched fiscal picture is arguably testing investors’ tolerance already,” she added. Germany bucked the trend as its 10-year bund , seen as a benchmark for the euro zone, traded 2 basis points lower. Shorter-dated bonds in Europe meanwhile rose in value. The yields on 2-year government bonds in France, Italy and Britain were 9, 6, and 4 basis points lower, respectively. The yield on Germany’s 2-year bunds dropped 12 basis points. “One factor people are speculating about on Treasurys is around the ongoing theme of a move away from the U.S. dollar, of it becoming less trusted,” Ken Egan, senior director for sovereigns at credit rating analysis agency KBRA, told CNBC in a call on Wednesday. “If you follow that through, one way that could manifest is structural holders of debt, reserve managers in China, could move away from Treasurys in response to policy moves from the U.S.” Egan added that secondary investors also appeared to be taking a step back from U.S. Treasurys, typically seen as a traditional safe haven assets, given the volatile geopolitical climate. “Various forces are at odds, because you have inflationary concerns and a rapid repricing of Treasurys on those, but on the other side you have weak demand and growth, and more rate cuts being priced in,” he told CNBC. German bonds were out of sync with the long-dated market on Wednesday because it is being seen as an alternative safe haven play, as investors — still stunned by the scale of Trump’s actions — wait for more clarity, he said. Egan also noted that European bonds with shorter maturity terms were rising in value as they are more policy-sensitive and traders want to lock in returns now, as more global interest rate cuts are being priced in. “Traditionally you might have gone into the U.S. during a period of volatility, but this is a U.S. story. Germany is benefiting from a wider flight to quality. The country has already told the market what it’s going to do, there’s clarity about what its path will look like,” Egan added, referencing Berlin’s recent passing of a huge fiscal package across infrastructure, climate and defense. In a note on Wednesday, Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard, likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.’s 2022 “mini budget” crisis, which rocked the country’s pension funds and led to emergency market intervention by the Bank of England. “The really worrisome thing about negative supply shocks is that they push up inflation and destroy demand at the same time, destroying the hedging capacity of bonds for equities. They are capital destroyers,” she said. “The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs. It is about investor perceptions over the probability of these types of shocks. And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.” Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that “we’re in a new world.” “This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,” he said. “Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we’ve got some technicals going on, we’ve got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.” Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region. “This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,” she said. “However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.” TOPICS: Business/Economy KEYWORDS: dollar Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Beyond that, the U.K.‘s stretched fiscal picture is arguably testing investors’ tolerance already,” she added. Germany bucked the trend as its 10-year bund , seen as a benchmark for the euro zone, traded 2 basis points lower. Shorter-dated bonds in Europe meanwhile rose in value. The yields on 2-year government bonds in France, Italy and Britain were 9, 6, and 4 basis points lower, respectively. The yield on Germany’s 2-year bunds dropped 12 basis points. “One factor people are speculating about on Treasurys is around the ongoing theme of a move away from the U.S. dollar, of it becoming less trusted,” Ken Egan, senior director for sovereigns at credit rating analysis agency KBRA, told CNBC in a call on Wednesday. “If you follow that through, one way that could manifest is structural holders of debt, reserve managers in China, could move away from Treasurys in response to policy moves from the U.S.” Egan added that secondary investors also appeared to be taking a step back from U.S. Treasurys, typically seen as a traditional safe haven assets, given the volatile geopolitical climate. “Various forces are at odds, because you have inflationary concerns and a rapid repricing of Treasurys on those, but on the other side you have weak demand and growth, and more rate cuts being priced in,” he told CNBC. German bonds were out of sync with the long-dated market on Wednesday because it is being seen as an alternative safe haven play, as investors — still stunned by the scale of Trump’s actions — wait for more clarity, he said. Egan also noted that European bonds with shorter maturity terms were rising in value as they are more policy-sensitive and traders want to lock in returns now, as more global interest rate cuts are being priced in. “Traditionally you might have gone into the U.S. during a period of volatility, but this is a U.S. story. Germany is benefiting from a wider flight to quality. The country has already told the market what it’s going to do, there’s clarity about what its path will look like,” Egan added, referencing Berlin’s recent passing of a huge fiscal package across infrastructure, climate and defense. In a note on Wednesday, Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard, likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.’s 2022 “mini budget” crisis, which rocked the country’s pension funds and led to emergency market intervention by the Bank of England. “The really worrisome thing about negative supply shocks is that they push up inflation and destroy demand at the same time, destroying the hedging capacity of bonds for equities. They are capital destroyers,” she said. “The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs. It is about investor perceptions over the probability of these types of shocks. And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.” Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that “we’re in a new world.” “This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,” he said. “Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we’ve got some technicals going on, we’ve got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.” Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region. “This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,” she said. “However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.” TOPICS: Business/Economy KEYWORDS: dollar Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

German bonds were out of sync with the long-dated market on Wednesday because it is being seen as an alternative safe haven play, as investors — still stunned by the scale of Trump’s actions — wait for more clarity, he said. Egan also noted that European bonds with shorter maturity terms were rising in value as they are more policy-sensitive and traders want to lock in returns now, as more global interest rate cuts are being priced in. “Traditionally you might have gone into the U.S. during a period of volatility, but this is a U.S. story. Germany is benefiting from a wider flight to quality. The country has already told the market what it’s going to do, there’s clarity about what its path will look like,” Egan added, referencing Berlin’s recent passing of a huge fiscal package across infrastructure, climate and defense. In a note on Wednesday, Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard, likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.’s 2022 “mini budget” crisis, which rocked the country’s pension funds and led to emergency market intervention by the Bank of England. “The really worrisome thing about negative supply shocks is that they push up inflation and destroy demand at the same time, destroying the hedging capacity of bonds for equities. They are capital destroyers,” she said. “The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs. It is about investor perceptions over the probability of these types of shocks. And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.” Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that “we’re in a new world.” “This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,” he said. “Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we’ve got some technicals going on, we’ve got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.” Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region. “This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,” she said. “However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.” TOPICS: Business/Economy KEYWORDS: dollar Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Germany is benefiting from a wider flight to quality. The country has already told the market what it’s going to do, there’s clarity about what its path will look like,” Egan added, referencing Berlin’s recent passing of a huge fiscal package across infrastructure, climate and defense. In a note on Wednesday, Freya Beamish, chief economist at TS Lombard, likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.’s 2022 “mini budget” crisis, which rocked the country’s pension funds and led to emergency market intervention by the Bank of England. “The really worrisome thing about negative supply shocks is that they push up inflation and destroy demand at the same time, destroying the hedging capacity of bonds for equities. They are capital destroyers,” she said. “The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs.

They are capital destroyers,” she said. “The issue here is not who is right or wrong about the long-term effects of tariffs. It is about investor perceptions over the probability of these types of shocks. And once this narrative starts to be priced in, the risk is of financial accelerators kicking in, as happened in the UK with the LDI crisis.” Alex Brazier, global head of investment and portfolio solutions at BlackRock, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Wednesday that recent months had been a reminder for investors that “we’re in a new world.” “This is not a situation where a classic broad stock index, broad bond index, set-and-forget portfolio is ideal,” he said. “Looking at the fundamentals of the U.S. bond market here, we’ve got some technicals going on, we’ve got early signs of stress in the swap market, that bears closely watching.” Meanwhile, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email on Wednesday that some European government bond yields had moved upward despite rising expectations of interest rate cuts in the region. “This is likely to be because investors are selling out their positions in European bonds to buy U.S. Treasuries given that they are offering higher yields,” she said. “However, U.S. Treasury yields are falling back again, and the situation remains very fluid.” TOPICS: Business/Economy KEYWORDS: dollar Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

This includes big companies and little people both. China and democrats are no doubt selling them to harm Trump too. If someone is selling, someone else is buying. No? I am a boomer (born in last year or 2 of the Gen). But Boomers perhaps squandered more national wealth than any country in history..not forced. Our Gen rush to buy cheap communist goods and sell out our jobs in the process is something I still don’t understand. Although to be honest I suppose many of the politicians and powerful in the 90s were of the Greatest Gen . Grok said only 3 of the top richest men in the USA in 1993 were Baby Boomers. One could argue that’s who started the mess. “first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory.” FDR They were higher in 2007, that’s less than 27 years ago. They were higher in 2007, that’s less than 27 years ago. Gold is a world market it always hold value no mater how trade markets do. Diamond are controlled by a few players but never gold. That the US Congress plans to add $5 trillion in new debt has nothing to do with this. /s Gold too very stable OK, supposed our economy collapsed and you had to use gold that was selling for $5,000 per ounce and you wanted to purchase an item for $1,000. How do you handle that. On the other hand if silver was selling for $100 per ounce, much easier to buy that item. Hey, I just saying if you can afford to buy gold have at it but I could afford gold I would be buying a lot of silver also. The only true source of safety is Physical gold in your home safe or buried under the basementIf GLD is paper its worthless...expect a short squeeze as people want physical gold and there isn't any available. If GLD is paper its worthless...expect a short squeeze as people want physical gold and there isn't any available. Exactly! The term ‘buying gold’ these days is a non-sequitur. What one is REALLY doing is dumping an IOU we have in our wallets, a poor devalued one at that, and getting back in our possession the metal behind that IOU. IOU = green-inked TP Legal in Texas...also the Texas the Gold Debit Card ...put in an oz of physical gold...say $3000 today and use it to spend until it runs out Ha Gold Stable....? it's $3000 an ounce now Expect $4000 an ounce by end of next year And $7000 the year after. it's $3000 an ounce now Expect $4000 an ounce by end of next year And $7000 the year after. Expect $4000 an ounce by end of next year And $7000 the year after. And $7000 the year after.

Title: China Puts Spoke In The Wheel After US Calls Beijing A Threat To Panama

China has slammed the United States' "bullying nature", after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Beijing was threatening the Panama Canal's operations. Beijing said US officials had "maliciously attacked" it over the key waterway to further its own interests. China is also reportedly influencing the Trump administration-backed sale of two key Panama Canal ports, operated by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, to US investment firm BlackRock."Senior US officials have maliciously attacked China, smearing and undermining China-Panama cooperation, once again exposing the United States' bullying nature," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing. This came after the Chinese embassy in Panama, in a statement on X, said the US has used "blackmail" to back its own interests and the "US doesn't have the right to interfere in" who Panama chooses to carry out business with. "The US has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the 'theoretical Chinese threat' in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United States' own geopolitical interests," the embassy wrote. Pete Hegseth's Panama Visit US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the second senior US official to visit Panama since President Donald Trump took office in January, on Tuesday vowed to "take back" the "US-built" canal to counter what he sees as China's influence over the waterway. Hegseth's visit to Panama comes two months after that of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. "Today, the Panama Canal faces ongoing threats...The United States of America will not allow communist China or any other country to threaten the canal's operation or integrity," Hegseth said in a speech Tuesday at a police station located at the entry to the shipping route. He also met with Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino, with the two issuing a joint statement that affirmed security ties. However, there was a notable discrepancy in the versions released by both sides on the issue of Panama's sovereignty over the canal. "Secretary Hegseth recognized Panama's leadership and inalienable sovereignty over the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas," read a Spanish-language statement released by Mulino's office. That sentence did not appear in the English-language statement released by the US government. However, shortly after that visit, Panama announced it was pulling out of Chinese President Xi Jinping's landmark global infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative. Panama Canal Issue Hong Kong company CK Hutchison operates two ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. The Trump administration has put immense pressure on Panama to reduce what it calls Chinese influence on the canal, which Washington sees as a threat to US national security. Panama has, however, denied the assertions that China exercises undue control over the waterway. But faced with Trump's repeated threats to seize the canal, Panama has put pressure on CK Hutchison to pull out of the country. In January, it began an audit of Panama Ports -- the subsidiary -- to determine if it was honoring its concession contract. After months of President Trump repeatedly saying that China asserted too much control over the Panama Canal, CK Hutchison, in March, announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the canal -- to a group led by giant US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. The deal was touted as a victory by President Donald Trump and was scheduled to be signed on April 2. But a furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, which likely prevented the parties from signing an agreement last week as had been planned, according to a report by AFP. It was further delayed after on the eve of Hegseth's visit, Panama's comptroller announced that the audit had revealed "many breaches" of the contract and said Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed from the operator.
