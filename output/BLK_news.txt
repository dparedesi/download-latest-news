What are institutions seeing that retail traders are missing? Even as Ethereum’s price hesitates around the $3,000 price level, the institutional engine behind the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) is running at full speed. On the 16th of December, on-chain data flagged a massive $140 million transfer as BlackRock deposited 47,463 ETH into Coinbase Prime. Far from a simple “sell-off” signal, this move reflects the complex rebalancing needed to manage the leading spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF during heavy market liquidations. While retail traders hesitate, BlackRock’s major rebalancing shows strong institutional confidence, as ETF issuers must keep adjusting ETH holdings to match inflows. This strategy helps stabilize the fund during volatility and reinforces Ethereum’s growing acceptance in traditional finance. Though BlackRock remains the institutional “gold standard,” it is no longer the undisputed heavyweight in the Ethereum treasury race. As of mid-December, BlackRock’s ETHA fund holds approximately 3.7 million ETH (approx. $11 billion). However, this massive stash has officially been eclipsed by BitMine Immersion (BMNR). Under the leadership of Tom Lee, BitMine has aggressively expanded its treasury to nearly 4 million ETH, signaling a “MicroStrategy-style” accumulation play that prioritizes protocol-level dominance over simple ETF fee collection. The timing of BlackRock’s 47,463 ETH deposit follows a turbulent period for US-based Ethereum ETFs. On the 16th of December, Farside Investors’ data revealed a staggering net outflow of $221.3 million from BlackRock’s ETHA. This single-day redemption accounted for nearly 99% of the total $224.2 million pulled from all US Ethereum ETFs combined. All in all, this suggests that while the “institutional machinery” is moving funds on-chain, it is largely to facilitate heavy redemptions from investors who are rotating capital or de-risking amidst a lackluster Q4 performance for the asset. That being said, this institutional reshuffling occurred against a backdrop of technical fragility. At the time of reporting, Ethereum was trading at $2,935.44. Despite a microscopic 0.77% gain in a 24-hour window, the broader trend remains bearish with ETH plummeting by 11.58% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap Hence, for BlackRock, the challenge is now two-fold: managing the logistics of massive ETF outflows while simultaneously defending a price floor that retail traders seem increasingly unwilling to support. This coincided with BlackRock’s recent $28.78 million acquisition of Ethereum, which the broader market has largely misread as mere price speculation. In reality, this move signalled BlackRock’s formal validation of Ethereum not as a “digital gold” alternative to Bitcoin, but as the essential financial infrastructure of the future. By securing this bundle of ETH, the world’s largest asset manager is effectively stockpiling the “fuel” necessary to run its BUIDL fund, which operates exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain. Ultimately, this acquisition shows BlackRock is no longer just participating in crypto, but actively building on Ethereum as mission-critical infrastructure for future global finance.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For 15 years, BlackRock's Kirsty Craig has operated as a kind of "translator" inside the world's largest asset manager, sitting between portfolio managers making big bets and engineers building the systems that help inform those decisions to get both sides aligned on driving returns. This skill set is part of what earned Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, the title of Tech Fellow, one of the firm's high technological distinctions, held by only two dozen of its thousands of engineers. Craig is one of five new fellows that the firm announced on December 16, recognized for supercharging the asset manager's investment team. This year, she is the only woman and the only fellow who works outside of Aladdin, the lucrative spine of BlackRock's investment technology. When it comes to her impact on how $13.5 trillion money manager BlackRock uses AI, Craig said she's especially proud of her role in Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. The "virtual investment analyst" was unveiled by Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein at the firm's investor day in June. It leverages AI to automate workflows and research, as many firms race to adopt the technology to speed up what were once monthslong investment processes. Now, as a fellow, Craig is even more embedded in BlackRock's efforts to stay ahead, as the firm continues to center on technological prowess. At first, Craig wasn't sure she'd become a tech fellow, largely because her work is different than most of the other fellows who work squarely within BlackRock's data analytics and risk platform, Aladdin. Her team of around 60 software engineers, data engineers, and data scientists "sits at the horizontal" across various investment capabilities to help drive investment research. She found out about the honor at the beginning of the month when a meeting was added to her calendar. When she heard the news, Craig started by telling the manager who had nominated her, her sponsor during the application process, her team, and her family, "but they've got no idea what it means," she told Business Insider. Nish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and the co-executive sponsor of the fellows program, said that existing tech fellows knew Craig not only for her innovation with AI in investing, but for her collaborative efforts. He described Craig as an "AI native," and added that her team is at the "tip of the spear" when it comes to applying AI to investment. Craig's time at different offices — Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia — has, she thinks, given her a strong foundation of horizontal leadership across teams. "I am responsible for really trying to find the dial movers across data, AI, and technology that really help our investment pillars drive investment research," she said of her work. Craig has learned how to communicate with both investors and Aladdin technologists, and said that building deep trust with both groups has been key to her success. "If you put both of those different personalities or personas together, quite often they're talking above or below each other. They struggle to connect. So for me, it's really been being able to translate both and then come up with a strategy in the middle," she said. For Craig, being a woman in a position of visible leadership is "a huge honor." Of the 24 tech fellows, five are women, including Craig. Women make up 43.8% of BlackRock's global workforce and 33.1% of senior leadership, according to data from January 1, 2025, posted on the firm's site. Craig said being involved in BlackRock's women and LGBTQ+ resource groups has informed her other work at the firm, especially in how they've taught her how to collaborate with people from across divisions and explain complicated topics. "If anything has probably helped me with, one, building my network; two, softer presentation skills; and then three, around how to communicate with impact," Craig said. With the title, she hopes to help more junior female technologists "lean in." For Ajitsaria, it's also important to have a diversity of expertise in the program and ensure that fellows represent all arms of BlackRock. When it comes to driving technology strategy itself, Craig said she's excited to keep figuring out how to leverage AI in active investing. Right now, her team is thinking about how to expand the scope of agentic research, potentially to areas like fixed income and macro investing. As she continues to soak up the news, Craig is also preparing for a very different big life change. Her partner is scheduled to give birth in early January, so, with the due date mere weeks away, Craig said they've kept all celebrating fairly tame so far. "We did go out for a meal. Nothing has been purchased, apart from cribs and bottles," she said. "Definitely some more celebrating will be done post January 6." Jump to

As concerns about the potential risks posed by quantum computing to the cryptocurrency landscape grow, the Solana Foundation has taken new measures by announcing a collaboration with Project Eleven, which specializes in post-quantum security. In a Tuesday press release, the Solana Foundation outlined its commitment to fortifying the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem against the implications of quantum computing. Through this initiative, Project Eleven has conducted a comprehensive threat assessment and successfully prototyped a functioning testnet utilizing post-quantum digital signatures. Under their engagement, Project Eleven undertook a risk analysis to evaluate how forthcoming breakthroughs in quantum computing could impact various facets of Solana’s infrastructure. Areas scrutinized included user wallets, validator security, and the foundational cryptographic assumptions that underpin the network. Moreover, Project Eleven has implemented a working post-quantum signature system on a Solana testnet, demonstrating that quantum-resistant transactions can be both practical and scalable. Matt Sorg, VP of Technology at the Solana Foundation, emphasized the organization’s approach: “Our responsibility is to ensure Solana remains secure not just today, but decades into the future.” He noted that the culture of innovation within the Solana ecosystem would continue to thrive with the upcoming release of a second client and an advanced consensus mechanism this year. Alex Pruden, CEO of Project Eleven, echoed this sentiment, stating, “Solana didn’t wait for quantum computers to become a headline problem. They invested early, asked the hard questions, and took actionable steps today.” Solana’s stance comes amid alarming reports indicating that quantum computers could potentially undermine blockchain security by developing algorithms capable of deciphering private keys. This scenario raises significant concerns for any digital assets operating on blockchain technology that rely on digital signatures, making them vulnerable to quantum hacking. As such, industry experts are actively exploring various measures to bolster cryptocurrency networks against these threats. Doug Finke, Chief Content Officer at Global Quantum Intelligence, pointed out that several groups are integrating the three post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms established by NIST into their platforms. He emphasized the uncertainty surrounding when a sufficiently powerful quantum computer might be developed, raising the stakes even further. Finke stated, “What’s worse, if an unfriendly party does develop such a computer, they may not let anyone know about it.” Currently, several cryptocurrencies have already begun incorporating quantum-safe cryptography into their architecture, including Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL), Cellframe, and Bitcoin Quantum from BTQ. Among those issuing warnings about the looming threats from quantum computing are notable figures such as Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, Capriole Investment founder Charles Edwards, and representatives from major firms like BlackRock and Google. Yakovenko has urged the Bitcoin community to accelerate efforts to implement quantum-resistant upgrades. He believes there is a 50% chance of a significant quantum breakthrough occurring within the next five years, further emphasizing the need for vigilance. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $127, which is a 6.7% decrease in price over the past seven days. Compared to the all-time high of $293 reached earlier this year, SOL is trading at almost 56% below this threshold.

Title: Court to reconsider inquest into death of infant born at Bessborough mother and baby home

Time Published: 2025-12-16T23:45:49Z
Full Content:
Cork South Coroner’s Court will reconsider holding an inquest into the death of a baby boy shortly after his birth at Bessborough mother and baby home, after the court’s chief coroner conceded a High Court challenge brought by the infant’s mother. Madeleine Bridget Marvier was 17-years-old when she was admitted to the home in Blackrock, Cork city, in August 1960. About two months later, she gave birth to her son, William Gerard Walsh. In December 1960, at 37 days old, William died at St Finbarr’s Hospital, Cork. In October 2023, Ms Marvier wrote to the Cork South Coroner asking that an inquest be held into the death of her son, on the grounds that his death was violent or unnatural, or was unexpected and from unknown causes, or was in suspicious circumstances. This request was refused. Ms Marvier brought judicial review proceedings against the Cork South Coroner in July challenging the refusal, claiming that a conclusion that the infant’s death is beyond doubt “cannot reasonably be drawn or inferred” and is “without basis” in the evidence she had put before the coroner. Ms Marvier brought the case alongside her daughter, Carmel Cantwell. On Tuesday, barrister Cillian Bracken, appearing for Ms Marvier, told Mr Justice Micheál O’Higgins that an order could be made on consent quashing the coroner’s decision to refuse to hold an inquest into the infant’s death. Mr Bracken said an order could also be made remitting the case to the deputy coroner for Cork South for reconsideration. An order against the coroner for his clients’ legal costs could also be made, counsel said. Barrister Eoin Sreenan, appearing for the coroner, said his client was consenting to the reliefs. Mr Justice O’Higgins granted the orders. Bessborough mother and baby home was operated by the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, an order of nuns, between 1922 and 1998. In 2021, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes concluded that 923 babies associated with Bessborough died during that time, but burial records for only 64 of them could be found. According to Ms Marvier’s court documents, her son’s death certificate – which she obtained in 1999 – attributed his death to renal abscess septicaemia, sepsis caused by an abscess in the kidney. Ms Marvier said she was previously unaware of the cause attributed to her son’s death. In 2019, after obtaining documents from Tusla, Ms Marvier learned for the first time that William had been buried at Carr’s Hill Cemetery in Cork, within the jurisdiction of the Cork South Coroner. In October 2023, Ms Marvier wrote to the Cork South Coroner asking that an inquest be held into the death of her son, on the grounds that his death was violent or unnatural, or was unexpected and from unknown causes, or was in suspicious circumstances. Included in her request was a report compiled by Dr Michael Munro, a consultant neonatologist, who opined that the death certificate’s stated cause of death was speculative and conjectural. In January this year, the coroner wrote to Ms Marvier refusing the request to hold an inquest. The coroner stated William did not die in a violent or unnatural manner, and on the balance of probabilities, did not die unexpectedly or from unknown causes, Ms Marvier’s court papers stated. Ms Marvier’s case noted the coroner’s purported assumption that in the absence of any record of a postmortem examination of the infant, there was no doubt around the cause of death of the infant, and therefore, there was no sufficient evidence available now to cast doubt on the death certificate’s cause of death. Ms Marvier claimed that the coroner made this assumption while at the same time acknowledging that medical records pertaining to the infant’s care at St Finbarr’s are now unavailable, and that it was not known what medical skills were employed in establishing William’s cause of death.

Title: JP Morgan’s move to Ethereum proves Wall Street is quietly hijacking the digital dollar from crypto natives

JP Morgan’s move into tokenized funds poses new challenges to traditional stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JP Morgan Chase & Co. has formally entered the contest for on-chain cash, and the prize is not just a new product line. It is the billions of dollars in institutional capital that now sit in zero-yield stablecoins and early tokenized funds. On Dec. 15, the $4 trillion banking giant launched the My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY) on the Ethereum blockchain, in its attempt to pull back liquidity into a structure it controls and regulators recognize. MONY wraps a traditional money-market fund in a token that can live on public rails, pairing the speed of crypto with the one feature payment stablecoins such as Tether and Circle cannot legally offer under new US rules: yield. That makes MONY less a DeFi experiment than JP Morgan’s attempt to redefine what “cash on-chain” means for large, KYC’d pools of capital. It also puts the bank in more direct competition with BlackRock’s BUIDL and the broader tokenized Treasuries sector, which has grown into a mid–tens of billions market as institutions look for yield-bearing, blockchain-native cash equivalents. To understand the timing, one has to start with the GENIUS Act, the US stablecoin law passed earlier this year. The statute created a full licensing regime for payment stablecoins and, crucially, banned issuers from paying interest to token holders simply for holding the token. As a result, the core business model for regulated dollar stablecoins is now codified: issuers hold reserves in safe assets, collect the yield, and pass none of it through directly. For corporate treasurers and crypto funds that hold large stablecoin balances for weeks or months, that embeds a structural opportunity cost. In a world where front-end rates hover in the mid-single digits, that “stablecoin tax” can run at roughly 4–5% per year on idle balances. MONY is designed to sit outside that perimeter. It is structured as a Rule 506(c) private placement money-market fund, not a payment stablecoin. That means it is treated as a security, sold only to accredited investors, and invested in US Treasuries and fully collateralized Treasury repos. As a money fund, it is structured to pass most of the underlying income back to shareholders after fees, not to trap the entire yield at the issuer level. Crypto research firm Asva Capital noted: “Tokenized money-market funds solve a key problem: idle stablecoins earning zero yield.” By letting qualified investors subscribe and redeem in either cash or USDC via JP Morgan’s Morgan Money platform, MONY effectively creates a two-step workflow. This allows the investors to use USDC or other payment tokens for transactions, then rotate into MONY when the priority shifts to holding and earning. For JP Morgan, this is not a side bet. The bank seeded MONY with around $100 million of its own capital and is marketing it directly into its global liquidity client base. As John Donohue, head of Global Liquidity at JP Morgan Asset Management, put it, the firm expects other global systemically important banks to follow. So, the message is that tokenization has progressed past pilots; it is now a delivery mechanism for core cash products. The economic logic becomes clearer when you look at collateral, not wallets. Crypto derivatives markets, prime brokerage platforms and OTC desks require margin and collateral around the clock. Historically, stablecoins like USDT and USDC have been the default because they are fast and broadly accepted. They are not, however, capital efficient in a high-rate regime. Tokenized money funds are built to fill that gap. Instead of parking $100 million in stablecoins that earn nothing, a fund or trading desk can hold $100 million of MMF tokens that track a conservative portfolio of short-term government assets and still move at blockchain speed between vetted venues. BlackRock’s BUIDL product has already shown how that can evolve. Once it gained acceptance as collateral on large exchanges’ institutional rails, it stopped being “tokenization as demo” and became part of the funding stack. MONY is aimed at the same corridor, but with a different perimeter. While BUIDL has pushed aggressively into crypto-native platforms through partnerships with tokenization specialists, JP Morgan is tying MONY tightly to its own Kinexys Digital Assets stack and the existing Morgan Money distribution network. So, the pitch for MONY is not to the offshore, high-frequency trading crowd. It is to pensions, insurers, asset managers and corporates that already use money-market funds and JP Morgan’s liquidity platforms today. Donohue has argued that tokenization can “fundamentally change the speed and efficiency of transactions.” In practical terms, that means shrinking settlement windows for collateral moves from T+1 into intraday, and doing it without moving out of the banking and fund-regulation perimeter. Moreover, the risk for stablecoins is not that they disappear. It is that a meaningful slice of the large, institutional balances that currently sit in USDC or USDT for collateral and treasury purposes migrate into tokenized MMFs instead, leaving stablecoins more concentrated in payments and open DeFi. Perhaps the clearest signal in MONY’s design is the choice of Ethereum as its base chain. JP Morgan has run private ledgers and permissioned networks for years; putting a flagship cash product on a public blockchain is an acknowledgment that liquidity, tooling and counterparties have converged there. Thomas Lee of BitMine views the move as a watershed moment, stating simply that “Ethereum is the future of finance.” This is a claim now supported by the fact that the world’s largest bank is deploying its flagship tokenized cash product on the network. However, the “public” blockchain launch here comes with an asterisk. MONY is still a 506(c) security. This means that its tokens can only sit in allowlisted, KYC’d wallets, and transfers are controlled to comply with securities law and the fund’s own restrictions. That effectively splits on-chain dollar instruments into two overlapping layers. On the permissionless layer, retail users, high-frequency traders and DeFi protocols will continue to rely on Tether, USDC and similar tokens. Their value proposition is censorship resistance, universal composability and ubiquity across protocols and chains. On the permissioned layer, MONY and peer funds like BUIDL and Goldman’s and BNY Mellon’s tokenized MMFs offer regulated, yield-bearing cash equivalents to institutions that care more about audit trails, governance and counterparty risk than about permissionless composability. Their liquidity is thinner but more curated; their use cases are narrower but higher-value per dollar. Considering this, JP Morgan is betting that the next meaningful wave of on-chain volume will come from that second group: treasurers who want Ethereum’s speed and integration without taking on the regulatory ambiguity that still surrounds a large part of DeFi. Ultimately, MONY looks less like a revolution against the existing system and more like a defensive pivot inside it. For a decade, fintech and crypto firms chipped away at banks’ payment, FX and custody businesses. Stablecoins then went after the most fundamental layer: deposits and cash management, offering a digital bearer-like alternative that could sit outside bank balance sheets entirely. By launching a tokenized money-market fund on public rails, JP Morgan is trying to pull some of that migration back inside its own perimeter, even if it means cannibalizing parts of its traditional deposit base. George Gatch, CEO of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, has emphasized “active management and innovation” as the core of the offering, implicitly contrasting it with the passive float-skimming model of stablecoin issuers. Meanwhile, bank is not alone. BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have already moved into tokenized MMFs and tokenized cash-equivalent products. So, JP Morgan’s entry shifts that trend from early experimentation to open competition among incumbents over who will own institutional “digital dollars” on public chains. If that competition succeeds, the effect will not be the end of stablecoins or the triumph of DeFi. Instead, it would be a quiet re-bundling as the settlement rails will be public, and the instruments running on them will look a lot like traditional money-market funds. However, the institutions earning a spread on the world’s cash will, once again, be the same Wall Street names that dominated the pre-tokenization era. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

They became members of BlackRock's Tech Fellows program, a group of 24 senior technologists playing a crucial role in the $13.5 trillion firm's vision and operations. This year's members underwent a rigorous application process — from being nominated to completing written evaluations and interviews — before being voted into the program by current fellows, Nish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and executive sponsor of AI, and the co-executive sponsor of the program, said. "We think about the combination of technical expertise, domain expertise, commercial mindset, but really lifting the platform, the culture, the experience across the firm," said Ajitsaria, who has been involved with Tech Fellows since it launched in 2020. Many of this year's fellows are credited with mentoring other technologists, according to an internal announcement shared with Business Insider. Technologists are gaining more and more influence on Wall Street as firms race to adopt AI. BlackRock has long positioned itself as equal parts financial technology company and asset manager. Aladdin — the firm's sprawling risk and portfolio management platform — underpins its client relationships, and tech-related revenue is among its fastest-growing businesses. BlackRock's technology services and subscription revenue jumped 28% year-on-year over the last quarter, fueled by Aladdin and the integration of newly acquired Preqin's private-markets data business, the firm reported in its latest earnings. Four of this year's fellows work in Aladdin, though Ajitsaria said that the group has always represented a wide swath of the firm's businesses. "We are also really deliberate about leveraging and applying our tech fellows to the firm's most critical technology initiatives," Ajitsaria said. As of 2023, one in every third BlackRock employee was a software engineer or technologist, according to a document about the firm. Fellows meet internally at least once a month and are expected to foster the firm's engineering culture both internally and externally — they might, for example, contribute to BlackRock's engineering blog or attend conferences, Ajitsaria said. BlackRock has set high targets for the year 2030, when it aims to reach $35 billion in annual revenue and fundraising $400 billion in private markets. As Ajitsaria said, "the 2030 vision of BlackRock is very much underpinned by technology." These five new fellows have just become a more integral part of that vision. As the head of Aladdin Studio Engineering for Aladdin Data, David Woodhead has spearheaded the effort to "open Aladdin," giving stakeholders access to the platform's data and analytics models, among other tools. He's recognized for "championing modern data platforms, cloud-native technologies, and open-source adoption," according to the internal announcement. Woodhead has helped craft the very architecture of Aladdin. Beyond his role at Aladdin Studio, Woodhead also oversees services that give Aladdin and its clients reference, market, and other third-party data. He joined BlackRock in 2006 and is based in Virginia, serving as a managing director. Kirsty Craig has been at BlackRock for 15 years and now serves as the head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech. She's shaped how the firm uses AI and data science in investment research. While Craig is this year's only fellow who doesn't work within the Aladdin program, she has forged collaboration between the investment and technology teams. Craig has worked in offices in Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia, and is currently a managing director. New York-based director Infant Vasanth is known for his work pushing BlackRock's internal research and automation platform forward. He joined the firm in 2011 and is now a senior director of engineering, running the team behind an analytics and automation platform. Vasanth, an advocate for open-source, often speaks at tech conferences and is the brain behind multiple patent filings. He also leads a team focused on Aladdin Studio's AI abilities. "Drawing on deep expertise in neural networks and pattern-recognition algorithms, he applies research rigor to building enterprise-scale AI systems," the announcement said. Michael Duncan, a director and engineering lead on Aladdin's Trading Engineering team, is the architect behind a collection of tools dubbed BlackRock's Xceler Ecosystem, which is now integral across Aladdin and has helped raise engineering standards. His team is in charge of "delivering multi-asset trading solutions and technology across global markets," and Duncan has improved its abilities. Beyond that, Duncan is the global engineering lead for part of Aladdin and leads a client support and performance engineering program. Duncan joined BlackRock in 2020 and is based in Chicago. New York-based Charlie Johnston joined BlackRock as a summer intern in 2013 and has worked his way up to being a director. A software engineer, he has improved the quality of the asset management giant's code and development processes. "Charlie's technical contributions and collaborative approach have strengthened the engineering community across Aladdin," the internal announcement reads. Jump to

December 16, 2025 11:27 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Carbon-Smart Investment Portfolio Global Market Report 2025" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The carbon-smart investment portfolio market is witnessing significant expansion, projected to rise from $28.18 billion in 2024 to $33.35 billion by 2025, with a robust CAGR of 18.4%. This growth is propelled by heightened focus on climate-related financial risks, the surge in green bond issuance, and the enhanced performance of renewable energy assets. Contributing factors include the expanding use of climate stress testing and the increasing availability of carbon-offset projects. Looking ahead, the market is set to escalate to $64.67 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 18%. Driving this momentum are factors such as the escalating demand for sustainable investments, rising awareness of climate change repercussions, government incentives favoring low-carbon projects, and a growing interest in net-zero aligned portfolios. Increased transparency in carbon reporting and the integration of blockchain technology are significant trends alongside advancements in carbon accounting, offset verification, and climate risk models. The surge in green building certifications is a pivotal growth driver for carbon-smart investment portfolios. As governments, businesses, and occupiers aim for energy-efficient and sustainable construction, the role of such portfolios becomes increasingly crucial. They provide capital for projects meeting sustainability standards, incentivize energy-efficient practices, and support certified green developments. Notably, in July 2024, the U.S. Green Building Council reported over 46,000 residential projects certified under the LEED rating system, exemplifying this upward trajectory. Key market players are developing innovative strategies to enhance carbon sequestration and biodiversity, attracting environmentally conscious investors. For instance, the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec partnered with Clean Energy Finance Corporation to launch Meldora, a $165 million sustainable agriculture platform promoting climate-smart farming and renewable energy, resulting in high-quality Australian carbon credits. Similarly, in April 2025, Meta Platforms Inc. collaborated with EFM Investments & Advisory LLC to foster climate-smart forestry in Washington State. The alliance aims to generate 676,000 forest carbon credits by 2035, transitioning 68,000 acres to management practices that enhance carbon storage and biodiversity, aligning with Meta's goal to attain net-zero emissions by 2030. Prominent players shaping the carbon-smart investment landscape include Allianz Global Investors GmbH, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., Legal & General Investment Management Ltd., UBS Asset Management AG, and Fidelity Investments, among others. The carbon-smart investment portfolio market analysis indicates that Europe was the largest region in 2024, with Asia-Pacific anticipated to witness the fastest growth rate.

Title: Altcoins update: XRP ETFs hit $1B in inflows; whales offload Ethereum
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/altcoins-update-xrp-etfs-hit-1b-in-inflows-whales-offload-ethereum/
Time Published: 2025-12-16T15:48:14Z
Full Content:
Cryptocurrencies extended their weakness on Tuesday, with Bitcoin sliding toward $85K. The value of all digital assets has declined by 3% over the past day to $2.96 trillion. Sentiments are deteriorating daily due to thin liquidity, as even fundamentally healthy projects are failing to sustain prolonged upsides. Amidst the gloomy outlook, investors are becoming more defensive, with institutional players reducing exposure as they rotate to narratives dominating the current landscape. This divergence is visible in leading altcoins, XRP and Ethereum, in this case. Let us explore further. Ripple’s token is recording a rare enterprise win amid broad market declines. According to SoSoValue data, XRP-linked exchange-traded funds have hot $1 billion in cumulative inflows. That marks a crucial milestone for a product that launched on November 13. Notably, XRP ETFs have recorded consistent daily inflows since their debut. The substantial inflows, within a short timeframe, indicate that expert investors are narrowing their focus and not exiting crypto altogether. XRP’s compliant ETF structure makes it appealing for institutions seeking cryptocurrency exposure without handling operational risks or custody. Most importantly, the inflows suggest a long-term positioning strategy, rather than chasing near-term price fluctuations. XRP’s institutional attractiveness lies in its improved regulatory clarity and clear use cases. Narratives matter the most during bearish sessions. Indeed, traditional investors will justify a payment-focused blockchain ecosystem faster than highly speculative or experimental narratives. Moreover, ETFs are crucial for enterprises looking to manage risk as they offer transparency, compliance, and liquidity. These features are valuable during unstable markets and have helped XRP-related products absorb pressure as rivals endure outflows. Meanwhile, XRP is trading at $1.92 after losing 7% the previous week. While the XRP community cheered staggering inflows, Ethereum is encountering immense selling pressure as large-scale holders reduce their exposure. According to Lookonchain, BlackRock has deposited 47,463 ETH, valued at approximately $140 million, to Coinbase Prime. Markets have interpreted the transaction as a preparation to sell. At the same time, the Konstantin Lomashuk-linked wallet sold 14,585 tokens, worth roughly $42.71 million, today, when ETH changed hands at $2,928. Also, Lookonchain revealed two whales that dumped Ethereum worth around $40.82 million, 14,000 tokens early today. The magnitude and timing of these transfers have intensified bearish sentiments around the largest altcoin. These transactions coincide with an already fragile market, amplifying downward momentum for ETH prices. Ethereum is trading at $2,928 after losing 3% and 6% the past day and week.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The IPO window may have cracked open, but it seems some former startups have no intention of going public. Makes sense, in a way: IPOs were traditionally a way to raise money, and if you can manage to raise ungodly amounts without having to put your company through public scrutiny, why do it? Databricks is proving that point: The data intelligence company has just raised more than $4 billion in a Series L funding round at a $134 billion valuation — up 34% from the $100 billion valuation that it achieved just three months ago. This is Databricks’ third major venture fundraise in less than a year, and it comes as the company focuses on building products that address the needs of the AI revolution: a database for AI agents, an AI agent platform, and apps that let companies build and deploy data and AI applications. The company is investing heavily in its database for AI agents, known as Lakebase, which is based on the open source database Postgres (enabled by the $1 billion acquisition of a startup called Neon), and is aimed at corporate developers’ vibe-coding projects. Meanwhile, its AI agent platform, Agent Bricks, is aimed at helping businesses build and deploy AI agents that can tap into their data. The company has also struck hefty deals worth hundreds of millions with AI labs Anthropic and OpenAI to offer their models within its enterprise products. Series L rounds aren’t really common, but the fact that Databricks has managed to raise venture funding at ever-increasing valuations (it was valued at $60 billion around this time last year) indicates how strongly investors believe in the power of helping companies use data to fuel their AI efforts. Indeed, Databricks on Tuesday said it now generates run-rate revenue of more than $4.8 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, of which more than $1 billion came from its AI products. “The parallel rise of vibe coding and generative AI is accelerating the development of data-intelligent applications in the enterprise. Databricks will use this new capital to help customers build AI apps and agents on their proprietary data, leveraging Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user experience layer, and Agent Bricks to power multi-agent systems,” the company said in a press release. The Wall Street Journal reports that the company will also use the new money to add thousands of new jobs in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, as well as bring on more AI researchers. “Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads,” Databricks’ co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi said in a statement. The round was led by Insight Partners, Fidelity, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Andreessen Horowitz, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, GIC, MGX, NEA, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Robinhood Ventures, T. Rowe Price Associates, Temasek, Thrive Capital, and Winslow Capital also participated. Topics Editor Ram is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Title: Visa launches USDC settlement for US banks on Solana blockchain

Visa launched USDC settlement for US financial institutions, starting with Cross River and Lead Bank on Solana, with a wider rollout planned for 2026. Payment processing giant Visa has launched USDC settlement services for some United States-based financial institutions. Visa said Tuesday that its USDC (USDC) settlement service is available for US financial institutions, with Cross River Bank and Lead Bank as the first participants; they have already begun settling with Visa in USDC on the Solana blockchain, and a broader rollout is expected in 2026. The report follows USDC issuer Circle’s launch of the public testnet for its layer-1 blockchain Arc, with over 100 major partners, including Visa, Mastercard, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, in late October. Visa noted that it is a design partner for the network, which “offers the performance and scalability needed to help support Visa’s global commercial activity.” Visa said it plans to use Arc for USDC settlements within its network and operate a network node. The payment giant’s global head of growth products and strategic partnerships, Rubail Birwadker, said “financial institutions are looking for faster, programmable settlement options that integrate seamlessly with their existing treasury operations.” Visa said the US launch is part of a larger effort to modernize its settlement infrastructure. Birwadker’s comments suggest that adopting stablecoins is a way for the company to ensure it remains relevant when stablecoins gain a more substantial foothold. He said, “Visa is expanding stablecoin settlement because [its] banking partners are not only asking about it — they’re preparing to use it.” Visa appears to be taking an active role in helping financial institutions adopt stablecoins for their operations. On Monday, the company launched a global Stablecoins Advisory Practice, a unit tasked explicitly with helping banks, merchants and fintechs design, roll out and manage stablecoin products. Related: YouTube enables PYUSD stablecoin payouts for US creators: Report On Nov. 27, Visa announced it had expanded its use of stablecoins for settlement in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa by partnering with crypto infrastructure company Aquanow. The partnership aims “to settle transactions using approved stablecoins such as USDC, reducing costs, operational friction, and settlement times.” Visa cited strong demand from banks and payment companies as the reason behind the initiative. Still, not all Visa stablecoin products are institution-facing services. On Nov. 12, Visa launched a pilot in the US, allowing US dollar-pegged stablecoin payouts to user wallets to be sent from business accounts funded using fiat currency. Visa said it is in the process of onboarding “select partners,” and broader access to the service will be rolled out in 2026.

Business FILE PHOTO: Databricks logo is seen in this illustration taken December 17, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Dec 16 : Databricks said on Tuesday that it has raised more than $4 billion at a valuation of $134 billion, the latest example of investors betting big on companies benefiting from the broader adoption of artificial intelligence. The Series L funding round for Databricks, which provides a software platform that helps firms manage large amounts of data and build their own AI models, came less than six months after its previous round at a valuation of $100 billion. It has given the San Francisco-based company a war chest to maintain investment momentum against competitors. "It's a race, and everybody's investing," Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi said in an interview.

Revenue from its AI products and data warehousing businesses each exceeded a $1 billion run rate, all while delivering positive free cash flow over the last 12 months, it added. The company plans to use the funds for research and development, to expand its go-to-market teams and for talent retention, which includes providing liquidity to employees through secondary share sales.

All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast. Another banger, Steve Cohen is BlackRock’s Chief Product Officer and Head of Product Solutions. BlackRock runs three and a half trillion dollars to the world’s largest asset manager. Their iShares ETF division is over $5 trillion. There are a few people in the world better situated to identify what is happening in the world of asset and wealth management than Steve Cohen. Not just fixed income, active index, bitcoin digital assets. They’re also moving into privates and alternatives. Whether that’s an ETF or just part of that platform is something else entirely. I, I thought this conversation was fascinating and I think you will also, with no further ado, BlackRock’s, chief Product Officer and head of Product Solutions, Stephen Cohen. Stephen Cohen: It’s great to be here. Barry Ritholtz: We’re gonna talk a lot about what you do at BlackRock and how the company has been growing, but I wanna start with your background degree in economics from Southampton College. Was the plan always to go into investment strategy or what were you thinking back then? Stephen Cohen: I’m not sure I had a plan. I, I studied economics at school and then at university and I, I was always, I was always very interested in this kind of concept of the markets. I didn’t have any background, no family background in, in markets or investing, but I always found reading up about markets interesting. And, and what kind of got me in, it was a slight fluke. We were talking about flukes before the show. One of my neighbors was a telecoms engineer, and he used to go round to all the banks installing the dealer boards. And he, one day, and I was talking to him and he, one day. Barry Ritholtz: Various ATMs, automatic tele machines, we call ’em here. Stephen Cohen: The phone phone systems that, that you use on the trading floors, you know, that come with all the hoot and holler and all that kind of stuff, I think meant Barry Ritholtz: Those were the big, at ATM manufacturers way Stephen Cohen: , they were. And, and he said, so I got talking about em and I mentioned this interest and he said, well, why don’t you do a day’s work experience with me? We’ll go to a bank. So we went to one of the banks, I can’t remember which one it was, and I walked onto this trading floor, you know, for someone who had no experience or never experienced this before, it was amazing. There was people shouting, there was screens and flashing numbers and stuff like that. And I thought, you know what? This, this looks pretty cool. This buzz was, was so the kind of combination of an opportunity to work in something that, that took economics and markets and the world, and then this kind of feeling of a buzzy environment, that was the thing. And so I applied to a number of banks and outta university got an opportunity to go to UBS. Barry Ritholtz: So that was your first gig right? Outta school you were working with convertibles and fixed income and something similar at ING Barings. Yeah. Tell us about your, your work at UBS and ING. What, what sort of job was it? Stephen Cohen: So I worked, I originally started in fixed income and, and then, and then went into convertible bonds. And a lot of what I spent my time doing was kind of more market strategist type of roles. So talking to clients about what was going on in the markets, what was going on in the bond markets, trade, I, you know, developing trade ideas for clients. And, and then that’s also how I got involved in spending quite a lot of time on the Japanese markets, which I found, you know, incredibly interesting and really got to understand kinda the Japanese culture and, and the, the way, the way the country operated. And Barry Ritholtz: Is that what led you to Nomura? Or did Nomura come first and then the Japanese exposure that Stephen Cohen: Yeah, it, it did. So getting involved in Japan kind lent me to, to doing, to doing convertible bonds originally at ING and then with a group of us at Namur. And, and that’s where I spent a lot more time on the Japanese markets. And I think it’s all part of how you, you know, I think back to to those days, you know, Japan was very different to what it is kind of now the market, definitely the market at the time was about nine, the nicko was about 9,009, 10,000 given where? Barry Ritholtz: Down from 39,000. Stephen Cohen: Yeah. Now we’re back at 46,000. So there’s like a proper v shape of that market, Barry Ritholtz: Right. Only took three and a half decades, Stephen Cohen: Only took three and a half decades. And I, and I managed to do the middle bit, which was not necessarily the most exciting bit, I’ve gotta be honest. But I think, you know, again, it was a, what was interesting about it is you learn about kind of an, an economy and therefore a stock market that is in such a different place as it was then to, you know, looking at the US market or the European markets at the time. Barry Ritholtz: So that raises a really interesting question. How do you think, how do you think about the 1990s, even the two thousands Euro nomura till 2011? How do you think about those decades versus today? It, that world doesn’t seem like it’s that long ago, but it really feels like it was so different. Stephen Cohen: It feels incredibly different. I think for Japan it’s completely different. And you know, if you go back to, as you say, the late nineties, early two thousands, you know, the banking crisis that was part of the bubble and the collapse had still not been solved. And it was only really in the early, early to mid two thousands that they finally kind of got their arms around the banking system. And one thing you read about history, and unless you can get the banking system operating properly and lending, you really struggle to get an economy going. The second thing that’s really interesting I think is so different is back then you would, every six months, every year there would be a government led fiscal impulse. Right? And, you know, they used to call it the building the roads to nowhere. Right. You know, paving the entire country. Right. Just gotta kind of spend and spend and spend. And the reaction of the market to that was, this is gonna have no impact. The reaction now to fiscal spending is actually this is, you know, great, this is kind of part of the economy. The, the country kinda being back on its feet. You’re now talking about inflation being potentially an issue in Japan. Whereas there, it was all about deflation. So it’s quite amazing how it has turned around. And you’re seeing that in the bond market and just the yields. Barry Ritholtz: One, one of the things I’m kind of fascinated about following the Japan, Japan bubble popping in 89 and how long it took to recover from that is the concept, and I’m apologies in advance from my mispronunciation of risu, which is the Japanese concept of these vertically integrated companies, manufacturing, retail, banking, like just every sector, if there’s a banking problem, the entire economy seems to run into trouble. ’cause that whole vertical Hmm. Sometimes it’s Mitsubishi, sometimes it’s whatever. Each of these entities are giant. And if the bank has a problem, wow, you’re really doing some damage. Stephen Cohen: Yeah. ’cause I think if you look back to the history, and again, this is, this is changing and, and, and different to the way we’d think about kinda western markets and companies, but Japan, historically it was a bank lending market. You, you got financing through bank lending, all the stock market. And so banks were just so central to the way the economy operated. And you see parallels to that in Europe, a little bit less here in the US it’s very different now. You know, there’s the, there’s the banking sector, which is obviously very critical to the way companies and financing. But you have this huge kind of private sector. You have private lending, direct lending, things like that. So again, it’s good. I think one of the things I’ve learned over my career and had the opportunity to work in different markets is you start to see these, the way these economies operate is different and therefore the, the impact on the markets and therefore investors is very, very different. Barry Ritholtz: So you stay at Mura till 2011. How did you, what brought you from Mura to BlackRock? Stephen Cohen: I had an opportunity, you know, having had a lot of great experiences. You know, 2011 BlackRock was probably 18 months into the integration of the iShares business or the, the indexing business. And really focused on how do we expand this business, particularly how do we expand iShares this, you know, this ETF business. And back in 2011, Europe European ETFs was still a very nascent industry. You know, now it’s like a two and a half trillion dollar industry. I, European iShares is over a trillion dollars. Back then it was very much still the very early days. And you could see what is, what was happening in the states. And so when I was speaking to BlackRock, you could see this really interesting opportunity to, to kind of take all of what I’d done before in terms of the market’s kinda background and the breadth of experience, and then apply it to this thing that was still pretty new. And the kind of mission was how do you educate people about what an ETF is? How do you help people start to think about how to use an ETF in a portfolio? And by the way, also, what are the ETFs that don’t exist yet that could exist? And again, you always have to, it’s quite hard. You always have to cast a, you know, Barry, you always have to cast your mind back to what it was then versus your perspective of where you are today. It was still fairly, you know, plain vanilla Barry Ritholtz: So go back to the 1990s, Im pretty sure the Qs were around then, and SPY might’ve been around, but this is before really iShares was still part of Barclays. But no one really thought that ETFs were a giant market waiting to take place, or I should say very few people thought that the ones who did ended up being at the head of a giant wave. What made you realize 15 years ago that, hey, this iShares thing is gonna be big one day? Stephen Cohen: Honestly, it was talking to the people in iShares. It was having kind of been introduced to them and having been approached to, to go and talk to them. It was, I learned a lot from just sitting down and, and understanding this. I’d sat in banks, we traded ETFs. They were, to be honest, a very, very small component of what we, of what we did. It was only really when I spoke to the people at iShares and the BlackRock and understood the history of how iShares had grown and where it was then. And the, that sense of mission, that sense of kind of the purpose of giving more access to investing to, to people, you know, and creating more transparency that they had lived as they grow in the US business. And they were growing the European business. And that kind of just captured you. And I think frankly in the last 15 years I’ve seen that and been fortunately been part of kind of driving that. But it was very clear that there was a big opportunity to do something different in an industry, an asset management industry that hadn’t really been shaken up. And I think one thing that ETFs have done, and iShares has led this is really shaken up the industry on behalf of end investors in a couple of ways. Barry Ritholtz: At at the very least they’re very low cost. And it’s raised questions about our do most, not all, but do most active managers actually justify their fees relative to their performance. And then second, helping to move a lot of mom and pop investors, at least having a core as passive indexing as opposed to an allocation that’s nothing but active managers. I mean, iShares has been the biggest driver of that. When you started at BlackRock, what was, what was the first job? Stephen Cohen: So I started in the iShares business and I actually set up an investment strategy team. And what we did was go out and talk to clients about what was going on in markets. You know, we were part of BlackRock, now I shares was part of BlackRock. And so there’s, you know, a huge pedigree of investing and how do you take that externally to, to our clients and educate them about how ETFs could be used to implement these ideas, build portfolios. I have to say in the early days, a lot of it was just educating people on what, what is an ETF? Like how does it actually work? How, how, what is a creation? What is a redemption? And what do I need to understand and know? Secondly, how do I then think about putting them in a, in a portfolio? And what’s interesting, I remember a couple of years in probably this probably 18 minutes, months into my time at BlackRock, we did a big study on how do you blend active and indexing. And we were very allergic to the word passive, right? Like, because you know, we used to go out and say to people, which we still do, you know, every decision you make is active, right? That’s right. Barry Ritholtz: If you market cap weighted, I mean, it could have, it’s a decision been equal cap. Stephen Cohen: Totally. You know, investing in US equities is a decision, it’s an active decision. Then deciding to use an ETF is an active decision. So we would, you know, we would talk to clients about, and what does it mean to use an ETF? How does it fit with, with active management? Which again, go back to, I think it’s pretty well accepted now. I think BlackRock has, and the ETF industry has played a big, big role in this, but the concept of blending, indexing and active managers and alpha in one portfolio is that’s, that’s kind of very accepted. People gonna get that. It’s pretty standard. It wasn’t back then 10, 14 years ago. And in some respects it was slightly religious in terms of indexing or like, you are either passive or you’re active. Barry Ritholtz: I recall the phrase that was used in the two thousands core and satellite; And, and you don’t hear that all that much anymore. Now it’s, you have a passive core and you’re, you’re decorating it with active choices around it. Stephen Cohen: Yeah. It’s kinda how do you get the best out of, out of everything. How, how do you say, you know what, actually, here’s an area where I think that we can deliver alpha, which is really what you’re, when you say active, what you’re really saying is like alpha something, alpha something, something beyond the index. And I come back to a point you made earlier, Barry, about how the industry shifted. I think what ETFs did is they sh shone a light on what is, what is performance, right? And you know, if you can get the index through an etf, it’s very efficient. Then as an active manager, you’ve gotta deliver something more. And many, many active managers of BlackRock do deliver more. But I think that that element of the more became a very important component of the industry and component of how for many investors, they could then blend these, these different tools together to create better portfolios. And I think that’s the journey to me in the last kind of 12, you know, 12, 14 years. It’s been so exciting. Barry Ritholtz: You said when you began, you went out and spoke to a variety of BlackRock clients. Were these mom and pop investors, were these institutional clients? Were they brokers and RIAs that are investing in ETFs on behalf of their clients? Who were the folks that you first reached out to? It Stephen Cohen: Was pretty broad actually. It, it tended to be wealth managers and it tended to be institutional investors, which would be, you know, primarily pension funds. But what’s interesting is how that has, how that’s expanded over the last, again, the last kind of decade. You know, if I look at, if I look at the breadth of users now is anything from central banks through to, you know, retail investors in 401k plans or the equivalent in Europe. And I think that’s been one of the secrets to the, to, to why ETFs have grown so quickly is that they actually are very much a product or a tool for anybody and everybody. So it started very much with I would say kind of wealth manages and pension funds. But it grew out and out and out and frankly in Europe we learned a lot from the way the US industry had had grown. We talk all, all the time about how the European ETF industry is probably about 10 years behind the us And so there’s a bit of a roadmap there. And you know, I think we’re seeing that happen in real time. Barry Ritholtz: When I over at Europe and, and so especially the UK, it seems like index adoption has been very slow. People haven’t quite bought into the concept of, hey, before you go after alpha, at least start with beta. That hasn’t really found a lot of traction there yet. Or are you seeing that start to change in Europe? Stephen Cohen: We’ve seen that change. It’s definitely behind the US but it is definitely happening. And I think the same forces and drivers that we’ve seen in the US are very much applicable to Europe and ultimately will be to Asia as well, which I think will go on that kind of same journey. So I think it’s just more of a matter of time or timing as to where we are now versus versus versus the US And there are different country dynamics that everywhere in the world play into why different parts of the industry, you know, move quicker or or slower. But I think the direction’s definitely the same. Barry Ritholtz: Different regulatory regimes, different tax treatment technology. Is the technology really all that different? You would think that adoption maybe some countries on a lag but not 10 years. Stephen Cohen: Yeah, I think it’s just, so I, I think the last 10 years in the US if we are today in somewhere like Europe, in the ETF industry where the US was 10 years ago, I think the next 10 years in Europe will be faster than the last 10 years in the us. Makes sense. Yeah, it’s ’cause I think that partly because there is a, there is a roadmap that the US has created, it’s different ’cause of regulation, all the things that you, that you mentioned, but I think that everything is happening so much faster now and, and you’re seeing that in ETFs, you’re seeing that in other parts of the industry as well. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk a little bit about what you’ve been doing at BlackRock for almost the past 15 years. You begin in 2011, the growth must have been explosive. What was that like watching this rocket ship take off? Stephen Cohen: It’s been fantastic. It’s been an amazing experience. You know, the firm has grown so quickly in the last 10, 15 years and not just grown in terms of assets, which is obviously one way to measure growth, but also just the breadth of what BlackRock does for our clients and the breadth of the number of clients that we talk to. What’s, I think, so for, for someone like me, what what’s so been so great is the ability to be involved in lots of different parts of the firm. And, you know, whether that was, again, growing the European iShares business, whether that was running fixed income iShares, which was a fantastic opportunity and time in, or moment in time I should say, in terms of really not just growing fixed income ETFs, but changing the bond market and the impact we’ve had there to now where, again, the breadth of the company with private markets and things like that. So it has been a, a great journey to be on personally, but also to see it from the inside. Barry Ritholtz: Can you explain what a chief product officer does at a large asset manager? It’s sort of an unusual title in the world of investing. Stephen Cohen: Yeah, so there are a number of things that, that I look at and my, my team look at. One is how do we continue to make sure that our product range is at the forefront of innovation in terms of where the industry is going. How do we make sure that what our clients are looking for with delivering in whatever format they’re looking at. And I think one of the biggest shifts that we’ve seen in the industry, we talked before about kind of how you blend active indexing kind of together, how that’s become more commonplace and kind of more, more accepted. I think the other thing that is happening is that the way all of our clients are, you know, consuming investments or accessing markets is also shifting. So this concept that, you know, pretty much for the whole time that we were growing the iShares business, when we talked about growing ETFs, we were really talking about, we, we were also talking about growing indexing. 00:21:29 That was very synonymous, right? When you talk about growing ETFs, now you’re not just talking about growing indexing, you’re talking about lots of different things, active ETFs, digital assets. And so I think this concept of how we ensure that as we look across all of the investment capabilities we have as a firm that we want to bring to our clients, that we’re delivering them in a way that works for our clients, that requires us to think a little bit differently to, to the way we’ve had to in the past and the way I think the way the industry has. And so that’s why we’ve brought all this together in, into my role and my, my group. And that includes driving the iShares business and, and the growth of ETFs, making ETFs more central to, to what we do in the firm, but also looking across all of our liquid active business, our private markets businesses with our investment teams and those business leads to, to ensure that our product range, you know, works for our clients. And then helping them, helping our clients actually get the best out of what we have. I started an investment strategy. We spent a lot of time talking to clients about what’s going on in markets, how to build better portfolios, how to get the best out of the tools that they have that we need to build. And then what’s next? What’s, what’s the next trend or theme that’s that’s on people’s minds. 00:22:47 [Speaker Changed] So, so I’m hearing two approaches. One is a top down, Hey, what’s going on in the world? What’s out there that’s interesting that perhaps we’re not addressing and a bottoms up. What are clients asking for? What do they think they want? What do we think they need? What, what’s the key driver of, of new offerings? We could talk a little bit about ibit, which is a unicorn. The, the Bitcoin ETF approaching a hundred billion dollars in assets. I think it could be the fastest ETF to a hundred billion dollars. I don’t even know what’s, what’s close maybe GLD, but that, that was a long time ago. How, how do you think about coming up with new products? How much of it is driven by client demand? And how much of it is driven by just looking from the top down and saying, here’s a hole that we really should fill. 00:23:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s a, it’s a real mixture. It is, you know, we’ll have a, a lot of ideas, we’ll have a lot of ideas that are driven by investment views we have as a firm by our investment teams by working with other people in the industry. And we will combine that with what we’re hearing from clients and where clients are, you know, we we’re engaging with clients all the time around, you know, their portfolios and seeing where are there kind of gaps in a portfolio or where are there, sometimes it’s, sometimes there are investment opportunities, but there isn’t a way to get to it. Again, come back to what ETFs have done. Like how do you give that access to, to something that was new. If you think about Ibit, you know, Bitcoin obviously had grown already to a pretty sizable kind of industry. 00:24:37 [Speaker Changed] I think when Ibit launched, Bitcoin was a little over a trillion dollars, something like that. Roughly 00:24:42 [Speaker Changed] That, yeah. Yeah. And, and so there was a sizable kinda industry already out there, but for many clients or many potential investors, the ease, the comfort, the knowledge understanding of of an ETF wrapper was a great way of allowing them to buy into crypto Bitcoin in this case and make it again, potentially a bigger part of the portfolio. What’s interesting is the number of, you know, in, in that explosive growth that Ibit has had, the number of buyers, investors of Ibit who were already holders of Bitcoin in, you know, other forms was quite notable. And so I think it kind of tests to this idea of actually how do you access different markets sometimes in quite traditional ways and how do you bridge between this kind of traditional world and this decentralized world? And you’re seeing the same thing with ether as well with our ether fund. 00:25:42 [Speaker Changed] So, you know, the, the classic Bitcoin issue is, wait, I have to make sure that this drive doesn’t get damaged. I have to keep in the safe. What’s my password? Hey, this is a lot of money and it’s a bigger pain in the neck to keep track of then the rest of my assets. I can own this in an ETF. Why do I ever wanna own Bitcoin directly? Seems to be what a lot of people are saying. And 00:26:06 [Speaker Changed] That, and that’s what we heard over and over again. Both again from people who had held or hold Bitcoin in digital wallets and felt that this was a kind of a, an easier, better way to hold it. 00:26:19 [Speaker Changed] Especially when you read the numbers. 25% of all coins ever mined. It might even be 30% have been lost. Either the drives were damaged or the passwords were lost, which is, 00:26:29 [Speaker Changed] There’s some great stories out there. Crazy 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] Guy who went out and bought a landfill ’cause he’s, 00:26:33 [Speaker Changed] Because he was trying to find the 00:26:35 [Speaker Changed] Of $200 million worth of Bitcoin on the drive that was accidentally Yeah. Thrown away. I mean, 00:26:40 [Speaker Changed] So, you know, putting in an I share probably would’ve been a, an at least an easier way of of right of owning a landfill. It, 00:26:49 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s kind of amazing, but it raises a question that I’ve been thinking about for a while. Alternatives and privates, whether it’s private equity, private debt, private infrastructure and real assets are probably the fastest growing segment of the market. Are we ever gonna see something like that in an ETF wrapper, an illiquid alt in an ETF, 00:27:17 [Speaker Changed] Possibly? Look, it’s definitely something that a lot of people are looking at, including ourselves. But there are a lot of ways to, I think the biggest story I think people jump towards the kind of private markets and ETFs and the real story is how do you open up access appropriately for more people to access private markets as part of the portfolio. So if we think about a world which we believe in which you are kinda moving from, call it 60 40, you know, the traditional right portfolio to more of a 50, 30, 20 where 20 is private markets and that’s applicable to somebody who owns a defined benefit scheme. In fact, they’ve got that already probably more through the, the way the scheme’s managed. But actually if you then apply that to say to other pension types, like a defined contribution scheme or a wealth investor, that kind of journey towards incorporating more private markets into a portfolio for all of the diversification reasons that, you know, we’ve talked about a lot that how that happens is, is the real work and that may end up requiring an ETF, but I think there are lots of other ways that, you know, that can open up the door to private markets being a bigger part. 00:28:26 Either either a completely new part or, or a bigger part of a portfolio for, you know, an individual retiree or an individual investor. Again, it comes back to what we were saying earlier on about rather than thinking about different product types, an ETF or a mutual fund being associated with one type of strategy, it’s actually saying what are the strategies that we believe would help a client, an investor have a better portfolio for whatever their goals are? And then how do you best put that together? 00:28:58 [Speaker Changed] So it’s less and what unique, less about the product? More about the solution to the, to 00:29:02 [Speaker Changed] Me it’s about the portfolio. Yeah. What, what’s the solution exactly, what are you trying to achieve and what, you know, and if it’s a, you know, long term retirement or retirement income, whatever, whatever it is. And then what does the portfolio need to look like or should look like and how does it evolve over time? And then how do you do it right? And what are the kind of mixture of tools that are most, most appropriate to, to get you there. So that’s the shift in thinking that I think 00:29:24 [Speaker Changed] People, so let’s dive into that a little bit. You know, the advantage of stocks, bonds, convertibles. Hmm. They all come with a CUSIP number. It’s pretty standard in terms of the custodianship, where, where it’s held, what sort of public information is a about available, the due diligence you can do about it, how to get liquid. When you want to get liquid, all those stocks, bonds, and, and put convertibles as sort of a hybrid. Everybody knows how to operate around that. It seems like when we look at privates, they’re all one-offs. The custodian ships are all a single thing. Doing the due diligence is time consuming and expensive. They’re, the hope is they’re, they’re not correlated and you’re giving up liquidity in exchange for the illiquidity premium. Can that ever be standardized enough that as a wealth manager, I could say, Hey Steven, I wanna move 10, 20% of these clients’ assets to a diversified set of equity debt Yeah. And real assets and I want some liquidity. Like is this a pipe dream? Oh, and I don’t want any K ones ’cause they’re a disaster to deal with. Like, if that were something that was turnkey and available, I would think that every wealth manager in America would rush in that direction. How long might it be before privates look something like public markets, or at least the pain points are, are reduced to Yeah. Something tolerable. 00:31:04 [Speaker Changed] I think we’re on a, we’re on a journey and I think that that is about, first of all, developing investment strategies and therefore, and being able to put them in products that work for a wealth manager. Secondly, there’s a big, you know, the operational lift, right? The, the technology development that is happening. And we’re working, we’re working with a number of firms around how can we make sure that, for example, model portfolios can incorporate private markets in a more efficient, kind of easier to use way. It’s gonna be different to public markets, it should be different to public markets because I think the role of a, of a infrastructure, for example, in a, in a, in a portfolio is different to the role of owning stocks or owning bonds. And I think that part of, you know, part of the way we’ve always thought about the role of stocks and bonds as being different as well, you know, bonds as a ballast to a portfolio, stocks as a growth driver for example. I think you’ve gotta 00:31:58 [Speaker Changed] Think about that. I’m enough when bonds actually generated attractive yields. 00:32:03 [Speaker Changed] Maybe that’ll come back, you know, we might need a bit of inflation, but yeah, one day, one day, Barry, will we be back on the podcast too? Absolutely. To cover that off. But I, I think that different role is very important, but there’s a lot of development to that is happening to be able to make that more efficient than it has been historically. And I think that’s, I think we will see a lot of change in the next couple of years. 00:32:27 [Speaker Changed] You, you mentioned technology, let, let’s dive a little deeper into that. BlackRock acquired pre Quinn and acquired E Front and I’m read about some integration into your Aladdin platform. How significant are those tools when it comes to offering private market investments to the public? 00:32:49 [Speaker Changed] Incredibly important. I think that, you know, for anybody who is for a wealth manager who is running a portfolio for a, for a client, the, it’s not just as, you know, it’s not just about buying the different products or doing the asset allocation, it’s also about the risk management of, of what does that portfolio look like? And that’s really what Aladdin is about. And as more and more investors, whether that is a retail investor or wealth wealth investor, or whether that’s a big pension fund, incorporate private markets into portfolios and blend private and public. And, and I think again, if you go back over that 10 15 year journey, we started with indexing on one side of the floor and you know, active on the other side. And we gradually brought those together and that became commonplace to blend. And I think we’re now in that world of starting to blend public markets and private markets, which historically were completely distinct and we’re starting to kinda blend, blend those because, because the industries are crossing over more companies are staying private for longer, et cetera, et cetera. 00:33:52 So as we bring those together, the need to be able to, you know, risk manage and understand those portfolios in different scenarios is incredibly important. That’s what Aladdin is about. With Preco, what is so exciting is that I think over time the private markets will become more transparent. There will be more data available and around and very similar to what, what Aladdin and BlackRock did with public markets will happen in the private markets as well. And that I think will help more and more investors access private markets in the way and understand what it is that, that they have partly of which is again, understanding the different liquidity and, and being comfortable that they’re different for a reason. And you’re not trying to create a one size fit fits all. You’re trying to create a portfolio that delivers the right, the right outcomes. Aladin I think is gonna be critical for that. So 00:34:45 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk a little bit about product development. Just in the ETF space this year, over a thousand new ETFs have come out, or at least we’re on pace to do that by the end of this year. This sort of hyper development of ETFs, it, everything we’ve talked about seems to be very thoughtful and very measured with a, a really specific approach. Kind of feels like the rest of the industry is just throwing stuff up against the wall to see what sticks, how, how do you look at this? 00:35:18 [Speaker Changed] We can only focus on what we do, so, 00:35:20 [Speaker Changed] But you have to be aware of what you see, but you 00:35:22 [Speaker Changed] Are aware of what’s going on a hundred percent, 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Three x inverse bitcoin. Like what, why, why do I want that? Or why does anyone want that? 00:35:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, you’ll have to ask them. 00:35:33 [Speaker Changed] I mean I guess it’s, they want to give people an opportunity to make any type of trade and every type of trade. I’m assuming that’s not your approach. 00:35:43 [Speaker Changed] I think there is a lot out there of throwing things out that sticks. Our approach is very much where do we believe that we can develop products, strategies, exposures that are gonna help create better portfolios, right? And if you look at the evolution of the ETF industry and what’s happened is it started, you know, go back 30, 30 plus 20 years ago. It started very much with how do you give access to kind of broad indices and then it was how do you inequities then how do you give access to more granular exposure like sectors or different countries? Then it was how do you move into different asset classes, like fixed income for example. And then more recently it’s been something like digital assets with, with ibit and that’s really been the journey of iisha s right? And I think that’s been therefore the journey of the industry as we’ve, as we’ve led it that I remains very much our view how we think about continuing to expand the iShares platform. 00:36:42 And that includes now using the ETF technology we’ve built to take things like active funds and wrap them into an ETF because the ETF is a more efficient way for many investors to actually own those different strategies. But again, it ha it starts with the strategy and I think that, you know, for us it’s about how do you, what, what is it that you are developing in terms of an exposure or strategy? Why, how does it fit with the world that we see today in terms of where we think the world is going from a market standpoint and a macro standpoint, how does it fit in terms of kind of a portfolio construction standpoint? You’re gonna have waves of innovation. Right now we’re having huge wave of, of of ETF launches and in particular the last two, three years, you know, the ETF is, it’s, it’s gone from being kind of very much on the side of the industry to being very central. We’re excited about that. You know, that’s what we were, that’s what we’ve built at BlackRock and iShares. But it’s also meant that ETFs are very much kinda being used more broadly and you know, that’s gonna be I think part of how the industry evolves. And then you kinda matures, 00:37:45 [Speaker Changed] Especially on the active side where you get all the benefits of mutual ownership without the capital gains penalty that you get in mutual funds. So it makes sense that a lot of active ETFs would develop where they might’ve been active mutual funds. Yeah. What else do you see as changing or in the midst of, of transforming is, is it by asset class? Is it by, you mentioned geography or sector, what is really in flux these days? 00:38:19 [Speaker Changed] So I think that, you know, when you look at, I’ll give you a couple of good examples. So digital assets I think is kind of fairly early days. Ibit is incredibly fast growing. It was the fastest to 20 to 30 to 40 to 50, and now hopefully to a hundred billion as an ETF. And we, you know, we have an Ethereum ETF there. I think there will be more product development in something like that. And again, for us that’s about bridging this kind of defi world with the traditional kind of finance world. That’s one area. The second area is take something like fixed income. You know, we’ve been building out fixed income ETF industry for 20 years. The industry is now two and a half-ish trillion dollars. We think it’s gonna be 6 trillion by kind of 2030. The growth is huge. Less than 2% of bonds in the world are in an ETF. Wow. So it feels, and having been, I can tell you having been on the journey and, and and been out there, you know, kind of pounding the streets on the, the value of fixed income ETFs over the years, it feels like this has become really, really big. And it has, and yet when you think it in the context of the $140 trillion of fixed income out there, you know, ETFs are still a pretty tiny part of the, the market in terms of how people own bonds. 00:39:39 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s relatively large compared to what it was, but in absolute terms. But 00:39:43 [Speaker Changed] In absolute terms, they still, you know, we’re still to use in and out the, the, the sports terminology of given it’s the World series, you know, the first inning, maybe the second inning. And then even if you look at e what’s really fascinating is you, if you look at, and we talked about active active ETFs, and again, that’s still very early stages, 00:40:01 [Speaker Changed] But on fixed, fixed income, they actually seem to do very like the broad, the Bloomberg Ag includes everything good, bad, and different. It seems like it’s relatively easy to capture a little bit of fixed income alpha with a handful of screens. You’re taking out the, the lowest credit quality or you’re taking out the riskiest credit that you’re not getting compensated for. Why does fixed income active seem like it’s a better bet or a higher probability bet than active equity? 00:40:37 [Speaker Changed] I think the historically fixed income, I’ll go back to when I started, was very much a, a world of limited transparency and, and kind of understanding, frankly, I think the understanding for most investors of fixed income relative to, I don’t mean, I don’t mean investors who are doing fixed income all, all every day, but for, for most retail investors in particular, I think people have a much more natural affinity to stocks than they do for bonds in terms of kind of the understanding. Bonds feel complicated at times. It feels like an in, it’s a world we don’t quite understand. Whereas equities, you kind of, you, you know, you know, Google or what, what or whatever it is. And so I think there’s always been a a, a sense of kind of outsourcing those decisions kind of more. So. The other thing is that the, the indices, the indexing market in fixed income has been slower to evolve. So you mentioned the ag and people tend to, when they think about fixed income indexing, they automatically go to the ag. Sure, the ag is one index and it’s a very specific index in terms of what it is. It doesn’t have a huge amount of credit in it, for example. But there are 00:41:43 Other indices with Bloomberg for which we have products like Universal that actually are much more representative of fixed income. So part of it also is, is, you know, what are you benchmarking yourself against? And I think we went through that experience with equities and we are going to go through that, or we are going through that experience with, with fixed income. And the other thing we’re seeing with fixed income is that we’re developing and building the more granular strategies in fixed income. So we’re carving up the market in fixed income the way we did in equities through ETFs. So if you want to own zero to three year government bonds own escar, if you want to own long-term treasuries own TLT, if you want to own bits of the cr, different types of credit crossover, you can now do that through ETFs. So, you know, it is an amazing tool. 00:42:29 And what’s fascinating about fixed income ETFs is that some of the fastest growing users are asset managers. So fixed income managers using ETFs as a way to be better at their job. And I think, again, that’s that blending of, of, of indexing. But even in the equity world, you know, equity indices are evolving. We, we were saying if you look back to 2000, you know, the top seven, you know, the whole kinda s and p was worth the equivalent to what the top seven stocks were worth, you know, six months ago. And so you mentioned earlier in the program equal weight s and p we’re seeing a lot of demand right now for things like equal weight or cap indices. We launched a top 20 fund. Top t we did the same thing with nasdaq. You know, even the s and p 500, owning the top 20 stocks versus owning the 500 stocks is a very, very, very different game. And so even something like large cap US equities, you, which you would’ve thought there was nothing else to innovate in, even that has been the area where we’ve probably done more in the last six months than than many other areas because the dynamics of of the US equity market have shifted so much in the last couple of years and, and investors are looking for different things 00:43:43 [Speaker Changed] Coming up. We continue our conversation with Steve Cohen, BlackRock’s Chief Product Officer and head of Global Product Solutions, discussing what goes into product development in finance. I’m Barry Ritholtz, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Steve Cohen. He’s BlackRock’s Chief Product Officer and head of Global Product Solutions. He also sits on BlackRock’s global executive committee. Since, since we’ve been talking about technology and you mentioned the top seven I I I’m legally obligated to ask a question about artificial intelligence and ai. What is AI doing to your business of developing new products? How we thinking about either AI as an asset class or actually deploying AI to help build new products? 00:44:55 [Speaker Changed] I think we’re seeing AI in probably three areas. I, the, the first one is obviously AI as an investment theme, which is very well kind of publicized, et cetera. And we’re seeing that through things like data centers, obviously stocks, credit, et cetera. The second one is AI in terms of investment strategy. For example, BlackRock, we’re very fortunate to have a systematic group investment group that is, has a 40 year track record in history of delivering really great performance. And you know, they would argue they were doing AI well before it was called ai when it was called machine learning or whatever it was called before 00:45:38 [Speaker Changed] That. It’s been around, most people think it’s new thing, you know, it’s been around a while. Watson played Jeopardy and I forgot the one, was it Deep Blue played chess 00:45:47 [Speaker Changed] And go, 00:45:48 [Speaker Changed] Those were 30 years ago. 00:45:50 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So, you know, it’s gone through its iterations and, and so, you know, and they’ve got some fantastic examples of the way they’ve used machine learning stroke now AI, to really understand, you know, every single day they will pass thousands of reports, earnings calls, et cetera, transcripts for for Right, for sentiment. And it, and, and you know, and the result, the investment results of those, of those signals that they create are, are really quite, quite fascinating and, and very lucrative in terms of investment alpha. And so we’re really seeing a huge demand right now for systematic investing. And this is something that historically people were nervous about because it was a black box, they didn’t understand it. And now people are using things like chat, GPT, et cetera, which is a black box, but they’re seeing the value they’re getting. And so what’s interesting is there’s a psychological shift and a greater acceptance of saying actually systematic investing using ai. 00:46:53 That’s really interesting and exciting and we’re so, so I think the second thing is we’re seeing it through using AI to be better investors. And then the third one is product development. And so how can we use the data that we are able to collect and effectively deploy big data and the AI that that we’ve developed in-house that sits on that to identify what are some of those themes that are coming up? What are some of the things that clients are talking about or being picked up in the, in the news or, or, or whatever it is. And be more kind of systematic, I would say, in being able to see what those those are. And also we are able to use it to test and stress test strategies that are new in different market environments. So it’s a really, again, it’s a really exciting time for, for product development because it’s giving us new tools that we didn’t have before. 00:47:45 [Speaker Changed] So, so BlackRock tends to come out with these very well thought out very rational products. And the question that, that I’ve been thinking about when I first started doing my homework for this is, what are some of the crazy ideas that you looked at and said, yeah, no, that’s just a bridge too far. Like what hasn’t come out? ’cause it was just too, either not solving a problem or, or just too wild and and reckless. Oh 00:48:13 [Speaker Changed] There’s a whole treasure trove of Oh really? Yeah, we could do another podcast, I’m sure. But you know, typically what’s interesting about it is there are two reasons why you might end up like that. One is it’s, it’s a crazy idea, but there’s just really no demand for it. Okay. And, and it for for well 00:48:32 [Speaker Changed] That’s an easy business 00:48:33 [Speaker Changed] Decision, which is an easy business decision, right? The second time. Often it’s, you’re just too early and, you know, I mean there 00:48:39 [Speaker Changed] Could have been an ETF for E and Bitcoin 10 years ago if the SEC would’ve allowed it. If 00:48:46 [Speaker Changed] They were allowed. Yeah. Yeah. So sometimes it’s the regulatory, you know, it could be, it could be that the industry, the industry in the broad sense of the word regulators or what whatever aren’t quite ready, you are not, you’re not able to actually build the thing that you’ve got an idea for. It could be that the market is not quite ready. Fixed income ETFs is a good example. We looked at things 10 years ago and decided that actually that the, that the fixed income market wasn’t ready. We weren’t quite ready to be able to do that in an ETFA decade on. And by the way, we launched a bunch of those as well, right? Knowing that it would take a long time. We didn’t expect to launch it and it’d be a, it would take off straight away knowing that it would take time for the, for the kinda market to get there. But we were comfortable we could manage that fund. And so often you end up in a situation where you’re kind of waiting for maybe the liquidity of the market to be, to be broad enough that an ETF works. So you know it’s gonna work in the future. It’s just a little bit early now, so it’ll come with different reasons why that may be the case. 00:49:46 [Speaker Changed] So, so that raises the question, what’s next on the product roadmap? So we’ve, we’ve talked about digital and, and crypto, we’ve talked about fixed income. Mm. And we’ve also talked about privates. What are you seeing as the next 10 years? 00:50:01 [Speaker Changed] It’s really across the whole waterfront of what you just said. I mean obviously with, with HPS and GIP with our new partners, there’s a lot of opportunity we believe to develop in the private credit and the infrastructure space and also the crossover of, of those kind of areas. I think this, this crossover of public and private markets and what does that look like in, in portfolios, whether that’s within a fund or in a, in a portfolio. I, I think is gonna be a big and very interesting theme. And, and the third area I think is we, you know, we constantly, obviously we’re, we we’re always working with our, our active portfolio managers to, to develop better strategies and, and new ideas they have. But we are always, always looking back as well. ’cause I think you can fall into the trap of thinking you’ve done it. 00:50:49 And I mentioned the example of, you know, US large cap equities and indexing and what, why would you ever look at that as an innovation area? Well, ’cause the, these markets keep changing and I think the world we’re, the world we’re in right now and a good example of the last six months, the number of clients around the world, particularly outside the US who are questioning their US dollar exposure is pretty significant. And what does that mean for time? Look at the move in gold. Suddenly that is, you know, the 4,000. Yeah. And so, you know, you see, you have to, I think you have to be willing to question the environment, the macro, the market environment and say actually what does that mean for, for things that we kind of thought we’d done. And I think that creates a lot of opportunity for our, for our clients to, to reinnovate things. 00:51:34 [Speaker Changed] So before I get to my favorite questions, I have one last broad question for you. What do you think investors and clients are not thinking about, talking about overlooking, but perhaps should be aware of? It could be an asset, a geography, a data point of policy. What is below the radar that really should be front and center? 00:52:00 [Speaker Changed] I think there are things that are kind of half on and half off the radar. Like, you know, the impact of what’s happening in demographics and immigration and changes like that and what does that mean for, for inflation, for the different types of income streams that people are going to need is something that’s, it’s kind of talked about but always slightly in the background. I think that’s gonna come more and more to the fore. We, it ties into the fiscal policy kind of, which is very much kind of talked about. I think that’s one thing. I think the second thing is we’re still, we’re still living through a lot of the post COVID impact and you know, we don’t, co COVID is kind of done and we would, it feels like it was many, many years ago, but there are a lot of industries and luxury is a good example, which is still being impacted by what happened then both in terms of the lockdown and then the immediate kind of boom that happened afterwards. There are still a lot of things that are still trying to work their way through the, through the system as it were. And that tends to be something I think people have kind of forgotten. But from an investing standpoint is actually pretty important. 00:53:03 [Speaker Changed] I I completely agree with you. It’s funny, we were just having a conversation the other day about housing and someone asked why are we have such a shortfall of single family homes in the United States? Hmm. Not even talking about affordability of homes. Yeah. Just sheer number. And the answer was that’s a hangover from the financial crisis 15, 16 years ago following that boom and bust a lot of builders shifted over, pivoted over to multifamily houses and apartment buildings. Right. Not single family. So it’s 15 years ago. Yeah. And we’re still still suffering the effects of it. Yeah. It’s, it’s amazing how, how long a tail some of these things happen. It takes a long time. I I don’t have you all day. I know you have a flight to catch tomorrow, so I have to get you out here at a decent hour. Let, let’s run through some of our favorite questions, starting with, tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 00:54:00 [Speaker Changed] So I’ve, I think I’ve been very lucky. I’ve, I’ve in, in each stage of my career, I’ve always had I think somebody who has been, whether a manager or a mentor, but, but really helped me think through and frankly just supported me in my career. I think two particularly jump out. One is the person who actually took me to, to ING Barings and who I first worked with there, who sadly is no longer with us, but was just an incredible friend. And, you know, in quite a pivotal time in my career, really helped me think through what do I want to do next? And, and kind of set me on that next kinda journey. And then the other one, I have to say a shout out to someone who was very early in my career, who I worked with, who I kind of looked up to in terms of their success, who became my wife. So that became a kind of a good man. She continues to mentor me in slightly, you know, different, more direct ways 00:54:58 [Speaker Changed] That, that’s a, that’s a nice couple of mentors. Let, let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading recently? 00:55:06 [Speaker Changed] Big fan of people like Ian McEwen. 00:55:10 [Speaker Changed] I know the name Martin 00:55:11 [Speaker Changed] Martin Amos. They’re just great, great authors. 00:55:15 [Speaker Changed] Gi give us some titles. Mar Martin, Amos and Ian Mc McKeon. 00:55:18 [Speaker Changed] Ian McKeen. Yeah. There’s a great book Ian McKeen called Sweet Tooth, which is all about, it’s got a great twist, which I won’t go into, but it’s no spoilers. It’s about 1950s, 1960s kind of spies in, in, in the uk. And there’s a book by Martin Amos, which is the first, I can’t remember the full title. It’s time something, but it’s written backwards. 00:55:41 [Speaker Changed] I kind of remember my wife reading something like that from Martin a MI don’t remember the title. 00:55:46 [Speaker Changed] It’s fa, it’s fascinating. He, he writes it backwards so everything happens backwards. So the day starts with the character going to bed and it’s the con, it’s written in the, as the consciousness of the the man. And so it’s brilliant. It’s just, 00:56:04 [Speaker Changed] I I, I’ll dig up the, 00:56:05 [Speaker Changed] The title Very cleverly written, huh? Not a good 00:56:08 [Speaker Changed] Story. Actually, not quite inception, 00:56:12 [Speaker Changed] But it’s in that guise of, of trying to think about how time works and Yeah. I won’t spoil it for you. Read it All right. It, but it, it’s the kind of book where even the most simple paragraph, you kind of reread it ’cause you’re trying to get your head around the fact that it’s being written backwards. Huh. 00:56:30 [Speaker Changed] Let, speaking of inception, what, what’s keeping you entertained these days? What are you streaming either watching or listening to? 00:56:37 [Speaker Changed] So, we’ve been on a bit of a marathon recently. We’ve done Yellowstone 18 83, 19 23, and Landman. 00:56:43 [Speaker Changed] That is all on my, in my queue and a heaven star. I saw the first Yellowstone on a plane and I’m like, oh, I gotta drag my wife into this one. 00:56:51 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s good. You need to commit, but it’s well worth it. Very, very, yeah. Very grip. All very different as well. 00:57:00 [Speaker Changed] So you are, you’re a Brit giving me an American Western recommendation. Let let this New Yorker give you an MI five London recommendation. Have you seen the film Black Bag? 00:57:15 [Speaker Changed] I 00:57:15 [Speaker Changed] Have. You have. 00:57:16 [Speaker Changed] I I saw it on a plane. I spent a lot of time on planes. Okay. I actually saw her on a plane. It was very good. 00:57:21 [Speaker Changed] I very clever. All upside surprise. Holy unexpected. 00:57:24 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Very good. I’d never heard of it. 00:57:25 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And then, and 00:57:26 [Speaker Changed] I assume you watch slow horses. 00:57:27 [Speaker Changed] I, that’s where I was about to go is so I, I, I had my wife watching through the second season and she kind of tapped out. I’m trying to bring her in for the most recent season. 00:57:37 [Speaker Changed] You’ve gotta get in. We are very much the, we won’t watch it until it’s all out. 00:57:42 [Speaker Changed] We, we’ve made that mistake not doing that with certain things. It’s, we binge it’s incredibly, we binge like, what, what is this? Watching one show a week? What are we living in the nineties? I can’t, like, 00:57:54 [Speaker Changed] I’m a cave. It’s like when an advert appears. Right, 00:57:56 [Speaker Changed] Right. It really is. Final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in fill up, fill in the blanks, investing ETFs, financial product, developing fixed income? What’s your advice for that person? 00:58:15 [Speaker Changed] Go for it. I, this, I think that, I really think this industry is changing so quickly. I think it’s changing faster than I’ve, in my kind of career in terms of what is happening, which I think creates a lot of opportunity for somebody starting out. My advice I always give to all of our analysts who are starting out, and frankly I give it to pretty much all of our team, is you’ve gotta keep learning. Th this is constantly changing. And, and you’ve got to just, you’ve always gotta be on that kind of learning curve. And, and that’s how you get better. It’s also where the opportunities come from a career standpoint. 00:58:52 [Speaker Changed] Make makes a lot of sense. Our final question, what do you know about the world of investing product development ETFs today would’ve been helpful back in the 1990s when you were first getting started? 00:59:05 [Speaker Changed] Well, if I’d known that Bitcoin was gonna be 120,000, I probably would’ve done Well that’s done something differently. 00:59:09 [Speaker Changed] Well, you could say that, you know, back 00:59:11 [Speaker Changed] The truck, say 00:59:11 [Speaker Changed] About everything. Right. Back up the truck on Amazon in 2002. Or Apple. Apple in 98 Completely. Or Microsoft from the IPO. 00:59:18 [Speaker Changed] No, I think one thing it does lend itself to, and it sounds a bit strange for somebody who started out, you know, on a bond trading floor doing bond maths, is, you realize over time, only when you look back the power of compounding. I know everyone writes about compounding and you learn about it, obviously, but it’s only when you have been around for a while and you look back at what compounding actually means as a, both a an investor, you know, you know, managing your own kind of future retirement and wealth. And then, or as a, or as somebody who works with, with clients about managing portfolios, what compounding actually does imply, and I was thinking about that the other day actually. 01:00:00 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s very counterintuitive. Hmm. There’s nothing in the natural world in your ordinary experience as a mammal that would give you any insight into just exactly how exponential it is. Yes. Yeah. It’s really fascinating.

Title: America’s $38 trillion national debt ‘exacerbates generational imbalances’ with Gen Z and Millennials paying the price, warns think tank
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/16/us-national-debt-generationa-imbalances-research-think-tank/
Time Published: 2025-12-16T11:32:02Z
Full Content:
The United States’ current borrowing trajectory will place an “undue burden on future generations,” an economic think tank has warned, with younger generations facing a higher interest rate environment, slower economic growth, and stalling wage increases.The latest research from the American Action Forum chimes with concerns across both the public and private sectors. JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell are among those nervously eyeing the nation’s $38 trillion debt burden. The government has paid $10 billion a week to service the debt for the first few months of the 2026 fiscal year.Economists are concerned that at some point, the growth of the American economy will become so disconnected from the borrowing of its government that bond buyers will demand higher premiums on their loans. The worry is that the central bank will intervene by increasing the money supply—kick-starting an inflationary cycle—but that ultimately the government may have to cut back on spending. Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio has described this scenario as an economic “heart attack,” with government investment squeezed out by the need for the country to maintain its debt obligations. Younger people will face the sharpest end of that outcome, warned Jordan Haring, director of fiscal policy at the American Action Forum. Haring, formerly a senior policy analyst at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), wrote in a note this week: “The United States’ high debt load exacerbates generational imbalances. These imbalances will ultimately burden younger and future generations with higher interest payments, slower economic growth, slower income growth, and a greater burden to bear for future tax or spending changes.” She continued: “Without significant policy changes to reduce debt growth, future generations will inherit a budget where significant resources are locked into servicing past borrowing. “As interest costs rise, the federal government will have less money available for education, infrastructure, or scientific research—areas that directly support long-term prosperity. Future taxpayers will face higher tax burdens or reduced government services simply to cover the costs created by previous budget deficits.” Haring pointed to the discrepancies in budgets between education and health services, for example. Already the gap is large: In 2025, the Department of Education requested $82.4 billion for its budget, while in 2024 Medicaid spending totaled more than $900 billion, per the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission. With an aging population, it is likely that spending on social care will increase over the coming decades. Lower birth rates will mean fewer entrants into the ranks of the economically active to maintain the revenues gathered by the government. While the accuracy of the conservative think tank’s research has been criticized in the past, Haring’s stance has been echoed by the likes of BlackRock’s Larry Fink. Last year, Fink urged corporate leaders and politicians to pursue “an organized, high-level effort” to rethink the retirement system. In a letter to BlackRock investors, Fink wrote: “The federal government has prioritized maintaining entitlement benefits for people my age (I’m 71) even though it might mean that Social Security will struggle to meet its full obligations when younger workers retire.” He added: “It’s no wonder younger generations, millennials and Gen Z, are so economically anxious. They believe my generation—the baby boomers—have focused on their own financial well-being to the detriment of who comes next. And in the case of retirement, they’re right.” With a shift in economic activity from one generation to the next comes new flows of wealth, and this is something governments around the world will be looking to leverage, according to experts. Studies have found that over the next 20 to 30 years as much as $124 trillion will be passed down from older generations to their younger counterparts, though UBS puts the figure of the so-called Great Wealth Transfer at $80 trillion. Baby boomers—people born between 1946 and 1964—are the wealthiest generation in history, and as these individuals begin passing on their assets, sums will go immediately to their Gen X, millennial, and Gen Z successors, and some cash will go to spouses. “The change in wealth comes at a time when many governments around the world have high debt and deficits. It seems unrealistic to suppose that governments will just sit idly by as this wealth moves around. We would expect governments to attempt to mobilize that wealth to help fund their debt, but in doing so that denies private sector investment access to some of those funds.”

Title: November 2025: The new priorities of European tech investing
URL: https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/comment/november-2025-new-priorities-european-tech-investing/
Time Published: 2025-12-16T11:16:36Z

European technology investing can no longer be relegated to the continent’s economic sideline. New movement in the sector and regular activity over the past few years have made it one of the primary infrastructures on which other industries and services are built. Every month, I publish a brief look at how this European tech sector is evolving, not just to summarise, but to better understand what the market is building towards.In this edition, the evidence further shows that tracing capital concentration is shaping Europe’s next phase of tech development. November was a particularly useful snapshot of activity, marking a shift from chasing the “next big theme” to backing essential parts of the sector’s infrastructure and disciplined scaling. Capital flows towards technologies that grow when risk is managed, production is planned, and execution outweighs narrative. One of the core signals of growth in the European tech industry in 2025 has been the rise in strategic investing, spanning defence, dual-use systems, and energy hardware. Capital is flowing towards tech that builds sovereignty as much as long-term resilience – as first signalled in my Summer 2025 analysis. By this fall, a pattern emerged not as a spike, but as a clear sign of market stability. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more What shifted in November was the focus from the tech itself to the capacity to produce it. Investors financed strategic solutions as well as their supply chains, fabrication, and manufacturing. The evidence of this investment shift is unmistakable in examples like Quantum Systems in Germany raising €180M to push dual-use aerial systems at an industrial scale, or Lithuania’s development bank backing MNP Technologijos/Monopulse to expand manufacturing of NATO-grade drone components. Over in Dresden, Ferroelectric Memory Company raised €100M (mixing €77M in private capital with IPCEI/EIC support) to further expand semiconductor fabrication for efficient AI computing, and France added depth with Hummink, bringing the total to €15M in microfabrication processes. Even Holosolis committed to a PV gigafactory at €220M or more. All these signs underscore that sovereignty has shifted from a theme to a production agenda. The space industry is growing faster globally. In Europe, what had looked in September and October like a series of strong individual rounds began to consolidate in November, marking a shift towards an industry with its own financial architecture, supporting repeatable deals. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The first of these signals was the emergence of institutional capital, when the European Investment Bank offered Space TechEU a €500M programme of dedicated funding rather than a one-off initiative. The second was the shift from isolated rounds to production-focused scaling across Europe. For example, Toulouse U-Space raised €24M for an industrial target of one satellite per week. In Germany, Reflex Aerospace closed a €50M Series A (the largest in European New Space) tied to sovereign space-based intelligence needs. Both rounds were based on manufacturing and production, not focused solely on R&D. Then the market matured to the orbital services layer of space. In France, Infinite Orbits secured €40M to scale in-orbit inspection and life-extension services (mixing private capital and EIC funding). That maturity is crucial, as it means financing focuses on infrastructure rather than just project creation. AI is everywhere, especially in 2025, but primarily as software systems with horizontal capabilities in workflows, data tools, and automation. What changed in November was the shift from software-only AI towards embodied systems and robotics. A scalable set of robotics deals across Europe appears less as isolated bets and more as shaping the physical AI stack in early stages. The first layer is the intelligence stack that trains, coordinates, and controls AI robotics. In Zurich, Flexion Robotics raised nearly €50M for a “brain stack” powering humanoid robotics. In London, Neuracore raised €2.5M in pre-seed funding to build a unified robot-centric infrastructure. Another layer came in deployment across industries. This was evident in Switzerland’s Gravis Robotics, which raised €19.9M to bring construction robots into operation through its “Excavator-as-a-Service” model. The Netherlands saw Saia Agrobotics raise €10M to steadily scale robotic greenhouse automation over clear productivity metrics. Taken together, these deals signal that robotics are getting out of the lab and into revenue-generating settings. Dexterity in robotics came next, as Zurich-based mimic raised €13.8M in Seed to focus on manipulation for complex physical tasks, and Forgis raised €3.8M pre-seed to develop industrial automation modules that extend AI into machinery. Beneath all of this, a components layer formed with Italy’s adaptronics raising €3.15M to scale electro-adhesive grippers, hardware crucial to the rest of the stack. When exploring the entire sector, these deals tell a story: robotics is shifting from prototyping and new product development to layered, investable solutions with AI-backed systems. While AI is making waves in robotics, it is also crucial in embedded workflows, analytics, and automation through industries like banking and healthcare. That activity leading up to November has led to the growth of a parallel market for controlling, securing, and governing AI integrations. Such investment is no longer a one-off, but an essential budget line, driven by rising demands in compliance, fraud prevention, identity and security. In the governance layer, London’s AI Score raised just under $1M to centralise oversight of AI use, ensuring visibility, auditability, and policy in one place. Vigilant AI.ai in the UK added “AI teammates” designed for regulated environments, supporting operational and governance needs. Fraud prevention is just as crucial, especially as AI makes it easier for scammers, fraudsters, and hackers to operate. The UK’s Falkin raised €1.7M in pre-seed funding to focus on blocking fraud before payments are made. Romania’s TMT ID secured €34M for identity intelligence and cybercrime prevention, one of the biggest European checks this month in anything related to trust or security. November also marked brand and misinformation defence, with the Netherlands’ Social Links raising €2.6M for tools that help companies defend against identity abuse, scam campaigns, and AI-driven misinformation (a category that barely existed only two years ago). Beneath all these layers is an emphasis on security, with Norway’s Bsure raising €1.8M to target identity, access, and licence risk across Microsoft environments. The pattern is clear: AI drives innovation, but also requires new mandatory spending on oversight, compliance, and trust. November marks the emergence of early architecture for the “AI risk stack,” sure to scale in parallel with AI across other applications. Earlier in 2025, debt slowly entered venture rounds as an add-on, then as blended structures. In November, that shift grew, with companies scaling through financial structures rather than solely through equity rounds. That took the form in multiple ways. Instead of raising larger Series A or B rounds, several companies focused on opening credit lines aligned with their business models. A clear example came from the UK’s BKN301 Group, which paired its €32M Series B with an institutional facility backed by BlackRock-managed funds. Zilch followed a similar pattern: its latest financing blended debt and equity with a securitisation expansion arranged alongside Deutsche Bank, using credit capacity as the engine for commercial scaling. Together, these cases show how credit capability, rather than dilution, increasingly fuels growth. November saw securitisation solidify its role as a meaningful scaling tool, something that used to live in banking and structured credit more than in venture-backed firms. For instance, London’s Zilch raised over €150M across debt and equity while expanding its securitisation programme with Deutsche Bank (using receivables as an asset for growth). This marked financing expansion through structured instruments rather than repeated equity rounds. November also saw companies scale with capital tied to managed assets rather than their latest valuation. In the UK, Keyzy expanded using asset-backed funding to finance property purchases, with more than €147M having already flowed through its model over 18 months. The company continues to grow as more homes move through the platform, without having to reset valuation every time it adds capacity. Hybrid stacks began appearing in early funding stages. In Spain, Devengo raised €2M in pre-Series A funding, combining equity and debt. While small, this signals that mixed financing structures are no longer limited to later-stage companies. Altogether, November highlighted the need for companies to focus on growth through smarter financing tools, not bigger venture checks. It shows that scaling is increasingly possible without constant dilution, and that venture is gradually absorbing capital-markets logic. Europe’s tech industry and exit market are active, but not in a way that generates broad liquidity. November saw small, focused acquisitions over massive or complex headline deals. Across the region, the pattern was visible in volume: the DACH markets alone saw 69 tech M&A transactions, with smaller, tuck-in deals outweighing larger, valuation-defining exits. POM’s acquisition of FarPay pulled invoicing, payments, and AR automation into a singular workflow. Integral bought CleverLohn in Berlin, folding payroll into its HR suite. Latvia’s TestDevLab was absorbed by Xoriant, adding delivery capacity. What links these deals is that they are not built around liquidity. They are driven by functionality. Buyers are acquiring capabilities they need immediately, while teams are joining larger platforms so their work can be used at scale. As the tech market becomes more industrial and execution-focused, exit activity looks smaller and is based on transactions that boost system strength. November’s patterns point in the same direction. European tech is moving out of the exploratory phase. What is visible now is greater discipline around production, supply chains, real-world deployment, and financing built for scale. That trend is reflected in defence, space, robotics, and AI, shifting towards things that can be manufactured, integrated, or operated. For investors, the market represents progress being measured by what can actually be built. For companies, the environment has shifted to one that rewards readiness — the ability to ship, deliver, and become part of the industrial stack. As Europe moves into the next cycle, this is the emerging shape — not one of narrative, but of a new, clearer sense of what the continent chooses to develop at scale. It outlines the trajectory along which the tech sector will continue to evolve. Oleg Khuaenov is CEO & Founder of Zubr Capital

Backed by the Jio brand, data support from parent companies, and learnings from peers, the non-banking financial company (NBFC) hopes to become a “constructive disruptor”. “For us, in financial services, we hope to be what I call ‘constructively disruptive’,” managing director and chief executive officer Hitesh Sethia said at the Mint BFSI Conclave 2025 on 12 December. “One has to be price competitive because that is true value for the customer. We will have to play on the advantage of cost and scale.” Jio Financial Services is the holding company for several businesses: NBFC Jio Credit Ltd, Jio Payments Bank Ltd, wealth management joint venture Jio BlackRock Investment Advisers Pvt Ltd, and asset management joint venture Jio BlackRock Asset Management Pvt Ltd, among others. Sethia said pricing competitiveness will come not through a price war but via cost engineering at scale, underpinned by technology. “We have the advantage to set everything from a zero base. If we are able to do that with today's modern technology, with the brand and capital that we have, there is a good chance we have in creating value for customers and capturing value for shareholders,” Sethia said. “That is an equation that can be solved.” He highlighted that Jio Financial’s late entry allows it to incorporate lessons from decades of industry data across timing the market, product segments, customer segments, and distribution channels. “Technology can certainly make a lot of products DIY (do-it-yourself). It can also digitize the distribution channel, make that intelligent and far more efficient. That is happening as we see.” The NBFC had assets under management (AUM) worth ₹14,712 crore as of end of September, while the AUM of the AMC business was at ₹15,980 crore across nine funds. The wealth management, broking and insurance businesses are still in the incubation phase. Demerged from Reliance Industries and listed in 2023, Jio Financial underwent a management and business overhaul to grow its loan book across home loans, loans against property, loans against mutual funds, loans against shares, and supply chain finance. Sethia, appointed CEO in November 2023, considers Jio Financial both a startup and a late entrant, but one blessed with two things most startups take years to build: brand and capital. “We were born with two things, which most startups take many years to build,” Sethia said, adding that the goal now is to build a “stable, steady” financial institution which is able to “last decades and weather the cycles that come with lending”. The plan is to start with secured loan products and later look at other loan products that “may be needed”, he said. Partnerships form a cornerstone of Jio Financial’s strategy. The company has 50:50 joint ventures (JVs) with BlackRock for asset management, wealth management, and broking. It has another 50:50 JV with Allianz Insurance for reinsurance, and has signed non-binding agreements with Allianz to enter life and general insurance. The company is also leveraging the Jio ecosystem. “We are present in MyJio, which is a part of the Jio telecom company. The MyJio app has a few hundred million monthly active users. That gives us a funnel for Jio Finance as well. There is clearly a case for collaboration between industries,” he said, citing the example of telecom and e-commerce with financial services. “In an eventual scale, we expect to be a full-scale service firm. We will span across the entire length and breadth of the country,” Sethia said. With Jio Payments Bank’s banking correspondent network, Jio Financial already has over 200,000 touchpoints nationwide and 18 million mobile app users. “The game has to be expanding the market rather than trying to eat up just the existing market share,” said Sethia, who sees opportunity in taking wealth management services to people in the ‘the middle of the pyramid’ as well as offering better services to people at the 'top of the pyramid'. Sethia emphasized simplifying financial services, meeting evolving customer expectations, and moving from a “digital first to intelligent always” approach. “Simply put, financial services has to work like Wi-Fi. When you need it, it is available and when you don't, it's quiet in the background.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: XRP ETFs Log One Month of Inflows as BTC, ETH Funds Bleed $4.6B

Time Published: 2025-12-16T00:53:47Z

Written & Edited byOihyun Kim US-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded one month of consecutive net inflows since their November 13 debut, setting them apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs that experienced billions in outflows over the same period. The milestone marks a turning point for XRP, which was excluded from traditional investment vehicles for years due to regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ripple’s legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, with spot ETFs lifting that barrier, institutional capital is flowing into the asset at a pace that has surprised even bullish observers. According to SoSoValue data, XRP spot ETFs have attracted fresh capital every trading session since launch, lifting cumulative net inflows to approximately $990.9 million as of December 12. Total net assets across the five products climbed to about $1.18 billion, with no single day of net redemptions recorded. The consistency stands out in a market where even the largest crypto ETFs have struggled to maintain steady momentum. Over the same 30-day window, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $3.39 billion in net outflows, including a single-day withdrawal of roughly $903 million on November 20. Ethereum ETFs followed a similar pattern, posting about $1.26 billion in net outflows. The divergence was most pronounced on December 1. On that day, XRP ETFs brought in $89.65 million while Bitcoin ETFs gained just $8.48 million—roughly one-tenth of XRP’s figure. Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, recorded more than $79 million in net outflows. December trading has further highlighted the contrast. Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded four negative flow days compared to eight positive days, while Ethereum ETFs displayed similar volatility with five negative days and seven positive days through December 12. XRP ETFs maintained positive flows throughout. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that XRP has become one of the fastest spot crypto ETFs to reach $1 billion in assets under management in the US, trailing only Ethereum. “There’s pent-up demand for regulated crypto products,” Garlinghouse stated. He highlighted Vanguard’s recent decision to offer access to crypto ETFs through traditional retirement and investment accounts, noting that crypto is now “accessible to millions more people who don’t need to be experts in the technology.” Garlinghouse also emphasized that longevity, stability, and community strength are increasingly essential themes for these new “off-chain crypto investors.” 👀<4 weeks, and XRP is now the fastest crypto Spot ETF to reach $1B in AUM (since ETH) in the US.With over 40 crypto ETFs launched this year in the US alone, a few points are obvious to me:1/ there’s pent up demand for regulated crypto products, and with Vanguard opening up… CME Group announced the launch of Spot-Quoted XRP and SOL futures on December 15, further expanding institutional access to XRP. “We’ve seen strong demand for our current Spot-Quoted Bitcoin and Ether futures, with more than 1.3 million contracts traded since launched in June, and we are pleased to add XRP and SOL to our offering,” said Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products at CME Group. The existing Spot-Quoted Bitcoin and Ether futures have experienced substantial growth, with December average daily volume reaching 35,300 contracts and a record trade day of 60,700 combined contracts on November 24. Market analysts suggest that the uninterrupted inflow pattern indicates that XRP ETFs are being used as structural allocations rather than as tactical trading instruments. “This is just 5 spot ETFs. No BlackRock, no 10-15 ETFs exposure yet, but they are coming,” one analyst noted, projecting that if weekly inflows remain near $200 million, cumulative inflows could surpass $10 billion by 2026. Despite strong ETF inflows, XRP’s price performance has remained subdued. The token has declined nearly 15% over the past month and was trading at $1.89 at press time. The disconnect between inflows and price may reflect the mechanics of ETF markets. ETF creation and redemption involve complex arbitrage processes that delay price effects. Market makers hedging their positions may also blunt some of the immediate impact from inflows.

Title: Warner Bros. is blockbuster finale to $4.5 trillion M&A haul
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/15/mergers-acquisitions-4-5-trillion-warner-bros-second-highest-year-ever/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T23:27:32Z
Full Content:
Dealmakers are heading into the final weeks of 2025 on a $100 billion cliffhanger. Paramount Skydance Corp.’s hostile bid to snatch Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. from under the nose of Netflix Inc. encapsulates the themes that have shaped a banner year for mergers and acquisitions: renewed desire for transformative tie-ups, massive checks from Wall Street, the flow of Middle East money and US President Donald Trump’s role as both disruptor and dealmaker. Global transaction values have risen around 40% to about $4.5 trillion this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show, as companies chase ultra-ambitious combinations, emboldened by friendlier regulators. That’s the second-highest tally on record and includes the biggest haul of deals valued at $30 billion or more. “There’s a sentiment in boardrooms and among CEOs that this is a potential multi-year window where it’s possible to dream big,” said Ben Wallace, co-head of Americas M&A at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “We’re at the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle so there’s anticipation that there will be more liquidity.” Beyond Netflix’s purchase of Warner Bros., this year’s blockbusters include Union Pacific Corp.’s acquisition of rival railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corp. for more than $80 billion including debt, the record leveraged buyout of video game maker Electronic Arts Inc., and Anglo American Plc’s takeover of Teck Resources Ltd. to reshape global mining. “When you look around and you see your peers doing these big deals and taking advantage of the tailwinds, you don’t want to be left out,” said Maggie Flores, partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP in New York. “The regulatory environment is in a position that is very conducive to dealmaking and people are taking advantage of it.” The tally also shows a level of exuberance in certain pockets that some advisers and analysts worry is unsustainable. Global trade tensions are ongoing, and market observers are increasingly warning of a selloff in the white-hot equity markets that have underpinned the M&A resurgence. Top executives at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley have all flagged the risk of a correction in the months ahead, in part tied to concerns about an overheated artificial intelligence ecosystem, where huge amounts of investment have juiced technology stocks. “These equity returns are really coming out of AI, and AI spend is not sustainable,” said Charlie Dupree, global chair of investment banking at JPMorgan. “If that pulls back, then you are going to see a broader market that isn’t really advancing.” The AI buzz led to some the year’s standout transactions. Sam Altman’s OpenAI took in major investments from the likes of SoftBank Group Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Walt Disney Co., and a consortium led by BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners agreed to pay $40 billion for Aligned Data Centers. In March, Google parent Alphabet Inc. framed its $32 billion acquisition of cybersecurity startup Wiz Inc. as a way to provide customers with new safeguards in the AI era. “Everyone needs to be an AI banker now,” said Wally Cheng, head of global technology M&A at Morgan Stanley. “Just as software began eating the world 15 years ago, AI is now eating software. You have to be conversant in AI and understand how it will affect every company.” The technology sector more broadly has already notched a record year for deals, thanks to a series of big-ticket takeovers across public and private markets. The trend extended to the White House over the summer, when the US government took a roughly 10% stake in Intel Corp. in an unconventional move aimed at reinvigorating the company and boosting domestic chip manufacturing. It was one of the clearest indications of Trump’s willingness to blur the lines between state and industry and insert himself into M&A situations during his second term, particularly in sectors deemed mission critical. His administration also acquired a stake in rare-earth producer MP Materials Corp. and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has hinted at similar deals in the defense sector. Trump has separately been positioning himself as kingmaker on high-profile transactions. The government secured a so-called golden share in United States Steel Corp. as a condition for approving its takeover by Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp., and the president recently signaled he’ll oppose any acquisition of Warner Bros. that doesn’t include new ownership of CNN. “The Trump administration’s approach to merger regulation today is markedly different compared to the first time around,” said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. Quinn said he couldn’t think of a member of the Republican Party from 15 to 20 years ago who would now believe the US government “is involved in the business of picking winners.” To be sure, bankers will be wondering if they could have achieved more in 2025 had it not been for the chaotic period earlier in the year, when deals were put on hold after Trump’s trade war hobbled markets. And in a sign that persistent economic challenges are still impacting some parts of M&A, the number of deals being announced globally remains flat. Many small and mid-cap companies have lagged the broader stock market and are opting to pursue their own strategic plans instead of weighing inorganic options, according to Jake Henry, global co-leader of the M&A practice at consultancy McKinsey & Co. “They’re thinking ‘I’m better off just operating my business and getting there.’ It has to be an explosive offer for them to come to the table,” he said. Meanwhile, private equity firms, whose buying and selling is a key barometer for M&A, are still having a harder time offloading certain assets because of valuation gaps with buyers. This has had a knock-on effect on their ability to raise funds and spend on new acquisitions. But bankers are starting to see a recovery here too as interest rates come down and bring more potential acquirers to the table. “What’s motivating sponsors more than anything is their need to return cash to investors,” said Saba Nazar, chair of global financial sponsors at Bank of America Corp. “We have been in bake-off frenzy for the last couple of months.” Dealmakers began the year whispering of M&A records under Trump’s pro-business administration. While they will just miss out on the milestone in 2025, there is a strong sense on Wall Street that those early bumps only delayed the inevitable. Brian Link, co-head of North America M&A at Citigroup Inc., said that after ‘Liberation Day’ in April, he expected to spend more time figuring out the impact of tariffs on different business and how to adjust around that. “That has not been the case,” he said. “Unless fear creeps back into the market, there doesn’t seem to be anything in the near term that’s going to change the dynamic here.”

Title: PME Pensioenfonds Terminates $5.9B BlackRock Mandate

PME Pensioenfonds, a Dutch pension fund with $70 billion in assets, has terminated a $5.9 billion equity mandate with BlackRock due to the manager’s misalignment with the fund’s environmental, social and governance framework, the fund announced on Monday. According to the release, PME began reviewing its relationship with BlackRock as early as January, following the firm’s departure from the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a collective of asset managers who sought to achieve net-zero portfolio emissions by 2050. The initiative paused operations following the departure of BlackRock, which was among the most prominent asset managers to leave. “As part of our strategy to invest for a good pension, we make deliberate choices about the companies included in our equity portfolio,” PME’s announcement stated. “We aim for a portfolio with a limited number of stocks, enabling us to better understand our investments and pursue an improved balance between risk, return, and sustainability. Implementing this strategy also means we carefully select and evaluate our external asset managers.” In 2022, PME began defining its ESG goals, evolving the goals into an ESG framework and later an ESG index portfolio it called the portfolio of tomorrow, in which “every company is selected based on deliberate choices aimed at achieving solid returns and supporting a living world,” PME stated. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  Following PME’s evaluation of BlackRock, the pension fund decided to end its relationship with the $11.5 trillion asset manager. “BlackRock has provided PME with high-quality services for many years in managing part of our equity portfolio,” PME stated. “We value that collaboration and the contribution they have made in managing our investments. However, PME also considers which external managers best align with our vision and the principles of the Portfolio of Tomorrow.” Going forward, PME will only rely on two asset managers to manage its equity investments—UBS Global Asset Management and MN, an investment manager based in The Hague, Netherlands. The move to two managers for the equity portfolio also will lower the pension fund’s costs, according to PME. “BlackRock has been entrusted by clients in the Netherlands and around the world to manage more sustainable and transition assets than any other asset manager. These clients see us as their partner of choice for achieving their investment goals, including their net zero objectives,” a BlackRock spokesperson wrote via email. “We manage more than €350 billion in total for our Dutch clients and are proud of our continued growth in the country. We are grateful for the opportunity to have served PME and its members for more than a decade.” PME is the latest European allocator to terminate a mandate due to ESG misalignment. PFZW, the Dutch pension fund for the care and welfare sector, terminated BlackRock—as well as AQR Capital Management LLC and Legal & General Investment Management—in September. In March, AkademikerPension, the Danish pension for academics, terminated a 3.2-billion-Danish-Krone ($503 million) mandate with State Street due to ESG misalignment, and U.K.-based defined contribution master trust The People’s Pension terminated a 28-billion-pound ($37.42 billion) mandate, also with State Street, due to misalignment with the pension fund’s sustainable investing policy, awarding the business to Invesco and Amundi. The termination of these European mandates showcases the tightrope that asset managers like BlackRock must walk regarding ESG factors—some investors and lawmakers deem BlackRock to be uncommitted to ESG goals, while others have criticized the firm for the opposite reason. In the U.S., the manager has lost mandates, including a fixed-income mandate from the Indiana Public Retirement System, due to its ESG commitment. “PME’s decision reinforces a clear shift in how asset owners are responding to climate risk,” said Alasdair Docherty, a sustainable finance and data analyst at the Norway-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, in a statement. “Large pension funds increasingly see climate change not as a moral issue but as a systemic financial threat to long-term portfolio values, and they expect their managers to act accordingly.” In November, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander called for the city’s $308.3 billion pension system to drop BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora Asset Management for failing to meet the system’s climate expectations from its managers. “Stewardship failures are now being treated as a material mandate risk,” Docherty continued in his statement. “For asset managers, particularly in the U.S., retreating from climate stewardship may once have felt like the path of least resistance, offering short-term relief from political and commercial pressure. Increasingly, that looks less like pragmatism and more like a strategic miscalculation.” Related Stories: Dutch Pension PZFW Terminates BlackRock, AQR, L&G Mandates Amidst Portfolio Reshuffle NYC Comptroller Calls for City Pensions to Drop BlackRock, Fidelity, PanAgora BlackRock AUM Surges Past $13T, Alts Investments Double Tags: BlackRock, PME Pensioenfonds « Trump Issues Executive Order Seeking to Curb Proxy Advisers’ Influence

Title: Anchorage Digital deepens RIA market push by acquiring unit of Securitize

The deal folds adviser-facing tools into Anchorage’s platform while allowing Securitize to remain focused on tokenizing real-world assets. Anchorage Digital, a federally chartered digital asset bank, acquired Securitize’s investment adviser platform as it seeks to expand its reach among institutional investors amid the growing adoption of digital assets. Anchorage announced on Monday that it has completed the acquisition of Securitize For Advisors (SFA), a lesser-known unit of Securitize, a company best known for tokenizing real-world assets. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. SFA is designed for registered investment advisers (RIAs); before the acquisition, it already relied on Anchorage for custody of client assets. By bringing the adviser platform in-house, Anchorage consolidates custody, trading and adviser-facing tools within a single platform, rather than operating across separate systems. Anchorage is an institutional crypto platform that operates a federally chartered digital asset bank in the United States. In March, it was selected by Cantor Fitzgerald as a custody partner for Bitcoin (BTC). For Securitize, the sale enables the company to focus more on its core tokenization business, according to Carlos Domingo, the company’s CEO. Securitize has been accelerating its real-world asset strategy and is moving forward with plans to go public through a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald. In May of last year, it raised $47 million in a funding round led by BlackRock. Securitize is behind BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, known as BUIDL. Related: Anchorage Digital adds HYPE staking support through Figment partnership Nathan McCauley, co-founder and chief executive of Anchorage Digital, said registered investment advisers are “driving one of the most important waves of crypto adoption,” likely referring to growing institutional adoption of digital assets through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) RIA involvement has been building for several years. Momentum began to shift in 2020, when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency allowed federally chartered banks to custody digital assets, giving advisers a compliant pathway to gain exposure. Broader participation followed the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, which lowered operational and regulatory hurdles for advisers and accelerated mainstream access. The funds align with existing RIA infrastructure, including broker-dealers and custodians, making allocation easier for institutional investors. Even after early adoption, RIAs still control access to sizable portions of the market that have yet to enter the digital assets space. “The reason that we’re here today is because of the retail channels adopting crypto ETFs and crypto more broadly,” Federico Brokate, an executive at crypto issuer 21Shares, told Cointelegraph. “The next category is RIAs, and this is where we need to see the majority of ETF flow over the next five years.” Related: SEC staff gives guidance on how securities laws could apply to crypto Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: Anchorage Digital Acquires Securitize Platform in Major Crypto Wealth Management Consolidation

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Anchorage Digital has acquired the Securitize For Advisors platform, strengthening its position in crypto wealth management for registered investment advisors as both firms pursue distinct institutional strategies. The first federally chartered crypto bank in the US, Anchorage Digital, has acquired the Securitize For Advisors (SFA) platform from tokenization specialist Securitize, tightening its grip on the growing market for crypto wealth management tools aimed at registered investment advisors (RIAs). The move comes as Anchorage ramps up its regulated stablecoin and custody business, while Securitize doubles down on large-scale tokenization and public-market plans. The company is taking over SFA, a crypto wealth management platform built for RIAs that has grown deposits and assets under management more than 4,500% over the past 12 months, according to their announcement. The business already had 99% of client assets custodied at Anchorage Digital Bank, making the acquisition a consolidation of an existing relationship rather than a new strategic bet. More details about the terms were not disclosed. A meaningful expansion of Anchorage Digital’s wealth management offering: Anchorage Digital has acquired the Securitize for Advisors business unit from @Securitize, expanding our wealth management capabilities with SFA’s platform, vision, and team. pic.twitter.com/q3cQHMpzir — Anchorage Digital (@Anchorage) December 15, 2025 The SFA acquisition comes in a year when Anchorage has stepped up activity around regulated stablecoins, such as USDtb and USDGO, additional asset support, and infrastructure partnerships. The firm recently moved to expand its custody universe by adding support for 25 additional digital assets for institutional clients, while maintaining a valuation above $3 billion from its last round. On the product side, Anchorage is building out stablecoin operations and institutional DeFi access, including work on Genius Act-compliant stablecoins and integrations that enable clients to tap on-chain liquidity in a regulated environment. The firm is also launching Anchorage Digital Ventures, a new venture arm targeting Bitcoin BTC $86 970 24h volatility: 0.6% Market cap: $1.74 T Vol. 24h: $49.86 B DeFi, real-world assets (RWAs), and decentralized identity projects that fit its institutional client base. All of this sits on top of its status as the only crypto-native firm with a federal banking charter and key licenses, including New York’s BitLicense. For Securitize, selling SFA allows management to refocus on its core business of bringing real-world assets on-chain. The company reports more than $4 billion in tokenized assets under management and works with managers including Apollo, BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, and KKR to issue tokenized funds and private credit products. In January, Securitize and Apollo rolled out the ACRED tokenized private credit fund across multiple chains, using Wormhole as an interoperability layer to move assets between networks. Regulatory expansion has become central to Securitize’s strategy. The firm recently secured full regulatory approval to operate a tokenized securities trading and settlement platform in the European Union, positioning it as the only player running licensed tokenization infrastructure in both the US and EU. Securitize now plans to go public via a SPAC deal at a $1.25 billion valuation and has indicated it will tokenize its own equity as part of the process. The Anchorage-SFA combination gives RIAs a more direct, regulated path into digital assets, with one provider covering custody, execution, and front-end tools under a federal banking charter. This move could simplify compliance and operational risk management for advisory firms that have so far relied on fragmented service providers or avoided crypto allocations altogether.

President Donald Trump weighs in on foreign relations during a presser at the White House. President Donald Trump has directed U.S. officials to help to facilitate a "lasting and durable peace" between Ukraine and Russia, with officials touting the "very, very strong" package presented for negotiations in Berlin over the weekend. Fox News Digital participated in a briefing with U.S. officials Monday morning to discuss ongoing discussions in Berlin with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his team, and European security officials.

(Pavlo Bahmut/Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Officials said Trump’s goal is to "stop the Russians from moving west." "President Trump's very focused on reaching a conclusion to this conflict that really stops the Russians from from moving west," one official said. "Under President Bush, Russia moved west. Under President Obama, Russia moved west. Under President Biden, Russia move west. President Trump really wants to see this as an agreement that ends that, for good." Officials also discussed the economic situation for Ukraine, noting that asset manager BlackRock has assembled a team, pro bono, to begin working on the matter, in coordination with the World Bank. "We went extensively through all the different financial borders that Ukraine currently faces," an official said. "What President Trump is trying to do is to save Ukraine as a country and make sure that they then have the ability to be, from a military perspective, security perspective, and then make sure that they can become viable." The official said the Europeans involved in discussions expressed "several times that they see Ukraine as critical for their security," and that they "need Ukraine to be financially viable and strong in order for it to be a good partner."

(Vyacheslav Prokofyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) But the officials said that "security guarantees were the major focus of the discussions." "It was a very specific, palpable conversation around how to deter any further incursions and to punish — or address — any further incursions," an official said. "I think Ukrainians would tell you, as will the Europeans, that this is the most robust set of security protocols they have ever seen." EUROPEAN TALKS RESHAPE UKRAINE’S PEACE PLAN AS ZELENSKYY REFUSES TERRITORIAL CONCESSIONS The official touted the current package as "very, very strong." "Hopefully the Russians are going to look at it and say to themselves, that’s okay, because we have no intention of violating it," the official continued. "But violations are going to be addressed with this security package." The official added: "The Europeans now know that we mean business, and the Ukrainians know it too." The package will ensure "oversight" and "deconfliction," along with "anything that will make the Ukrainian people feel safe." "It’s just that strong," the official said. Officials said that the basis of the agreement is to have "really, really strong Article Five guarantees." Officials said that President Donald Trump has been "very, very clear" that he is "not looking to put pressure on Ukraine." (Al Drago/Reuters) "We believe the Russians, in a final deal, will accept all these things which will allow for a strong and free Ukraine," an official said. "Russia has indicated they would be open to Ukraine joining the E.U., which would be, I think, the biggest expansion of the Euro-free zone since the Berlin Wall — this would be two huge wins for them." Officials said that Trump has been "very, very clear" that he is "not looking to put pressure on Ukraine." "He has done his best to help define these issues and whatever decision they ultimately make on their territorial issues around these other outstanding issues will be up to them," the official said. UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY YET TO READ PEACE PLAN, TRUMP SAYS Meanwhile, the officials touted the conversations with the European community, specifically the Germans, the English, and the French. "I can’t say enough good things about them," one official said. "Everyone has been dug in to end this conflict. Hopefully we are on the path to peace." Another official said this is a "full U.S.-European effort to try to come up with the strongest package possible in order to see if we can go back to Russia with something that can close this out." The official added that President Donald Trump’s focus on the deal has been to ensure "robust security so that this war really ends and that this will not happen again." (Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The official added that Trump’s focus on the deal has been to ensure "robust security so that this war really ends and that this will not happen again" and to reach an agreement to deal with "all of the economic issues for Ukraine so that they have a bright and prosperous future." The official also said Trump hopes that Russia can "get back into the global economy so that they have incentive not to go back to war in the future." The U.S. officials said Monday conversations are ongoing, but touted the "multiple different solutions" they have presented that can "bridge the gap between the parties." CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP "We have moved considerably closer in narrowing the issues between the Ukrainians and the Russians," one official said. "It is a really good faith effort." "Are we prepared to go to Russia if needed? Absolutely. Are we prepared to go to Ukraine if needed? Absolutely," the official said. "We are under instructions to do what it takes to help facilitate, on behalf of President Trump, a lasting and durable peace between Ukraine and the Russian Federation," the official continued.

Title: MSC Emerges as ‘Leading Contender’ to Acquire ZIM, Report Says
URL: https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/msc-zim-leading-contender-bid-hapag-lloyd-acquisition-takeover-israel-mediterranean-shipping-company-1234794026/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T19:22:43Z
Full Content:
By Glenn Taylor Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) is reportedly in the mix to be the new owner of container shipping competitor ZIM. According to a report from Israeli business publication Calcalist, the world’s largest ocean carrier submitted a bid to ZIM’s board of directors to acquire the fellow shipping company. A previous report from another Israeli publication, Globes, said MSC had expressed interest in an acquisition while indicating that another major carrier, Hapag-Lloyd, had put in its own bid. Hapag-Lloyd has never confirmed the report. The Calcalist called MSC, the “leading contender” for the bid. Last month, ZIM’s board of directors confirmed that it put the company under strategic review after rejecting a prior takeover over from a group co-led by CEO Eli Glickman. The board is currently undergoing a proxy fight, with a minority investor group aiming to replace three board directors. Sourcing Journal reached out to MSC. MSC and ZIM already have a slot-swapping and vessel-sharing partnership, launching their own trans-Pacific cooperation in February. Under that three-year partnership, the carriers share vessels across six weekly services between Asia and the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts, with some stops at select Mexican and Caribbean ports. ZIM also had a prior arrangement with MSC from Asia to the Pacific Northwest. The ZIM North Pacific line stops at Yantian, Shanghai and Qingdao in China, and then South Korea’s Port of Busan, before crossing the Pacific Ocean to reach Canada’s Port of Vancouver. Related Stories Topics EU Scrutinizes MSC's Planned Stake in Barcelona Port Terminal Topics US Navy Taps Palantir to Speed Up Shipbuilding With AI 'Ship OS' ZIM’s shares increased nearly 6 percent in Monday morning trading on the report. MSC has more container-carrying capacity than any other ocean carrier, with its estimated 967 vessels able to transport nearly 7.1 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs), according to container shipping research database Alphaliner. That makes up a 21.3 percent of total market share by TEU. ZIM, on the other hand, carries the 10th most capacity at 704,000 TEUs, a 2.1 percent share of the fleet. Neither of the companies are part of the three major vessel-sharing alliances—the Ocean Alliance, the Premier Alliance and the Gemini Cooperation. A sale of ZIM is likely to have some barriers despite the board’s strategic review. ZIM’s workers’ committee clamored for Israel’s Transportation Minister Miri Regev to block the Hapag-Lloyd sale after the Globes report came out. The employees argue that foreign control could endanger Israel’s supply chain and potential national security in the event of another war. The committee’s main concern is that 98 percent of Israel’s trade goes by sea, with the workers harping that ZIM was the only ocean carrier that stopped at the country’s ports regularly throughout its war with Hamas. Selling to Hapag-Lloyd set off bells and whistles for the committee, given that the state investment wings of the Qatari and Saudi Arabian governments collectively own more than 20 percent of the German shipping company. MSC is privately owned, with the majority of shares held by the Italy-based Aponte family. While the ownership group doesn’t have ties to countries with tenuous relationships with Israel, any potential foreign buyer is still going to generate scrutiny. Israel’s government has a “golden share” in ZIM, which is likely to play a role in any potential transaction to a foreign entity. This mechanism is designed to protect the country’s interests in private companies deemed essential for national security and transportation. The provision gives the government veto powers over potential acquisitions if more than 24 percent of the company is sold. With its golden share, the government requires ZIM to have a majority-Israeli board, an Israeli chairman and a fleet of 11 ships available for state use in emergencies. According to the Calcalist report, ZIM employees are also concerned about potential layoffs should a foreign buyer acquire the company and consider relocating its headquarters abroad. The rumors also come as MSC is seeking to push through a $23 billion proposed acquisition of 43 ports worldwide from Hong Kong-based port operator CK Hutchison. The shipping company is partnering with BlackRock in the deal, but it is still hanging in regulatory limbo due to various contentions from China and Panama. That deal would shift two critical ports on the opposite sides of the Panama Canal under MSC’s ownership, which Panama Canal officials argue could put its operating neutrality at risk due to heavy concentration under one carrier. China has held the deal up under antitrust review, and has held gripes with a U.S. entity having control over the Panama Ports.

Title: BlackRock expands crypto bet with 7 senior hires across U.S. and Asia

BlackRock is ramping up its digital asset strategy with a wave of new hires aimed at expanding its crypto and blockchain-related products globally, amid growing institutional interest in tokenized and onchain assets. In a job posting board, the $10 trillion asset manager said it is hiring for seven digital asset positions, six based in the United States and one in Singapore. The move follows BlackRock's head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, posting about the open roles on LinkedIn last week. One of the positions in the U.S. focuses on expanding BlackRock’s iShares digital asset ETF lineup. The "Vice President/Director, Digital Assets Product Strategist" job listing seeks a candidate to scale existing products, including its crypto ETFs, and help extend them to institutional and wealth management clients. Currently, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has $70 billion in assets under management. The same role also mentions building “next generation products with strong commercial appeal,” pointing to the firm's ambition to go beyond traditional investment wrappers. The Singapore-based role is more expansive. There, BlackRock is looking for a leader to shape its digital asset strategy across Asia, where regulatory clarity and demand from institutional investors are accelerating. The job involves setting commercial targets and identifying “first-mover big bets” in the region that align with global priorities. A multi-year business plan is part of the brief. The hiring push adds to BlackRock’s growing presence in crypto markets. The firm made headlines last year with the launch of its spot bitcoin ETF, which helped drive record flows into crypto investment vehicles. Beyond ETFs, the firm is also expanding its asset tokenization strategy. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has spoken publicly about the potential of tokenized assets to modernize capital markets by increasing transparency and settlement efficiency. Last year, it launched a tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain and has invested in infrastructure providers, such as Securitize, to explore how public blockchains can support regulated financial products. A representative for BlackRock could not be reached for comment. CORRECTION (Dec. 15, 20:48 UTC): Corrects headline and story throughout to clarify details of BlackRock's search for candidates in crypto roles. UPDATE (Dec 15, 20:06 UTC): Adds that BlackRock couldn't be reached for comment.

Title: JPMorgan launches new crypto fund for wealthy investors — after Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a ‘fraud’ and ‘Ponzi scheme’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/12/15/business/jpmorgan-launches-new-crypto-fund-for-wealthy-investors/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T17:23:08Z
Full Content:
JPMorgan Chase — whose CEO Jamie Dimon once dismissed bitcoin as a “fraud” and likened cryptocurrencies to a “Ponzi scheme” — is diving further into crypto with a money-market fund that’s based on blockchain. The bank’s asset-management division, which handles $4 trillion, will start the Wall Street giant’s first tokenized money-market fund — this one on the Ethereum network — with $100 million of its own money, the Wall Street Journal reported. The fund — called the My OnChain Net Yield Fund, or MONY — will be opened to outside investors on Tuesday, but it’s not aimed at the masses: The minimum investment is $1 million, and individuals need at least $5 million in investments to qualify. Institutions need at least $25 million. A money-market fund is like a safe savings option that invests in short-term debts from governments or companies, earning a bit more interest than a regular bank account. A fund is referred to as “tokenized” when those assets are turned into digital tokens on a blockchain, a giant online record-keeping system that does not need a central bank or company to manage it. Ethereum is one of the main blockchain networks. Investors can buy into the fund through JPMorgan’s online portal and get digital tokens in their crypto wallets, which are like digital storage for online money. They can use cash or USDC, a stablecoin that holds a steady value tied to the US dollar, issued by Circle Internet Group. The fund pays interest and dividends daily, just like traditional ones. This move comes after the Genius Act passed earlier this year, setting rules for stablecoins and sparking more tokenization of stocks, bonds, funds, and real estate. “There is a massive amount of interest from clients around tokenization,” John Donohue, head of global liquidity at JPMorgan Asset Management, told the Journal. “And we expect to be a leader in this space and work with clients to make sure that we have a product lineup that allows them to have the choices that we have in traditional money-market funds on blockchain.” Money-market funds have grown popular, with total assets at about $7.7 trillion now, up from $6.9 trillion at the start of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute. Stablecoins have a market value of over $300 billion, according to data compiled by CoinGecko. Tokenized funds appeal to crypto users because they earn yields while staying fully on the blockchain, avoiding idle cash in stablecoins that do not pay interest. For managers, it reduces costs and speeds up deals. Some funds serve as collateral on crypto exchanges, helping to attract new clients to digital assets. JPMorgan’s move highlights a shift in its approach to digital assets, despite past criticisms from Dimon, its long-serving chief executive.
