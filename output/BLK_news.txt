Alt21, a Dublin-based low-cost foreign exchange fintech, has appointed the former chairman of Global Shares to its board in a move that it seen as opening doors to strategic investment to accelerate its growth. Andy Stewart led an investment in 2018 by New York private equity firm Motive Partners, in which he is an industry partner, into Cork-based Global Shares, which administers employee share plans for companies. Motive Partners was the biggest winner when JP Morgan acquired Global Shares three years ago for $730 million (€632 million) to mark one of the most successful exits by an Irish fintech. Mr Stewart was Global Shares’s executive chairman at the time. Motive Partners had a 40 per cent stake. Alt21, once known as Assure Hedge, was founded almost a decade ago by former financial derivatives trader Barry McCarthy. It is chaired by Richard Hayes, also an early investor in – and former chairman of – Global Shares. Pritesh Ruparel, chief executive of Alt21, said that Mr Stewart’s “deep experience in designing capital structures for scalable global fintechs is invaluable” to the company. “I look forward to working closely with Andy to help us secure the optimal capital structure and the scale of financing that matches our ambition,” he said. Alt21 offers multi-currency solutions for small to medium-sized businesses (SMEs) at a fraction of rates charged by banks and brokers, which dominate the market. It started providing services in the UK in 2021 under authorisation from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). It also recently secured authorisation in Malta, which will allow it to offer services across the EU, including Ireland. [ Dublin fintech firm Alt21 raises further $12.5m in fundingOpens in new window ] While fintechs Revolut and Wise have managed to prise a slice of foreign exchange business from banks in the micro-SME space over the past decade, Alt21 is aimed more at medium-sized firms, where its systems can be integrated into existing payroll and accounting systems. Half of the company’s 65 staff are understood to be engineers. The company raised $12.5 million earlier this year in a so-called series A funding round, bringing total investment to date to $44 million. “Alt21 is tackling one of the biggest inefficiencies still facing global mid-market businesses, the hidden costs and complexity of managing, moving, or earning interest on their money,” said Mr Stewart, who previously held senior roles at Blackrock, Credit Suisse and Man Investments. “I’m excited to join the board and support the company in its ambition to scale into a truly global disruptive brand.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Business Investors are directing money into U.S.-based exchange-traded funds at a rapid clip, pushing inflows so far this year across the $1 trillion line, State Street Investment Management said on Tuesday. That puts U.S. ETF inflows on pace to set a new annual record of as much as $1.4 trillion by the end of 2025, State Street said, with virtually every category benefitting from the torrent of new cash as investors continue to yank money out of traditional mutual funds in favor of lower-cost and more liquid ETFs. "Any market correction might slow the pace but it wouldn't halt the trend," said Matthew Bartolini, global head of research strategists at State Street. Last year, ETF flows reached the $1 trillion mark on December 11, State Street said, marking the first year they hit that threshold. This year, the breakneck pace has accelerated, with investors steering money into everything from low-cost, plain-vanilla ETFs tied to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to cryptocurrencies and gold, Bartolini said.

Title: Elizabeth Warren: Leftism for thee but not for me

By Paul Sperry, Real Clear Wire October 14, 2025 When Sen. Elizabeth A. Warren recently traveled to the Big Apple to endorse New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, she was asked if overt socialism is really the best model for Democrats to adopt. “You bet,” she replied in her signature folksy style. The Boston lawmaker wasn’t just jumping on the sudden trendiness of socialism three-and-a-half decades after its near-extinction. With fellow Senate traveler Bernie Sanders, Warren has been a catalyst for moving her party to the left since her first campaign in 2012. She and Sanders are, in many ways, the godparents of the self-avowed Democratic Socialists such as Mamdani and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are providing the youthful energy for the Democrats in the Trump era. As Warren’s attacks on Wall Street and the wealthy are gaining even wider traction among liberals – a recent Gallup poll found 66% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism – the apparent contradictions between her public economic positions and private financial decisions are receiving new scrutiny, particularly as the one-time presidential candidate appears to be testing those waters again.

Charity Doesn’t Begin at Home Financial records examined by RealClearInvestigations show that Warren has hardly followed the path of socialism in her personal finances. Start with the redistribution of wealth. Warren tirelessly bashes the “selfish” and “greedy” rich for not paying their “fair share,” and demands the government step in and redistribute their income to the poor. But charity does not always begin in the Warren home. While Warren hauls in nearly $1 million a year, she donated less than 3% of her household income to charity in 2024, according to her tax returns. This is much less than the charity of the Obamas, for instance, who typically donate more than 20% of their earnings to the needy and philanthropic causes, and low for the average American in her income bracket, studies show. The average millionaire donates more than twice her share. It also appears that Warren opens her pocketbook wider when she’s running for national office and under a bigger media microscope. The $26,669 in charitable deductions Warren reported on her tax returns last year pales in comparison to the $81,858, or 9% of income, she reported as she launched her campaign for the White House in 2020. And the outspoken Democratic leader keeps her own tax burden down while calling for higher taxes on “millionaires and billionaires.” Records show Warren is not averse to taking maximum advantage of provisions in a tax code she denounces as unfair. She has, for example, written off used articles of clothing on her taxes and has had to correct past returns for inflating the value of those items. She’s also written off thousands of dollars in used books – and even in-flight WiFi to expense down business income. And she would exempt herself from her proposed “Ultra-Millionaire Tax,” which levies a surtax on those with a net worth above $50 million. With a net worth of at least $8 million (with estimates as high as $12 million), Warren has benefited handsomely from free market capitalism – even as she has spent most of her career in the public and educational sectors. Fat Cat Investments Despite her frequent complaints that “the wealthiest 10% of U.S. households own 84% of American-held shares” of stock, she has invested the bulk of her money in stocks and bonds managed by Wall Street investment funds. These accounts are valued at between $1.9 million and $6.8 million, according to her most recent Senate financial disclosures, filed in April. (Values are given as ranges in the disclosure reports that members of Congress are required to file each year.) Although Warren has rarely traded individual stocks, records show the mutual funds where she has parked her millions – Vanguard and TIAA-CREF – hold a number of companies in industries that Warren has demonized, including Big Oil, Big Tech, and Big Pharma. Through these funds, for example, Warren has invested in Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA; Exxon and Shell; Wells Fargo; Goldman Sachs; Monsanto; Johnson & Johnson; and even NewsCorp – the owner of conservative Fox News and the New York Post. Nevertheless, Warren has ripped “fat cat bankers” at Wells Fargo for preying on minority homebuyers and customers with “predatory” rates and “junk” fees, and also for “screwing” their own employees. She even demanded the Federal Reserve revoke Wells Fargo’s status as a financial holding company over “abusive and unlawful” practices. Warren has called for regulators to break up tech giants Amazon and Apple, which she claims are running monopolies. “I’m sick of freeloading [tech] billionaires” who “roll over everyone,” she recently said. Warren has described Exxon as a “bad actor” that contributes to global warming. She’s even accused the energy giant of “corporate perjury” by publicly denying its alleged role in warming and producing “fake research” to “mislead the American people about climate change.” The senator has also slammed Exxon for “imposing massive price increases on Americans [sic] families,” arguing “this corporate greed is inexcusable.” Environmental activist groups have called on her chosen retirement fund, TIAA, to divest from Exxon, along with the rest of its more than $78 billion in oil, gas, and coal assets, according to a recent estimate by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. They argue the fund is using contributions from investors like Warren to “destroy communities and the environment.” Last year, Warren bashed Donald Trump for capitulating to the oil industry. “Donald Trump has a deal for Big Oil: if they raise $1 billion and send him back to the White House, he’ll gut environmental protections and roll back Joe Biden’s progress in fighting climate change,” she asserted on X. “It’s corruption, pure and simple. And it would be a disaster for our planet.” Exempting Some Millionaires Slamming the president’s “Big Beautiful Bill” earlier this year, Warren complained, “Trump’s tax cuts stand to benefit (the) highest income earners.” She would know – she’s one of them. The $919,583 in household income Warren reported on her 2024 tax return she filed jointly with her husband puts her in the top 1% of highest-earning Americans. The year before she entered the Senate, Warren reported earning $616,181. The lawmaker’s base Senate salary of $174,000 accounts for just one-fifth of the total income she reported to the IRS. The rest comes from book royalties, dividends, capital gains, earned interest, retirement income, and her husband Bruce Mann’s salary as a tenured Harvard professor. The Senate is often described as a Millionaire’s Club, and she fits right in: Her $8 million net worth would rank her as the 18th wealthiest member of the Senate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Warren’s net worth has risen each year since she was first elected to the Senate in 2012, while the median wealth of senators overall has declined, according to the think tank. Although Warren is just one of many millionaires in Congress, government watchdogs note her wealth is at odds with the stridency of her class-warfare rhetoric. “Elizabeth Warren poses as the champion of the underdog, but her policies strip middle- and lower-income Americans of opportunities to advance their lot and build wealth,” said John Berlau, director of finance policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, referring to her calls for more taxes and financial red tape. “By pursuing policies that keep others from moving up, Sen. Warren has emerged as an unlikely champion of the existing 1%.” Warren did not reply to requests for comment. Critics note that several of Warren’s former staff members have moved on to positions in the sectors she decries. In 2023, she declared, “The abuse of the revolving door is appalling,” particularly in the financial sector, which she claims is “rigged to help the wealthy and well-connected.” But records show her own office has served as a revolving door for the banks. For example, Wally Adeyemo, who served as her chief of staff when she was standing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, went on to work as a senior adviser at investment giant BlackRock. At least six other Warren staffers who worked in her Senate office have worked as lobbyists, records show. In addition, several of her senior campaign aides have worked on K Street. “There is a history of a revolving door of Warren staffers and protégés at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau taking jobs at big Wall Street firms, such as BlackRock,” Berlau said. Restrictive Neighborhoods Home ownership is also key to wealth-building, but zoning restrictions often price the working class out of homes. Warren has fought against so-called NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) rules and has fiercely advocated for building more affordable housing in cities. She even backs Mamdani’s “social housing” proposal to let the New York state government seize private properties and convert them into public housing. However, Warren has chosen to live in affluent neighborhoods in Boston and D.C. that are heavily zoned to exclude the construction of new housing units and price out the average homebuyer. Public financial statements do not disclose the 76-year-old legislator’s real estate holdings, but other records show she owns at least two homes valued at more than $5 million. Her primary residence is located in the leafy Avon Hill section of Cambridge, Mass., which has enforced a century-old zoning system of minimum lot sizes, minimum parking requirements, floor area ratios, limits on units per building, and height restrictions. The restrictions have yielded a housing shortage in the city that has driven up the value of existing homes – including Warren’s 1876 Victorian mansion, which has risen eightfold to an estimated $4 million since she bought it in 1995. Records show she and her husband owe no mortgage on their nearly 4,000-square-foot home, which features three stories, high ceilings, marble mantels, hardwood floors, and a four-car garage. The median price for a home in Cambridge now tops $2.2 million. “The astronomical increase in the value of Warren’s home, and home prices in Cambridge more generally, has not happened in a vacuum,” said Scott Van Voorhis, a Boston real estate analyst. “The city’s special blend of upscale NIMBYism and restrictive zoning laws and regulations kept new house, condo and apartment construction to a trickle at best, even as demand for living in the city increased leaps and bounds.” Though the Cambridge city council earlier this year loosened its zoning ordinances to permit more housing across the city, Warren’s neighborhood remains largely exempt from reforms. That’s because Avon Hill is a conservation district further regulated by the Cambridge Historical Commission. Records show Warren’s street and home are located within the historic district, which protects old Victorians from being torn down for multifamily housing. That makes her neighborhood the ultimate safe NIMBY zone. “Nothing has been built [in her neighborhood] for decades beyond the occasional mansion upgrade,” Van Voorhis noted. Warren clearly understands there is a housing supply problem in Boston. In July, she helped shepherd the ROAD to Housing Act through the Senate, which, among other things, would provide grants to communities that change their land-use rules to make it easier to build new housing units. “We have a real problem here in Massachusetts that we simply don’t have enough housing,” Warren explained to the Boston Globe, noting the state is about 200,000 units short of what is needed. “If we don’t start building more housing here, the housing crisis will continue to intensify.” But when it comes to her own neighborhood – one of the least affordable in the state – she remains silent. Cambridge council members noted they didn’t hear “a peep” from Warren when they were recently debating zoning reforms to deal with the city’s growing housing affordability crisis. In 2013, when Warren bought her home in Washington, D.C., she also happened to select an area of the capital city where zoning restrictions have entrenched the status quo. Valued at more than $1 million, her condo is in the trendy Penn Quarter section of D.C., which is a historic area protected by land-use rules. Dubious Identity Politics Most famously, Warren’s personal decisions seem at odds with the left’s leavening of traditional socialist positions with identity politics. Before moving to the Senate, Warren was a tenured professor at Harvard with a lucrative salary. Although the school denies that her claims to Native American ancestry influenced their decision to hire her, she and the administration trumpeted her diverse background. Warren also listed herself as a racial minority in a legal directory distributed by the Association of American Law Schools and was listed as a Native American in federal forms filed by Harvard Law School. When she launched her political career in 2012 and released a memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” Warren described her alleged “Native American roots” as a Cherokee. Henry Holt & Company paid her a $525,000 advance for the book, which became a national bestseller that still earns her royalties. She also helped publish a cookbook, “Pow Wow Chow,” exploiting the myth of her native American lineage. Warren took in $430,000 a year as a tenured Harvard Law professor by claiming a Native American heritage – even as she has railed against whites appropriating minority culture or pretending to understand minority experiences. But, as she ramped up her run for the White House, Warren responded to persistent challenges of this claim by taking a DNA test. In late 2018, her campaign maintained it showed “strong evidence” of Native American ancestry dating back generations. When that failed to quiet her critics, Warren basically had to acknowledge that the test revealed that she is as little as 1/1024th Native American, making her less of that ancestry than the average white American. She also eventually apologized to the Cherokee Nation in 2019. The year before that admission, however, she lectured others during her Senate campaign about stolen valor: “It is wrong and cowardly for people to make fraudulent statements in order to receive distinctions that they have not earned. We need to ensure that no one can benefit from making false claims and steal the true valor of the courageous.” “If there ever were a genuine case of cultural appropriation, Sen. Warren is guilty of it,” said Gad Saad, a business professor at Concordia University. “She literally appropriated Native American culture as her own by constructing a false narrative about her ancestry.” “And yet,” he added, “she benefited for several decades from this false narrative both in her academic and political career.” Saad and others who have closely followed her career suggest the progressive senator appears to have a “good for me, but not for thee” ethic when it comes to her own personal ambitions. Though she’s carefully groomed a reputation as a fighter for the “have-nots” against the “haves,” the record shows that, outside the spotlight, she has often pursued her own interests and followed the path of the haves.

Title: Larry Fink: ‘Bitcoin shouldn’t be a large portion of your portfolio’ as BlackRock ETF drops to $90bn

About us Copy link Buy Bitcoin — but don’t get carried away. That’s the message from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the man who once called Bitcoin “the domain of money launderers and thieves.” On Monday, he told CBS’s 60 Minutes the asset now has a place in investor portfolios. Just not a big one. “There’s a place for bitcoin much like gold — it’s an alternative. For those that are looking to diversify their portfolio, this isn’t a bad asset,” Fink said. He doesn’t believe, however, that it “should be a large component of your portfolio.” The comment mirrors how Wall Street has historically viewed gold: a useful diversifier and hedge, but never a core allocation. Indeed, Wall Street has long-preached the gospel of diversification through a traditional 60/40 portfolio — 60% stocks for growth, 40% bonds for stability. The model worked for decades, delivering steady returns while cushioning crashes. But as correlations between stocks and bonds have broken down in recent years, compressing returns, institutional investors are searching for new sources of diversification. That’s when alternative assets like Bitcoin come into play. Despite Fink’s caution, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has become one of the most successful fund launches in history. Less than two years since its debut, the firm’s IBIT fund already holds over $90 billion in assets under management. Moreover, IBIT led all ETF flows across every sector last week, pulling in $3.5 billion, or about 10% of all net flows into ETFs. That beat Vanguard’s SPLG and State Street’s VOO, stalwart S&P 500 trackers that have been around for 20 and 15 years, respectively. “That”s how hungry the fish are,” Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst, said on X. “Enjoy while it lasts.” Still, that $90 billion figure is down from $98 billion last week, after Bitcoin’s value fell amid a record $19 billion leverage crash. Other traditional finance titans have gone a bit further. Back in June, Ric Edelman, the famed financial advisor of Edelman Financial Engines, which manages $287 billion for 1.3 million clients, made a huge call on crypto. Edelman said that conservative investors should allocate 10% to digital assets. He also recommended that moderate investors assign 25% to the nascent instruments, and aggressive investors a staggering 40%. “Today I am saying 40%, that’s astonishing,” he said on CNBC on June 27. “No one has ever said such a thing.” Fink’s words come at a time of broad economic turmoil — much like the last time BlackRock executives were in the press telling investors to buy Bitcoin. Back in April, Samara Cohen, BlackRock’s CIO of ETF and Index Investments said that crypto-curious institutions really only cared for Bitcoin. “Especially in this environment,” Cohen told the Blockworks Empire podcast. What was that environment? A global trade war and uncertainty around Federal Reserve Policy. This time is no different. Last Thursday, a tug-of-war between the US and China sent crypto markets tumbling, setting off a $19 billion liquidation event. Nowadays, macro uncertainty is compounded as the US suffers through its second week of a government shutdown. The funding impasse has delayed the release of key economic data the Federal Reserve relies on for policy decisions, including monthly jobs reports and inflation data. Without official statistics, markets are flying blind on the health of the economy. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin’s narrative as a hedge against government chaos has gained traction with institutional investors searching for alternatives to traditional markets. Fink’s measured endorsement reflects this shift — Bitcoin is legitimate enough for diversification, but Wall Street’s old guard isn’t ready to bet the farm on it just yet.

Title: Here’s How Much Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Institutions Bought Last Week

Institutional investors bought more Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP last week, with crypto funds recording another week of net inflows. This provides a bullish outlook for these crypto assets, especially as they look to bounce from last week’s crash. CoinShares’ report revealed that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP saw net inflows of $2.67 billion, $338 million, and $61.6 million, respectively. This came as crypto funds recorded $3.17 billion in inflows last week, bringing their year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $48.7 billion. Specifically, BTC, ETH, and XRP now have YTD inflows of $30.2 billion, $13.9 billion, and $1.8 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, the increased inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum over XRP last week mark a turnaround, as these institutions at some point accumulated more XRP than the top two cryptos by market cap. This was the case two weeks ago when XRP saw a net inflow of $93.1 million while BTC and ETH recorded outflows of $719 million and $409.4 million, respectively. The net inflows into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP last week came despite the crypto market crash triggered by Donald Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on China. CoinShares revealed that there was little reaction to the development, as crypto funds saw about $159 million in outflows on Friday when Trump announced it. CoinShares also noted that, despite the hype around upcoming XRP ETF launches, inflows into XRP funds have slowed, as institutional investors pay more attention to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Notably, BTC and ETH have seen more inflows since the U.S. government shutdown began. Institutional investors are believed to be moving into Bitcoin, especially as a safety net amid macro uncertainty, a trade which has been described as the ‘debasement trade.’ The increased inflows into the Bitcoin funds were one of the factors that contributed to a rally to a new all-time high (ATH) above $126,000 earlier this month. However, BTC has since lost all these gains thanks to the tariff announcement last week. SoSoValue data shows that the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have started this week with outflows, possibly stemming from last week’s tariff announcement. The BTC ETFs recorded $326.52 million in daily net outflows on October 13. BlackRock was the only fund issuer that recorded inflows on the day, taking in $60.36 million. Meanwhile, the ETH ETFs recorded daily net outflows of $428.52 million. BlackRock’s ETH fund recorded the largest outflows, with $310.13 million flowing out of the fund. Other funds also recorded outflows or zero flows. If the trend sustains, it could present a setback for these crypto assets as they look to bounce from last week’s market crash.

Title: The Pain and Possibility of Pensions

If pensions make your eyes glaze over, that’s by design. The less attention they get, the more quietly Wall Street can profit from them. But these massive funds quietly shape the economy we all live in. As of September, the largest public pension fund in the country — the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or CalPERS — manages approximately $575 billion. In New York City, five pension funds and systems — representing more than 750,000 current and retired public workers — hold more than $295 billion in assets, making them some of the largest institutional investors in the country. That money comes with power and contradictions. Pensions are designed to protect workers from an uncertain future, but their investments can undermine jobs or accelerate the climate crisis. Socially responsible investing is often presented as a fix, but many efforts have collapsed into greenwashing. High fees and risky bets can transfer wealth from workers to Wall Street while obfuscating how these investments reverberate through the economy. In These Times News Editor J. Patrick Patterson sat down with people who work inside and outside the system to cut through the arid language of ​“fund performance” and ​“asset allocation” and reveal how pensions are anything but dull: Brad Lander, New York City comptroller; Evan Sutton, a strategist who has organized campaigns challenging corporate power, including the impactful Tesla Takedown protests; and Mullissa Willette, a CalPERS board member and union leader. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. J. PATRICK PATTERSON: Pensions hold an enormous pool of public capital at a moment when private equity and mega corporations dominate the global economy. What role should pensions play, and what’s standing in the way? BRAD LANDER: Our first priority, and our fiduciary duty, is guaranteeing retirement security for public sector workers, for the teachers and firefighters and public hospital nurses and school crossing guards in New York City. That’s critical right now with what’s happening at the federal level, with workers losing their rights to collectively bargain. Our fiduciary obligation is not only a legal obligation, but a deep expression of our commitment to public sector workers. We are not day traders, and to trade long-term retirement security with all the risks — that includes in climate, in thriving workplaces, in an inclusive economy — to close your eyes to that broad set of risks would be a dereliction of duty. So that means paying attention to environmental, social and governance risks, and that has added up to an approach that has been one of the foundations of a thriving U.S. economy. People who wreck the foundations of responsible investing for either short-term gains or crass political purposes really do risk the long-term stability of the U.S. economy and the people who depend on it. MULLISSA WILLETTE: I always start with the basics. What are public pensions? They’re not gifts; they’re not handouts. They’re deferred wages. They’re things that workers collectively bargain for and said, ​“I will do this today for that tomorrow.” They are the earnings of teachers, of county employees, nurses, bus drivers, custodians in the hospital. Those are already the people, before their pension comes into play, who are holding up our economy and who are keeping our communities running. I know at CalPERS, the majority of our workers are Black, brown and AAPI [Asian American Pacific Islander] women who are already the keystones of their home economies. There have been studies showing that pensions are one of the most effective tools we have to break cycles of wealth inequality for Black and brown communities and for many workers of color who’ve been systemically excluded from wealth-building opportunities. For some, a secure pension is the difference between retiring with dignity or retiring in poverty. Understanding that retirement system as one of the few pathways to intergenerational security for working families makes our responsibility on that long-term sustainability really important. I also want to credit Jon Lukomnik, because he literally wrote the book on it. Our investment returns are largely driven by ​“beta,” the performance of the overall market, not individual stock selection. So that means chasing high returns through complex, high-fee strategies doesn’t protect our members from systemic risks. LANDER: I also really value Jon Lukomnik’s analysis here. ​“Alpha” is the outperformance risk-return of an individual investment; beta, as Mullissa explained, is about systemic risk. We’re broadly invested all across the economy, so it really is the thriving of the economy that is the key to our ability to meet our obligations in a way that is not true for many other investors. Lukomnik did some analysis, before I got here, that showed how, in New York City, opening up proxy ballot access helped improve returns across the economy, and how things like climate risk or inequality or lack of inclusion are broad economic risks if not addressed, and gains when addressed. That’s something that universal investors, like public pension funds, have a unique responsibility and opportunity to make a difference on. EVAN SUTTON: I think we need to acknowledge up front that public pensions have an activist interest. If we can’t protect public sector jobs and make public sector jobs safe jobs, then the public pensions will disappear and the public jobs disappear. In New York City, we saw the teachers unions really pushing for moving money out of hedge funds that were using profits to attack teachers unions and other public sector unions. And that’s actually pushing companies to better policies, so that if you want the investment of the public sector unions — which have vast resources — then you are, at minimum, not harming public sector workers. I would love to see more public sector pensions really looking at how they can leverage investment to keep companies from engaging in the kind of behavior we’ve seen, for example, from Tesla and its CEO, where there’s tens of billions in public pension money nationwide invested. But Tesla’s CEO has perhaps done the single most damaging act we’ve seen to public employees, in dropping huge amounts of money to elect this administration, in supporting farright candidates going after public workers, and there’s a lesson that can be taught, even if it’s on the backside. PATTERSON: Fees and private equity and hedge funds can drain retirement funds. How big of a problem do you see here? WILLETTE: I believe that you pay people for the job that’s done. So if a manager can get us phenomenal returns — without exploiting the workforce, without exploiting the climate and the planet, without destroying the economy — then I’m happy to pay them for that. But as a trustee, I find it’s very, very difficult when the fee structures are very opaque. Don’t underestimate showing up and asking the questions. We have to demand transparency. We have to require full disclosure not just of the fees, but how the investment was made, where we’re losing money, how performance incentives are calculated, evaluating whether there is unnecessary risk. It also means we have to walk away from deals that don’t meet those standards, which is hard because of the work and the relationships built just to get to that level of information. LANDER: A challenge in general is that you pay much higher fees in private markets than in public markets, which is fine, so long as your returns — net of fees — are still delivering. Responsible investing in private markets uses different tools and looks different than it does in public markets, but we’ve had many of our most significant impacts through our private markets investments. For many years, for example, the Venetian hotel was the one big nonunion hotel on the strip in Las Vegas. Sheldon Adelson owned it. His widow put it up for sale after he died, and Apollo Global Management bought it. Apollo was coming to us for a big re-up right as that was happening, and we were able to say to Apollo, ​“It’s going to be very hard to get our members to vote for a re-up.” So they entered into a neutrality agreement with the culinary and the other unions there, and now more than 4,000 workers have a good union contract. So that’s a different approach than we would take through a shareholder resolution. PATTERSON: What other barriers do you see in moving money away from high-fee products? WILLETTE: Things like the corporate code haven’t kept up with today’s legislative changes. Policy is usually just codifying what’s already happening, and new ways of extracting from workers are created every day. Even what you think is sacrosanct in terms of the National Labor Relations Act — we don’t know what the NLRA is going to look like a year from now, let alone 10 years from now. So we have to be evolving. And I think being held to yesterday’s standards in today’s environment is one of the biggest barriers. We also don’t talk enough with our members about it, and they’re not at the gates demanding change. PATTERSON: What does that actually look like — for a union to get its membership informed? WILLETTE: Every time I think I understand how some unions are structured, we learn new structures of new unions, and that’s beautiful — because if they’re democratic and members are building their power, then there’s no wrong route. I started out working for a public agency, and I live in the Bay Area in California. I got my first paycheck and said, ​“Why is this huge amount of money being taken out? I need to opt out of that.” And I was told, ​“Nope. That’s your pension benefit, it’s there so you don’t end up a client of a social services agency when you retire.” And I learned what a pension was. So — new employee orientation, first paycheck, unions can be talking to their members all the time. You can create the space; if it doesn’t exist, use a space that already exists. Anytime we talk about collective bargaining, anytime you talk about the topic of the day, I could probably turn it into a pension conversation. This stuff isn’t fun, and I think it was meant to be that way, by design. But there’s not anyone who says, ​“Nope, that’s too complicated for me.” We can’t let Wall Street, or even private assets, be so complex that they’re untouchable, because that’s what’s happened. If we can explain what we want to a Wall Street consultant, then we can explain it to the people whose money it is we’re managing. SUTTON: And if members don’t understand their money is being invested through hedge funds and private equity firms siphoning off vast amounts of money, then members will never make their voices heard. The reality is, with the amount of money that even mediumsized public pensions have to invest, you have enormous leverage. And there will be a hedge fund or private equity firm that can deliver the same results that will be happy to take that investment money at a lower fee. What has happened too is that pension boards have developed policies to tie their own hands. For example, in Wisconsin, the statewide pension decided, ​“We don’t divest from anything because we don’t want to have to deal with constant calls to divest from this thing or that thing.” And while I understand the urge, I also think that having folks like Brad and Mullissa in these positions — who actually think about leverage and think about the role that activism can play to benefit the pension — is really important. Pensions need to think of themselves not just as fiduciaries, but as political implements. Part of that is using the leverage in the investments being made. PATTERSON: Does that not risk politicizing pensions? LANDER: Four of our five funds are structured so that half the votes are the public sector and the other half are representatives of the unions. The union members on those funds represent the workers, and they care about the retirement security they’re elected to protect. And they bring a real, thoughtful, fiduciary approach, and that may wind up looking different to some of those different members. It is entirely possible to take those seriously and clearly, with a clear responsible investing approach. Having representatives of the workers — whose retirement security is at the table — is a strong part of doing that PATTERSON: But your role is not just with pensions; it’s with taxpayer dollars. Where do you see a line between what pensions can do responsibly and what really requires public budgets? LANDER: You can’t use pension as subsidy. Subsidy is like— a foundation giving the money away. But this isn’t our money to give away. If we were to give it away, not only would that be a legal violation, but it wouldn’t be there for the workers it’s promised to. But there is a strong role for investment dollars in helping move forward the kinds of things that New Yorkers, including those workers, need. We have an authorization to invest up to 2% of our portfolio in economically targeted investments — which has historically meant affordable housing and small business — that will earn returns and also strengthen the New York City economy, to make it more inclusive and address capital gaps. We are looking right now at whether it’s possible to broaden that out somewhat, to do more climate investing or meet other needs. SUTTON: This is one of the places where there’s been some really interesting and creative thinking about ways money can be used for social good. When I was at the American Federation of Teachers, we were in the middle of a major project where AFT and the New York teachers’ pension had invested in the rebuild of LaGuardia Airport Terminal B. That project led to something in the neighborhood of 15,000 good union jobs. Part of the investment strategy was helping secure a really strong project labor agreement to ensure those jobs were going to qualified union construction workers in the skilled trades, but it’s also returning an investment. Another really interesting example is where a company provides down payment assistance to qualified workers, because that’s often the single greatest obstacle, even if you could pay the mortgage. And then, within a certain period, you either have to sell or refinance, and the company takes a cut of the increased value of the home. Of course, if the home has lost value, then the company takes a little bit of a bath, so like all other investment, it’s a gamble on the market to grow. But that, for example, could be a triple investment into the union member — the member’s money to get into a home, built by member wealth, going to return the investment into the member’s pension. WILLETTE: And when the member buys their home, that would keep the member in that job for longer, and that helps recruitment, which costs the taxpayers less. We have better quality jobs, because historic information stays on the job when people stay in that job. So it creates a stronger sense of community, and then people vote where they work and live, which creates better patterns of outcome. PATTERSON: One of the greatest financial risks of our time is climate change, but some say ESG investing — for environmental, social and governance criteria — is mostly greenwashing. If responsible investing can’t deliver, what role should pensions play in addressing climate risk? LANDER: We have one of the boldest decarbonization plans for U.S. public pension funds. We divested fossil fuel reserve owners from our public equities coming up on five years ago, and we have found that has been a good investment. We’re a year ahead of our goal of being net zero by 2040. We have seen good returns in our renewables and are proud of the ways the returns have aligned with that. But I am really worried here that red state treasurers and elected officials have brought more pressure to bear, scaring the asset managers out of the clear recognition that climate risk is financial risk, and therefore backing off. We required all of our public markets asset managers to give us their decarbonization plans by June 30, and we’re reviewing them now. We’re requiring all our private markets managers to do the same by next June 30, and we’ve been clearer with them. If managers aren’t taking appropriate steps that are aligned with our goals, then we’re going to have to bid out their mandates and look for managers who are. A big European pension fund pulled a $17 billion mandate from BlackRock this week, precisely over concerns about BlackRock’s walk-back on climate. PATTERSON: Is it actually possible to divest? If we’re not investing in fossil fuels, where should we invest? SUTTON: I would love to see every public pension fund divested from fossil fuels, but you do get into some really weird territory. Tesla, again, is an example of an environmentally responsible company, and arguably Tesla pushed the auto industry into more electrification. Tesla also made tons of money selling other companies its climate credits so they could continue building an outsized number of dirty cars — so was it just robbing Peter to pay Paul? And that’s not even getting into Tesla’s own labor and environmental practices around construction and rare earth minerals. There are blue chip stocks that are, for example, insurance companies. Is it responsible to be invested in insurance companies when a large-scale climate disaster could make even the largest insurance companies insolvent? Or when those companies are refusing to underwrite homes in large sections of places like California? I don’t think there’s an easy answer. I do think, if you’re going to take a risk in investing, then take it on things that can make the world better while delivering a good result. WILLETTE: I always want to frame it as — whose money is this and what would they say about these investments? Workers know the impact of climate change, and it’s their money. We have workers in parks departments who literally feel the heat of the day. We have workers who have families on farms in California. I also know fossil fuel is plastics, it’s lipstick, it’s a lot more than the coal plant in Ohio. It’s huge. Can our economy survive that divestment? I have workers who contribute to CalPERS, who live and work for the city of Bakersfield, an economy really reliant on the fossil fuel industry. So what jobs do they do if the fossil fuel industry is removed, and what’s left for a roads worker? A social worker? We have to fly the plane while we build it. We have to invest in the new work and the new standards while also divesting. But I don’t like using the word divestment, because it’s an investment decision. If I invest in one thing or another, that’s the investment decision. I didn’t divest from one thing and then something else. As a fiduciary, our fund has to sustainably generate returns, and we can only do that if the companies we invest in have repeatable business practices that will sustain that value. And we know we are going to run out of oil, that those coal plants are going to explode. If we don’t have a company that has repeatable, sustainable, long-term business practices, we shouldn’t be invested in that company. LANDER: Red state treasurers and MAGA interests are both doing the bidding of their fossil fuel donors and trying to force people to keep burning capital up by burning fossil fuels, and at the same time, trying to force on everyone a short-term approach. They are, therefore, really jeopardizing the foundations on which American capital markets and shareholder governance rest. Public sector workers in red states need the same things our workers do. And I think this is an opportunity for people to really loudly push back. PATTERSON: Can pensions realistically push back, or do they just reinforce corporate power, in the sense that concentrated corporate power undermines democracy? SUTTON: I do think pension funds have the opportunity to countervail corporate power. You don’t have external investors in a pension fund, so there’s not really an apples to apples comparison there. The Venetian finally unionizing is a perfect example of one way to do it. And if we want to survive the moment, we’re going to need a lot more people like Mullissa and Brad who are ready and willing to actually wield that money as power. LANDER: The movement of capital into the economy — and whether it cares about whether the planet burns up, whether it cares about workers, about inclusion in the economy regardless of race or background, having an opportunity to get capital to start smart businesses and innovate — has a huge impact on what the future of the economy will be. WILLETTE: So we have to invest in strategies that support, not undermine, the workers whose pension we’re trying to serve. There are a lot of examples of corporate power that erodes the workers’, whose money it is. As a public sector trustee, investing in a company that privatizes public goods or public services would go against my fiduciary duty to protect the public workers’ retirement security. We need to not leave anything off the table just because it hasn’t been done before. Housing, the energy grid, highspeed internet lines — there’s a lot of investment opportunity in new technology, for example, that would benefit workers and benefit our communities. J.

As of the end of September, BlackRock managed $13.5 trillion in assets for clients, the asset manager announced during its third quarter earnings call this morning. The firm’s assets under management grew 17% year over year, from $11.48 billion as of the third quarter of 2024. BlackRock, like many asset managers, has turned to acquisitions of specialist alternative investment managers for growth and diversification—these illiquid asset classes also provide the firm with higher fee revenue. The firm reported that revenue from performance fees was 33% higher in the year-over-year quarter and 449% higher than the previous quarter. Institutional assets made up 52% of BlackRock’s assets under management in the most recent quarter, and 35% of its base fees. Alternative investments make up only 3% of BlackRock’s assets under management, but they account for 17% of the firm’s base fees. Base fees also comprise 75% of BlackRock’s quarterly revenue, as of the end of Q3, according to an earnings supplement from the firm. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  For comparison, equities account for 55% of BlackRock product types and 48% of base fees. Fixed income accounts for 24% of AUM and generated 20% of its base fees. In July, BlackRock completed its acquisition of private credit manager HPS Investment Partners, adding more than $150 billion in client assets. The firm’s 2024 acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners also added more than $100 billion in infrastructure investments. According to BlackRock, it almost doubled client assets invested in alternative strategies to $663 billion in the third quarter of this year, up from $334 billion in Q3 2024. Growth was strongest in private credit, which grew to $196 billion from $37 billion as a result of the HPS acquisition, and in infrastructure, where assets grew to $182 billion from $52 billion. “We’ve brought together the strengths of GIP, HPS, and Preqin, and together we’re already driving landmark fundraising and deal flow, accelerating client engagement, and [seeing] double-digit organic revenue growth over the last year,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a statement.

If the company—which disclosed a record $13.46 trillion in assets under management—could move toward offering ETFs as tokens to investors, then that would broaden access to capital markets and reduce fees, he said during the firm’s third-quarter earnings broadcast. As BlackRock leans deeper into digital assets, Fink said the firm is already “having conversations with all the major platforms” in finance about how they can play a role in BlackRock’s tokenization push, within the context of digital wallets. Since Fink touted tokenization as the future of markets in 2022, he has remained as a high-profile backer of the technology on Wall Street, serving as a potential harbinger for how the most influential financial institutions could adopt digital assets over time. “It is our belief that we need to be moving rapidly,” Fink said of tokenization. “We need to be tokenizing all assets, especially assets that have multiple levels of intermediaries.” Although BlackRock isn’t focusing on digital representations of real estate, Fink highlighted it as one area that tokenization could reduce fees. Because every intermediary involved is charging fees, Fink said tokenization could make home ownership more affordable. Tokenized assets have seen some adoption among individual investors, but Fink said “young people” are the ones that are heavily using them. Introducing them to more traditional assets sooner could allow investors to better prepare for life events like retirement, he posited. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL, which debuted last year, is among the largest tokenized assets at $2.8 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz. As of Tuesday, it had 89 holders, while being issued by a firm called Securitize. BlackRock led a $47 million strategic funding round in Securitize this year. BlackRock’s Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships, Joseph Chalom, called the firm’s investment “another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy” at the time. BlackRock is behind the largest ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have $93 billion and $17 billion worth of assets under management, respectively, according to CoinGlass data. Although BlackRock is racing towards tokenized markets, Fink suggested that it might be a while before the public gets a clearer look at what the Wall Street titan has in store “I do believe we have some exciting announcements in the coming years on how we could play a larger role on this whole idea of the tokenization and digitization of all assets,” he said. “We're spending a great deal of time on the tech. I'm trying to develop our own technology related to this."

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Eyes Bigger Role in Tokenization

BlackRock (BLK), the asset management giant overseeing more than $13 trillion of assets, is ramping up efforts to bring traditional finance (TradiFi) onchain, seeking a bigger role in tokenization as a way to unlock access to markets and streamline how assets are traded. Teams across the firm are exploring how to use tokenization to make markets more efficient and accessible, with leadership hinting at bigger moves ahead, CEO Larry Fink said during an earnings call following its earnings release Tuesday. "I do believe we have some exciting announcements in the coming years on how we could play a larger role on this whole idea of the tokenization and digitization of our assets," Fink said. Fink said that he sees digital asset — a market currently worth over $4.5 trillion — growing "significantly" over the next few years. BlackRock was among the firsts to issue spot-based bitcoin BTC$111,725.38 and ether ETH$4,044.48 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., and are the largest products of their kind with $93 billion and $17 billion in assets under management (AUM), respectively. The asset manager is also behind the largest tokenized money market fund on the market, the $2.8 billion BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) issued with tokenization specialist Securitize and available across various blockchains including Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche. BlackRock led Securitize's $47 million fundraising round last year betting on tokenization gaining traction. BlackRock's AUM grew to $13.4 trillion in the third quarter of the year, up from $11.4 trillion in the previous year. The firm reported $61 million in revenue from its digital asset products, only a fraction of the company's total revenue of $6.5 billion, per the earnings release. BlackRock shares traded around 1.5% higher during morning trading on Tuesday.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. BlackRock 3.0 is starting to take shape — revenues from its private markets businesses are outpacing fees coming in from its fixed-income mainstays. Despite its world-beating iShares ETF line hitting new highs in the third quarter of 2025, managing more than $5 trillion in assets after record net inflows of more than $150 billion, it's not what the firm's leadership is excited about. Instead, CEO Larry Fink and his team are giddy about subscriptions and a business unit that represents less than 3% of its overall asset base. The firm spent more than $27 billion to acquire private-credit giant HPS, infrastructure investor Global Infrastructure Partners, and private-markets data player Preqin, with the final deal — its $12 billion, all-equity purchase of HPS — closing at the start of the third quarter. Since the GIP deal closed on October 1 of last year, revenues from private market funds and tech subscriptions, including Preqin and BlackRock's existing risk analytics platform Aladdin, have outpaced those from fixed-income funds and ETFs —once the firm's bread and butter — each quarter, and the gap is only going to grow. The firm added roughly $105 billion in private market assets last quarter, thanks to more than $100 billion from HPS. The addition of the private credit business to BlackRock's coffers has helped fuel a 136% growth in fees from private market funds through the first three quarters of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Martin Small, the firm's chief financial officer, said that even without Preqin, tech services revenue is up 12% year-over-year. "I've never been more excited about the future of BlackRock," said Fink, speaking on Tuesday's earnings call. Just as BlackRock, with $13.5 trillion in assets, rode the passive-investing wave in the 2010s to become more than a fixed-income investment manager, the firm has shifted its focus to the lucrative private markets, where fees are higher, capital is stickier, and 401(k) money may soon flood in. This isn't to say the firm has turned away from bond investing. Last quarter, fixed-income funds attracted tens of billions of new capital, and the firm has more than $3 trillion in products focused on the asset class. But BlackRock is focused on where institutional capital is flowing, and Fink and Small spoke Tuesday about the extended conversations the HPS team is having with their insurance clients. GIP raised the largest infrastructure fund ever this summer, at more than $25 billion. "The depth and breadth of BlackRock's global platform," as Fink described the firm's many offerings, is spreading even further. Your daily guide to what's moving markets — straight to your inbox.

Title: ‘Fund The AI Arms Race’—Elon Musk Is Quietly Backing Bitcoin And Issued A ‘Fake Fiat Currency’ Dollar Warning

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Elon Musk, the Tesla billionaire who fell out with U.S. president Donald Trump over his $37 trillion debt-raising tax and spend bill, has once again quietly signaled his support of bitcoin—even as a serious bitcoin price warning light flashes red. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Bitcoin has swung wildly this week as the gold price soars and stock markets plunge on fears Trump could reignite the smoldering U.S. trade war with China, with a bitcoin price "flash crash" over the weekend sparking a serious BlackRock warning. Now, Musk, who has said his new political party would support bitcoin over the U.S. dollar, has praised bitcoin for being "based on energy" and agreed the bitcoin price has soared amid dollar "debasement" designed "to fund the AI arms race." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run "AI is the new global arms race, and capex will eventually be funded by governments (U.S. and China). If you want to know why gold/silver/bitcoin is soaring, it’s the 'debasement’ to fund the AI arms race," the ZeroHedge X account posted, adding: “But you can't print energy.” Musk responded, saying: “True," and adding: "That is why bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy.” In recent months, the “debasement trade” betting against traditional currencies like the dollar and betting on “hard” assets like gold, silver and bitcoin has taken off, with traders pushing gold, silver and the bitcoin price to record highs. Musk, who has said he personally holds bitcoin, ethereum and the meme-based dogecoin, also agreed with a reply to his post that said, “dogecoin is also based on energy.” Bitcoin, which is secured by a network of so-called miners who use powerful computers to validate transactions in return for newly issued bitcoin, uses as much electricity each year as some small countries, with its energy demands climbing along with its price as more miners join the network. Musk, who helped Trump back into the White House with campaign rallies and warnings over the spiraling U.S. debt pile that passed $37 trillion this year, dramatically fell out with Trump after he failed to rein in government spending, while Musk’s own department of government efficiency (Doge) initiative has so far failed to make the multi-trillion dollar savings it originally promised. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Musk’s support for bitcoin and crypto has waned from its Covid-era peak, though Musk has continued to give backing to bitcoin, as well as his "favorite" cryptocurrency dogecoin. Following his White House exit, Musk said his America Party would favor bitcoin over the U.S. dollar, with Musk branding the dollar and other non-asset backed currencies as “hopeless.” Disquiet over so-called fiat currencies has grow in the years following the huge 2008 financial crisis bailouts that directly led to the creation of bitcoin and then Covid lockdown stimulus measures that flooded the economy with trillions of freshly printed dollars. Government stimulus and supply chain disrupting lockdowns sparked massive global inflation, which some fear has put the U.S. dollar into "death spiral" as the Federal Reserve is forced to create more dollars to pay off interest on its existing debt.

Title: Markets Set For Lower Open As China Conflict Continues

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks rebounded Monday but poised to open lower Tuesday as the trade conflict with China continues. Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 have dipped 1%, Nasdaq 100 futures are 1.2% lower and Dow Jones futures are down 0.6%. The back-and-forth of stock prices tracks with the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs after China restricted the export of rare earth minerals last week. Trump then walked back his aggressive tone, assuring the public in a Truth Social post that the trade disagreement was resolvable. Tuesday, China sanctioned five U.S. subsidiaries of a South Korean shipmaker. After trade tensions flared last week, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiked to $21.99 from $17.09. The index retreated to a still-elevated level of $19.03 before eclipsing $21 again. The VIX Index quantifies market expectations for near-term volatility, based on S&P 500 option prices. On the inflation front, a new analysis by Goldman Sachs concludes that U.S. tariffs will raise prices by year-end. According to a research note summarized by the LA Times, analysts said U.S. consumers will probably absorb 55% of tariff costs while American companies pay 22%. Only 18% of tariff costs were projected to hit foreign exporters. If the projections prove accurate, the Federal Reserve’s job of stimulating jobs while managing inflation could get complicated. Earnings season begins Tuesday with scheduled reports from JPMorgan Chase, Johnson & Johnson, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Blackrock, and others. Third quarter reports will demonstrate how corporate profits are trending amid the unique circumstances in 2025. Themes to watch include: What is a good P/S ratio? The price-to-sales or P/S ratio is a metric investors use to evaluate a company’s stock price. It is particularly useful for companies that aren’t profitable because you can calculate it without positive earnings. Like the P/E ratio, the P/S requires context to interpret. A low P/S ratio could mean the company is undervalued or that investors are not confident in the company’s future. A high P/S indicates investors are willing to pay more for the company’s sales—which is good when the company lives into the optimism, and bad when it does not. You can calculate the P/S ratio as the company’s market capitalization divided by its revenue over the last 12 months. Alternatively, you can calculate a forward P/S ratio as the company’s market capitalization divided by its expected revenue over the next 12 months. The two calculations quantify what investors are willing to pay for $1 of the company’s previous or expected sales. The P/S ratio is most valuable in comparisons. You can compare a P/S ratio to: Lower P/S ratios are generally associated with lower growth expectations, while higher P/S ratios imply more optimistic growth expectations. And this makes sense: The standard P/S calculation uses a sales figure that’s already happened, but investors make trading decisions on their future predictions. If investors expect next year’s sales to be, say, 50% higher, they’ll accept a higher stock price. Mathematically, a higher stock price increases the market capitalization which raises the P/S ratio. This is why fast-growing industries, like technology, have higher P/S ratios than more predictable industries such as utilities. Value investors prefer P/S ratios below 1 or no higher than 2, assuming the company has a fundamentally productive business model and healthy balance sheet. Growth investors tolerate or even gravitate towards higher P/S ratios because they can signal outperformance relative to peers. These P/S ratios as of Oct. 10, 2025, demonstrate how this metric can vary dramatically by business and industry. The average P/S ratio of the S&P 500 is 3.17.

Title: Aptos cofounder, early employees raise $50 million for crypto fund Maximum Frequency Ventures
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/10/14/maximum-frequency-ventures-mo-shaikh-aptos-labs-50m-fundraise/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T12:30:00Z
Full Content:
Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. The veteran crypto founder Mo Shaikh isn’t afraid to be brash. When asked why his new venture capital firm was called Maximum Frequency, or MF, Ventures, he said the name was a “nice play on letters.” Which letters? The same ones for “motherf–ker,” he implied, laughing. “It kind of takes that level of grind and focus to really be a founder,” he told Fortune. In other words, to be a great founder requires “f–k you” energy. On Tuesday, Shaikh, the cofounder of the well-known blockchain development company Aptos Labs, announced that he and three former colleagues had raised $50 million for a new venture fund that will focus on crypto companies. “We want to help each founder hit their maximum frequency,” he said. Once a novelty in venture capital, crypto-focused funds are now commonplace, and Maximum Frequency will join a landscape defined by the likes of Paradigm, Dragonfly, and Haun Ventures, among others. Shaikh’s three other cofounders are Neil Harounian, the first employee Shaikh hired at Aptos Labs and the startup’s former head of ecosystem; Alexandre Tang, the former head of APAC institutions at Aptos Labs; and Jerome Ong, the former APAC ecosystem lead. While Shaikh wouldn’t disclose from whom he had raised the money, he did say the fund’s limited partners include family offices in the U.S., East Asia, and Southeast Asia. The four cofounders have also put their own money into the fund, Shaikh said, declining to specify how much. “We do have skin in the game,” he said. The new company comes amid a sluggish period for crypto venture capital. Despite soaring prices for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, venture investments in crypto dropped 55% to $6.8 billion from the first to second quarter of this year, according to data from Pitchbook. And VCs more broadly are struggling to raise new capital. The sector raised $50 billion from limited partners in the first half of 2025. That puts the venture capital industry on a much slower pace than 2024, when it raised nearly $190 billion over the entire year, per Pitchbook. Still, the four cofounders of Maximum Frequency Ventures believe they can fight the headwinds. Shaikh is a crypto and finance veteran. He started his career at financial behemoths like the accounting firm KPMG and the asset manager BlackRock. In 2020, he landed a gig at Meta to work on strategic partnerships for the social media giant’s now-scuttled blockchain project. In late 2021, shortly before Meta publicly gave up on its crypto ambitions, the Big Tech giant gave Shaikh and his colleague Avery Ching its blessing to use Meta’s proprietary software to launch a high-speed blockchain, which the two dubbed Aptos. The project was a venture darling, and the duo raised more than $400 million for their company Aptos Labs, according to data from Pitchbook. But, after about three years at the startup, Shaikh stepped down as CEO in December and Ching took his place. While Shaikh initially said he was stepping away to focus on “a new chapter,” he didn’t specify in any more detail why he was leaving. He declined to comment further to Fortune. Aptos continues to be one of the major blockchains and its cryptocurrency has a market capitalization of nearly $3 billion. Shaikh and his cofounders are now focused on building and supporting companies along with other founders. And it’s their background working at a high-profile startup they believe will separate them from other crypto VCs, said Shaikh and cofounder Neil Harounian. “There aren’t really any funds in crypto that incubate,” added Harounian. As opposed to other VCs who, they argue, passively write checks into startups, the four cofounders will actively work with founders to build out their businesses—and even start companies in house. So far, Maximum Frequency Ventures has deployed $5 million into six startups, Shaikh said. While the crypto venture firm hasn’t yet announced the deals, he said the founders they’ve backed are geographically diverse, from Texas to Abu Dhabi to South Korea. The team has specifically focused on looking for founders in Asia as opposed to only in the U.S., said Shaikh. “We’re very hands on. We’re very active,” he said. “It’s a quality game, not a quantity game.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Elizabeth Warren: Leftism for Thee But Not Me

Full Content:
When Sen. Elizabeth A. Warren recently traveled to the Big Apple to endorse New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, she was asked if overt socialism is really the best model for Democrats to adopt. “You bet,” she replied in her signature folksy style. The Boston lawmaker wasn’t just jumping on the sudden trendiness of socialism three-and-a-half decades after its near-extinction. With fellow Senate traveler Bernie Sanders, Warren has been a catalyst for moving her party to the left since her first campaign in 2012. She and Sanders are, in many ways, the godparents of the self-avowed Democratic Socialists such as Mamdani and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are providing the youthful energy for the Democrats in the Trump era. As Warren’s attacks on Wall Street and the wealthy are gaining even wider traction among liberals – a recent Gallup poll found 66% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism – the apparent contradictions between her public economic positions and private financial decisions are receiving new scrutiny, particularly as the one-time presidential candidate appears to be testing those waters again. Charity Doesn’t Begin at Home Financial records examined by RealClearInvestigations show that Warren has hardly followed the path of socialism in her personal finances. Start with the redistribution of wealth. Warren tirelessly bashes the “selfish” and “greedy” rich for not paying their “fair share,” and demands the government step in and redistribute their income to the poor. But charity does not always begin in the Warren home. While Warren hauls in nearly $1 million a year, she donated less than 3% of her household income to charity in 2024, according to her tax returns. This is much less than the charity of the Obamas, for instance, who typically donate more than 20% of their earnings to the needy and philanthropic causes, and low for the average American in her income bracket, studies show. The average millionaire donates more than twice her share. It also appears that Warren opens her pocketbook wider when she’s running for national office and under a bigger media microscope. The $26,669 in charitable deductions Warren reported on her tax returns last year pales in comparison to the $81,858, or 9% of income, she reported as she launched her campaign for the White House in 2020. And the outspoken Democratic leader keeps her own tax burden down while calling for higher taxes on “millionaires and billionaires.” Records show Warren is not averse to taking maximum advantage of provisions in a tax code she denounces as unfair. She has, for example, written off used articles of clothing on her taxes and has had to correct past returns for inflating the value of those items. She’s also written off thousands of dollars in used books – and even in-flight WiFi to expense down business income. And she would exempt herself from her proposed “Ultra-Millionaire Tax,” which levies a surtax on those with a net worth above $50 million. With a net worth of at least $8 million (with estimates as high as $12 million), Warren has benefited handsomely from free market capitalism – even as she has spent most of her career in the public and educational sectors. Fat Cat Investments Despite her frequent complaints that “the wealthiest 10% of U.S. households own 84% of American-held shares” of stock, she has invested the bulk of her money in stocks and bonds managed by Wall Street investment funds. These accounts are valued at between $1.9 million and $6.8 million, according to her most recent Senate financial disclosures, filed in April. (Values are given as ranges in the disclosure reports that members of Congress are required to file each year.) Although Warren has rarely traded individual stocks, records show the mutual funds where she has parked her millions – Vanguard and TIAA-CREF – hold a number of companies in industries that Warren has demonized, including Big Oil, Big Tech, and Big Pharma. Through these funds, for example, Warren has invested in Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA; Exxon and Shell; Wells Fargo; Goldman Sachs; Monsanto; Johnson & Johnson; and even NewsCorp – the owner of conservative Fox News and the New York Post. Nevertheless, Warren has ripped “fat cat bankers” at Wells Fargo for preying on minority homebuyers and customers with “predatory” rates and “junk” fees, and also for “screwing” their own employees. She even demanded the Federal Reserve revoke Wells Fargo’s status as a financial holding company over “abusive and unlawful” practices. Warren has called for regulators to break up tech giants Amazon and Apple, which she claims are running monopolies. “I’m sick of freeloading [tech] billionaires” who “roll over everyone,” she recently said. Warren has described Exxon as a “bad actor” that contributes to global warming. She’s even accused the energy giant of “corporate perjury” by publicly denying its alleged role in warming and producing “fake research” to “mislead the American people about climate change.” The senator has also slammed Exxon for “imposing massive price increases on Americans [sic] families,” arguing “this corporate greed is inexcusable.” Environmental activist groups have called on her chosen retirement fund, TIAA, to divest from Exxon, along with the rest of its more than $78 billion in oil, gas, and coal assets, according to a recent estimate by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. They argue the fund is using contributions from investors like Warren to “destroy communities and the environment.” Last year, Warren bashed Donald Trump for capitulating to the oil industry. “Donald Trump has a deal for Big Oil: if they raise $1 billion and send him back to the White House, he’ll gut environmental protections and roll back Joe Biden’s progress in fighting climate change,” she asserted on X. “It’s corruption, pure and simple. And it would be a disaster for our planet.” Exempting Some Millionaires Slamming the president’s “Big Beautiful Bill” earlier this year, Warren complained, “Trump’s tax cuts stand to benefit (the) highest income earners.” She would know – she’s one of them. The $919,583 in household income Warren reported on her 2024 tax return she filed jointly with her husband puts her in the top 1% of highest-earning Americans. The year before she entered the Senate, Warren reported earning $616,181. The lawmaker’s base Senate salary of $174,000 accounts for just one-fifth of the total income she reported to the IRS. The rest comes from book royalties, dividends, capital gains, earned interest, retirement income, and her husband Bruce Mann’s salary as a tenured Harvard professor. The Senate is often described as a Millionaire’s Club, and she fits right in: Her $8 million net worth would rank her as the 18th wealthiest member of the Senate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Warren’s net worth has risen each year since she was first elected to the Senate in 2012, while the median wealth of senators overall has declined, according to the think tank. Although Warren is just one of many millionaires in Congress, government watchdogs note her wealth is at odds with the stridency of her class-warfare rhetoric. “Elizabeth Warren poses as the champion of the underdog, but her policies strip middle- and lower-income Americans of opportunities to advance their lot and build wealth,” said John Berlau, director of finance policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, referring to her calls for more taxes and financial red tape. “By pursuing policies that keep others from moving up, Sen. Warren has emerged as an unlikely champion of the existing 1%.” Warren did not reply to requests for comment. Critics note that several of Warren’s former staff members have moved on to positions in the sectors she decries. In 2023, she declared, “The abuse of the revolving door is appalling,” particularly in the financial sector, which she claims is “rigged to help the wealthy and well-connected.” But records show her own office has served as a revolving door for the banks. For example, Wally Adeyemo, who served as her chief of staff when she was standing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, went on to work as a senior adviser at investment giant BlackRock. At least six other Warren staffers who worked in her Senate office have worked as lobbyists, records show. In addition, several of her senior campaign aides have worked on K Street. “There is a history of a revolving door of Warren staffers and protégés at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau taking jobs at big Wall Street firms, such as BlackRock,” Berlau said. Restrictive Neighborhoods Home ownership is also key to wealth-building, but zoning restrictions often price the working class out of homes. Warren has fought against so-called NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) rules and has fiercely advocated for building more affordable housing in cities. She even backs Mamdani’s “social housing” proposal to let the New York state government seize private properties and convert them into public housing. However, Warren has chosen to live in affluent neighborhoods in Boston and D.C. that are heavily zoned to exclude the construction of new housing units and price out the average homebuyer. Public financial statements do not disclose the 76-year-old legislator’s real estate holdings, but other records show she owns at least two homes valued at more than $5 million. Her primary residence is located in the leafy Avon Hill section of Cambridge, Mass., which has enforced a century-old zoning system of minimum lot sizes, minimum parking requirements, floor area ratios, limits on units per building, and height restrictions. The restrictions have yielded a housing shortage in the city that has driven up the value of existing homes – including Warren’s 1876 Victorian mansion, which has risen eightfold to an estimated $4 million since she bought it in 1995. Records show she and her husband owe no mortgage on their nearly 4,000-square-foot home, which features three stories, high ceilings, marble mantels, hardwood floors, and a four-car garage. The median price for a home in Cambridge now tops $2.2 million. “The astronomical increase in the value of Warren’s home, and home prices in Cambridge more generally, has not happened in a vacuum,” said Scott Van Voorhis, a Boston real estate analyst. “The city’s special blend of upscale NIMBYism and restrictive zoning laws and regulations kept new house, condo and apartment construction to a trickle at best, even as demand for living in the city increased leaps and bounds.” Though the Cambridge city council earlier this year loosened its zoning ordinances to permit more housing across the city, Warren’s neighborhood remains largely exempt from reforms. That’s because Avon Hill is a conservation district further regulated by the Cambridge Historical Commission. Records show Warren’s street and home are located within the historic district, which protects old Victorians from being torn down for multifamily housing. That makes her neighborhood the ultimate safe NIMBY zone. “Nothing has been built [in her neighborhood] for decades beyond the occasional mansion upgrade,” Van Voorhis noted. Warren clearly understands there is a housing supply problem in Boston. In July, she helped shepherd the ROAD to Housing Act through the Senate, which, among other things, would provide grants to communities that change their land-use rules to make it easier to build new housing units. “We have a real problem here in Massachusetts that we simply don’t have enough housing,” Warren explained to the Boston Globe, noting the state is about 200,000 units short of what is needed. “If we don’t start building more housing here, the housing crisis will continue to intensify.” But when it comes to her own neighborhood – one of the least affordable in the state – she remains silent. Cambridge council members noted they didn’t hear “a peep” from Warren when they were recently debating zoning reforms to deal with the city’s growing housing affordability crisis. In 2013, when Warren bought her home in Washington, D.C., she also happened to select an area of the capital city where zoning restrictions have entrenched the status quo. Valued at more than $1 million, her condo is in the trendy Penn Quarter section of D.C., which is a historic area protected by land-use rules. Dubious Identity Politics Most famously, Warren’s personal decisions seem at odds with the left’s leavening of traditional socialist positions with identity politics. Before moving to the Senate, Warren was a tenured professor at Harvard with a lucrative salary. Although the school denies that her claims to Native American ancestry influenced their decision to hire her, she and the administration trumpeted her diverse background. Warren also listed herself as a racial minority in a legal directory distributed by the Association of American Law Schools and was listed as a Native American in federal forms filed by Harvard Law School. When she launched her political career in 2012 and released a memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” Warren described her alleged “Native American roots” as a Cherokee. Henry Holt & Company paid her a $525,000 advance for the book, which became a national bestseller that still earns her royalties. She also helped publish a cookbook, “Pow Wow Chow,” exploiting the myth of her native American lineage. Warren took in $430,000 a year as a tenured Harvard Law professor by claiming a Native American heritage – even as she has railed against whites appropriating minority culture or pretending to understand minority experiences. But, as she ramped up her run for the White House, Warren responded to persistent challenges of this claim by taking a DNA test. In late 2018, her campaign maintained it showed “strong evidence” of Native American ancestry dating back generations. When that failed to quiet her critics, Warren basically had to acknowledge that the test revealed that she is as little as 1/1024th Native American, making her less of that ancestry than the average white American. She also eventually apologized to the Cherokee Nation in 2019. The year before that admission, however, she lectured others during her Senate campaign about stolen valor: “It is wrong and cowardly for people to make fraudulent statements in order to receive distinctions that they have not earned. We need to ensure that no one can benefit from making false claims and steal the true valor of the courageous.” “If there ever were a genuine case of cultural appropriation, Sen. Warren is guilty of it,” said Gad Saad, a business professor at Concordia University. “She literally appropriated Native American culture as her own by constructing a false narrative about her ancestry.” “And yet,” he added, “she benefited for several decades from this false narrative both in her academic and political career.” Saad and others who have closely followed her career suggest the progressive senator appears to have a “good for me, but not for thee” ethic when it comes to her own personal ambitions. Though she’s carefully groomed a reputation as a fighter for the “have-nots” against the “haves,” the record shows that, outside the spotlight, she has often pursued her own interests and followed the path of the haves.

Resilient consumer spending despite higher borrowing costs helped sustain the US economic momentum, fuelling gains in equity markets and prompting investors to pour money back into lower-cost index strategies. A cooling labour market and moderating inflation pushed the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September - its first reduction this year - while expectations of further easing later in 2025 fuelled strong inflows into BlackRock's fixed-income exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This inflow helped the firm offset softer performance fees and higher costs linked to the acquisition of alternative asset manager HPS Investment Partners. BlackRock's assets under management rose to $13.46 trillion in the quarter, up from $11.48 trillion a year earlier. Long-term net inflows totalled about $171 billion, led by continued strength in its ETF business, which remains the firm's key driver of organic growth. The world's largest asset manager reported adjusted earnings of $1.91 billion, or $11.55 per share, for the three months to September 30, up from $1.72 billion, or $11.46 per share, a year earlier.

Title: Trump’s 401(k) Bitcoin Order: What It Means For Your Retirement Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2025/10/14/trumps-401k-bitcoin-order-what-it-means-for-your-retirement-portfolio/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByTonya M. Evans, Contributor. When BlackRock CEO Larry Fink calls something “the domain of money launderers and thieves,” market experts pay attention. So, on Sunday, October 12, when he referred to bitcoin by telling CBS’s “60 Minutes” host, Lesley Stahl, that “markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions,” the reversal was notable. Although, given Blackrock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund impressive performance data, the change of heart was also not surprising. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) became the fastest fund ever to reach $10 billion in assets after launching in January 2024. Now it holds nearly $100 billion, more than any other ETF in BlackRock's 1,000-plus fund lineup. But Fink’s new optimism about digital assets isn’t coincidental; it actually mirrors that of President Donald Trump’s August 7, 2025 executive order, which explicitly opened 401(k) plans to “holdings in actively managed investment vehicles that are investing in digital assets.” The order's logic is straightforward: wealthy Americans and government workers access alternative investments through pension plans, but 90 million Americans in employer-sponsored retirement plans don't. “My Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation risk that impede American workers' retirement accounts from achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement,” the order states. The 2025 State of the Crypto Holders Report from the National Cryptocurrency Association found that 76% of users say crypto has had a positive impact on their lives, underscoring its move from niche experiment to mainstream asset class. For the 55 million Americans already using crypto, the question isn’t whether digital assets belong in portfolios, it is merely how to access these assets safely. Yet this rise in crypto adoption comes amid a systematic weakening of fiduciary-duty standards and oversight mechanisms that once protected U.S. retirement savers from high-risk products. This leaves investors to navigate a rapidly expanding market with fewer regulatory guardrails. Ironically, financial innovations like Bitcoin and blockchain technology may themselves offer some of the transparency and accountability that lawmakers and regulators have struggled to provide by law. That’s the benefit of using public, distributed ledgers. CNBC anchor and New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin is deeply concerned about the too-big-to-continue climate the stock market is in. Sorkin told “60 Minutes” this week that he sees disturbing parallels of today’s market to America's worst crash. “I’m anxious we are at prices that may not feel sustainable,” Sorkin said, adding that we’re either “living through some kind of remarkable boom" or "reliving 1929.” As Sorkin explains in his book “1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History – and How It Shattered a Nation,” Wall Street “democratized” stock investing right before the 1929 crash by letting buyers purchase with 10% down, borrowing the rest from brokers. “It was all wrapped in the flag of democratizing access,” Sorkin explained. “In good times it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook in a very bad way.” Now that the Trump administration is taking a more lenient approach to consumer protections, the parallels are stark. “There’s speculation in the market today, there’s an increasing amount of debt, and all of that’s happening against the backdrop of the guard rails coming off,” Sorkin wrote. For most Americans, those guardrails are not abstract—they protect the only wealth they have. According to 2022 data from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finance and analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, approximately two-thirds of U.S. household wealth is concentrated in two asset categories: primary residences and employer-sponsored retirement accounts. The executive order acknowledges this tension, promising to “curb ERISA litigation that constrains fiduciaries’ ability to apply their best judgment.” Critics hear 1920s deregulation. Supporters hear removal of paternalistic barriers preventing working Americans from accessing investments available to the wealthy. Americans approaching retirement are caught in the middle—and skeptical. In fact, a recent Boldin survey of over 1,000 Americans found that nearly half oppose adding alternative assets like crypto to their 401(k)s, only about one-third support the idea, and roughly 80% say they’re unlikely to invest any portion of their retirement savings in such assets. However, there is a critical difference between 1929’s bubble and the 2025 bitcoin bull market: Bitcoin was born out of the 2008 crisis and designed to (among other things) address the same systemic vulnerabilities Sorkin fears. On January 3, 2009, Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto embedded a message in the Genesis Block: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” It wasn’t random, it was a timestamp and philosophical statement about why Bitcoin needed to exist. While governments rescued failing banks with taxpayer money, Nakamoto proposed an alternative: a monetary system with no central authority to bail out, no fractional reserve banking to collapse, no ‘too big to fail’ institutions. Bitcoin wasn't created to ride boom cycles. It was created to survive—and provide an alternative during—the exact breakdowns Sorkin describes. Fixed supply vs. credit expansion. The 1929 crash stemmed partly from unconstrained credit creation. Bitcoin's protocol enforces a hard cap of 21 million coins—no authority can “print” more to bail out failing entities. Transparent settlement vs. opacity. 1929 exposed massive hidden leverage and counterparty failures. Bitcoin settles transparently every ten minutes with no trading halts or ability for authorities to freeze markets during panics. Equal access vs. gatekeeping. Sorkin rightly warns about retail investors accessing opaque private equity deals. Bitcoin offers radically equal access—the same blockchain data available to BlackRock is available to every investor. No insider information. Self-custody option vs. mandatory intermediation. Unlike 1929's stock certificates held by brokers who could face insolvency, Bitcoin enables self-custody—eliminating counterparty risk entirely. The executive order’s inclusion of digital assets isn’t comparable to credit-fueled stock speculation. As head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management, Gerry O’Shea told Reuters: “Bitcoin has moved beyond its early days as a merely speculative asset and is slowly entering into many investors' long-term investment strategy. This EO will help accelerate this trend.” The industry response has been bullish. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz called the executive order's potential impact “a monster pool of capital,” telling CNBC it represents a widening of avenues “for bringing more people into the tent” of crypto adoption. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was equally emphatic, following his company’s May 2025 inclusion in the S&P 500, he told Yahoo Finance: “Crypto is here to stay. It's going to be a part of everyone's 401(k).” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse advocates for diversified crypto exposure in institutional portfolios. “I own XRP, BTC, and ETH, among a handful of others—we live in a multichain world, and I’ve advocated for a level-playing field instead of one token versus another,” Garlinghouse posted on X. His multichain philosophy aligns with emerging retirement product development. As Grayscale’s diversified crypto ETF filing demonstrates, institutional investors increasingly recognize that different digital assets serve different purposes, bitcoin as digital gold and ether for decentralized applications and smart contracts, for example. A sophisticated ecosystem is emerging that balances access with safeguards: Whether this represents breakthrough or breakdown depends on execution, not on Bitcoin’s software protocol, which has proven resilient for 17 years and counting. But whether fiduciaries implement prudent limits and regulators deliver promised clarity by early 2026. Sorkin's 1929 warning carries weight. But the opacity and leverage that fueled that collapse are precisely what Bitcoin's architecture eliminates: transparent settlement, no fractional reserves, no hidden counterparty risk. The real danger isn't Bitcoin—it's whether fiduciaries treat it as speculation rather than strategic hedge, and whether promised regulatory safeguards materialize or stall. Trump's executive order opened the door. How fiduciaries and investors walk through it will determine whether we are witnessing democratization or simply repeating 1929’s grave errors with more sophisticated technology.

The complete blockchain overhaul of financial markets could happen in the next two decades, according to experts. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com Compared to the 6 million years it took for our ape-like ancestors to become modern-day humans, financial markets are evolving at lightning speed. Pretty soon, it won’t just be crypto that’s trading on the blockchain, but all assets and products — stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, alternatives and more — that will be tokenized, making transactions quicker, cheaper and more transparent. “By the time all assets are tokenized becomes a reality, [it will] probably be 10, 15, 20 years from now,” David Abner, Northern Trust head of global ETFs and funds, said at a recent Financial Times conference. So how do we actually get there? Tokenization is expected to be a two-step process. First is putting already established financial products like ETFs on the blockchain. “The token products today, at least from the more mainstream firms, live in both worlds of traditional finance and decentralized finance,” said Karan Sood, CEO of asset manager Vest. The next step is tokenizing the underlying assets of those products, which will require a regulatory framework. “There’s been a big question mark, especially with the last administration, whether there was alignment to support the development of token and decentralized finance in general,” Sood told Advisor Upside. “Even though we don’t have any specific regulation just yet, the [Trump] administration’s posturing seems very supportive.” Major firms have already started on steps 1 and 2: Currently, the real-world asset tokenization market is about $24 billion in size. While that figure may sound relatively small, it represents 380% growth in the past three years, and it’s projected to reach an eye-popping $30 trillion by 2034, according to Standard Chartered. Crunch the numbers on that, and you get about 125,000% growth. That’s a lot, by the way. The key to greater acceptance may be using them in more traditional products, like mutual funds and ETFs. The consumer segment has eluded Goldman for years. Could this time be different? Competing financial priorities and rising costs of living threaten to replace retirement as an economic reality for upcoming generations. Tax-law and human behavior are complicated, but there’s a method to mitigating past investment mistakes. Performance gaps underscore the critical need for continued human oversight in financial decision-making. Early career advisors discuss what they need to succeed and how their generation thinks about finances. Allocations today have a striking resemblance to where they stood in 2023, according to new Goldman Sachs data. Investing $1 billion in T. Rowe may be more efficient for Goldman than building out its own channel. AI can now draft marketing materials in advisors’ tone of voice and writing style. Whether advisors want that is an open question. After several funds from the startup Yieldstreet resulted in total losses, experts questioned the role of private investments in client portfolios. The industry isn’t sweating the new research as clients largely prefer bespoke plans from actual humans. There is growing demand for private market allocations, especially among less wealthy clients who historically haven’t had access to them. © 2025 The Daily Upside

NEW DELHI: Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) have begun the sale process for Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP)-owned Vena Global Group Pte Ltd’s Indian renewable energy platform, Vena Energy India, in a deal having an enterprise value of around $1 billion, according to two people familiar with the development. The deal comes amid a steady flow of global capital into India’s clean energy market. The sale, code-named Project Indigo, marks Global Infrastructure Partners’ full exit from its bet on Vena Energy. The sale process was formally launched this month. GIP itself was acquired by BlackRock Inc. in October last year. Vena Energy India operates 957 megawatts (MW) of renewable power assets, with another 59 MW under construction. GIP, along with CIC Capital Corp. (CIC Capital) and Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments), had acquired Singapore-based renewable energy developer Equis Energy for $5 billion in October 2017. The acquisition included $1.3 billion in liabilities and Equis’s Indian portfolio, which comprised green energy platforms Energon and Energon Soleq. The assets were later rebranded as Vena Energy and structured as a corporate platform in Singapore. “Vena Energy projects have a weighted average residual power purchase agreement (PPA) of 17 years, with a ₹4.5 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) or per unit weighted average tariff," said one of the two people cited above requesting anonymity. Vena Energy has been active in India for over a decade through its earlier avatar Equis Energy. Its portfolio includes an advanced pipeline of 1.25 gigawatts (GW) of solar and wind projects and 752 megawatt-hours (MWh) of battery energy storage systems (BESS). It also has 1.46 GW of early- to mid-stage solar and wind projects under development and 100 MWh of additional BESS capacity. Spokespersons for GIP and MUFG declined to comment. A PSP Investments spokesperson said in an emailed response, “Our policy is to not comment on market rumours or speculation. We will therefore not participate in the story." Queries emailed to representatives of Vena Global Group, Morgan Stanley, and CIC Capital on Sunday night went unanswered at press time. Green energy dealmaking surgesIndia’s renewable energy sector has been driving merger and acquisition activity, accounting for about $8.5 billion worth of deals, roughly 80% of all power sector transactions, in the first half of the current fiscal year, according to EY. The report noted that India now counts over 60 marquee global investors in its green energy space. “In Asia Pacific, India stands out as a dynamic market, with energy security and ambitious clean-energy targets (backed by government initiatives in renewables, battery storage and green hydrogen) creating a favourable environment for M&A activity," wrote PwC in its 2025 mid-year outlook report. “Asia Pacific continues to focus on investments to meet ambitious clean-energy targets, as well as investments in electrification and critical mineral supply chains. For example, in India, goals to hit 500 GW non-fossil fuel-based energy generation and 61 GW/336 GWh of energy storage targets by 2030 are driving M&A activity in renewables, green energy and electric vehicles," the PwC report said. The momentum is underpinned by India’s rapid capacity expansion. The country’s installed renewable energy capacity stands at 245 GW, with solar and wind contributing 116 GW and 52 GW, respectively. India aims to add 50 GW of new capacity annually to reach 500 GW by 2030, 1,800 GW by 2047, and 5,000 GW by 2070 as part of its net-zero roadmap. India accounted for 5.6% of the record 306 terawatt-hours (TWh) of global solar generation growth in the first half of 2025, which rose 31% year-on-year, according to think tank Ember. “Examples of recent notable transactions in this space include JSW Neo Energy’s acquisition of the 4.6 GW O2 portfolio and ONGC NTPC Green’s 4.1 GW Ayana platform deal," the PwC report said. Investor appetite for operational and under-construction assets is strong, with hybrid models gaining traction. Government support is expected to drive further M&A energy and infrastructure activity across the region. Two examples of this supportive policy environment include the Indian government’s initiative to integrate biogas into the national gas grid and its recent revision of the Domestic Content Requirement policy to boost domestic solar cell manufacturing, it added. Recent deal activity underscores the growing investor interest. European alternative asset manager EQT, for instance, dropped plans to sell renewable developer Zelestra’s India business, transferring it instead to its Asia-Pacific infrastructure arm led by Hong Kong-based partner Ken Wong. EQT will invest around $600 million to expand the portfolio and has appointed Parag Sharma—former CEO and founder of EQT- and Temasek-backed O2 Power—as Zelestra’s new chief executive, replacing Sajay K.V. In another deal, Nasdaq-listed ReNew Energy Global Plc agreed to sell 300 MW of solar assets to Singapore’s Sembcorp Industries Ltd, valuing the equity and enterprise at around $100 million and $190 million, respectively. Sembcorp, along with Torrent Power Ltd, Inox Green Energy Services Ltd (of the INOXGFL Group), and General Atlantic-owned Actis LLP, is also among the shortlisted bidders for Macquarie Asset Management’s Green Investment Group (GIG) platform, Vibrant Energy. The transaction—code-named Project Notos—is valued at around $600 million. Also Read | India needs to fix $1.5-tn green finance gap.

Title: BlackRock purchases $60M worth of Bitcoin

Share this article BlackRock clients purchased around $60 million worth of Bitcoin on Monday, continuing the asset management firm’s accumulation during market volatility. BlackRock, a major asset management firm, has been facilitating client investments in Bitcoin through its spot ETF products. The purchase reflects institutional resilience amid recent market dips. BlackRock has been the sole issuer adding Bitcoin to its holdings during recent periods of price volatility, positioning itself as a key player in long-term crypto adoption. The investment pattern represents a broader trend of wealth transfer from retail sellers to Wall Street accumulators. BlackRock clients, including institutional and retail investors, continue stacking Bitcoin through the firm’s products even in non-surging markets. This sustained accumulation by BlackRock clients could intensify future rallies as selling pressure from retail investors eases, according to market observers tracking institutional Bitcoin adoption patterns.

Title: World's Largest Asset Manager Believes Bitcoin "Serves Same Purpose As Gold" - Here's Why

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has recently walked back on his previous claims about Bitcoin being an 'index of money laundering' and admitted that the cryptocurrency serves the same purpose as gold in one's portfolio. “I did say Bitcoin, because we were talking about Bitcoin then, was the domain of money launderers and thieves," Fink told CBS on Sunday. “But you know, the markets teach you, you have to always re-look your assumptions. There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it’s an alternative," he added. Fink's comments on Bitcoin come at a time when cryptocurrencies worldwide witnessed large liquidations, motivated by Donald Trump's warning to China on Friday. Most cryptocurrencies suffered a beating, with Bitcoin dropping down from $125,000 levels to $104,000. Ethereum, too, saw a massive drawdown, falling to $3,700 levels. Bitcoins has since recovered and is trading around $114,000 levels, with the entire crypto market adding $550 billion in value since Friday's close. Fink, though, asserted caution, adding that Bitcoin is not a bad asset, but it should not form a major part of your portfolio. “For those looking to diversify, it is not a bad asset, but I don’t believe that it should be a large component of your portfolio,” he said. Earlier this month, similar words were echoed by Ben Powell, Chief Investment Strategist for the Middle East and Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. In an exclusive conversation with NDTV Profit, Powell said, “Having a 2% exposure to Bitcoin could make sense. The same goes for Gold." BlackRock is the world’s largest money manager that oversees roughly $12.5 trillion in assets. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is the largest crypto ETF with more than $93.9 billion in assets under management.
