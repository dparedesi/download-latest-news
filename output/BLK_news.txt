We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Home Appliance Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT) stands against other best home appliance stocks to buy according to analysts. The home appliance industry is likely to continue flourishing as long as people continue buying homes and relying on technology to make their daily tasks easier. According to Grand View Research, the household appliances market in the US was valued at $58.33 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1% between 2024 and 2030. One of the primary driving forces behind this growth is the rise in the disposable income levels of consumers. In addition, the rapid pace of urbanization is also a pivotal factor behind the market’s expansion. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the United States’ major home appliances market is expected to have a market size of $34.42 billion in 2025. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 2.93% between 2025 and 2030, reaching $39.77 billion at the end of the forecast period. The growing economic pressure and changing consumer lifestyles are the primary reasons behind the growth in the major home appliances market in the US. In addition, the rising penetration of distribution channels such as brand outlets, supermarkets, specialty stores, and e-commerce is contributing to this growth. The demand for primary household appliances such as washing machines, dishwashers, and mixer grinders is significantly increasing due to consumers’ busy and sedentary lifestyles. Another report by Mordor Intelligence shows that the overall US home appliance market size will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3% between 2025 and 2030, reflecting similar trends. A prominent trend emerging in the home appliance industry is people opting to purchase home appliances directly from manufacturers instead of using traditional middlemen. According to PWC’s June 2023 Global Consumer Insights Pulse Survey, a majority of customers, around 63%, reported buying products directly from a brand’s website. This number is expected to rise in the coming years, as around 29% of the consumers stated that while they hadn’t yet adopted this trend, they were thinking about going direct-to-consumer. The US Appliance Satisfaction study conducted by J.D. Power in 2023 showed that around 75% of appliance purchases occurred on the first store visit. In addition, nearly 71%, or three-fourths of home appliance transactions, took place in-store. Although 29% of the purchases occurred online, a majority of consumers still preferred seeing the equipment in person before buying it. In 2023, Christina Cooley, home intelligence lead at J.D. Power, stated: “This year’s data shows us that 56% of home appliance shoppers are doing their research online before heading in-store to purchase. Though price is almost always going to be the main driver of whether someone decides to purchase an appliance or not, one-third of buyers did not purchase because they were seeking specific options and features, and one-fifth indicated they couldn’t purchase, as their desired appliance wasn’t in stock.” According to Mordor Intelligence, the US housing sector is likely to generate growing demand for home appliances. It is, thus, a prominent driving force behind the industry’s future growth prospects. Development of the housing sector and improvement in people’s living conditions have a direct positive effect on the growth of the home appliance market. Therefore, a growing housing sector in the US is expected to trigger growth in the country’s home appliance market. We sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 home appliance stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks with the highest analyst upside potential as of January 2, 2025. The list is sorted in ascending order of analyst upside. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up photo of a robotic vacuum cleaner, highlighting its advanced design and home innovation capabilities. Analyst Upside: 41.94% iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT) is a global consumer robot company with a portfolio of smart home devices and home robots. Its portfolio features advanced technologies for cleaning, human-robot interaction, mapping and navigation, and physical solutions. Its offerings include the Braava family of automatic floor-mopping robots, the Clean Base Automatic Dirt Disposal, and others. The company has been facing persistent market segments and competitive headwinds that affected its sell-through performance in fiscal Q3 2024. However, it expects to see a stabilization in its revenue trend over time. It is on track to exceed its operating expense targets, and is investing in areas that drive revenue and improve its foundation for profitable growth. iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT) is also expanding its new product pipeline and announced the creation of iRobot Labs in July. iRobot Labs will serve as the company’s innovation center and represent its global initiative to boost its domestic product and software engineering talent. In addition, the company has reduced its supply chain and R&D expenses by relocating certain non-core engineering and supply-chain functions. It announced an additional workforce reduction as part of its ongoing restructuring plans and is transitioning to a new product development paradigm with its contract manufacturers to facilitate growth. This new operating model is allowing the company to significantly increase its new product innovations with less than half the internal resources and around one-third the cost. Such transformations are expected to improve the company’s long-term performance and generate shareholder value. iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT) ranks fifth on our list. Overall, IRBT ranks 5th on our list of best home appliance stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of home appliance stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IRBT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Posted on 01/08/2025 8:24:20 AM PST by House Atreides Russia has stolen a priceless lithium deposit from under Britain's nose As reported earlier, the largest lithium deposit in Ukraine has come under Russian control. But new details have come to light, reports Rogov, Chairman of the RF Public Chamber's Commission on Sovereignty: "About a year ago, the Kiev regime, for a pittance, completely transferred the rights to develop the Shevchenkivske lithium deposit to the British. It was supposed to be developed by the Australian company European Lithium, owned by the British businessman Anthony Sage. In fact, the British, with the assistance of Zelensky, stole the priceless deposit. But now their plans have been put to rest; they are not destined to come true." Now the most valuable resource needed for battery production will be mined by Russia." (Excerpt) Read more at youtube.com ...

"...a 2001 moratorium on the sale of land to foreigners had always represented an obstacle to unrestrained privatisation.

In 2020, Zelenskyy gave in to the IMF’s demands and finally repealed the moratorium. 'Agribusiness interests and oligarchs will be the primary beneficiaries of such reform,' said Olena Borodina of the Ukrainian Rural Development Network.

I suspect the Kiev end of this corruption has their proceeds safely stashed in overseas banks by now so only the British interests are on the outs now. At least Hillary got her money for Uranium One. That’s what matters to the Clintons. One of the main reasons Putin invaded Ukraine was to steal its minerals, which are estimated to be worth in excess of $36 trillion (which is coincidentally the same as the US national debt). That’s really what the whole thing is about. The Donbas is an absolute treasure house with both rich soil as well as oil, gas and mineral deposits under that. Blackrock and Vanguard and their political pawns want to get their grubby paws on all of it.

Title: What 2025 Holds for Tokenized Real World Assets
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/01/08/what-2025-holds-for-tokenized-real-world-assets
Time Published: 2025-01-08T16:23:13Z
Full Content:
Real world assets (RWAs). This is what the crypto natives and institutions are now calling on-chain representations of ownership in real estate, debt, equity, fund LP units, and other traditional assets. Throughout 2024, RWA tokenization grew in popularity thanks to key catalysts including: You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. What can we expect in 2025? This should be the year tokenization solidifies its position and transitions into the "pragmatists" portion of the adoption bell curve. With over $50 billion in RWAs already on-chain, 2025 is predicted to reach at least $500 billion (excluding stablecoins). Collateral mobility, yield-generating assets backed by other tokens (i.e. stable/yieldcoins and tokenized liquidity products), more complex financial products, and proven streamlined operations will drive the growth of the tokenized RWA market cap. Over time, this will increase investor preferences toward tokenized rather than non-tokenized versions, leading to further adoption and inflows. Real estate alone provides over $30 billion in value, demonstrating savings through tokenizing HELOCs, alternative financing, collateralized loans, on-chain title, funds, and more. Regulatory clarity Regulatory clarity remains a top barrier to adoption, but 2025 could bring significant progress. News of Paul Atkins’ appointment as SEC chair, Perianne Boring at the CFTC, and David Sacks as Crypto Czar is increasing the likelihood for a clear U.S. legal framework for digital assets. This would encourage larger institutional participation, raise investor confidence, and spur further innovation in infrastructure for RWAs. The EU, Switzerland, and Singapore have already shown that stronger regulation, even a sandbox, will enhance global momentum even further. Bridging the crypto community via RWA utility/governance tokens Tokenization has caught institutional attention due to cost savings and operational efficiencies. This is observed in both trials and in-production use cases compared to their off-chain counterparts. On the crypto side, governance and utility tokens are giving holders discounted trading fees compared to non-token holders, priority access to deal flow, decision-making, and more. This is the language the crypto community speaks, which will redirect crypto and NFT gains into RWAs and encourage building dApps/ infrastructure for them. Additionally, the Trump administration’s potential tax breaks on gains from U.S.-issued cryptocurrencies (utility/ governance tokens) is something investors and issuers should watch closely. 2025 should see tokenization of financial assets grow as both a narrative and application. Large banks and asset managers’ adoption will yield tangible results and spark confidence to move forward with related endeavors higher up the risk curve. Tapping DeFi ecosystems will continue to propel both primary and secondary markets forward by adding utility and enabling new economic opportunities. This year will see the chasm between crypto-native communities and traditional finance start to narrow. Tokenization is no longer a future concept; it’s here and will continue to grow. If you haven’t been paying attention to this space, now is the time. Regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and improved utility, among other catalysts like the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve at state and federal levels, will stimulate exponential growth and adoption.

What is Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and what are their future? I’m Barry Ritholtz. And on today’s edition of At The Money, we’re going to discuss all sorts of cryptocurrencies. To help us unpack this and what it means for your portfolio, let’s bring in Matt Hougan. He’s the chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management. The firm runs over 10 billion in crypto assets. So Matt, let’s start with a really basic question. What is Bitcoin? What is Ethereum? And what use cases do these coins have? Matt Hougan: Oh, amazing. Well, it’s great to be here. You know, Bitcoin is a crypto asset. The way I think of it is the first way that investors can store wealth in a digital format without relying on any government or any bank. It’s built on a major technical innovation called the blockchain, which took 40 years to develop, trying to figure out how to make this possible. Bitcoin broke through that in 2008, 2009, and it’s been gaining steady adoption. Ethereum is something more complex than Bitcoin. If you think of Bitcoin as digital money, you can think of Ethereum as making money and, and compute programmable in a public setting, and you can build applications on that. You can build smart contracts, you can build stable coins, you can build other applications. I think it’s a very exciting technology, but you can think of Bitcoin as digital money, Ethereum as sort of public compute and programmable money, and you’d be pretty close to reality. So you mentioned smart contracts. Barry Ritholtz: I’m kind of fascinated by that when, when we were talking about this a few years ago, the idea for smart contracts for concert tickets had come up where, Hey, Taylor Swift is unhappy that in the U S scalpers are buying up their tickets, keeping them away from the fans and selling them for $5,000. If we were to put Taylor Swift contracts on Ethereum, she could sell her tickets at $50 And whoever buys them, if they want to resell it at a higher price, she says, great this contract says I get half of that. And so the idea is to encourage it going to fans and making it less profitable for scalpers. But even if they do scalp it, well, then the artists themselves get it. How realistic are our applications like that? And when might we see something along those lines? Matt Hougan: I love it. It’s all going to happen. Barry. I think they’re all realistic. Crypto enables frictionless, programmable money. So what you’re raising there as an example of allowing money to be programmable, it’s not just concert tickets. You could say the same thing about art. Artists are always upset that they sell their art and then a hundred Xs in price and they don’t benefit from that directly. So this idea of, of attaching revenue streams downstream from it, is something that you can do easily in the blockchain setting. The natural question is why hasn’t it happened, right? If we were talking about this two years ago and it’s such a great idea, why hasn’t it happened? And there are two reasons for that. One is that crypto has had a regulatory cloud hanging over it. The SEC has been launching lawsuits against crypto. There was concerns in Congress, a senator was building an anti-crypto army. If you’re a mainstream corporation, are you going to build a new business in an area where a senator is building an army to crush you? You’re not. So we didn’t see any of that. The second is that blockchains were slow and costly, until about a year ago, sort of, we’ve gone through in blockchains. What we went through going from dial up to broadband internet. Now we have highly performant, low cost blockchains that can perform a lot of transactions. And we have a positive regulatory environment. I think you’re going to see a flowering of a million use cases over the next two or three years in crypto. They’re going to blow people’s minds. I think they’re going to go mainstream. You’re going to be using crypto apps without even knowing it. And I think people haven’t woken up to that reality yet. Barry Ritholtz: You’re really suggesting where like 1993 and the internet is that, is that a good frame of reference? Matt Hougan: That is exactly right. And you’re seeing these crypto apps pop up and break through people’s consciousness. A good example was Polymarket during the election. (Oh, sure). Everyone was looking at PolyMarket for the prediction odds on who would win the presidential election. It was it was in the Bloomberg terminal, right? The data from it. That was a crypto app. It could only be built on crypto. Crypto enabled it to happen, and yet no one was talking about that. So yeah, it’s 1994, 1996, and the internet. We’re starting to see a few examples. Yahoo’s jumping up. You know, email is jumping up. Hotmail is happening, but it hasn’t gone mainstream yet. It’s about to. Barry Ritholtz: It sounds like there are a lot of new use cases for things like Ethereum. Give us some other examples because you’re obviously much more knowledgeable about this. Matt Hougan: Stablecoins are one of the great killer apps to develop in crypto. A stablecoin is a money market fund, but on a blockchain. Right? It’s a way to access dollars on a blockchain. So why is that a killer app? There are two reasons. One, it puts a U. S. bank account at the fingertips of anyone with a cell phone anywhere around the world. And if you’re in Argentina or you’re in Turkey and you can’t easily access a U. S. dollar bank account, but your currency has high inflation, you’re going to want access to stablecoins. That’s built primarily on Ethereum. If you’re in sub-Saharan Africa, there’s a company called Yellowcard that’s using stablecoins to do country-to-country payments between business entities. It’s growing at an exceptional rate. The U. S. dollar is a phenomenal tool and most people don’t have access to it, Stable coins make that instantly accessible globally. And so I think that’s a good example of how crypto can really go mainstream at a very fast rate. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk a little bit about security. I recall 10 years ago, crazy numbers, something like a lot of hacks, a lot of thefts. And we talked previously about passwords, something like 20-25% of all Bitcoins have been lost because the owners either misplaced the drive it was on or misplaced the password. That sort of security issue seems to have been taken care of as this has become financialized and you can buy coins in ETF fashions. Tell us a little bit about custody and security of crypto assets. Matt Hougan: I mean, it’s worth noting those, those stories always sound so ridiculous. How could these crazy people lose their passwords now worth a billion dollars. But remember at the time it wasn’t worth a billion dollars. It was worth a few bucks, right? Somebody bought. Two pizzas for 80,000 Bitcoin. That’s now worth a billion dollars. I sure hope they were good. But you know, you have to think back to then when Bitcoin was trading for a few cents, people weren’t as careful as they would be today. But the technology has improved exponentially. Now, the way most people custody their Bitcoin, their Ethereum, their other crypto assets is through regulated, qualified custodians with insurance from leading insurance providers who have been doing it this for years. And have hundreds or thousands of people who help manage that securely. And the track record for those qualified custodians is sterling. Um, and so I think it’s really improved sort of exponentially. Barry Ritholtz: And to give you a sense of how long that’s been going on in November, 2017, there was literally an episode of the Big Bang Theory where they talked about mining coins and putting it on a drive that subsequently got lost, and back then in 2017, it was. You know, tens of thousands of dollars today. It’s, uh, it’s a whole lot more than that. I keep hearing from some skeptics who are saying this is a bubble. All these crypto-currencies are just speculative excess. How do you respond to that? Matt Hougan: They may be right, of course, that’s what makes a market, but many of the smartest investors in the world are allocating to Bitcoin and crypto. Stan Druckenmiller is allocating to crypto. Abbey Johnson at Fidelity is allocating to crypto. Blackrock is building a huge business in this. 60% of the world’s largest hedge funds have a position in Bitcoin. It may be that those people have a right point of view as well. When I look at crypto today, it looks to me like a technology that is just crossing the chasm from early adopters to mainstream and is yet to gain that sort of mainstream attention. It’s of course, possible, Barry, that the price will pull back. It’s been the best performing asset in the world for the last couple of years. It could be due for a pullback. But long-term, it’s not at a mature state. Bitcoin is not standing shoulder to shoulder with gold. Ethereum is not standing shoulder to shoulder with Amazon cloud services. We think of them at a discounted level until they’re standing shoulder to shoulder. I don’t think we’ve reached maturity or bubble level. I think we have, I think we’re getting there, but I don’t think we’re there yet. Barry Ritholtz: So let me ask you a two sided question and you can answer them both. What are the skeptics not understand about crypto generally? What do you think the advocates either get wrong or overemphasize? Matt Hougan: What do the skeptics not understand is a really great question I think many of them are anchored on the first time they heard about Bitcoin and Something that crypto needs to admit is the first time many people heard about Bitcoin or crypto was in a negative light Maybe it was FTX Maybe it was the collapse of Mt. Gox in 2014. Maybe it was Silk Road and illicit use. And the problem is, from a psychological anchoring perspective, they have such a negative first take on Bitcoin, they’re not able to evaluate it properly. They still consider things like “What about the illicit use of Bitcoin?” Well, the Department of Justice has come out and said that Bitcoin’s illicit use is so small and it’s not worth, you know, monitoring. It’s much lower than it is for cash. I think many of the skeptics don’t evaluate where the data is today because they’re taking a 2022 or 2018 or 2014 view of Bitcoin and crypto. Barry Ritholtz: I mean, we’ve seen some pretty extreme forecasts on prices that, that, you know, kind of raise red flags when people are talking about, you know, 1 million or 5 million as a Bitcoin target. It seems like they’re trolling us a bit. Matt Hougan: It does seem like they’re trolling us a bit. I think they underestimate the efficiency of markets and the ability of markets to accurately value what an asset is. Just because Bitcoin has gone up in the past and crypto has gone up in the past does not guarantee that it will go up in the future. And there are significant foreseeable and unforeseeable risks. In the future that we should think about their regulatory risks, their technology risks, their adoption risks, you know. Look, it’s hard to be the best-performing asset in the world for 10 consecutive years and then tack on an 11th. And, uh, I think there’s probably just too much assumption that there is a manifest destiny of Bitcoin going to a million. There is no such guarantee in the market. There’s always risk. Barry Ritholtz: Well the trend is your friend that that’s the old trading desk statement. So that, that leads to a really interesting question. Are these coins an investment or are they a speculation? Matt Hougan: Yeah, they’re absolutely an investment and some of them have elements of speculation. Let me give you an example of Bitcoin. I think when you’re investing in Bitcoin, you’re making two bets. One, you’re making a speculative bet that Bitcoin will stand shoulder to shoulder with gold as a store of value asset. Right now, it’s about 10 percent of gold. You’re saying, I think it’ll be 20, it’ll be 30, it’ll be 40, it’ll be 50, it’ll be 100. The second bet you’re making is that the U. S. government has 36 trillion of debt and is printing another trillion every 90 days. The store of value market is going to become more valuable in the future. And Bitcoin is a piece of that. To me, that’s a fundamental bet. And the other one is a speculative bet about it maturing. The reason Bitcoin’s performed so well over the last handful of years Is both of those have come true. And if you have two bets that are both coming true, you know, it’s not one plus one, it’s two times two equals four. It’s, it’s sort of an exponential bet. So there’s elements of speculation, but there are elements of fundamental investing behind these crypto assets as well. Barry Ritholtz: So, to wrap up, investors should pay attention to the various coins, in particular, Bitcoin and Ethereum, as a new technology that is crossing the chasm from early adopters towards mainstream investing. It doesn’t mean that you, outsize your position. It doesn’t mean that you oversize holding Bitcoin. Think about this as a new technology that is starting to be adopted more broadly in the world of both finance and technology. Try and, you know, every beer commercial ends with drink responsibly – invest responsibly if you want to take a few percentage of your portfolio and throw it into a Bitcoin ETF, there’s nothing terrible about that. You just don’t want to go hog wild and get sucked into the bubble mentality. That’s where people run into trouble. Thanks, Matt. This has really been interesting. I’m Barry Ritholtz.

EditorActivism Activist Post, Charlie Robinson, Neenah Payne Charlie Robinson is the host of the Macroaggressions Podcast. He was the author of Hypocrazy: Surviving In A World Of Cultural Double Standards in 2021 and The Octopus of Global Control in 2017When Robinson took over the Activist Post and Natural Blaze sites on January 1 this year, he offered an online version of Hypocrazy which is 259 pages, as shown below. It’s a must-read read for anyone who would like to make sense of the last four crazy years and much more. The Apple logo used to encourage us to “Think Different” – to take a bite out of the forbidden apple to access knowledge and truth. Robinson encourages us to do the same. Never was thinking different more important than during the COVID years. From 2020-2023, anyone who questioned the COVID-19 “scientific consensus” was ridiculed, silenced, and accused of being a selfish “conspiracy theorist” who was causing “vaccine hesitancy” and “killing grandma”. However, people who had the wisdom and courage to refuse the COVID shots protected their lives and those of their children – even if they lost their jobs and many friends. COVID was such a wake-up call that the corporate media (much of it “Brought to you by Pfizer”) is now collapsing as more people turn to the alt media for trustworthy information.

Team humanity There seems to be one rule for me yet another for thee. It’s this hypocrisy that the author Charlie Robinson takes on in his most recent book: Hypocrazy. His argument is clear: as much as the powers-that-be tell us that things are normal…. Mar 7, 2022 Excess Mortality Just Got Worse: Alarming New Data! Ed Dowd: COVID Shots Are Causing Youth Democide explains that when former Blackrock Portfolio Manager Edward Dowd discussed shocking information about excess mortality. “The millennial age group 25 to 44 experienced an 84% increase in excess mortality into the fall. It’s the worst ever excess mortality, I think, in history,” Dowd stated. Dowd noted an acceleration of excess mortality in 2021, around the time when mandates and boosters took effect. Dowd said “starting in the summer and into the Fall, with the mandates and the boosters, there were 61,000 excess millennial deaths. Basically, millennials experienced a Vietnam War in the second half of 2021.” National Archives stated 58,220 U.S. military fatal casualties of the Vietnam War. Dowd says this data is the smoking gun which shows COVID-19 injections are causing excess mortality in all age groups. Dowd labeled this ‘democide.’ Wikipedia’s definition of democide: “Democide is the murder of any person or people by their government, including genocide, politicide, and mass murder”. Dowd summarized: “So the government, through the mandates, has killed people.” TFH #603: 9/11 And The Deagel Report With Charlie Robinson reported that Dr. Bill Deagle predicted in 2017 that the populations in Western countries would drop by 2025 because of a pandemic and an economic crisis. Robinson correlated those predictions with the “excess deaths” in 2021-2022 in Western countries that took the COVID shots. He pointed out that countries that did not get many COVID shots are ones for which Deagle predicted population rises. So, Dr. Deagle knew by 2017 there was a plan to release a deadly “pandemic” to kill much of the Western population by 2025. Part 1: Where did all the people go?

From Macroaggressions with Charlie Robinson DR BILL DEAGLE – EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS NOW 2006 First published on 5/13/22 Hypocrazy: Surviving In A World Of Cultural Double Standards 2021 Amazon Description Hypocrite Western SOCIETY has become a difficult place for many people to navigate due to the constantly shifting moral values, cultural double standards, the outright manipulation of reality by the MEDIA, a dangerous consolidation in the BUSINESS community, and the strange WOKE agenda. The many WARS that have been started by psychopathic GOVERNMENTS, be they against other countries or things like drugs and COVID, have worked to shake peoples’ BELIEFS in the institutions that they once trusted with their lives. What a crazy time to be alive. The Octopus of Global Control 2017 Charlie says: “I didn’t set out to actually be a writer, but rather to organize content in a way that other people could interpret and process themselves. The Octopus of Global Control was written so that people could share it with friends and family members that did not currently have an understanding of what was really happening in our world.” Amazon Description The Octopus of Global Control is a controversial, nonfiction book detailing how those in positions of power are able to manipulate society for their benefit, why they believe that they are entitled to impose their warped world view of reality on mankind, and how we can break free from their grip. The eight tentacles of control that are wrapped around humanity are the Military, Governmental, Covert, Physical, Financial, Media, Spiritual, and Scientific. The book tackles topics such as uncovering the Deep State, false flag terror events, the media’s role in manufacturing wars, the 9/11 deception, the fraud of central banking, our broken education system, the use of religion to shape society, and the corrupted medical industry.The Octopus of Global Control footnotes these important events by featuring quotes and first-hand observations from over 500 witnesses and participants that were involved in the most important events in our history. Their words add context and help to paint the picture of these historic events by explaining who these people were, what they said, why it matters, and what actually happened.The author, Charlie Robinson, accomplishes the seemingly impossible task of blending the seriousness of these topics, and the respect they deserve, with dark humor, sarcasm and wit, that allow the reader to laugh at the preposterous while grasping the importance of these lessons. Robinson says in the video The Octopus of Global Controlbelow that in 2025, he will release an 8-part video documentary based on his book of the same name.“ I came out of Anarchapulco 2024 on a mission to turn my 2017 book, “The Octopus of Global Control” into an 8-part video documentary series. This was always the plan. It was meant to be turned into a punk rock version of history, matching the aggressive and unfiltered nature of the book which featured 700 quotes from 500 different people and is destined for television screens through a streaming service, and the timing feels right. There are so many different ways that director Richard Willett (Ickonic) is able to take this project, and with Jason Dahl (Dahlhouse Studios) and his mind-blowing graphic design, the Octopus will come to life in ways the book never could.” Deception: The Great Covid Cover-UpThe Wuhan Cover-Up: And the Terrifying Bioweapons Arms Race Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health A Plague Upon Our House: My Fight at the Trump White House to Stop COVID from Destroying America Presidential Takedown: How Anthony Fauci, the CDC, NIH, and the WHO Conspired to Overthrow President Trump Activism Activism Activism Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Title: Cortical direction selectivity increases from the input to the output layers of visual cortex

Full Content:
Sensitivity to motion direction is a feature of visual neurons that is essential for motion perception. Recent studies have suggested that direction selectivity is re-established at multiple stages throughout the visual hierarchy, which contradicts the traditional assumption that direction selectivity in later stages largely derives from that in earlier stages. By recording laminar responses in areas 17 and 18 of anesthetized cats of both sexes, we aimed to understand how direction selectivity is processed and relayed across 2 successive stages: the input layers and the output layers within the early visual cortices. We found a strong relationship between the strength of direction selectivity in the output layers and the input layers, as well as the preservation of preferred directions across the input and output layers. Moreover, direction selectivity was enhanced in the output layers compared to the input layers, with the response strength maintained in the preferred direction but reduced in other directions and under blank stimuli. We identified a direction-tuned gain mechanism for interlaminar signal transmission, which likely originated from both feedforward connections across the input and output layers and recurrent connections within the output layers. This direction-tuned gain, coupled with nonlinearity, contributed to the enhanced direction selectivity in the output layers. Our findings suggest that direction selectivity in later cortical stages partially inherits characteristics from earlier cortical stages and is further refined by intracortical connections.

Accordingly, neurons within the visual system of various species exhibit selectivity for motion direction (cat: [1]; monkey: [2]; ferret: [3]; rabbit: [4]; mouse: [5]; fly: [6]). Despite extensive research into the generation of direction selectivity at the initial stage [7–14], questions remain about how direction selectivity is processed and relayed at subsequent stages. It is believed that direction selectivity in later cortical stages substantially inherits characteristics from earlier cortical stages [15], as observed for the laminar processing of orientation selectivity [16–19], black–white asymmetry [20–23], and surround modulation [24–27] in the primary visual cortex (V1). Under this hypothesis, the direction selectivity of later cortical stages should strongly correlate with earlier cortical stages, sharing similar preferred directions. Consistent with this hypothesis, direction-selective cells in V1 are likely to receive synaptic connections from other V1 cells that have similar preferred directions [28–33]. In contrast, recent studies have suggested that direction selectivity is re-established at multiple stages along the visual pathway. In mice, direction selectivity first occurs in the retina [34] and is then independently reestablished in L4 [9] and L2/3 [35] of V1. Furthermore, the preferred direction of postsynaptic neurons in L2/3 of mouse V1 does not correlate with that of presynaptic neurons in L4 [35,36]. A similar de novo generation of direction selectivity at later stages has been observed in L4 of V1 in rabbits [37,38] and in the middle temporal (MT) visual area of monkeys [39]. Given these 2 contrasting hypotheses, the inheritance hypothesis and the re-establishment hypothesis, the manner in which direction selectivity is processed and relayed through consecutive cortical stages of the visual hierarchy, especially within the neocortex’s laminar structure [40], remains to be fully elucidated. Leveraging the intricate neural circuitry within a cortical column [16,41–43] and the advancements in laminar recording [44–46], we investigated the processing and relay of direction selectivity across 2 successive stages of the visual hierarchy in cats: the input layers and the output layers within the early visual cortices, including areas 17 and 18. Unlike in monkey V1 [47], where direction-selective neurons are prevalent only in the input layers (layers 4 and 6), cat early visual cortices have direction-selective neurons within both the input and output layers [48–50]. This enables us to investigate the laminar transmission of direction selectivity and how laminar circuits process direction selectivity. By employing drifting grating stimuli with varied directions, we assessed alterations in the strength of direction selectivity and shifts in the preferred direction as neural signals progressed from the input layers to the output layers within a single cortical column. Our findings indicate that the output layers not only inherit direction selectivity from the input layers but also exhibit enhanced direction selectivity. Through comparative analyses of population-averaged direction tuning curves and the development of computational models, we discovered a direction-tuned gain mechanism for signal transmission from the input layers to the output layers, which leads to enhanced direction selectivity in the output layers. Granger causality (GC) analysis suggested that this direction-tuned gain mechanism may be the result of both feedforward connections from the input layers to the output layers and recurrent connections within the output layers. In the present study, we recorded laminar responses in areas 17 and 18 of anesthetized cats with multielectrode linear probes (Fig 1A). Multiunit spiking activity (MUA), representing the response of a relatively local population [51], as well as sorted single-unit spiking activity (SUA), were extracted for each recording site. Unless otherwise specified, results from MUA were shown. We verified the perpendicularity of each probe placement by confirming minimal variation in RF center positions and high consistency of preferred orientations across recording sites (S1 Fig). Additionally, we determined the laminar position of each recording site based on the MUA, local field potential (LFP), and current source density (CSD) responses to sparse noise (SPN) stimuli (S2 Fig).

CO, cytochrome oxidase; DSI, direction selectivity index; MUA, Multiunit spiking activity; RF, receptive field; SPN, sparse noise. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002947.g001 Based on neuronal responses to SPN stimuli within the receptive field (RF) center, we calculated the response latency of each recording site, defined as the time point when the neuronal response reaches half of its maximum (Fig 1B). By pooling all the recording sites of each layer, we characterized the laminar distribution of response latency (Fig 1C). When comparing the input layers (including L4 and L6) with the output layers (comprising L2/3 and L5), we found that neuronal responses are significantly delayed in the output layers (Fig 1D; output layers: 51.76±0.5479 ms, N = 131 recording sites; input layers: 38.55±0.5716 ms, N = 129 recording sites; interlaminar difference: p = 3.6405*10−26; Wilcoxon rank-sum test), and this delay exists in all probe placements (Fig 1E, N = 24 probe placements, p = 1.8215*10−5; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). This latency variation across cortical depth justified the laminar assignment within the early visual cortices in our study. Based on the neuronal responses to drifting gratings with varied directions, we obtained direction tuning of each recording site, from which we calculated the direction selectivity index (DSI), which represents the strength of direction selectivity, and determined the preferred direction, which is the direction that evokes maximum responses (Fig 1B). We then characterized the laminar distribution of the DSI (Fig 2A). We observed that the output layers exhibited a significantly larger DSI (Fig 2B; output layers: 0.4605±0.0161, N = 134 recording sites; input layers: 0.2566±0.0194, N = 109 recording sites; interlaminar difference: p = 1.7392*10−8; Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and had a larger proportion of recording sites with strong direction selectivity (Fig 2B; proportion of recording sites with DSI > 1/3, output layers: 73.13%, N = 134 recording sites; input layers: 43.12%, N = 109 recording sites; interlaminar difference: p = 2.0992*10−6; chi-square goodness-of-fit test), indicating an enhancement of direction selectivity in the output layers. This enhancement was found in almost all probe placements (Fig 2C, N = 25 probe placements, p = 2.5432*10−5; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Across all probe placements, we found that the DSIs in the output layers were approximately 78.59% greater than those in the input layers (Fig 2D, DSI enhancement: 0.7859±0.1813, N = 25 probe placements). Additionally, our analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between the DSIs in the output layers and those in the input layers (Fig 2C, N = 25 probe placements, r = 0.7131, p = 9.7213*10−6; Spearman’s ρ), suggesting that the direction selectivity observed in the output layers may be partially inherited from the input layers. Similar results were obtained when considering only L2/3 and L4 (S3A–S3C Fig). (A) Laminar pattern of the DSI. Each dot represents the data from one recording site. Recording sites belonging to the output layers, including L2/3 and L5, are shown in blue. Recording sites in the input layers, including L4 and L6, are shown in red. The vertical dashed line represents a DSI of 1/3, indicating that the response strength in the preferred direction is twice that in the null direction. The running medians of neighboring recording sites are shown as black lines, and shaded error bars indicate the SEM. (B) Cumulative distributions of DSIs in the output layers (blue line) and the input layers (red line). The horizontal dashed line indicates a cumulative proportion of 0.5, and the vertical dashed line represents a DSI of 1/3. The median value and SEM of the DSI for both layers are shown at the top. The proportions of recording sites exhibiting strong direction selectivity (DSI > 1/3) within the input and output layers are denoted by colored arrows on the right.

DSI, direction selectivity index. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002947.g002 In addition to comparing DSIs, we quantified the shifts in preferred directions of neuronal pairs located at different depths within the output layers, within the input layers or across the input and output layers. We observed that for most neuronal pairs within a cortical column, the preferred direction remained largely unchanged, irrespective of whether the neurons were within the output layers, within the input layers or across the input and output layers (Fig 3A, proportion of neuronal pairs with preferred direction difference less than 30 degrees, within output layers: 83.33%, N = 330 pairs; within input layers: 69.62%, N = 237 pairs; across input and output layers: 78.16%, N = 577 pairs), reflecting the columnar organization of direction preference previously demonstrated in the early visual cortices of carnivores (cat: [52–54]; ferret: [3,55]). We also found a small subset of neuronal pairs exhibiting a shift in preferred directions of approximately 180 degrees (Fig 3A, proportion of neuronal pairs with preferred direction difference greater than 150 degrees, within output layers: 10.30%, N = 330 pairs; within input layers: 20.25%, N = 237 pairs; across input and output layers: 14.38%, N = 577 pairs), consistent with findings from previous studies [56]. However, upon comparing neuronal pairs with strong direction selectivity (those for which the DSIs of both recording sites were greater than 1/3), we found that nearly all pairs exhibited no change in their preferred directions (Fig 3B, proportion of neuronal pairs with preferred direction difference smaller than 30 degrees, within output layers: 86.74%, N = 181 pairs; within input layers: 88.41%, N = 69 pairs; across input and output layers: 88.99%, N = 218 pairs). Enhancement of direction selectivity in the output layers and maintenance of preferred directions across input and output layers were also observed with sorted single units and when considering only putative excitatory neurons based on their spike waveforms (S4A–S4D Fig).

DSI, direction selectivity index. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002947.g003 Through an interlaminar comparison of the DSIs, we demonstrated an enhancement in direction selectivity within the output layers of cat early visual cortices. The strong positive correlation between the DSIs of the output layers and the input layers, coupled with the consistent preferred directions across these layers, suggests that the direction selectivity observed in the output layers is predominantly inherited from the input layers. To further elucidate the processing and relay of direction selectivity from the input layers to the output layers, we compared the population-averaged direction tuning between the input and output layers. Prior to averaging, we aligned the preferred direction of each recording site to 90 degrees. As depicted in Fig 4A, as opposed to the neuronal responses in the preferred direction, the response strength in the other directions was weakened in the output layers compared to that in the input layers. As a control, we also compared the response strength under blank stimuli between the output layers and the input layers. We found that, under blank stimuli, the response strength was also reduced in the output layers (Fig 4A), which is in line with the reduced spontaneous activity in the output layers of awake macaques [57–60] and suggests that neuronal activity in the output layers is inherently weaker than that in the input layers.

The response ratio was greatest in the preferred direction (Fig 4B). Fig 4C shows the distribution of response ratios under 3 stimulus conditions: blank stimulus, null direction, and preferred direction. For both the blank stimuli and null direction, the response ratio was significantly less than 1 (Fig 4C; blank stimuli: N = 24 probe placements, p = 2.98*10−6; null direction: N = 24 probe placements, p = 0.00154; sign test), indicating a less active neuronal response in the output layers under nonpreferred conditions. In contrast, in the preferred direction, the response ratio approached 1 (Fig 4C, N = 24 probe placements, p = 0.541; sign test), suggesting the preservation of the preferred response in the output layers. A comparison of the response ratios among these conditions revealed no significant difference between the blank stimuli and null direction (Fig 4D, N = 24 probe placements, p = 0.317; Wilcoxon signed-rank test), whereas the response ratio for the preferred direction was substantially greater than that for both the blank stimuli (Fig 4D, N = 24 probe placements, p = 0.00184; Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and null direction (Fig 4D, N = 24 probe placements, p = 2.35*10−5; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Additionally, there are diverse relationships between response ratios across different stimulus conditions (Fig 4D; null direction versus blank stimuli: r = −0.29, p = 0.166; preferred direction versus blank stimuli: r = −0.48, p = 0.0185; preferred direction versus null direction: r = 0.85, p = 2.13*10−6; Spearman’s ρ). The interlaminar comparisons of response strength at these chosen stimulus conditions for each probe placement are shown in S5 Fig. Similar results were obtained when considering only the signal transmission from L4 to L2/3 (S3D–S3G Fig). To summarize, the results indicate that neuronal responses are inherently less active in the output layers, a trend that persists for the nonpreferred directions. However, neuronal responses in the preferred direction are selectively preserved from the input layers to the output layers. What mechanisms can lead to a direction-tuned response ratio between the output layers and the input layers and ultimately result in enhanced direction selectivity in the output layers? Similar to the neural circuits responsible for generating direction selectivity [10,61], the direction-tuned response ratio between the output layers and the input layers we observed could result from several factors: (1) Nonlinearity [50,62], such as spiking nonlinearity [63] or gating of sensory information across layers [64]. Under this assumption, a direction-independent gain of signal transmission from the input to output layers, combined with a nonlinearity like a threshold-linear function, is sufficient to explain the observed direction-tuned response ratio. (2) A direction-dependent change in the relative strength of excitation and inhibition, which could involve increased excitation in the preferred direction [13], increased inhibition in the null direction [14], or both, as seen with the influence of brain state on direction selectivity in rabbit LGN direction-selective neurons [38]. This mechanism suggests that, in contrast to a direction-independent gain, the gain of interlaminar signal transmission varies with the direction of the stimulus. To differentiate between these 2 potential mechanisms, we constructed 2 models simulating signal transmission from the input layers to the output layers (Fig 5A). In both models, the neuronal response in the input layers was first scaled by a linear gain and then subjected to static nonlinearity, specifically a threshold-linear transfer function [65–67]. The parameters of both models were optimized to explain neuronal responses in the output layers. The distinction between these 2 models lies in the linear gain: in the first model, the gain was constant across all stimulus conditions (Model I: untuned gain), whereas in the second model, the gain varied with stimulus condition (Model II: tuned gain). (A) Two models aim to explain neuronal responses in the output layers. In both models, responses from the input layers are first scaled by a linear gain and then pass through a static nonlinearity before producing the output responses. In the first model (Model I, Untuned Gain), the linear gain is fixed across all directions. In the second model (Model II, Tuned Gain), the linear gain varies in different directions. The exemplar neuronal responses in the input and output layers are the same as those in Fig 4A, and are also presented as mean ± SEMs. (B) Comparison of DSIs between the output of Model I and the input layers.

This contribution is quantified by calculating the ratio of the DSI difference between Model I (untuned gain) and the input layers to the DSI difference between the output layers and the input layers. (E) Comparison of adjusted goodness of fit (adjR2) between Model I and Model II. Since Model I and Model II differ in the number of free parameters, we used adjR2, which accounts for the number of free parameters in each model, to enable fair comparisons. The horizontal and vertical dashed lines represent an adjR2 value of 0.8. Only results from probe placements where Model II has an adjR2 greater than 0.8 were shown in other figures. Similar results were obtained using the AIC and BIC. (F) Comparison of DSIs between the output of Model II and the output layers.

AIC, Akaike information criterion; BIC, Bayesian information criterion; DSI, direction selectivity index. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002947.g005 We first evaluated whether nonlinearity alone could explain the neuronal responses observed in the output layers. Although the DSI of the output responses in Model I exceeded that of the input layers (Fig 5B, N = 24 probe placements, p = 0.000228; Wilcoxon signed-rank test), it remained lower than that of the output layers (Fig 5C, N = 24 probe placements, p = 0.000162; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The overall contribution of nonlinearity to the enhancement of direction selectivity is about 29.09%±5.17% (Fig 5D). This finding indicates that while nonlinearity contributes to enhancing direction selectivity beyond the input layers, it does not entirely account for the enhanced direction selectivity observed in the output layers. In contrast, Model II offers a more comprehensive explanation of neuronal responses in the output layers, as indicated by the adjusted goodness of fit (adjR2), which accounts for the number of free parameters in each model (Fig 5E, adjR2 of Model II versus adjR2 of Model I: N = 25 probe placements, p = 1.23*10−5; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC), which both account for the number of free parameters in each model, we obtained similar results (S6 Fig). The DSI of the output response in Model II shows no significant difference compared to that in the output layers (Fig 5F, DSI of the output responses in Model II versus DSI of the output layers: N = 24 probe placements, p = 0.407; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The diverse relationships of response ratios between different stimulus conditions, as demonstrated in Fig 4D, can also be accurately replicated in Model II (S7 Fig). Additionally, the contribution of direction-tuned gain to the enhancement of direction selectivity is 70.15%±6.30% (Fig 5G), suggesting that an inter-laminar direction-tuned gain mechanism plays a critical role in this process. Subsequently, we analyzed the population-averaged direction tuning of the linear gain extracted from Model II. We observed that the linear gain was direction-tuned, peaking in the preferred direction (Fig 6A). A strong positive correlation was found between the DSI of the linear gain and the DSI of the output layers (Fig 6B, N = 17 probe placements, r = 0.57, p = 0.0179; Spearman’s ρ), indicating that this direction-tuned gain mechanism contributes to the enhancement of direction selectivity in the output layers. Fig 6C shows the comparison of linear gains among the blank stimulus, null direction, and preferred direction. The gain in the null direction exceeded that of the blank stimulus (Fig 6C, N = 17 probe placements, p = 0.00309; Wilcoxon signed-rank test), suggesting interlaminar amplification of the response in the null direction. Furthermore, the gain in the preferred direction was greater than those for both the blank stimulus (Fig 6C, N = 17 probe placements, p = 0.000503; Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and the null direction (Fig 6C, N = 17 probe placements, p = 0.000293; Wilcoxon signed-rank test), demonstrating selective amplification in the preferred direction. Similar results were obtained when considering only the signal transmission from L4 to L2/3 (S3H and S3I Fig) and when using a different type of nonlinearity, the power-law nonlinearity (S8 Fig).

DSI, direction selectivity index. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002947.g006 In the nonlinearity we used, whether a threshold-linear transfer function or a power-law nonlinearity, a threshold-like component is included, which could act like a suppression. To explicitly clarify the roles of linear gain and the suppression, we developed a third model. In this model (Model III), input layer responses are first multiplied by a linear gain, then subtracted by a constant, and finally processed through a rectified-linear nonlinearity (ReLU) to simulate output layer responses (S9A Fig). We found that Model II outperformed Model III by a very small margin (S9B Fig). In Model III, the gain was also direction-tuned (S9D Fig), and there was a strong relationship between the DSIs of the tuned gain and the output layers (S9E Fig). Finally, we conducted GC analysis to identify the potential neural circuit origin of the direction-tuned gain. For a specific pair of connections, we calculated the pairwise-conditional GC value. In this calculation, all joint dependencies among the other known variables are conditioned out, effectively mitigating the impact of potential confounding factors, such as common inputs. Compared to blank stimuli, stimuli in the null direction elicited stronger feedforward connections from L4 to L2/3 and from L4 to L5 (Fig 7A). Moreover, stimuli in the preferred direction not only reinforced these connections from L4 to L2/3 and from L4 to L5 but also intensified the recurrent connections from L2/3 to L5 (Fig 7B). Notably, compared to those in the null direction, stimuli in the preferred direction further strengthened the connections from L4 to L2/3 and from L2/3 to L5 (Fig 7C). S10 Fig shows the paired comparisons of normalized GC values between different stimulus conditions. These findings suggest that the direction-tuned gain likely stems from the combined effect of feedforward connections from the input layers to the output layers, as well as the recurrent connections within the output layers.

GC, Granger causality. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002947.g007 The gain of signal transmission from the input layers to the output layers exhibits direction tuning, which is likely to derive from the synergistic effects of both feedforward and recurrent connections. This direction-tuned gain, in addition to nonlinearity, enhances direction selectivity within the output layers, suggesting complex interplay between these neural pathways in processing motion information. By leveraging laminar recording and computational modeling, we elucidated the processing and relay of direction selectivity across 2 successive stages of the visual hierarchy: the input layers and the output layers within cat early visual cortices. The strength of the direction selectivity is strongly correlated between the output layers and the input layers (Fig 2C) and preferred directions are preserved (Fig 3). Moreover, direction selectivity is enhanced in the output layers (Fig 2), where neuronal responses to the preferred direction are selectively preserved (Fig 4). The enhancement of direction selectivity likely results from direction-tuned signal transmission across layers (Fig 6), which may be attributed to both feedforward connections across input and output layers and recurrent connections within the output layers (Fig 7). In both carnivores [68,69] and primates [47], direction selectivity is considered an emergent property of the visual cortex and was initially observed in the V1 input layers. Unlike in cat early visual cortices, where direction-selective neurons are prevalent in all layers, in monkey V1 these neurons are only prevalent in the input layers (L4 and L6, [47]). This is because motion information is not primarily transmitted to the V1 output layers but is instead directed to the MT via L4B and L6 of V1 in monkeys [70]. Additionally, within the ventral pathway of monkey, motion information is transmitted to V2 thick stripes from L3 of V1 [71]. In contrast to monkey V1 [72,73], neurons in cat early visual cortices are organized into 2D direction maps [52–54,74–76]. These differences in the laminar and tangential organization of direction selectivity make the cat early visual cortices an ideal model for studying the laminar processing of direction selectivity. Leveraging laminar recordings from multielectrode linear probes, our study characterized the laminar distribution of DSI and demonstrates, for the first time, that direction selectivity is enhanced in the output layers compared to the input layers within the same cortical column (Fig 2). Based on a database of 899 cells, Kim and colleagues characterized the distribution of DSI across different layers of cat area 17 (A17) [50]. They also found a higher proportion of direction-selective neurons in L2/3 and L5 compared to L4. In L6, however, they observed that the DSI distribution peaked at high DSI values, a pattern not observed in our data. Since our sample size of L6 neurons is relatively small compared to theirs, our sample may underrepresent some highly direction-selective neurons in L6. In a recent study, Hawken and colleagues identified 6 main functional clusters in L6 of monkey V1 [77], suggesting multiple parallel circuits within L6. One of these clusters, which is highly direction-selective, was located near the upper half of L6. Additionally, a two-photon study found that the direction map in cat A17 is not homogeneous but patchy [74]. These findings suggest that sampling at different cortical depths or positions may result in varying DSI distributions in L6. Within a cortical column, we observed that a minority of the neuronal pairs demonstrated a shift in preferred directions of approximately 180 degrees (Fig 3A), corroborating earlier research [56]. The abrupt shift in preferred directions can be partially explained by the presence of direction fractures within the direction map [52–54,75] and the observation that some neurons exhibit opposite preferred directions for the 2 eyes [78] in cat early visual cortices. However, neuronal pairs with pronounced direction selectivity consistently maintain their preferred direction (Fig 3B). This suggests that strong direction selectivity is coupled with a more stable representation of motion information. Since the DSIs of the output layers and the interlaminar gain are positively correlated (Fig 6B), this stability may stem from the stronger direction-tuned gain of interlaminar signal transmission. These insights offer a vital point of reference for subsequent research on the plasticity of direction selectivity, as well as its potential modulation through learning or adaptive processes. In addition to direction selectivity, other response properties also exhibited distinct laminar distributions, including the response modulation ratio (F1/F0) and orientation selectivity. Based on F1/F0, visual neurons are classified as simple cells (F1/F0 ≥ 1) and complex cells (F1/F0 < 1), with simple cells being more prevalent in the input layers and complex cells more abundant in the output layers (cat early visual cortices: [16]; monkey V1: [18]), as is shown in S11 Fig. Within both the simple and complex cell populations, direction selectivity is enhanced in the output layers (S11C and S11D Fig). Furthermore, we found no correlation between F1/F0 and DSI in either the output layers or the input layers (S11E and S11F Fig), in line with previous studies in cat early visual cortices [76] and monkey V1 [30,33]. These results suggest that the enhancement of direction selectivity is primarily due to interlaminar processing. Similar to direction selectivity, previous studies have reported stronger orientation selectivity in the output layers compared to the input layers (cat early visual cortices: [79]; monkey V1: [17,18]), as demonstrated in S12 Fig. A strong correlation was found between orientation selectivity and direction selectivity, suggesting that the generation of orientation selectivity and direction selectivity may share partially overlapping mechanisms, such as intracortical inhibition [62,80,81] or spike threshold [19]. These diverse relationships between different response properties and their laminar dependence highlight the need for comprehensive large-scale models [82–84], which could provide insights into whether these properties share distinct mechanisms and the roles of diverse laminar circuits. In this study, we combined data from cat area 17 (A17) and area 18 (A18). Previous studies have found a higher proportion of direction-selective neurons in A18 compared to A17 [85,86], with A18 displaying a homogeneous direction map [52,54] and A17 showing a patchy direction map [74]. Consistent with these findings, we also observed a higher proportion of direction-selective neurons in A18, but only in the output layers, not in the input layers (S13 Fig). This difference in DSI distributions within the output layers of A17 and A18 may be explained by the finding that, while the response ratios between the output and input layers are largest at the preferred direction in both areas, the response ratios in A18 tend to be higher than those in A17. It would be interesting to explore whether interlaminar processing varies between different cortical areas, such as V2 thick stripes [72,73] and MT [87] in monkey, where direction maps are also observed. We identified 2 factors contributing to the enhanced direction selectivity in the output layers. The first is nonlinearity (Fig 5), potentially arising from gating of sensory information across layers [64] or nonlinear transformations from membrane potential to spike activity [63,88]. The second factor is a direction-tuned gain for interlaminar signal transmission (Figs 5 and 6). The functional relevance of this direction-tuned gain may lie in enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio in visual processing and allowing for more accurate and efficient encoding of motion information. Through GC analysis, we demonstrated increased feedforward connections from the input layers to the output layers, as well as increased recurrent connections within the output layers at the preferred direction (Fig 7). The feedforward connections are inherently excitatory, while the increased recurrent connections could result from increased excitation, increased inhibition, or a combination of both. The increase in excitation at the preferred direction may be supported by the presence of direction maps. Given the presence of direction maps, neurons within a direction column are likely to receive stronger excitatory inputs upon exposure to their preferred direction, which could result from enhanced feedforward convergence or recurrent connections, or both [89–91]. Future investigations are needed to determine whether the degree of enhancement in direction selectivity varies across different locations within the direction map and to explore whether the direction tuning of interlaminar signal transmission depends on these locations. The involvement of inhibition in direction selectivity is evidenced by experiments showing the influence of direction selectivity through manipulations of inhibition or modeling results. Direction selectivity of cortical neurons is reported to decrease with the blockade of inhibition [92–96] and to increase with enhanced inhibition [80,97]. By modeling the cat’s early visual cortices, Freeman revealed that inhomogeneities in the orientation map can cause spatiotemporal offsets between excitation and inhibition [98], and these offsets have been demonstrated to contribute to direction selectivity across various species (cat: [63]; monkey: [99]; ferret: [95]; mouse: [35,100]). There are different possibilities for the relative direction tuning of inhibition and excitation: inhibition can be untuned [82], co-tuned with excitation [63,101–103], or tuned differently from excitation [95]. To study the role of inhibition in the interlaminar direction-tuned gain, future studies could use either pharmacology or optogenetics [95,104] to selectively activate or inactivate inhibition within certain cortical layers. If the impact of intracortical inhibition is significant, it would be beneficial to examine the roles of diverse types of inhibitory cells [105–107] and how the interplay between excitation and inhibition leads to the interlaminar direction-tuned gain. In our single-unit data, when considering only narrow-spiking units, we found no significant difference in direction selectivity between the input and output layers, as direction selectivity was already strong in the input layers (S4E Fig). However, it is uncertain whether this finding can be attributed to the direction tuning of inhibitory neurons in cat early visual cortices, due to 2 factors: (1) the sample size of narrow-spiking units in the input layers is relatively small (28 single units); and (2) classification of neuronal types based on spike waveform remains controversial. Recent studies have shown that some narrow-spiking units in cat early visual cortices and monkey V1/premotor/motor cortex may belong to excitatory neurons [108–110], while some GABAergic neurons in mouse V1 exhibit broad-spiking waveforms [111]. Moreover, results on the direction selectivity of inhibitory neurons are diverse (cat early visual cortices [112,113]; ferret V1 [114]), highlighting the need for future studies to characterize the response properties of inhibitory neurons in the early visual cortices and their functional roles within neocortical networks. In our model results, although responses in the output layers are derived by scaling responses from the input layers in our model (Fig 5), this does not conclude that the underlying neural circuit employs a pure multiplication algorithm. Alternatively, the tuned gain can be equivalent to a fixed gain combined with tuned suppression, as illustrated in Model IV of S9 Fig. It has been shown that normalization—a process where an excitatory drive is divided by the summed activity from neighboring neurons—is a canonical neural computation [115–119] that can explain various neuronal response properties, including contrast gain control [120,121], cross-orientation suppression [122,123] and surround suppression [24,26,124]. Understanding whether normalization contributes to laminar processing of direction selectivity, and how interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons shape underlying neural circuits, is crucial for advancing our knowledge of visual information processing. In the present study, we recorded neuronal responses in anesthetized animals, which is well-suited for studying cortical processing of basic visual features. However, the use of anesthetized animals presents 2 inherent limitations. First, anesthesia may attenuate feedback connections from higher visual areas [125–127]. These feedback connections may influence the direction selectivity of neurons in the early visual cortices [128,129]. Second, the impact of propofol, the anesthetic used in the present study, on neuronal responses throughout the cortical column is a matter of ongoing debate, and it remains unclear whether the differences in response strengths across layers are affected [130–133]. To address these limitations, future studies could record laminar responses in awake animals to determine whether the results are consistent with those of the present study or if additional connections are engaged in the absence of anesthesia. By using drifting gratings with fixed stimulus properties such as contrast, size, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency, and by varying only the direction, we can directly compare direction selectivity between the input and output layers through simultaneous recordings. Previous studies have demonstrated that direction selectivity is modulated by varied spatiotemporal configurations of visual stimuli [7,134,135]. Additionally, both intralaminar and interlaminar connections are known to exhibit variability in response to changes in stimulus configurations [26,45,60,136,137]. Therefore, it would be worthwhile for future studies to employ a richer array of stimuli to determine whether the strategy for columnar processing of motion information varies across different spatiotemporal configurations. As a caveat, while our results may primarily suggest a refinement of inherited direction selectivity in the output layers of the early visual cortices, we could not exclude the possibility of neurons exhibiting re-manufactured direction selectivity. Further research could elucidate whether such neurons exist, particular near the fractures of the direction map. Acute experiments were performed in adult cats of both sexes (Felis catus, 2 to 4.5 kg; 9 animals). All procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines, and the research protocol was approved by the Biological Research Ethics Committee of Beijing Normal University (ID: IACUC(BNU)-NKLCNL 2017–06) and Fudan University (ID: 2021JS0087). The details of the surgical procedure can be found in our previous studies [21,123,137]. In brief, animals were injected with dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg, subcutaneously) 12 h before surgery. At the beginning of the surgery, the animals were initially anesthetized with isoflurane (5% concentration) and injected with atropine sulfate (0.05 mg/kg, subcutaneously). During the surgery and electrophysiological recording, anesthesia and paralysis were maintained with propofol (2 to 6 mg/kg/h) and vecuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg/h), respectively. The end-tidal CO2 concentration was maintained at 3.5% to 4%, and the body temperature was maintained at 36.5°C to 37.5°C. Ventilation pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, and blood oxygen were monitored continuously. To prevent brain edema and to reduce saliva secretions during the experiment, dexamethasone was injected every day (0.4 mg/kg), and atropine sulfate (0.05 mg/kg) was injected every other day. To dilate the pupils, 1% atropine sulfate solution was administered. To protect the corneas and focus visual stimuli on the retina, contact lenses with appropriate refractive power (+2.0 D) were fitted onto the eyes. To reduce optical aberration, artificial pupils (3 mm in diameter) were placed in front of the eyes. Before the experiment, the optic disc was back-projected onto the screen with a reversible ophthalmoscope, from which we estimated the location of the area centralis. The animal’s head was fixed on the stereotaxic instrument, and a craniotomy was performed to enable electrophysiological recording of the early visual cortices (P7-A5, L0-L5; Horsley–Clarke coordinates, both hemispheres, including A17 and A18). After the penetration of the linear probe, 1.5% to 2% agar was applied to protect the cortex. A multielectrode linear array was used to record neuronal activity across all layers simultaneously. A 24-electrode linear probe (U-Probe, Plexon; 15 μm in diameter and 100 μm interelectrode distance) was used for all animals except for one animal, in which a 64-electrode linear probe (Probe64D Sharp, IDAX Microelectronics; 50 μm interelectrode distance) was used. The linear probe was controlled by a microelectrode drive (NAN Instruments, Israel) to penetrate across the cortex. Electrical signals were acquired at a sampling rate of 30,000 Hz with a Cerebus 128-channel system (Blackrock Microsystems). To obtain the multiunit spiking activity (MUA), we first high-pass filtered the raw data (seventh order Butterworth with a 1,000 Hz corner frequency). Subsequently, we thresholded the filtered data based on a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 5.5, setting responses that exceeded this threshold to 1, while all others were set to 0. The raw data were also low-pass filtered (seventh order Butterworth with a 300 Hz corner frequency) to obtain the LFP. Both the MUA and LFP were further downsampled to 500 Hz. In total, we obtained 26 probe placements that had a high SNR and were perpendicular to the cortex. The perpendicularity of each probe placement was verified based on the variation of RF center positions and the consistency of preferred orientations across recording sites. To quantify the variation of RF center positions, we calculated the RF Center Dispersion: (1) where (xi, yi) and σi are the center position and radius of the ith recording site, N is the number of recording sites in one probe placement, and is the averaged center position across N probe placements. This parameter quantifies the variation in RF centers relative to the RF size within one probe placement, with the numerator representing the variation of RF center positions and the denominator representing the population-averaged RF diameter. A smaller value indicates less variation in RF center positions across all recording sites. We quantified the consistency of preferred orientations by calculating Preferred Orientation Consistency: (2) where θi is the preferred orientation of the ith recording site and |C| is the amplitude of a complex value. The range for Preferred Orientation Consistency is from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater consistency in preferred orientations across recording sites; a value of 1 occurs when all recording sites within a probe placement share the same preferred orientation. In S1A Fig, we presented RF Center Dispersion and Preferred Orientation Consistency for all probe placements. Low RF Center Dispersion values and Preferred Orientation Consistency values close to 1 confirm perpendicular penetration of these probes. For long-lasting probe placements, perpendicularity was further verified postmortem through histology, as probe tracks were clearly delineated by CO staining. Visual stimuli were generated on a PC with a Leadtek GeForce 6800 video card and were presented on a gamma-calibrated CRT monitor (Dell P1230, refresh rate 100 Hz, mean luminance 32 cd/m2). The stimuli were all monocularly presented to the eye contralateral to the recorded hemisphere. In the present study, 2 types of stimuli were employed: sparse noise stimuli (SPN) and drifting gratings. Before utilizing the drifting gratings to determine the direction selectivity, the SPN was used to identify the center and the size of the classical RF of each recording site. Furthermore, the layers were assigned based on neuronal responses to the SPN. The sparse noise stimuli consisted of black and white squares presented at random positions on a 2D grid. Each square had a 90% contrast from the uniform gray background (luminance: 32 cd/m2) and was presented for 40 ms in a reverse-correlation paradigm. The size of each square, the distance between neighboring squares, and the extent of the visual space covered were chosen based on the classical RF size of the recording sites (typically 1–5 degrees). Drifting gratings, similar to the SPN, had a 90% contrast and a mean luminance of 32 cd/m2. The size of each grating was slightly larger than the classical RF mapped using the SPN. The temporal frequency was set at 2 Hz, with the duration ranging from 2 to 4 s. We chose spatial frequencies that elicit strong responses for each probe placement, ranging from 0.05 cpd to 0.4 cpd. During the recordings for each probe placement, only the direction of the gratings was varied, while all the other parameters remained constant. The number of directions tested for each probe placement varied from 12 to 24. In each direction, the images were presented 5 to 100 times, and 5 to 10 repetitions were typically sufficient to achieve a high SNR. Among the 26 probe placements, 12, 18, and 24 directions were used 6, 15, and 5 times, respectively, while 5, 10, and 100 repetitions were used 1, 20, and 5 times, respectively. Experiments involving 100 repetitions were designed to investigate additional research questions. In addition to grating stimuli, blank stimuli (a uniform gray background) will randomly appear in some trials. These trials with blank stimuli constituted approximately 10% of the total trials. For each probe placement, we assigned all recording sites to corresponding layers according to stimulus-evoked MUAs, LFPs, CSDs, and spatial RFs from SPN experiments [21]. Concerning the differences in cortex thickness across probe placements, we assigned a relative depth to each recording site [41,42,138,139]. The range of relative depth was from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating the border between the cortical surface and L2/3, and 1 indicating the border between L6 and white matter. The border between the cortical surface and L2/3 can always be identified from LFPs because the LFP waveform is nearly identical for recording sites out of the cortex, and an abrupt change exists between neighboring recording sites once it enters the cortex. The border between L6 and white matter was determined by MUA and spatial RF. The deepest site with a high SNR of MUA and consecutive spatial RF was deemed 50 μm above this border. We separated the cortex into 4 layers (L2/3, L4, L5, and L6) using 3 relative depths (0.35, 0.58, and 0.76 from top to bottom) to mark the borders between neighboring layers. These borders were determined primarily based on MUA response latency, defined as the time point at which the response reached half of its maximum (Fig 1B). Notably, L4 and L6 exhibited faster latencies than L2/3 and L5 (Fig 1C–1E). In S2A Fig, we showed MUA, LFP, and CSD responses evoked by black and white stimuli within the spatial RF for an example probe placement. MUA responses revealed advances in latency and a stronger rebound in both L4 and L6 [21]. LFP responses indicated a polarity reversal in L6, while CSD responses identified a current sink in L4 [140,141]. S2B Fig displays the number of electrodes within each layer across all probe placements, consistent with the relative thickness of each layer. To enhance the statistical power, we combined the data from L2/3 and L5 as the “output layers” and those from L4 and L6 as the “input layers” due to their roles in signal transmission along the visual hierarchy [41] and their similarities in response properties [21]. In S3A Fig, we further showed that the DSI in L2/3 and L5 was significantly larger than in L4 and L6. Similar results were observed when comparing between L4 and L2/3, as seen between the output layers and input layers, including enhanced direction selectivity in L2/3 (S3B and S3C Fig), a direction-tuned response ratio between L2/3 and L4 (S3D–S3G Fig), and a direction-tuned gain mechanism from L4 to L2/3 (S3H and S3I Fig). For each recording site, we calculated the trial-averaged MUA response to each test stimulus direction, represented by θ, and denoted it as R(θ, t). For each stimulus direction, R(θ, t) can be plotted as a peristimulus time histogram (PSTH). Similarly, we obtained R(Blank, t) for blank stimuli. We defined Var(θ) and Var(Blank) as the variances of R(θ, T) and R(Blank, T), respectively, where T includes the 0 to 200 ms period after stimulus onset. From these measurements, we calculated the SNR of each recording site as follows: (3) Only recording sites with an SNR larger than 8 were further analyzed. We fitted direction tuning curves of the time-averaged response, R(θ), with the von Mises function [142]. In the above equation, θpref and θnull represent the preferred direction and null direction, respectively, and they are always of 180° difference. σ1 and σ2 control the tuning width in the preferred direction and null direction, respectively. For initial-guess values, we set θpref as the direction eliciting the maximum response, σ1 and σ2 to 1, α and β as the difference between the maximum and minimum responses across all directions, and R0 as the minimum response across all directions. The optimal parameters are then obtained using fmincon in MATLAB. Based on neuronal responses in the preferred direction R(θpref) and in the null direction R(θnull), we calculated the DSI as follows: (5) The DSI ranges from 0 to 1, with a larger value indicating stronger direction selectivity. In addition to direction tuning curves, we also fitted orientation tuning curves as: (6) In the above equation, θpref represents the preferred orientation. We defined θortho as the orthogonal orientation, which is always 90° away from θpref. Based on the fitted orientation tuning, we get responses at the preferred orientation R(θpref) and at the orthogonal orientation R(θortho). We defined the orientation selectivity index (OSI) as follows: (7) We further calculated OP ratio as the ratio between R(θortho) and R(θpref) and HWHH as the half-width at half-height. By simulating the signal transmission from the input layers to the output layers, we constructed 2 computational models to fit the neuronal responses in the output layers. We assumed that there are 2 stages for interlaminar signal transmission. The first stage is a linear gain, and the second stage is a static nonlinearity. In the first model (Model I, untuned gain), the linear gain was constant under all stimulus conditions, including different directions and blank stimuli. is the average neuronal response across all the valid recording sites within the input layers at the ith repetition. We use the subscript S to denote all stimuli used, which include both grating stimuli and blank stimuli. is the output response. w is the fixed linear gain across all stimulus conditions, and f is a static threshold-linear nonlinearity with the following form: (9) In the above equation, g0 is the threshold, A is the gain, and σ controls the smoothness of the transition zone, with larger values generating smoother transitions. The derivation and examples of this equation can be found in previous studies [65–67]. In the second model (Model II, tuned gain), the linear gain, w(S), varied under different stimulus conditions. In both models, we optimized parameters to minimize the residual between the output responses and the true neuronal responses in the output layers . To compare Model I and Modell II, we used the adjusted goodness of fit (adjR2), which accounts for the number of free parameters in each model: (12) In the above equation, Nsample and Nparam represent the number of data samples and free parameters, respectively. and R are the fitted and raw response, respectively. and are the average value of the fitted and raw responses, respectively. In addition to the form of nonlinearity in Eq (9), we also used a power-law nonlinearity: (13) In the above equation, g0 is the threshold, A is the gain, and [C]+ represents half rectification. In the above 2 forms of nonlinearity, there is a suppressive component in each. To explicitly study the role of linear gain and suppression, we developed 2 additional models (Model III and Model IV). These models incorporate 3 stages: a linear gain, a suppressive component, and a rectified-linear nonlinearity (ReLU): (14) In the above equation, T(S) represents the suppressive component. In Model III, w(S) varied at each stimulus condition, while T(S) was constant. Conversely, in Model IV, w(S) remained constant and T(S) varied at each stimulus condition. Multivariate Granger causality was calculated using the MVGC MATLAB Toolbox [143], and the details can be found in our previous work [21]. For each probe placement, we obtained the pairwise-conditional GC value, GC(S, Eto, Efrom), under all stimulus conditions S, where Eto and Efrom were the targets and sources of the connections, respectively. When calculating the pairwise-conditional GC value for a specific pair of connections, all joint dependencies among the other known variables are conditioned out. This approach helps mitigate the impact of potential confounding factors, such as common inputs. We then z-scored GC(S, Eto, Efrom) and obtained the normalized GC value. Spike sorting was initially performed automatically using KiloSort [144] and then manually curated using Phy [145]. The quantity of each unit was quantified by the SNR of the spike waveform, which was defined as the ratio of the peak-to-peak amplitude of the mean waveform to twice the standard deviation of the noise [146]. Any unit with a spike waveform SNR greater than 1.5 was classified as a single unit (SU). We separated all SUs into 5 classes (narrow-spiking units, broad-spiking units, triphasic-spiking units, compound-spiking units, and positive-spiking units) based on recent work studying extracellular spike waveforms in cat early visual cortices [147]. The details of the classification can be found in our previous work [21]. For each SU, we calculated the response modulation ratio (F1/F0) under the preferred stimulus condition, where F1 represents the response at the same temporal frequency as the stimulus drifting, and F0 is the averaged response. We then categorized each SU as either a simple cell (F1/F0 ≥ 1) or a complex cell (F1/F0 < 1). The laminar profile of F1/F0 and its relationship with DSI are illustrated in S11 Fig. The median values of all recording sites within the input and output layers from one probe placement were used for interlaminar comparison, and under these conditions, an error-bar indicating the SEM is also shown. Otherwise, each recording site was used as an independent repetition. To test whether there was a difference between the medians of 2 groups, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired groups and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for independent groups. Unless explicitly stated, a two-sided test was used. The Kruskal–Wallis test, employed to compare medians across multiple groups, was supplemented with the Bonferroni method to adjust for multiple comparisons. To determine if the median of a group was different from 0, we used a sign test. The chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to compare the proportions of 2 groups. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to test the correlation between 2 variables. All error bars represent the median ± SEM (standard error of the mean), unless otherwise noted. (A) Dispersion of RF centers and consistency of preferred orientation of all probe placements. RF Center Dispersion (the abscissa) is calculated as , where (xi, yi) and σi are the center position and radius of the ith recording site, N is the number of recording sites in one probe placement, and is the averaged center position across N probe placements. The numerator represents the variance of RF center positions, and the denominator is the population-averaged RF diameter. A smaller value indicates less variation in RF centers across all recording sites. Preferred Orientation Consistency (the ordinate) is calculated as , where θi is the preferred orientation of the ith recording site and |C| is the amplitude of a complex value. A larger value indicates higher consistency in preferred orientations across all recording sites. Each dot represents 1 probe placement. Results from 3 example probe placements are shown in B–D. (B–D) Example probe placements with RF Center Dispersion and Preferred Orientation Consistency as indicated in A.

MUA and LFP responses were normalized by their maximum absolute response over time at each recording site. MUA responses show that the input layers (L4 and L6) leads the output layers (L2/3 and L5) and exhibits a stronger rebound [21]. LFP and CSD responses indicate a latency change between L2/3 and L4 and a polarity reversal between L5 and L6. (B) Distribution of electrode number within each layer from all probe placements. For the U-Probe (100-μm interelectrode distance), electrode numbers in the output layers (L2/3 and L5) are shown in blue, and those in the input layers (L4 and L6) are shown in red. For Probe64D Sharp (50-μm interelectrode distance), electrode numbers are shown in black.

The horizontal dashed line indicates a cumulative proportion of 0.5, and the vertical dashed line represents a DSI of 1/3. The median value and SEM of the DSI for both layers are shown at the top. The proportions of recording sites exhibiting strong direction selectivity (DSI > 1/3) with the input and output layers are denoted by colored arrows on the right. Statistical comparisons for median DSI values (at the top) and proportions of recording sites with strong direction selectivity (on the right) between the output layers and the input layers are also shown. (C) Comparison of DSIs between L2/3 and L4 within the same probe placement. For each probe placement, we obtained the median value and SEM of the DSI across all recording sites in L2/3 and in L4.

(B) Comparison of DSIs between the output layers and the input layers within the same probe placement from all sorted single units. Within the same cortical column, direction selectivity was enhanced in the output layers (N = 24 probe placements, p = 0.0036; Wilcoxon signed-rank test), and the DSIs between the output layers and the input layers were highly correlated (r = 0.4783, p = 0.0192; Spearman’s ρ).

Left: Cumulative distributions of DSIs in the output layers (blue line) and the input layers (red line). Compared to the input layers, the output layers exhibited a significantly larger DSI (output layers: 0.5612+0.0218, N = 145 single units; input layers: 0.3663+0.0251, N = 118 single units; interlaminar difference: p = 0.0011; Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and had a larger proportion of recording sites with strong direction selectivity (proportion of recording sites with DSI > 1/3, output layers: 73.79%, N = 145 single units; input layers: 55.08%, N = 118 single units; interlaminar difference: p = 0.0015; chi-square goodness-of-fit test).

(E) Similar to C, but for narrow-spiking units only. The DSIs of the output and input layers showed no significant difference (output layers: 0.6582+0.0348, N =50 single units; input layers: 0.5083+0.0555, N =28 single units; interlaminar difference: p = 0.1708; Wilcoxon rank-sum test), with a similar proportion of recording sites exhibiting strong direction selectivity (proportion of recording sites with DSI > 1/3, output layers: 80%, N = 50 single units; input layers: 75%, N = 28 single units; interlaminar difference: p = 6079; chi-square goodness-of-fit test).

Left, Model II in the main text. Middle and right, neuronal responses in the input layers are first multiplied by a linear gain (G), then subtracted by a suppressive component (S), and finally passed through a rectified-linear nonlinearity (ReLU) to simulate output layer responses. In Model III (middle panel), the linear gain is direction-tuned while the suppression is untuned to direction. In Model IV (right panel), the linear gain is untuned to direction and the suppression is direction-tuned. The exemplar neuronal responses in the input and output layers are the same as those in Fig 4A, and are also presented as mean ± SEMs. (B) Comparison of adjusted fitting goodness (adjR2) across Model II and Model III.

Title: ‘It’s a hilariously wonderful idea’: Coastal saunas a hot ticket amid icy Irish temperatures

Dublin swimming haven the Forty Foot provided the unlikely – and blustery – backdrop for a mobile sauna in the days before Christmas. Over the past 250 years, the much loved bathing spot, at a promontory in Sandycove beside the James Joyce Tower, has witnessed many a sight, most famously, perhaps, Buck Mulligan’s dip there in Ulysses. But one suspects that even Joyce couldn’t have imagined a wooden 10-person sauna on wheels perched there, overlooking the sea. It was as if an alien spaceship had landed, with hardy swimmers and walkers stopping to gawp as they rounded the concrete wind shelters of the Forty Foot, on a rocky outcrop reaching into Dublin Bay. The spot has become temporary home to the The Hot Box Sauna company, which has been awarded a licence by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The council became the first of Dublin’s local authorities to trial the use of mobile saunas as part of a pilot scheme over two months in December and January. Others are situated at Killiney beach and Dún Laoghaire Baths. Helen Smirnova, a civil engineer with the council’s Infrastructure and Climate Change division, said that for the previous year the council had been receiving requests for saunas to be installed. “We were asked if we would be interested in placing saunas in public grounds. There are a lot of saunas in private grounds but only one or two other local authorities around the country allow this scheme,” she said. [ Tailbacks from Forty Foot stretch for miles as Christmas swimmers descendOpens in new window ] Ms Smirnova said the council decided to begin the trial after it was approached by people involved in the business and by members of the public. “We can’t just allow someone to set up and we couldn’t prioritise one particular vendor over another,” she said. “We had to make it a fair competition for those applying for the licence. It’s a good opportunity to do a trial and what we viewed as the best service providers were given a licence.” Up to 15 applications were made to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council; five saunas are now based in the three locations and have the option to open from 7am to 7pm three days weekly. One of the key stipulations for operators is that they must provide their own insurance. Whether or not the saunas become permanent features hasn’t yet been decided. The council will consider factors such as what the atmosphere is like around the pop-ups, cleanliness, traffic and safety. [ Rediscovering Ireland’s sea sauna tradition: ‘It’s like a modern-day pub, except you leave feeling great’Opens in new window ] Ms Smirnova said the council “wanted to find out if the locals were okay with the set up”. She said there had not been “a major amount of complaints as of yet” but some concerns had been raised. The council will compile a report and make a decision within months on whether or not to continue the scheme, she added; the saunas would be run by private entities, with tenders for each location advertised. Meanwhile, Waterford City and County Council has licensed two outdoor saunas, or hot pods, which are operating at Kilmurrin Cove and Clonea Strand. A spokesperson said the “general reaction has been very positive” and that the local authority intends to extend the offering. Back at the Forty Foot, friends Kate Blaney, Jane Young and Caroline Somers, from Sandycove, Booterstown and Blackrock respectively, were full of praise for the concept of a local authority licensing saunas. Ms Somers said she loved it. “It’s great for this time of year to encourage people to use saunas while getting in and out of the sea,” she said. “The council should definitely try to keep it operating.” Ms Young was introduced to the pop-up by a friend. “They are a great addition,” she said. Ian McColl, from Dún Laoghaire, who happened upon the sauna while out walking his dog, said that if he had known about it before he “would have definitely used it”. “It’s a hilariously wonderful idea,” he said. Micheál Beirne (23) who works for The Hot Box Sauna company, which operates in five locations around Ireland, said the business takes all concerns from members of the public on board, including over whether a person’s body can cope with going from hot to cold temperatures so quickly. “In Finland and, indeed, other Scandinavian countries, the use of saunas outdoors is part of their culture. When using a sauna people should go at their own pace,” he said. The majority of people “love it”, Mr Beirne said of the concept. “I get great satisfaction from this job. I love hearing about how people found out about saunas,” he said. “Saunas are a good place for people to socialise. It gets them outdoors and in this day and age, with our fast pace of life and social media, individuals are feeling the burden of loneliness. In Finland 80 per cent of people who use such saunas are aged over 60.” Forty-five minute slots can be booked for €15; all users must be aged over 18. The trial ends on Friday, January 31st. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Disturbing your silence is my job but I want to make a little room for peace

“Hello from somewhere in the sky over Brussels,” my phone flashes. The tingle from my friend’s message so many kilometres up in the sky gives me the tiniest sense of what those 1979 internet pioneers must have felt when they sent the word “Lo” across the world wide web. As the initial thrill of contact fades, it feels not like my friend and I had cracked a code of the modern era but that we’d broken a secret code. The inside of a giant metal box in the sky has become an unlikely sacred space. It is oddly one of the few truly disconnected places we have left. Disconnected with the outside world, connected with ourselves, where we are. Yes, sometimes my head gets unintentionally connected with my seat-neighbour’s pungent armpit. But I am present. In the discomfort of that noxious connection. (While I do know some airlines have had wifi for years, I am, like most Irish people, on the low-budget, short-haul end of the aviation world.) Another unlikely sanctuary is the rail line surrounding Seapoint Dart station. For years this Bermuda triangle of mobile phone signal would make me audibly gasp in frustration, as I’d hear the “beep, beep, beep” of my cut-off phone call or see “no internet connection” cross my screen over and over in the middle of adding Weetabix to my online supermarket order. Smartphones make the harried and frazzled life of a full-time working parent just-about possible. Fifteen years ago I’d have had to give my whole Saturday morning over to the weekly shop instead of simply adding milk and butter to my virtual basket on my journey to work. Or I’d have to stay in the office late instead of answering urgent emails at my kitchen table while discussing river erosion over a fourth class geography book. But mobile phones also leave us with few silent retreats. There are almost no gaps for the thoughts to creep in, to give us perspective. You could describe the five-minute journey between Salthill and Blackrock Dart stations, catching glimpses of the daily colour-changes of Dublin Bay, as unproductive. But it is in these slivers that there is room to stop and listen and hear what is inside. Whether it is good or bad. Joyful or painful. We are surrounded by ways to pull us out of our inner life. This always-on world is reliably at hand to offer us a distraction. And distraction is a broad church. From “being productive” in buying gifts, or proofreading a report on your phone before a deadline, to aimlessly watching videos we don’t even control, engrossed by the TikTok Chicken Dance challenge ... scroll, scroll, scrolling the algorithm. [ Pro tips from ancient thinkers: why are people in their teens and twenties suddenly so obsessed by the Stoics?Opens in new window ] If there is pain or grief to be felt or deep thinking to be had, there is the soothing flicker of the screen to help us keep it light, keep it in the shallow, to numb us. Emptiness lets things rise to the top. It lets reflection catch you unawares. I pass a familiar-looking house and feel a jolt inside. I don’t reach for my phone. I remember my recently-passed vibrant sister. I hear her lovely laugh and smile. I feel her warm welcome. I know I’ve an emptiness at missing her. But most importantly I feel this. Swimming also brings me to this reposeful place. For 30 minutes there is just me and my strokes and the water. Surprising ideas enter my head, as if randomly out of nowhere. But I wonder were they just in a queue, waiting for some room to bubble up. Going back to my locker at the pool always brings the same tightness in my chest. I pick up my phone with a twitch. What have I missed? Are my kids okay? The screen almost always tells the same story. At most there’s some breaking news push alert on a new twist in the big story of the day from one of the dozen news sites I’ve signed up to for work. My relief and disappointment are simultaneous. I am sharply aware of the irony of me writing on this topic. For disturbing the silence is my job. Daily I send Irish Times news notifications to people’s phones. I try to make enticing social media posts and catchy headlines, to pull readers out of their worlds, away from their own thoughts. Distracted by the dopamine hit of a breaking story. [ Dermot Whelan: ‘Mindfulness isn’t a cult. We don’t have to get naked and cover ourselves in hummus’Opens in new window ] But this merely reflects the hyperconnected world we all occupy. In so many ways the phone in my pocket gives me power, productivity, flexibility, in my attempt to “have it all”. So today I speak for making a little room for peace and silence. Let’s never fix the signal gap at Seapoint Dart station. And Ryanair and Aer Lingus, don’t even think about giving us wifi on board our short-haul flights. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

(NYSE:BABA) call options and a 94.69% increase in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) direct holdings, according to its third quarter 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. What Happened: The $69 billion hedge increased Alibaba call options from 5,200 contracts in the second quarter to 4.74 million contracts in the third quarter. Similarly, it raised its put options in Alibaba by 281.79%, from 1.49 million to 5.71 million contracts, while scaling back its direct shareholding in the company by 21.97%, from 2.08 million shares to 1.62 million shares.

If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Millennium also rebalanced its investments in other major companies. The firm reduced its stake in NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 12.57%, cutting its direct holdings from 12.75 million shares in the second quarter to 11.15 million shares in the third quarter. Call options on Nvidia were trimmed by 19.75%, from 15.17 million to 12.17 million contracts, while put options decreased by 21.06%, from 38.63 million to 30.50 million contracts. The hedge fund significantly increased its position in Broadcom, nearly doubling its direct holdings to 1.15 million shares, up from 592,501 shares in the second quarter. Call options in Broadcom surged 966.56%, climbing from 271,100 to 2.89 million contracts, while put options rose 863.89%, from 492,500 to 4.75 million contracts. In other notable moves, Millennium increased its direct holdings in Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) by 51.36%, bringing its stake from 3.04 million shares to 4.60 million shares. Call options in Microsoft rose slightly by 5.31%, from 2.91 million to 3.06 million contracts, while put options declined by 11.63%, from 4.88 million to 4.31 million contracts.

Call options in Tesla dropped by 17.16%, from 3.93 million to 3.26 million contracts, while put options saw a steep decline of 38.31%, from 9.10 million to 5.62 million contracts. Why It Matters: Millennium made notable changes to its holdings in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), raising its direct stake by 80.97%, from 3.08 million shares to 5.57 million shares. Call options in SPY decreased slightly by 2.01%, from 3.74 million to 3.67 million contracts, while put options increased by 34.89%, from 6.44 million to 8.68 million contracts. Millennium, founded by Englander in 1989 with just $35 million, showed notable activity across other major holdings. The fund increased its Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) position with a 10.8 million purchase of iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NYSE:IBIT). The investment shifts occur as Millennium faces potential structural changes. The firm is reportedly in early-stage discussions with BlackRock Inc. regarding a possible equity stake sale, which would mark the first external investment in Millennium’s management company during its 35-year history. Englander, who began his career as a floor broker and trader on the American Stock Exchange, has maintained 100% ownership of Millennium since its inception. The firm employs multiple investment strategies, including relative value, equity arbitrage, fixed income, and quantitative approaches. Check It Out: Arrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord.

In October 2024, Arrived sold The Centennial, achieving a total return of 34.7% (11.2% average annual returns) for investors.

Title: Turbulent Timeways returns for seven weeks of Timewalking dungeons, plus the new Timely Buzzbee mount!

NEXT | Khadgar's countdown is over, so here's how to earn the Witness of t... While we wait for The War Within patch 11.1, the WoW developers continue to give us a steady stream of content with the return of the Turbulent Timeways. For the next seven weeks we’ll have an active Timewalking event, encouraging us to revisit old dungeons and factions. In addition to the standard rewards from Timewalking, this Turbulent Timeways event will reward us with with the Timely Buzzbee mount for completing the Master of the Turbulent Timeways 2 achievement, which is a meta-achievement requiring you to run dungeons for five of the seven weeks. If you need another reason to jump in, there’s also increased gear rewards: the weekly quest to complete five Timewalking dungeons will reward a cache with Heroic Nerub-ar Palace gear (item level 610-619) instead of Normal difficulty loot. These pieces can also be upgraded with crests to increase their power.If you’re more concerned about the collectibles available with Timewalking Badges, the Turbulent Timeways event is a great time to stock up on them: you can get 500 a week on each character via the quest drop you get by running a single Timewalking dungeon, with additional Badges for every boss you kill. Those still looking to purchase mounts will be well on their way, and if there are any other items you are missing — or reputation you want to finish — now’s the perfect time to acquire them. Reputation gains for the week’s faction are boosted by 50% and you can buy tokens for bonus reputation at Timewalking vendors. You may even be lucky enough to acquire the Infinite Timereaver, which is what I keep telling myself every time I queue up.Since the most recent Timewalking event (ignoring the persistent Classic Timewalking during the 20th Anniversary) was for Cataclysm, the Turbulent Timeways will start with Mists of Pandaria Timewalking the week of January 7.

Title: Bitcoin’s Price Prediction For 2025: What To Watch For This Year
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/bitcoin-price-prediction-2025/
Time Published: 2025-01-07T21:12:48Z
Full Content:
As 2025 unfolds, bitcoin’s trajectory will be shaped by increased sovereign adoption, liquidity ... [+] dynamics and integration into corporate treasuries. Bitcoin’s remarkable journey in 2024 set the stage for a transformative year. With institutional adoption skyrocketing, regulatory clarity improving and technological advancements accelerating, the question on everyone’s mind is: where will bitcoin go in 2025? This article explores bitcoin’s current state, the factors shaping its price, expert predictions, opportunities and challenges for the coming year. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious observer, here’s what you need to know about bitcoin’s potential in 2025. Bitcoin’s evolution in 2024 cemented its status as a mainstream asset. With its price breaching the $100,000 mark, it drew unprecedented interest from institutional investors, retail traders and governments. The approval of multiple spot bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was a pivotal moment, ushering billions in new liquidity and normalizing bitcoin as a legitimate investment vehicle. Institutional adoption was another major milestone. Leading firms like BlackRock and BNY Mellon embraced bitcoin, offering custody and trading solutions to their clients. This institutional confidence supported a dramatic and sustained rise in bitcoin’s price in 2024. Now, we may see a virtuous cycle of increased inflows and reduced volatility. Bitcoin’s position on corporate balance sheets also looks set to grow, with corporations like MicroStrategy expanding their holdings to record levels and dozens of other companies following suit. With regulatory frameworks becoming clearer and adoption growing across industries, bitcoin entered 2025 with significant momentum. Its resilience and unmatched monetary properties make it a cornerstone of the emerging digital financial ecosystem. Several forces are shaping bitcoin’s price in 2025, ranging from institutional adoption and regulatory developments to technological innovation. Together, these factors will determine whether bitcoin continues its upward trajectory or faces hurdles in its mainstream acceptance. Institutional participation in bitcoin markets reached historic levels in 2024, with firms like BlackRock, BNY Mellon and Fidelity integrating bitcoin into their offerings. Spot bitcoin ETFs, hailed as a watershed moment, provided regulated avenues for large capital pools, such as pension funds and retirement accounts, to gain exposure. This wave of adoption not only brought new liquidity but also reduced market volatility, making bitcoin more attractive to risk-averse investors. In 2025, increased institutional participation could further stabilize bitcoin’s price and cement its role as a core portfolio asset for long-term wealth preservation. Regulation played a defining role in bitcoin’s 2024 success, with the SEC approving multiple spot ETFs and clarifying its stance on bitcoin as a commodity. These developments bolstered investor confidence and fostered broader acceptance. Looking ahead, regulation could either propel bitcoin to new heights or present obstacles. In the long term, bitcoin will overcome any roadblocks put in its way by regulators, lobbies or financial institutions, because capital naturally flows into the hardest form of money available. However, financial incumbents can slow the speed of adoption if they mount a strong resistance to bitcoin. Bitcoin’s technological ecosystem continues to evolve, enhancing its scalability, privacy, and utility. “Layer 2” (L2) innovations like the Lightning Network enables near-instant transactions at negligible cost. Newer L2 technologies like Ark and Fedimints will continue to mature, pushing forward bitcoin’s viability as a medium of exchange. Upcoming advancements, such as privacy-enhancing features like Silent Payments and improved self-custody solutions will make bitcoin even more secure and accessible. Additionally, bitcoin-backed lending protocols are poised to unlock liquidity without requiring holders to give up custody of their assets. These developments will reinforce bitcoin’s appeal as both a currency and a store of value. The events of 2024 have sparked a wide range of predictions for bitcoin’s price in 2025, reflecting varying levels of optimism and caution. Bullish predictions for bitcoin's price in 2025 from posts on X suggest a significant upward trend. CNBC analyst Tom Lee’s target number is $250,000. Matthew Sigel of VanEck forecasts $180,000. These forecasts reflect a strong belief in continued institutional adoption, the impact of bitcoin ETFs, and the cyclical nature of bitcoin's price movements post-halving. Of course, mega-bulls like Cathie Wood and Michael Saylor expect multi-million dollar bitcoin in the next few years, though not necessarily in 2025. Bearish analysts caution against over-exuberance, highlighting macroeconomic risks like tightening monetary policies and potential regulatory crackdowns. A historical correlation with M2 suggests that bitcoin may depreciate as monetary conditions tighten. Peter L. Brandt, a respected market analyst, warns that his technical analysis might indicate a crash to $78,000, but that the price could then either continue declining or rise precipitously. There are no indicators that we have another “crypto winter” on the horizon, but then again, there weren’t any clear indicators that one was going to come in 2022, either. The collapse of the politically-connected money laundering operation known as FTX, and the subsequent attempts to cover up ties between stolen money and donations to prominent political leaders, unexpectedly blew up what had been a favorable macroeconomic environment for continued bitcoin price appreciation. The thing about black swans is that they are, well, black swans – there’s always a chance that bitcoin adoption will be temporarily held back by another liquidity crisis in fiat-based finance. Some price targets for 2025 are more neutral in nature. As a typical example, this X user suggests bitcoin might start the year with a dip around $80,000 to $85,000 due to the January inauguration, then recover to make new all-time highs but face rejections before trending higher into a blowoff top by the end of the year. Some investors who believe quantum computing advancements threaten bitcoin have rated BTC a “hold.” Although these investors are correct to point out that quantum computing will necessitate changes to bitcoin’s protocol, there is no reason to single out bitcoin in this regard. Encryption is a key part of virtually all modern businesses, so by this logic, all stocks would also be rated a hold indefinitely until company leadership can present a credible plan for post-quantum transition. In 2025, developments in regulation, technology, and mainstream acceptance are set to significantly impact bitcoin’s exchange rate with the dollar. Below are key trends that could drive bitcoin’s continued growth. Global liquidity conditions in 2025 may create a favorable environment for Bitcoin’s appreciation. China’s bond market rally, with 10-year yields hitting multi-decade lows due to rate cut expectations, signals a broader shift in economic policy. Simultaneously, U.S. Treasury bills are maturing at unprecedented levels, and there is a strong possibility that the U.S. federal government will pivot toward tariffs as a revenue source, which could significantly raise the prices of consumer and capital goods in the short term. These factors point to an inflationary environment, with the Federal Reserve likely constrained in its ability to tighten monetary policy further. Historically, such inflationary pressures have resulted in asset price increases, which would mean bitcoin’s price could rise alongside stocks, real estate and other stores of value. Sovereign adoption of bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset remains a compelling possibility for 2025. In the U.S., the regulatory shift toward bitcoin-friendly policies, exemplified by pro-bitcoin voices within the Trump administration, could set a precedent for broader acceptance. This legitimacy, in turn, could prompt other nations to explore bitcoin as a reserve asset. Sovereign adoption also reduces circulating supply, as reserves are typically held long-term and removed from active market liquidity. As more nations accumulate bitcoin for strategic reserves, a combination of reduced supply and increased demand could lead to sustained price increases. Mainstream integration of bitcoin into business treasury operations could be a defining trend in 2025. MicroStrategy’s addition to the QQQ index signaled that markets are increasingly willing to embrace companies with substantial bitcoin holdings. Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule change now allows companies to report bitcoin holdings at fair market value rather than cost basis, making it more appealing for firms to hold bitcoin without distorting their balance sheets. An emerging ecosystem for collateralized lending, including bitcoin-backed debt instruments, is also taking shape. This development enables companies to secure liquidity without selling their bitcoin holdings, effectively integrating bitcoin-backed financing into standard business operations. As more firms adopt these practices, bitcoin’s role as a core asset for financial resilience and growth will become more prominent, driving further adoption and market demand. Despite bitcoin’s remarkable progress, several challenges could impact its growth in 2025. These include state-led attempts to control financial systems, speculative concerns around future technologies, and macroeconomic uncertainties. Understanding these potential hurdles is crucial for gauging bitcoin’s resilience and long-term outlook. As bitcoin adoption grows, state actors may attempt to assert control over financial sovereignty through regulatory measures and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), outlined ambitious plans for 2025, including launching the digital euro and reshaping euro banknotes. These initiatives are part of a broader strategy to maintain influence over monetary systems amid growing inflationary pressures. CBDCs could be used to limit bitcoin’s role by offering a state-backed alternative, potentially accompanied by stricter regulations on decentralized currencies. However, history shows that attempts to suppress bitcoin often have the opposite effect, driving adoption as users seek financial systems resistant to control and censorship. The geopolitical instability in regions like Europe, coupled with the ongoing U.S. embrace of bitcoin, could further highlight the contrast between permissionless money like bitcoin and state-issued digital assets. Fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) about quantum computing’s impact on bitcoin’s security has recently resurfaced in mainstream discourse. Critics claim that future quantum computers could break bitcoin’s cryptographic security, rendering the network vulnerable to attack. However, quantum computing will pose a problem for virtually all digital systems that modern life relies upon. Bitcoin’s encryption protocol can be upgraded to be quantum-safe. Upgrading thousands of other systems and protocols could be much more challenging. In reality, quantum computing is a problem for every single system that uses encryption, and will need to be addressed with a Y2K-style effort with all hands on deck. Quantum computing doesn’t pose a unique problem for bitcoin. Macroeconomic conditions remain a significant factor influencing bitcoin’s performance. Global economic uncertainty, driven by inflationary pressures, geopolitical conflicts and shifts in monetary policy, will continue to shape financial markets. In Europe, rising inflation rates and political instability — exacerbated by coalition collapses in major economies like Germany and France — add further complexity. In the U.S., fiscal challenges, including the potential shift to tariffs as a revenue stream, could influence both domestic and global financial dynamics. While bitcoin thrives in inflationary environments due to its scarcity, extreme economic instability can also deter adoption if liquidity becomes constrained. Conversely, prolonged economic turbulence could position bitcoin as a safe-haven asset for those seeking to preserve wealth outside traditional financial systems. Bitcoin’s trajectory in 2025 depends on a combination of factors, from institutional adoption and technological innovation to regulatory clarity. While short-term volatility remains likely, the long-term outlook for bitcoin is robust, with adoption trends and monetary properties driving its growth. However, nobody can predict the price of bitcoin. Investors should approach this asset class with a long-term perspective, understanding its potential as a tool for generational wealth creation, not a reliable source of short term trading profits. As bitcoin continues to mature as an asset, the strategies for investing in it are evolving. This section explores key strategies — diversifying your portfolio, staying informed on market trends, and leveraging dollar-cost averaging — to help navigate bitcoin investing in 2025 and beyond. Bitcoin remains a high-growth asset with significant upside. BlackRock now recommends an optimal allocation of about 2%. What this means is that one of the largest financial firms in the world sees bitcoin as playing a role in managing the risk and growth potential of a mainstream portfolio. In 2025 and beyond, when we talk about diversification across asset classes, bitcoin will be assumed to be part of the picture. The mantra to simply buy and HODL bitcoin is easy to understand and follow, and has provided substantial returns over the long term. However, if you are one of those investors that feels like something is missing unless you’re actively researching and investing in market movers, the thing to watch in 2025 is corporate adoption. Companies that incorporate bitcoin into their treasury strategy may perform differently than others, as we saw with MicroStrategy in 2024. Several new ETFs are awaiting approval that would provide exposure to companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheets. Dollar-cost averaging allows investors to build a bitcoin position over time, reducing the impact of short-term price fluctuations. This technique lets you set it and forget it, rather than trying to time the market. Modern bitcoin platforms make it easy to dollar-cost average into bitcoin. Bitcoin’s journey through 2024 cemented its position as a cornerstone of the global financial landscape. Institutional adoption surged with the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, while regulatory clarity and technological advancements strengthened its appeal as a long-term asset. Despite potential challenges, including macroeconomic uncertainty and state-level opposition, bitcoin’s unmatched monetary properties continue to drive global demand. As 2025 unfolds, bitcoin’s trajectory will be shaped by increased sovereign adoption, liquidity dynamics and integration into corporate treasuries. Whether bullish or cautious, one fact remains indisputable — bitcoin’s adoption curve only points upward. Investors should approach this asset with a long-term perspective, recognizing it as a tool for generational wealth in an era where financial innovation and sound money converge. While predictions vary, long-term adoption trends suggest upward momentum, despite potential short-term volatility. That said, it is impossible to predict bitcoin’s price. You should always do your own research and consult your financial advisor before investing. Yes, institutional participation is a key driver, providing liquidity and stabilizing markets. ETFs and other traditional financial instruments are providing bitcoin exposure to investment portfolios that could never access it before. While there is always the possibility that a government decides to attack bitcoin using environmental policy, the political winds in the U.S. have shifted in such a decisive way in favor of bitcoin that I believe a major environmental campaign against bitcoin is unlikely in 2025. Bitcoin tends to appreciate over long time scales but exhibits price volatility in the short term. That’s why it’s usually a good idea to only invest what you can afford to set aside and not touch for a long time. Rather than timing the market, use dollar-cost averaging techniques to buy small amounts consistently over time. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

(NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other AI stocks on Wall Street's Radar. As reported by Reuters, Wall Street’s main indexes rose on Monday to more than one-week highs, driven by a rally in semiconductor stocks and news suggesting that the incoming Trump administration could adopt a less aggressive tariff stance than previously anticipated. READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Headlines Shaping Wall Street for 2025 and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm Microsoft has recently announced that it plans to invest $80 billion in AI-enabled data centers in fiscal 2025, suggesting how semiconductor demand is expected to remain strong this year. According to Citigroup, the company’s spending plan was a “modest positive” update as it removed the risk of a drop in capital expenditures. Ever since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022, investments in AI have surged drastically. Since AI requires drastic computing power, tech companies have been investing billions to enhance their AI infrastructures and broaden their data center networks. The race, however, isn’t just limited to the US. Efforts are being made to protect the country’s leadership in AI against the rest of the world, particularly China. China, in turn, has begun offering developing countries subsidized access to scarce chips, and it’s also promising to build local AI data centers. Moves like these could position the country as an AI leader in the future, something that the US is actively making efforts to avoid. However, regardless of the capital expenditures companies are making toward AI, one analyst says that these are no longer going to be enough in 2025. David Dietze of Peapack Private Wealth Management said that a major theme for 2025 is going to be “Show Me The Money”. Dietze said that even though major companies have been investing billions in AI partnerships and similar initiatives, investors are soon going to be demanding proof of returns. “Wall Street’s the type of place where it’s like, ‘Show me the money, like, yesterday…These investments and capital expenditures are great, but when does the cash flow start coming in? And right now many AI companies have gotten a pass on that, but I think increasingly Wall Street’s going to say, ‘No, we’ve seen the capital expenditures, you’ve got the AI label, but now we want to see the cash flows coming in from that. And that’s what we’re gonna be watching so carefully next year”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:PLTR) is a leading provider of artificial intelligence systems. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) has had a spectacular year fueled by artificial intelligence, but an analyst from Morgan Stanley has recently turned negative on the red-hot stock. On January 6th, analyst Sanjit Singh assumed company coverage with an “Underweight” rating and placed a $60 price target on the stock, an estimated 25% downside from Friday’s close. According to Singh, despite Palantir’s (PLTR) early AI strides, the potential risks seem to outweigh the potential rewards. The firm, which hadn’t previously rated the stock, acknowledged that the company has been performing well and has good momentum, but also contended that the stock price already reflects this success which is “more than priced in at the current multiple premium”. “The skills/capabilities of the enterprise with respect to building AI applications should likely improve, which may make it difficult for Palantir (PLTR) to sustain its current level of momentum, creating downside risk given the premium valuation of the shares”. Overall, PLTR ranks 8th on our list of AI stocks on Wall Street's Radar. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: BlackRock may exit woke business climate group Net Zero Alliance as backlash over ESG investing widens
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/01/07/business/blackrock-exits-net-zero-alliance-as-backlash-over-esg-investing-widens/
Time Published: 2025-01-07T18:11:28Z
Full Content:
BlackRock — which for years has courted controversy with its focus on so-called ESG, or Environmental Social Governance investing — is considering an exit of the so-called “Net Zero” coalition of top corporations who pledge to reach zero-carbon emissions by 2050, The Post has learned. The investment giant led by billionaire CEO Larry Fink is poised for a pivot from dictates of the United Nations-sponsored “Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative” as pressure grows on big corporations to reverse their woke business agendas. It comes as others have announced plans to leave a sister UN coalition for mega banks. In recent days, the nation’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, plus Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, said they are dropping their membership from the UN climate coalition. BlackRock’s likely departure is more significant. The world’s largest investment fund, with more than $10 trillion in assets under management, was a leader in ESG investing, with its top executives including Fink evangelizing on the need to use the company’s investing might to force corporations to reduce their carbon footprint. A political backslash recently forced Fink and BlackRock to reverse course on ESG and now other big ESG asset managers are doing so as well. The Post has learned that State Street and JPMorgan Asset Management are moving toward leaving the asset-management alliance. BlackRock press officials declined comment. A rep for State Street and JPMorgan didn’t return a call for comment. A press official for the alliance declined to comment. The Net Zero Initiative describes itself as a is an “international group of asset managers committed, consistent with their fiduciary duty to their clients and beneficiaries, to supporting the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner, in line with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius; and to supporting investing aligned with net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner.” When BlackRock joined the Net Zero Initiative in 2021 with other major asset managers and corporations, it was seen as a way to institutionalize so-called sustainable investing in the corporate ecosystem. But soon thereafter, a swift political backlash developed; sustainable energy investing faced stiff opposition to GOP politicians who ran large state pension funds in red states such as Texas and Florida. Rising inflation came after the COVID lockdowns ended, and higher gas prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made sustainability efforts politically toxic. Members of Congress even suggested that the Net Zero Alliance violated antitrust laws since it forced corporations to operate in concert to achieve what they called dubious aims of climate sustainability while causing working class people to suffer. Fink himself became the subject of scorn and BlackRock lost more than $1 trillion on assets as red state treasurers boycotted the firm for managing pension assets. Fink has been slowly walking back his once strident proselytizing of ESG. BlackRock money managers in the US are no longer under pressure to use ESG screens in all investment decisions, instead doing it just for clients that ask for such methods. It has vastly scaled back supporting ESG-related proxy proposals or shareholder votes. As a result, BlackRock, AUM has largely recovered to $11 trillion. Leaving the alliance, however, is a further sign that BlackRock and corporate America in general sees even more consumer and political pushback not just in ESG investing, but in all aspects of corporate wokeism. In recent years major corporations have begun to embrace progressive policies in the boardroom using so-called Diversity Equity and Inclusion policies in hiring and image making. A consumer backlash ensued as well as a Supreme Court ruling making such de facto hiring quotas illegal, prompting scores of companies to now reverse their DEI policies. Incoming president Donald Trump has vowed to end DEI in federal contracting, and to issue executive orders reversing the Biden administration’s attempt to employ ESG to scaled back US oil drilling, adding to the pressure on big companies to reverse such progressive policies.

Title: Why Wall Street Banks Are Suddenly Quitting A Global Climate Group
URL: https://observer.com/2025/01/banks-quite-climate-alliance/
Time Published: 2025-01-07T17:19:32Z

From Goldman Sachs (GS) to Morgan Stanley (MS), many of the largest banks in the U.S. are quitting an international climate group amid rising political pressure as the nation enters a second Trump presidency. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. First launched in April 2021, the United Nations’ Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) aims to make the financial sector more environmentally sustainable by converges banks, insurers and investors to set sustainability targets in line with the group’s standards. The NZBA has more than 140 bank members across 44 countries that manage $64 trillion in total assets. But in recent weeks, U.S. banks have been pulling out of the group en masse. Goldman Sachs was the first major Wall Street bank to pull out of the NZBA, announcing its departure on Dec. 6 without giving a reason. The move came just days after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued BlackRock (BLK), Vanguard and State Street—three of the largest asset managers in the world—for conspiring to manipulate energy markets. Paxton accused these institutional investors for pressuring coal companies in which they own large stakes into reducing production and deceiving investors into pursuing ESG (environmental, social and governance) strategies. On its website, Goldman Sachs still keeps its commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emission by 2030 across its operations and supply chain. The bank said it’s still “very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world.” Wells Fargo (WFC) announced its departure from the group on Dec. 20. Again, the bank did not provide a reason but maintains a sustainability page on its website, which includes a goal to reduce energy usage from 2019 levels by half before 2030. Four days before Wells Fargo’s withdrawal, a number of climate advocacy groups co-published a letter to the NZBA addressing “slipping standards” within the group. “The alliance must not seek to appease or accommodate potential defectors or remain complacent when its members dilute their targets, as doing so undermines the very purpose of the coalition and jeopardizes global climate goals,” the letter said. For instance, Morgan Stanley loosened its target to align with the Paris Agreement’s maximum warming goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius to 1.7 degrees Celsius—“a lower ambition scenario requiring less emissions reductions by the bank,” the letter said. Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) both quit the NZBA on the last day of 2024. Citi said it’s working towards its own goals outside of the group while Bank of America said it will continue working with clients on environmental issues and meeting their needs. Like their peers, Citi’s net-zero goals and Bank of America’s environmental sustainability commitments remain published on their respective websites. Both banks seek to achieve net-zero carbon emission across its financing activities, operations and supply chain by 2050. Morgan Stanley quit the NZBA on Jan. 2. The bank also gave no reason for its defection but maintains its internal climate goals. The bank says it reached carbon neutrality in 2022, but is still working on reaching net-zero financed emissions, with interim goals set for 2030. Some ESG experts see the exodus as more of an attempt to align with political pressure than a retreat from climate commitments. “Financing sustainable initiatives is increasingly linked to long-term profitability and market demand,” Sunil Kansal, head of consulting and valuation services at the ESG consulting firm Shasat, told Observer. “What matters is not the framework but the outcome. Banks will continue to drive the green transition, adapting their strategies to evolving circumstances.” “These exits are not a rejection of climate action. They reflect a reaction to multiple factors,” Chris Pyke, chief innovation officer at the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), told Observer. He alluded to factors like reporting burdens, challenging targets and—perhaps most relevant for U.S. banks—antitrust scrutiny from Republican lawmakers. As the nation heads into a second Trump presidency, efforts to firm up environmental reporting regulations are likely to fall flat given his anti-regulation stance.

Title: Earthquakes and Blowouts Undermine Case for Carbon Storage in Texas
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2025/01/07/807181.htm
Time Published: 2025-01-07T17:03:27Z

Texas has seen surging interest from companies hoping to bury carbon dioxide in its oilfields, putting the state at the vanguard of a government-subsidized program to fight climate change. But pumping CO2 into the ground could exacerbate earthquakes and well blowouts already happening in the Permian Basin as Texas struggles to manage wastewater disposal, potentially undermining public support. “Without legitimate oversight of underground injection in Texas, we expect more geyser-like well blowouts, sinkholes, leaks from plugged and unplugged wells, and injection-induced earthquakes,” said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, a Texas watchdog group pushing for tougher oversight of the oil and gas industry. Such consequences have rarely happened as a result of CO2 injection over the decades the technology has been deployed. The unprecedented vast volume of carbon now proposed for burial, however, worries activists and researchers. Carbon sequestration is vital to U.S. government goals to reduce emissions that cause global warming. The Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, landmark climate-change legislation, includes billions of dollars worth of subsidies for CCS projects. While President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to gut the IRA, energy experts say CCS subsidies will likely survive due to bipartisan support. Trump’s transition team did not provide comment. Several companies, including Occidental Petroleum OXY.N, plan to take advantage of IRA subsidies. The projects are concentrated in Texas, where CCS proponents argue underground geology is ideal for storing liquid and gaseous waste. PERMIT APPLICATIONS JUMP Over the last 12 months, the number of applications filed with the Environmental Protection Agency for carbon injection permits in Texas has jumped by 63% to 43, according to the agency, making it a national leader. But Texas is dogged by problems linked to disposal of drilling wastewater underground. The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) regulator has grappled with leaks and blowouts from orphan wells, as well as earthquakes, triggered by higher pressure underground from water injection. Reuters spoke with a dozen Texas landowners and researchers who said proposed CO2 projects need more oversight than the state can offer to avert environmental and safety risks. The RRC is seeking authority from the EPA to oversee its own permitting program for carbon sequestration to speed up approvals. The EPA, which is also reviewing Texas’ handling of wastewater permitting following the blowouts, said the request was being considered. The RRC said in a statement it is capable of effectively regulating CO2 injection wells, adding it has hired more staff. Trump’s victory increases the chances Texas will get this authority, experts say. North Dakota was the first state to receive oversight authority during Trump’s first term and its governor, Doug Burgum, is Trump’s pick for interior secretary, which includes responsibility for drilling permits on federal land. Burgum did not respond to requests for comment. REASON FOR CONCERN One of the biggest Texas projects is the Stratos direct air capture joint venture in Ector County between Occidental and asset manager BlackRock. It is expected to inject 8.5 million metric tons of CO2 starting next year. The county has numerous abandoned wells at risk of erupting if underground pressure rises and CO2 eats away at cement plugs, said oil and gas attorney Sarah Stogner, who represents landowners that have had blowouts. There have been 19,700 wells drilled in the county since 1993, according to data from state agencies. Nineteen are orphan wells, with no company legally responsible for ensuring they remain plugged, including three close to the Stratos site. Raymond Straub, a hydrogeologist who owns a Texas groundwater services firm, testified at an October EPA hearing that he was concerned Occidental did not devote enough attention to the unplugged or badly plugged orphan wells in the project area. Occidental spokesperson William Fitzgerald said the company had done extensive site surveys to ensure it would be safe. “This survey confirmed the location of three wells, which Occidental will address prior to beginning CO2 injection,” he said. “There is more than 3,000 feet of confining rock layers above the sequestration zone to securely contain the CO2.” A pilot project by agribusiness ADM ADM.N in Illinois, the first of its kind meant to demonstrate the technical feasibility of commercial carbon injection, has suffered leaks and other setbacks, underscoring worries. ADM spokesperson Jackie Anderson said the leaks have presented no risk to surface or groundwater or to public health, and that the company is confident in CCS technology. Dominic DiGiulio, an independent energy analyst and former EPA official who has studied CCS, said, however, that CO2 can corrode the cement casings of plugged wells. “These abandoned wells will in fact leak,” he said. A 2023 paper by Chinese researchers, published in Earth-Science Reviews, said CO2 injection could also boost the risk of earthquakes. The researchers did not respond to requests for comment. Large leaks could acidify groundwater, and suffocate people and animals if it displaces oxygen above ground, according to nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust. “This is supposed to be permanent storage,” said Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network. “If it can’t even contain it for 10 years, why do we think it can contain it forever?” she added, referring to ADM’s project.

With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is immune to inflation in a way that traditional currencies simply can’t match. The financial landscape is evolving, and Bitcoin is at the forefront of this transformation. What started as a niche experiment is now being embraced by major institutions like BlackRock, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and even nations like El Salvador as their required currency. For business owners, the question is no longer if Bitcoin will play a role in the future of finance but how it will benefit their businesses today. Why Bitcoin Matters for Business Owners Bitcoin’s unique appeal lies in its scarcity.

This makes Bitcoin a customer payment option and a strategic asset for businesses looking to meet customers where they’re at and store value. Forward-thinking business owners are already exploring how Bitcoin can: Adopting Bitcoin doesn’t have to be risky or complex. I’ve designed a five-week implementation project specifically for business owners. It starts small—just $100—and focuses on three actionable steps: The goal is simple: to make Bitcoin accessible and practical for businesses of all sizes.

We came across a bullish thesis on IDT Corporation (NYSE:IDT) on Substack by LittleBarnSparrow. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on IDT. IDT Corporation (NYSE:IDT)'s share was trading at $46.87 as of Jan 6th. IDT’s trailing P/E was 16.05 according to Yahoo Finance. A technician inserting a credit card into a point-of-sale machine for identity authentication. IDT Corporation, a diversified holding company, has emerged as a compelling investment opportunity, balancing legacy businesses with high-growth segments. Its portfolio includes three stagnating or declining legacy businesses and three rapidly expanding ventures with significant addressable markets. Recent results underscore IDT's strong operational performance, robust balance sheet, and strategic investments aimed at amplifying profitability through operating leverage. This positions IDT as a well-rounded company with promising near- and long-term growth prospects. The standout performer, National Retail Solutions (NRS), specializes in providing Point-of-Sale (PoS) systems and associated recurring services to small retailers. In the latest quarter, NRS reported a 26.5% revenue increase, with recurring revenues up 29%, driven by improved ARPU and expanding profitability margins. Despite cyclicality in advertising revenue, the company has strategically diversified its revenue streams, now relying more on payment processing and software solutions, which offer higher-quality, non-cyclical growth. NRS is actively broadening its total addressable market by targeting verticals like small restaurants, hotels, and gas stations. With adjusted EBITDA margins now at 25% and a trajectory toward $135 million in revenues by 2025, NRS is on track to deliver approximately $35 million in EBITDA, making it a cornerstone of IDT’s growth story. The Fintech segment, led by BOSS Money, IDT's money remittance business, has shown exceptional performance, with revenues surging 45% year-over-year. Management is prioritizing margin improvement, with adjusted EBITDA jumping to $4 million this quarter. Investments in working capital, particularly for disbursement funding, highlight a strategic commitment to sustaining strong growth in this high-potential area, supported by IDT's cash-rich position—a distinct competitive edge in a working capital-intensive industry. Net2Phone, IDT's cloud communications segment, reported 13% revenue growth despite currency headwinds, with ARPU improvements in premium services like Communication Center as a Service. While its performance is less dynamic than NRS or BOSS Money, it remains a steady contributor with strong growth prospects. Legacy businesses, which still account for a significant portion of revenue, provide a stable financial foundation, even as they lose share to the rapidly growing segments. With management's focus on building NRS into a multi-billion-dollar enterprise and leveraging the momentum of BOSS Money, IDT appears poised for substantial value creation. Despite the CEO's understated communication style, the company’s consistent results and strategic direction inspire confidence. At its current valuation, IDT offers a compelling investment case with significant upside potential fueled by its high-growth segments and operational excellence. IDT Corporation (NYSE:IDT) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 14 hedge fund portfolios held IDT at the end of the third quarter which was 15 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of IDT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Canadian Penny Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Galiano Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:GAU) stands against other best Canadian penny stocks to buy according to analysts. According to a report by the Government of Canada, released on December 16, the country’s economic outlook has been revised upward, as private-sector economists forecast moderate growth of around 2% in the second half of 2025. The report highlights the average of private sector forecasts are used as the basis for economic and fiscal planning in Canada to ensure objectivity and transparency. The Department of Finance surveyed a group of 11 private sector economists in September 2024, who expect the Canadian economy to benefit from robust growth in the US, driven by rising equity markets and increasing confidence among US households and businesses. The economists forecast that the unemployment rate will also stabilize to 6.6% by the end of 2025 compared to 6.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The report also states that the government is reducing the federal debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. The federal debt-to-GDP ratio in 2023-24 was 42.1% and is forecasted to decline to 41.9% in 2024-25.

In an interview with BNN Bloomberg on January 3, Gavin Graham, Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager at Spire Wealth Management, discussed the investment landscape for 2025, particularly focusing on Canadian stocks. Graham acknowledged that Canada has been a market leader in cutting interest rates which provides them a much better position than their U.S. counterparts, specifically in sectors such as pipelines, utilities, REITs, telecom, and financials, which are interest-rate sensitive industries. In the energy sector, Graham expressed a preference for natural gas companies which have performed well due to low cost structure and the potential for increased demand due to the anticipation of colder weather in the US. Despite the local weather-related volatility in North America, he sees a positive outlook for the sector due to the impact of geopolitical events, such as Ukraine ending its gas imports from Russia, which could further influence natural gas prices. Graham also recommended that investors allocate 5 to 10% of their portfolios to gold, citing the robust performance of gold miners. He noted that while gold itself was up 27% last year, gold miners have underperformed relative to the metal and suggests that major gold miners have the potential to outperform. Gold mining stocks, being a leveraged play on the price of gold, could see significant gains if the gold price continues to rise and can offer attractive dividend yields and a hedge against economic uncertainty. Canada’s economic outlook for 2025 appears optimistic, with moderate growth expectations, a stabilizing unemployment rate, and a declining interest rate along with the favourable federal debt-to-GDP ratio. Investors seeking diversification and high-growth potential should look at opportunities in undervalued sectors within the Canadian market. An aerial view of Asanko Gold Mine in Ghana, West Africa.

Title: Happy New Year, Bitcoin!

Bitcoin 2025 2024 was a big year for Bitcoin. It was the year of the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, the beginnings of corporate adoption of Bitcoin, and the first crossing of the hundred-thousand-dollar milestone. Of these, the ETF did the most to bring mass adoption to Bitcoin. Now, any retirement account can have Bitcoin exposure at the click of a button. Though it does not provide true bitcoin ownership in the form of self-custody of private keys, it does act as a gateway drug to get normies interested in Bitcoin. Perhaps the most important person of the year for Bitcoin was Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock. Fink has a low-profile presence in the financial press, but enough clout that his endorsement was enough to give comfort to vast pools of capital to invest in Bitcoin. BlackRock’s stamp of approval was a big win for Bitcoin, and the ETF inflows are likely what led to crossing the $100k threshold. Speaking of which, my favorite Bitcoin video of the year was God Save The Coin by Michael Goldstein of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute. It runs through all the different criticisms Bitcoin faced since its inception. At the end of the day, Bitcoin doesn't care and marches on. The narratives and criticism around Bitcoin will constantly shift and evolve, yet there is nothing like the market test to prove its value. Looking ahead, 2025 will be the year of corporate adoption of Bitcoin. This is already happening, with MicroStrategy leading the pack and open-sourcing its playbook for companies to convert their cash holdings into bitcoin. Not only have most of the bitcoin miners decided to HODL bitcoin, but so too have over a dozen other assorted companies. I expect a Fortune 500 company to buy bitcoin on its balance sheet this year in 2025, and Michael Saylor to be the most famous/infamous figure for Bitcoin in 2025. I’ll write separately about MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury operations and assess its leverage/risk, but its most fascinating impact is on the corporate bond market, which can now have Bitcoin exposure through convertible debt. And it's not just MicroStrategy, as all the other miners are following suit, with Marathon and Riot leading the pack. The bond markets are larger than the equity markets, and providing this channel for the bond market to have Bitcoin exposure is probably the most unanticipated outcome in Bitcoin thus far, and may have the most significant consequences that no one expected. Finally, I'm optimistic that the new Trump Administration will adopt favorable regulation towards crypto in general, though I do not expect the US government to buy bitcoin the way it holds gold. The new chair of the Council of Economic Advisers is favorable to the idea of the US holding Bitcoin. But he has remarked that the US already holds so much bitcoin because of prior seizures (like the Silk Road). I expect the new administration to simply re-label those holdings as a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, without making any new purchases this year. As for corporate adoption, I expect small companies to continue to convert some of their cash to bitcoin. For the big companies, my Hail Mary bet is that the first major purchase will come from Tesla, Meta, or Dell. Tesla already has some bitcoin on its balance sheet from its purchase a few years ago, and Elon Musk is slowly learning about the problems of inflation while advising President Trump, evidenced by his posting of Milton Friedman videos on X. Mark Zuckerberg is pushing forward open-source AI; the next logical step is open-source money. So I’m optimistic about 2025 for Bitcoin, even though 2024 will be hard to beat! One Community.

Title: The Great Crypto Crash

Trump will usher in a speculative frenzy. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. “The countdown clock on the next catastrophic crash has already started,” Dennis Kelleher, the president of the nonprofit Better Markets, told me. In the past few weeks, I have heard that sentiment or similar from economists, traders, Hill staffers, and government officials. The incoming Trump administration has promised to pass crypto-friendly regulations, and is likely to loosen strictures on Wall Street institutions as well. This will bring an unheralded era of American prosperity, it argues, maintaining the country’s position as the head of the global capital markets and the heart of the global investment ecosystem. “My vision is for an America that dominates the future,” Donald Trump told a bitcoin conference in July. “I’m laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world.” Annie Lowrey: The three pillars of the bro-economy Financial experts expect something different. First, a boom. A big boom, maybe, with the price of bitcoin, ether, and other cryptocurrencies climbing; financial firms raking in profits; and American investors awash in newfound wealth. Second, a bust. A big bust, maybe, with firms collapsing, the government being called in to steady the markets, and plenty of Americans suffering from foreclosures and bankruptcies. Having written about bitcoin for more than a decade—and having covered the last financial crisis and its long hangover—I have some sense of what might cause that boom and bust. Crypto assets tend to be exceedingly volatile, much more so than real estate, commodities, stocks, and bonds. Egged on by Washington, more Americans will invest in crypto. Prices will go up as cash floods in. Individuals and institutions will get wiped out when prices drop, as they inevitably will. The experts I spoke with did not counter that narrative. But if that’s all that happens, they told me, the United States and the world should count themselves lucky. The danger is not just that crypto-friendly regulation will expose millions of Americans to scams and volatility. The danger is that it will lead to an increase in leverage across the whole of the financial system. It will foster opacity, making it harder for investors to determine the riskiness of and assign prices to financial products. And it will do so at the same time as the Trump administration cuts regulations and regulators. Crypto will become more widespread. And the conventional financial markets will come to look more like the crypto markets—wilder, less transparent, and more unpredictable, with trillion-dollar consequences extending years into the future. “I have this worry that the next three or four years will look pretty good,” Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell and a former International Monetary Fund official, told me. “It’s what comes after, when we have to pick up the pieces from all the speculative frenzies that are going to be generated because of this administration’s actions.” For years, Washington has “waged a war on crypto and bitcoin like nobody’s ever seen,” Trump told crypto entrepreneurs this summer. “They target your banks. They choke off your financial services … They block ordinary Americans from transferring money to your exchanges. They slander you as criminals.” He added: “That happened to me too, because I said the election was rigged.” Trump is not wrong that crypto exists in its own parallel financial universe. Many crypto companies cannot or choose not to comply with American financial regulations, making it hard for kitchen-table investors to use their services. (The world’s biggest crypto exchange, Binance, declines even to name which jurisdiction it is based in; it directs American customers to a smallish U.S. offshoot.) Companies such as Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo tend to offer few, if any, crypto products, and tend to make minimal, if any, investments in crypto and crypto-related businesses. It’s not so much that banks haven’t wanted to get in on the fun. It’s that regulations have prevented them from doing so, and regulators have warned them not to. This situation has throttled the amount of money flowing into crypto. But the approach has been a wise one: It has prevented firm failures and crazy price swings from destabilizing the traditional financial system. Crypto lost $2 trillion of its $3 trillion in market capitalization in 2022, Kelleher noted. “If you had that big of a financial crash with any other asset, there would have been contagion. But there wasn’t, because you had parallel systems with almost no interconnection.” Forthcoming regulation will knit the systems together. Granted, nobody knows exactly what laws Congress will pass and Trump will sign. But the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, which passed the House before dying in the Senate last year, is a good guide. The law was the subject of intense lobbying by crypto advocates with billions on the line and cash to spend, including $170 million on the 2024 election. It amounts to an industry wish list. FIT21 makes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator of most crypto assets and firms and requires that the CFTC collect far less information from companies on the structure and trading of crypto products than securities firms give the SEC. Annie Lowrey: The Black investors who were burned by Bitcoin Beyond loose rules, financial experts anticipate loose enforcement. The CFTC predominantly oversees financial products used as hedges by businesses and traded among traders, not ones hawked to individual investors. It has roughly one-fifth the budget of the SEC, and one-seventh the staff. And in general, Washington is expected to loosen the strictures preventing traditional banks from keeping crypto on their books and preventing crypto companies from accessing the country’s financial infrastructure. According to Prasad, this regime would be a “dream” for crypto. Trump and his family are personally invested in crypto, and the president-elect has floated the idea of establishing a “strategic” bitcoin reserve, to preempt Chinese influence. (In reality, this would mean deploying billions of dollars of taxpayer money to soak up speculative assets with no strategic benefit to the United States.) How many Republicans will invest in crypto because Trump does? How many young people will pour money into bitcoin because his son Eric says its price is zooming toward $1 million, or because the secretary of commerce says it is the future? Nothing being considered by Congress or the White House will reduce the inherent risks. Crypto investors will remain vulnerable to hacking, ransomware, and theft. The research group Chainalysis tallied $24.2 billion in illicit transactions in 2023 alone. And if the U.S. government invests in crypto, the incentive for countries such as Iran and North Korea to interfere in the markets would go up exponentially. Imagine China engaging in a 51 percent attack on the bitcoin blockchain, taking it over and controlling each and every transaction. The situation is a security nightmare. Americans will be exposed to more prosaic scams and rip-offs too. The SEC has brought enforcement actions against dozens of Ponzi schemers, charlatans, and cheats, encompassing both the $32 billion sham-exchange FTX and ticky-tacky coin firms. Nobody expects the CFTC to have the muscle to do the same. And FIT21 leaves loopholes open for all kinds of scuzzy profiteering. A crypto firm might be able to run an exchange, buy and sell assets on its own behalf, and execute orders for clients—legally, at the same time, despite the conflicts of interest. Simple volatility is the biggest risk for retail investors. Crypto coins, tokens, and currencies are “purely speculative,” Prasad emphasized. “The only thing anchoring the value is investor sentiment.” At least gold has industrial uses. Or, if you’re betting on the price of tulip bulbs, at least you might end up with a flower. With crypto, you might end up with nothing, or less. A large share of crypto traders borrow money to make bets. When leveraged traders lose money on their investments, their lenders—generally the exchange on which the traders are trading—require them to put up collateral. To do that, investors might have to cash out their 401(k)s. They might have to dump their bitcoin, even in a down market. If they cannot come up with the cash, the firm holding their account might liquidate or seize their assets. A report released last month by the Office of Financial Research, a government think tank, makes clear just how dangerous this could be: Some low-income households are “using crypto gains to take out new mortgages.” When crypto prices go down, those families’ homes are going to be at risk. Many individual investors do not seem to understand these perils. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has had to warn the public that it does not protect crypto assets. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has raised the concern that people do not realize that crypto firms are not subject to the same oversight as banks. But if Trump is invested, how bad could it be? Regulators and economists are not worried primarily about the damage that this new era will do to individual households, however. They are worried about chaos in the crypto markets disrupting the traditional financial system—leading to a collapse in lending and the need for the government to step in, as it did in 2008. Where Wall Street once saw fool’s gold, it now sees a gold mine. Ray Dalio of Bridgewater called crypto a “bubble” a decade ago; now he thinks it is “one hell of an invention.” Larry Fink of BlackRock previously referred to bitcoin as an “index of money laundering”; today he sees it as a “legitimate financial instrument”—one his firm has already begun offering to clients, if indirectly. Early in 2024, the SEC began allowing fund managers to sell certain crypto investments. BlackRock launched a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in November; one public retirement fund has already staked its pensioners’ hard-earned cash. Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs are doing crypto deals too. Billions of traditional-finance money is flowing into the decentralized-finance markets, and billions more will as regulators allow. Charlie Warzel: Crypto’s legacy is finally clear What could go wrong? Nothing, provided that Wall Street firms are properly accounting for the risk of these risky assets. Everything, if they are not. Even the sturdiest-seeming instruments are dangerous. Stablecoins, for example, are crypto assets pegged to the dollar: One stablecoin is worth one dollar, making them useful as a medium of exchange, unlike bitcoin and ether. Stablecoin companies generally maintain their peg by holding one dollar’s worth of super-safe assets, such as cash and Treasury bills, for every stablecoin issued. Supposedly. In the spring of 2022, the widely used stablecoin TerraUSD collapsed, its price falling to just 23 cents. The company had been using an algorithm to keep TerraUSD’s price moored; all it took was enough people pulling their money out for the stablecoin to break the buck. Tether, the world’s most-traded crypto asset, claims to be fully backed by safe deposits. The U.S. government found that it was not, as of 2021; moreover, the Treasury Department is contemplating sanctioning the company behind tether for its role as a cash funnel for the “North Korean nuclear-weapons program, Mexican drug cartels, Russian arms companies, Middle Eastern terrorist groups and Chinese manufacturers of chemicals used to make fentanyl,” The Wall Street Journal has reported. (“To suggest that Tether is somehow involved in aiding criminal actors or sidestepping sanctions is outrageous,” the company responded.) Were tether or another big stablecoin to falter, financial chaos could instantly spread beyond the crypto markets. Worried investors would dump the stablecoin, instigating “a self-fulfilling panic run,” in the words of three academics who modeled this eventuality. The stablecoin issuer would dump Treasury bills and other safe assets to provide redemptions; the falling price of safe assets would affect thousands of non-crypto firms. The economists put the risk of a run on tether at 2.5 percent as of late 2021—not so stable! Other catastrophes are easy to imagine: bank failures, exchange collapses, giant Ponzi schemes faltering. Still, the biggest risk with crypto has little to do with crypto at all. If Congress passes FIT21 or a similar bill, it would invent a novel asset class called “digital commodities”—in essence, any financial asset managed on a decentralized blockchain. Digital commodities would be exempted from SEC oversight, as would “decentralized finance” firms. In the FIT21 bill, any firm or person can self-certify a financial product as a digital commodity, and the SEC would have only 60 days to object. This is a loophole big enough to fit an investment bank through. Already, Wall Street is talking up “tokenization,” meaning putting assets on a programmable digital ledger. The putative justification is capital efficiency: Tokenization could make it easier to move money around. Another justification is regulatory arbitrage: Investments on a blockchain would move out of the SEC’s purview, and likely be subject to fewer disclosure, reporting, accounting, tax, consumer-protection, anti-money-laundering, and capital requirements. Risk would build up in the system; the government would have fewer ways to rein firms in. Crypto regulation could end up undermining the “broader $100 trillion capital markets,” Gary Gensler, the soon-to-be-former head of the SEC and the crypto industry’s enemy No. 1, has argued. “It could encourage noncompliant entities to try to choose what regulatory regimes they wish to be subjected to.” Annie Lowrey: When the Bitcoin scammers came for me We have seen this movie before, not long ago. In 2000, shortly before leaving office, Bill Clinton signed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. The law put strictures on derivatives traded on an exchange, but left over-the-counter derivatives unregulated. So Wall Street ginned up trillions of dollars of financial products, many backed by the income streams from home loans, and traded them over the counter. It packaged subprime loans with prime loans, obscuring a given financial instrument’s real risk. Then consumers strained under rising interest rates, crummy wage growth, and climbing unemployment. The mortgage-default rate went up. Home prices fell, first in the Sun Belt and then nationwide. Investors panicked. Nobody even knew what was in all of those credit-default swaps and mortgage-backed securities. Nobody was sure what anything was worth. Uncertainty, opacity, leverage, and mispricing spurred the global financial crisis that caused the Great Recession. The crypto market today is primed to become the derivatives market of the future. Were Congress and the Trump administration to do nothing—to leave the SEC as crypto’s primary regulator, to require crypto companies to play by the existing rules—the chaos would remain walled off. There’s no sensible justification for digital assets to be treated differently than securities, anyway. By the simple test the government has used for a century, nearly all crypto assets are securities. But Washington is creating loopholes, not laws. As the crypto boosters like to say, hold on for dear life. “A lot of bankers, they’re dancing in the street,” Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase said at a conference in Peru last year. Maybe they should be. The bankers are never the ones left holding the bag. More Stories The Rise of the Union Right The Health-Care System Isn’t Hopeless

Decentralized Applications Concept - DApp - Autonomous Applications that Run on a Distributed Ledger ... [+] System such as a Blockchain Traditional finance isn't just adopting crypto - it's being rebuilt around it. JPMorgan is launching instant dollar-euro conversions on its rebranded Kinexys blockchain, where transaction volumes have grown tenfold to process over $2 billion daily. Visa's new Tokenized Asset Platform enables banks like BBVA to create and manage digital tokens, with pilot programs starting in 2025. Mastercard's Crypto Credential service operates across 13 countries in Europe and Latin America, simplifying transactions through partnerships with Bit2Me and Mercado Bitcoin. Morgan Stanley's E-Trade is exploring direct crypto trading services, while Goldman Sachs makes bold moves in the digital asset space - spinning off its Digital Assets Platform into a standalone entity, forging strategic partnerships with Tradeweb Markets, holding over $700 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs, and exploring market making in Bitcoin and Ethereum. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF draws billions in institutional money. The story isn't about disruption anymore - it's about integration, as the world's largest financial institutions systematically blur the lines between traditional and digital finance. Our strategy is to create more utility for crypto holdings, enabling users to connect their balances to Visa credentials and spend in fiat at millions of merchant locations," explained Nikola Plecas. With over 60 crypto platforms now working with Visa, the company is unlocking new use cases beyond trading, including remittances and cross-border payments. This transformation extends beyond payments. Citi's Tony McLaughlin envisions: "In five years, we might have a blockchain or state-machine capability where financial institutions involved in a transaction can look at that common state and use it as a source of truth to update their own balance sheets." These developments signal a fundamental shift toward a more efficient and interconnected global financial infrastructure. The Foundation of Financial Innovation The technology underpinning this financial transformation isn't just an upgrade - it's a complete reimagining of how money moves. While blockchain started with Bitcoin, its impact now reaches far beyond cryptocurrencies. The technology's distributed ledger architecture, smart contracts, and tokenized incentives enable programmable automation while providing new ways to track, verify, and secure digital transactions, transforming sectors from supply chains to healthcare records. In the financial sector, however, its impact has been particularly profound. Traditional trades that once required days and multiple intermediaries can now be executed and settled instantly, marking the most significant upgrade to financial infrastructure in decades. The technology's ability to provide immutable records and transparent transactions has sparked innovation across the entire financial services spectrum. The maturation of crypto markets has spurred the development of sophisticated yet accessible investment infrastructure. ICONOMI exemplifies this trend, allowing users to copy established portfolios or manage their own crypto assets. The platform's Blockchain Index portfolio provides easy access to top crypto assets and simplifies crypto investing for beginners while also offering sophisticated tools for experienced traders. This evolution reflects the industry's movement toward more user-friendly, professional-grade services. ICONOMI's approach helps users navigate the complex crypto landscape with features like dollar-cost-averaging and automated profit-takin The Rise of Tokenization: Unlocking Value in Real-World Assets The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) represents one of finance's most transformative innovations. By converting ownership rights into digital tokens on a blockchain, this technology bridges traditional finance, real assets, and the decentralized world. Industry analysts project the RWA market could expand dramatically within the next decade, potentially reaching $10-15 trillion. Major institutions are accelerating this transformation. Goldman Sachs, for example, has launched three new tokenization products for institutional clients, focusing on money market funds and real estate assets while also creating marketplaces for these In this tectonic landscape, Liqvid exemplifies this evolution by developing infrastructure for single-transaction purchases of yield baskets comprising tokenized real estate, private credit, and bonds. The founding team's background from marquee institutions like BlackRock and Edge Capital brings extensive industry insight, technical expertise, risk management, and regulatory navigation crucial for innovations and adoption. The platform aims to democratize access to previously exclusive institutional-grade financial instruments, leveraging the transformative potential of the RWA market. AI/Blockchain AI and blockchain are forging a new digital frontier where razor-sharp insights meet unbreakable trust. As artificial intelligence decodes complex data patterns, blockchain anchors these revelations in an immutable ledger, transforming raw information into verifiable, tamper-proof intelligence. This symbiotic dance between predictive analytics and cryptographic security is rewriting the rules of data integrity, enabling a world where insights are not only discovered but permanently validated and transparently shared. VeraViews demonstrates this in digital advertising by integrating blockchain-based Proof of View (PoV) technology with AI-driven fraud detection. This approach helps verify ad impressions and increase transparency, addressing persistent issues like ad fraud and wasted budgets. By using real-time fraud detection and transparent data tracking, VeraViews showcases how emerging technologies can tackle industry-wide challenges, from preventing market manipulation to fostering accountability in digital ecosystems. DeFi -Decentralized Finance. blockchain, decentralized financial system DeFi and Stablecoins: The New Rails of Finance DeFi represents blockchain's most radical innovation yet—a financial system that runs purely on code. Traditional banks use people and paperwork to process loans and trades. DeFi replaces all of that with automated smart contracts. Flash loans, a uniquely DeFi invention, showcase this power—enabling complex borrowing and trading to happen in seconds, something impossible in traditional finance. What makes these innovations particularly significant is their ability to execute complex financial operations without traditional intermediaries - transforming processes that historically took days into near-instantaneous transactions. But it's stablecoins that serve as the critical bridge between DeFi and traditional finance. These digital dollars, maintaining stable value through fiat currency pegs, are becoming the universal adapter between old and new systems. Payment giants like Mastercard and Visa now use them to make cross-border transfers faster and cheaper. Banks are following suit, recognizing that stablecoins could reshape everything from treasury operations to international trade finance. Their ability to enable seamless interaction between conventional and decentralized finance is accelerating mainstream adoption. Cross-Border Payments and Technology Innovation Blockchain is rewiring how money moves across borders. The combination of blockchain networks and stablecoins has created new pathways for cross-border transactions that bypass traditional correspondent banking systems. Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard, stated, "Blockchain technology, and public blockchains in particular, are opening up a number of new use cases, one of which is to transfer value — such as remittances — from one country to another." This evolution could have significant implications for the global remittance market, which the World Bank estimated at $630 billion in 2022. To power these cross-border transactions, the ecosystem also requires a robust exchange infrastructure. BestChange has emerged as part of this development, providing a cryptocurrency exchanger directory that aggregates real-time rate comparisons. Such services help users navigate the complex landscape of crypto exchanges and rates, contributing to market efficiency and accessibility. It offers features such as rate notifications, exchange history, and user reviews, catering to crypto enthusiasts, freelancers, and businesses seeking efficient fund transfers between different systems. The Path Forward: Regulation and Growth The regulatory environment has matured significantly, with major jurisdictions introducing comprehensive frameworks that balance innovation with consumer protection. This regulatory clarity has been crucial for institutional adoption, providing the certainty needed for larger financial institutions to invest in blockchain-based solutions. A New Era of Finance The numbers tell the story: $2 billion in daily transactions and $1.5 trillion in notional value since inception on JPMorgan's Kinexys blockchain, $10-15 trillion projected for tokenized real assets, and a $630 billion global remittance market transforming through digital networks. Beyond the statistics, we're seeing concrete infrastructure changes - Visa and Mastercard embedding crypto capabilities across continents, BlackRock moving institutional capital into digital assets, and JPMorgan's blockchain rewiring the fundamental architecture of global finance across five continents. The implications extend beyond the trading floor. Corporate treasurers who once tracked only fiat currencies must now navigate stablecoins and digital tokens. DeFi protocols are automating processes that previously required teams of bankers. Blockchain-AI integration is reshaping everything from fraud detection to market surveillance. This isn't a story of disruption anymore - it's one of integration. Traditional finance isn't fighting the digital revolution; it's actively building it. Those who recognize this shift aren't just adapting to change - they're positioning themselves to shape how value moves in a digital economy. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Analysis-Trump's SEC pick likely to give Wall Street easier enforcement ride
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysistrumps-sec-pick-likely-to-give-wall-street-easier-enforcement-ride-3799703
Time Published: 2025-01-07T11:22:11Z
Full Content:
By Douglas Gillison and Chris Prentice (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump's SEC pick voted several times against punishing big companies and was extremely critical of the agency's enforcement process when he was a top official there, according to public records and former SEC attorneys, in a possible glimpse of what is to come under his leadership. Paul Atkins voted against at least 10 enforcement actions punishing individuals and companies, including Citigroup (NYSE:C) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), according to a Reuters review of Securities and Exchange Commission records from the final years of his 2002-2008 stint as a commissioner. In doing so, he defied his fellow Republican agency chairs. Atkins was also fastidious, scrutinizing proposed enforcement actions word by word and frequently pushing back on SEC staff who recommended bringing charges, according to three former SEC enforcement staff. At the time, Atkins made no secret of his mistrust of much of the SEC's process for probing and disciplining rule-breakers, arguing that corporate fines unfairly penalize shareholders and that the SEC should focus on individual fraudsters. He became well-known for his industry-friendly views, even as the agency grappled with the fallout from the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals. But his enforcement dissents, which have not been previously reported in detail, and Reuters' interviews with more than a dozen former SEC officials and academics, provide insight into how deep that skepticism was. They suggest Wall Street is set for a much easier ride after years of aggressive enforcement under Democratic Chair Gary Gensler, whose SEC levied over $20 billion in penalties and other charges. High-profile companies whose SEC cases could be affected by new leadership include electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), crypto exchanges Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) and Binance, and investment firms BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Carlyle and TPG. Under Atkins, the SEC will likely focus on misconduct that causes direct investor losses, such as scams, rather than corporate malfeasance where the harm is not always immediately obvious, the sources said. Critics say such an approach is dangerous because big companies can pose systemic risks and are capable of large-scale harm to investors. "His nomination should bring down the stress levels and ambient heart rates for compliance ... staffers," said Tyler Gellasch, a former SEC official who now leads the Healthy Markets Association, which focuses on increasing capital markets transparency and reducing conflicts of interest. Its members include pension funds. Atkins did not respond to requests for comment. He has said little on enforcement in recent years but has continued to argue for light-touch oversight, and has represented companies in regulatory disputes via his consultancy, Patomak Global Partners (NYSE:GLP). Trump transition spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment. 10 DISSENTS SEC leadership comprises five politically-appointed commissioners, including the chair, who vote on rules and enforcement actions. Typically, chairs bring a vote when they have enough support to pass a measure. During Atkins' tenure, commissioners sometimes revealed how they voted on regulatory matters, but neither they nor the agency routinely publicized the outcomes of enforcement votes, obscuring commissioners' overall records from public view. Reuters reviewed online voting records from Atkins' tenure, for which only 28 months during 2006 to 2008 are available. The records relate to administrative enforcement actions brought before the SEC's in-house court but not federal court litigation. With 10 dissents, Atkins disapproved of more than twice as many actions as Democratic commissioner Roel Campos, while Democrat Annette Nazareth and Atkins' fellow Republican Kathleen Casey did not dissent on enforcement matters at all during those months. Campos, Nazareth and Casey did not respond to requests for comment. Even in today's partisan climate where party-line SEC dissents are common, Atkins' willingness to oppose his fellow Republicans on enforcement matters is striking, underscoring how strongly he felt about the issues, said experts. "Atkins is an independent thinker with a clear view about how markets work," said Stanford professor Joseph Grundfest, who was a Democratic commissioner in the 1980s. Jay Clayton, SEC chair during Trump's first term, was similarly skeptical of big corporate fines and focused mostly on small-scale investor frauds. But the agency was still active, notching record penalties in 2020 and surprising some onlookers with landmark charges against Tesla and crypto firm Ripple. While Atkins' 10 dissents were among thousands of votes he would have made, former agency officials said they accurately reflect his exacting approach to enforcement issues. "He put us through our paces," said former SEC assistant enforcement director Gregory Faragasso, who praised Atkins' acumen and expertise. "He would want to get down into the weeds on certain issues ... you'd have to really know your stuff." Two other former officials shared similar observations. One said Atkins would negotiate corporate penalties with staff, often pushing for a focus on fines for individuals over companies. Atkins voted against a $7-million SEC settlement with IBM over accounting and other issues, and opposed a 2008 order against Citigroup over its financial statements. He also dissented on smaller matters, such as censuring unregistered accountants. The documents do not record Atkins' reasoning but, in contemporaneous remarks, he argued that corporate fines only hurt shareholders who had already suffered from the original misconduct. He also argued that enforcers often pursued minor infractions, suggesting in a 2008 speech that they did so to pad enforcement figures, and that enforcers were not transparent about the evidence they had on targets. "Where there are serious violations, enforcement action is necessary, but the goal should be to work with firms to build their internal compliance," he said.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Mirror Dow Jones Decline on Monday. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CNX Resources Corp. (NYSE:CNX) stands against the other stocks. Ten companies kicked off this week's trading mirroring a decline on Dow Jones with a series of catalysts dampening investor sentiment. In this article, let’s explore the reasons behind their decline. To come up with Monday's top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A long line of heavy-duty trucks transporting natural gas across a rural highway. Shares in CNX Resources dropped for a second day on Monday, losing 7.49 percent to finish at $30.64 each as investors continued to sell off shares following its lukewarm reception of the newly released hydrogen tax credits. While it acknowledges the environmental and economic benefits of Coal Mine Methane, CNX said last week that the final rules of Section 45V, the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, seem too restrictive and do not offer sufficient economic incentives to expand its CMM capture operations for hydrogen use. Despite reservations, the company said it was planning to leverage the validation and explore alternative incentive pathways for CMM, such as voluntary markets, other tax incentives, and compliance program commercial opportunities. Overall CNX ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks that crashed today. While we acknowledge the potential of CNX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CNX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Blackrock Clinic secures green light for first phase of 16-year masterplan

Blackrock Clinic Blackrock Clinic has secured the planning green light for a new cardiology department, an eye centre and additional in-patient bedrooms at its south Dublin site. The planned new facilities are the first phase of a 16-year masterplan for the hospital, which will also include the construction of a second hospital building on site. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has given the first phase planning permission after concluding that the planned two-storey extension to the side of the main hospital building is acceptable. Planning documents lodged with the application reveal that the Larry Goodman Trust-owned hospital is proceeding with the masterplan “for the overall site following the acquisition of several neighbour sites adjoining the campus”. McGill Planning states that some of the main elements of the expansion “will include the provision of a dedicated cancer centre, a new specialised women’s health centre, additional theatre capacity, and additional high-tech interventional cardiology laboratories”. It says Blackrock Clinic admitted 52,185 in-patient and daycare patients in 2023 and this figure is expected to grow to 78,000 by 2033, which is around a 50pc increase over the next decade. “Blackrock Clinic is currently operating at full capacity,” it states. “In order to meet future growth in demand for medical services, the hospital will need to significantly expand its capacity and invest in the construction of major new medical facilities on the hospital campus.” The McGill Planning report lodged with the application states that the hospital’s capacity has doubled since 2008. The existing St Catherine’s site will host the second hospital building and deliver additional theatres; additional cath-lab capacity to meet growing demand in existing services; the development of a new cancer centre and the addition of new in-patient bed capacity. McGill Planning says Henry J Lyons Architects and Urban Designers were appointed in September 2023 to develop a masterplan following a competitive tender. It adds that this proposed two-storey extension application “is the first of several planning applications” that will be submitted to the council to enable the delivery of the plan. The two-floor extension will also provide 14 single-occupancy bedrooms. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

If talks end successfully, an announcement on the acquisition is expected to be made as early as this week. Inari Medical, which has a market value approaching $3 billion, is expected to enhance Stryker's portfolio by expanding its treatment options for venous thromboembolism, a condition characterized by blood-vein clotting, and other venous diseases. In recent weeks, Inari has signaled intentions to go on sale after receiving acquisition interest from Stryker and other parties. Reports said that other potential buyers could still approach Inari and that there is a possibility that no deal may be finalized with any of the interested parties.

Officials explained that the changes "clarify how producers of hydrogen, including those using electricity from various sources, natural gas with carbon capture, renewable natural gas (RNG), and coal mine methane can determine eligibility for the credit.” Plug Power is an American company engaged in the development of hydrogen fuel cell systems that replace conventional batteries in equipment and vehicles powered by electricity.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Sierra Space CEO Tom Vice has left the company, CNBC confirmed Monday. In a statement, Sierra Space said Vice retired Dec. 31. Chairman Fatih Ozmen will serve as interim CEO, with Eren Ozmen as president. “After three and half years in the role, Tom Vice has retired as Sierra Space CEO as of the end of 2024 — we thank him for his leadership and wish him well in his retirement,” a Sierra Space spokesperson said in a statement. Spun out of aerospace contractor Sierra Nevada Corporation, or SNC, in 2021, Sierra is one of the most valuable private U.S. companies in the burgeoning space sector, most recently valued at more than $5 billion. But Sierra Space has struggled to launch the first mission of its reusable cargo space plane called Dream Chaser, which is key to the company establishing itself as a major player in the industry. Vice was named CEO of Sierra Space in 2021, a few months after SNC owners Fatih and Eren Ozmen spun out the company — with investors including General Atlantic, Coatue, BlackRock and AE Industrial Partners. Vice was previously the CEO of Aerion Supersonic, a startup that planned to build high-speed business jets and that shut down in April 2021. The first Dream Chaser vehicle was supposed to debut by 2021. But even in 2024, the space plane, named Tenacity, was not ready when United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket, its ride to space, needed to launch. Dream Chaser has won NASA contracts to fly seven cargo missions to and from the International Space Station. Sierra Space said Tenacity is targeting a launch no earlier than May. The company has continued to develop its inflatable space station technology, as well as expand into a product line of satellite buses after winning a high-profile $740 million Pentagon contract last year. Sierra Space saw layoffs during Vice’s tenure, as well as turnover in a number of senior executive roles. But in 2024, Vice spoke repeatedly of Sierra Space’s plan to go public, outlining a tentative path to IPO as soon as late 2025. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Why Is Geron Corporation (GERN) the Best Long-Term Penny Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) stands against the other best long-term penny stocks to buy. On December 3rd, Bob Kaynor, CFA, Head of US Small & Midcap Equities at Schroders, provided a comprehensive outlook for small-cap stocks in 2025, emphasizing their potential as a cost-effective investment in the robust US economy. He mentioned that the economy has shown resilience post-pandemic, bolstered by fiscal stimulus from the Biden Administration through significant legislation like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This recovery is primarily driven by strong consumer spending and a favorable labor market. In this robust environment while large-cap equities may appear expensive and have likely priced in much of the anticipated growth, small and mid-cap stocks remain relatively undervalued. This presents an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to domestic economic strength without incurring high costs. Kaynor identified several trends, which he believes could enhance the performance of small and mid-cap stocks in 2025. He pointed out that following a downturn in 2022 and 2023 due to recession fears and high valuations, M&A activity is now rebounding. This resurgence is expected to benefit small-cap stocks as they often become acquisition targets. Additionally, increased IPO activity can generate interest and optimism in the small-cap sector. Moreover, the ongoing and anticipated decline in interest rates starting late 2024 is expected to reduce borrowing costs for small-cap companies, which typically rely on short-term financing. This environment is historically favorable for small caps, particularly when inflation stabilizes between 1% and 3%. Kaynor also noted that the service sector of the market is expanding. The services sector not only forms a significant portion of the GDP but also favors small-cap companies primarily those operating within this space. Moreover, trends like reshoring are enabling small firms to become reliable suppliers for larger corporations. He expects that increased CapEx driven by automation and government support in sectors like semiconductors will likely correlate with revenue growth for small caps, further enhancing their investment appeal next year. Kaynor noted that Wall Street analysts predict a substantial rebound in earnings for small caps beginning in late 2024, with expectations that their growth will outpace large caps throughout most of 2025. A close-up of a laboratory technician in a laboratory, measuring a newly developed biopharmaceutical drug. To curate the list of the 12 best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we got an initial list of penny stocks (trading under $5) with more than 20% 5-year sales growth. Next, we cross-checked each stock for 5-year sales growth from Seeking Alpha. Lastly, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 hedge funds database. Please note that the stock prices were recorded on December 31, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stock Price: $3.54 5-Year Sales Growth: 113.54% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29 Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative treatments for blood cancers. Its flagship product, RYTELO, is a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor that has received FDA approval for treating certain adult patients suffering from lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) with transfusion-dependent anemia. This approval marks it as the only company with an oligonucleotide telomerase inhibitor available in the United States. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) reported a net product revenue of $28.2 million from RYTELO, marking a successful first full quarter since its launch. As another important highlight for the quarter, management completed financing transactions to bolster its cash position. This included a synthetic royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma, providing $125 million in exchange for tiered royalty payments, and a 5-year senior term loan agreement with Pharmakon for up to $250 million. After its successful launch in the US, management is waiting for the review of RYTELO's MAA in lower-risk MDS by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). If the regulatory approval is granted it plans to launch RYTELO in select EU markets starting in 2026. Overall, GERN ranks first on our list of best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GERN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GERN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Spun out of aerospace contractor Sierra Nevada Corporation, or SNC, in 2021, Sierra is one of the most valuable private U.S. companies in the burgeoning space sector, most recently valued at more than $5 billion. But Sierra Space has struggled to launch the first mission of its reusable cargo space plane called Dream Chaser, which is key to the company establishing itself as a major player in the industry. Vice was named CEO of Sierra Space in 2021, a few months after SNC owners Fatih and Eren Ozmen spun out the company — with investors including General Atlantic, Coatue, BlackRock and AE Industrial Partners. Vice was previously the CEO of Aerion Supersonic, a startup that planned to build high-speed business jets and that shut down in April 2021. The first Dream Chaser vehicle was supposed to debut by 2021. But even in 2024, the space plane, named Tenacity, was not ready when United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket, its ride to space, needed to launch. Dream Chaser has won NASA contracts to fly seven cargo missions to and from the International Space Station. Sierra Space said Tenacity is targeting a launch no earlier than May. The company has continued to develop its inflatable space station technology, as well as expand into a product line of satellite buses after winning a high-profile $740 million Pentagon contract last year. Sierra Space saw layoffs during Vice's tenure, as well as turnover in a number of senior executive roles. But in 2024, Vice spoke repeatedly of Sierra Space's plan to go public, outlining a tentative path to IPO as soon as late 2025. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Travel Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)) stands against other best travel stocks to buy right now. According to a report by UN Tourism published on September 19, international tourism revived back 96% of the pre-pandemic levels during the first seven months of 2024. Around 790 million tourists were traveling around the globe during the said time, which is 11% greater than that in 2023 but still 4% less than in 2019. As per the report, the key drivers of this growth have been a strong demand for travel in Europe and also the re-opening of markets in the Asia Pacific region. The Secretary-General of UN Tourism, Zurab Pololikashvili noted that the growth in international tourism has been in line with the projections made by the department. He mentioned that the sector is on its way to achieving full recovery from the biggest crises in history and that too in an environment of economic and geopolitical challenges. Pololikashvili suggested that the recovery highlights the growing demand for international tourism planning and managing companies to cater to the revival in a way that benefits the communities through inclusive and sustainable policies. In addition, to an increase in tourism, the air connections have also improved along with an easing in visa restrictions. READ ALSO: 10 Best Entertainment Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now. The report also highlighted that increased air connectivity and visa facilitation have supported the recovery. Data collected by the UN World Tourism Barometer showed that the Middle East remained the strongest region relative to others as it surpassed the 2019 levels by 26% during the first seven months of 2024. Moreover, Africa also remained strong and hosted 7% more tourists than in 2019. On the other hand, Europe and the Americas which host the most tourists combined recovered 99% and 97%, respectively. Despite the robust growth, certain challenges remain unaddressed including geopolitical challenges, extreme climate conditions, and high inflation in certain regions of the world. Regardless, the report anticipates continued recovery and expects strong revenue from international tourism to persist for a long period. To compile the list of the 10 best travel stocks to buy right now, we used the Finviz stock screener. Using the screener we aggregated a list of travel services stocks sorted by market capitalization. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders as per Insider Monkey’s third-quarter 2024 database. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A vacation home luxury bedroom setup with stunning decor showing a desired getaway experience. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54 Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is an international online platform that connects people looking for places to stay with those who have space to rent out. Guests can browse host listings and book a place to stay directly through the Airbnb website or app. Unlike traditional hotels, the company offers a wide variety of accommodations, catering to different preferences and budgets. This includes everything from private rooms in someone’s home to entire houses. The company has been actively upgrading its platform to streamline the process of listing and booking, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. Over the past three years, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) has launched more than 535 new features to improve user experience. Recent upgrades include personalized app features and enhanced listing quality, with over 300,000 low-quality listings removed to ensure better guest experiences. Moreover, the company has rolled out more than 50 upgrades in 2024 alone. These efforts have turned out to be fruitful as during the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company witnessed an increase in bookings through the Airbnb app, which now accounts for 58% of total nights booked, up from 53% last year. The company generated $3.7 billion in revenue, marking a 10% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This growth was attributed to a steady rise in nights and experiences booked, which totaled 123 million for the quarter. Management noted that it is experiencing a rise in first-time bookers, particularly among young travelers. Looking ahead to Q4, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) anticipates continued growth in bookings despite potential challenges from tougher year-over-year comparisons. The company plans to introduce more features aimed at enhancing user experience and expanding its market presence globally. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) declined in the period on concerns around a weaker demand outlook for the quarter as well as increasing marketing spend planned for the second half of 2024, pressuring near-term margins. Given the company’s exposure to the health of the consumer and related willingness to spend on leisure travel, we believe it’s important to take a step back to see the larger picture. Global accommodations have been and will likely continue to be a mid-single-digit growth market. Still, as private rentals become increasingly mainstream and the dependability of those private listings improves, we would expect private rentals to continue to gain market share. We continue to see Airbnb as a likely double-digit revenue grower over the next five years, and with modest margin expansion, we could expect mid-to-high-teens earnings growth.” Overall, ABNB ranks 3rd on our list of best travel stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of ABNB to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABNB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Moreover, Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE:CCL) posted an all-time high revenue of $25 billion for the full year 2024, indicating a 15% increase year-over-year. The growth was driven by a robust demand and increased consumer spending on traveling. Management of the company has developed a strong profitability model, which led fiscal 2024 net income to surpass its September guidance by $130 million to reach $1.9 billion. CEO, Josh Weinstein, noted that the company outperformed its initial guidance for 2024 by $700 million, contributing nearly $2 billion more to its bottom line year-over-year. Looking ahead, Carnival is optimistic about 2025, predicting continued growth with yield increases expected to surpass historical rates. Management is enhancing its destination strategy to attract more guests and increase global awareness of cruise travel.

Title: Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ): Harnessing 5G and AI Innovation for Enterprise Solutions

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $50 According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other AI stocks under $50. Franklin Mutual's Katrina Dudley appeared on CNBC on December 31 to discuss whether the sectors that powered the market's gains in 2024 will continue to lead the way in 2025, particularly AI within the tech and communications sectors. Companies in these sectors, especially the MAG7 stocks, have experienced remarkable performance over the past year. She pointed out that alongside traditional tech stocks, companies providing essential infrastructure are crucial for supporting the rapid expansion of AI technologies. She expressed strong optimism about AI's continued influence, stating that it represents a secular theme likely to propel the tech sector forward in the coming year. When addressing concerns about market valuations, Dudley reiterated that high valuations, such as the S&P 500 trading at ~22 times earnings, should not deter investors. Instead, she argued that these valuations reflect robust earnings growth among technology companies, distinguishing this phase from past market bubbles. The network effects inherent in AI-driven companies contribute to their returns, suggesting that if these firms can exceed earnings expectations, their valuations could become more favorable over time. However, she cautioned that consistent performance is critical. Any failure to deliver on earnings growth could pose risks in a high-valuation environment. Turning her attention to lagging sectors, Dudley discussed healthcare as an area ripe for AI-driven transformation. She noted that while healthcare has significant upside potential due to demographic trends, some healthcare service providers faced challenges in 2024 due to rising costs and consumer pushback against high pricing. The increased focus on transparency in healthcare pricing may benefit consumers but could complicate profitability for companies. She suggested that advancements in AI technology are enhancing productivity within pharmaceutical research and development. Although immediate benefits may not be visible, she believes that AI's long-term impact on productivity will make healthcare an increasingly attractive sector for investment. Dudley's insights underscore the transformative potential of AI across both tech and healthcare sectors. Methodology We first sifted through internet lists to compile a list of the top AI stocks under $50. We then selected the 12 stocks with high analysts' upside potential and that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of analysts' upside potential (at least 10%), as of January 2. We've also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock which was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Title: Tower of strength – Brian Maye on Sinéad de Valera
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irish-diary/2025/01/06/tower-of-strength-brian-maye-on-sinead-de-valera/
Time Published: 2025-01-06T18:59:00Z
Full Content:
Although Sinéad de Valera, who died 50 years ago on January 7th, is probably mainly remembered as the wife of Eamon de Valera, she was an Irish-language activist for many years, a highly respected teacher for the Gaelic League, and proved a prolific author of children’s books in later life. She was also an actor and even considered a career on the stage at one time. She was born Jane (usually called Jennie) Flanagan on June 1st, 1878, in Balbriggan, Co Dublin, one of four children of Laurence Flanagan, a carpenter, and Margaret Byrne. The family moved to Phibsborough in Dublin when she was seven as her father was made clerk of works for the building of St Peter’s Church there. Following local schooling, she attended Baggot Street Teacher Training College from where she graduated as a national-school teacher. Her teaching career began in Edenderry, Co Offaly, and continued at Francis Xavier School, Lower Dorset Street, which she had herself attended. She developed a great interest in the Irish language, joining the Gaelic League, adopting Sinéad Ní Fhlannagáin as her name and frequently visiting the Mayo Gaeltacht. As a member of the Gaelic League and of Maud Gonne’s Inghinidhe na hÉireann, she became involved in amateur dramatics. A play she performed in was The Tinker and the Fairy by Douglas Hyde. According to Frances Clarke, who wrote the entry on her in the Dictionary of Irish Biography, she asked George Moore, in whose garden on Ely Place the play had been performed, if she should consider a career in acting but he advised her against it. Becoming fluent in Irish, she gave language classes at the Gaelic League college on Parnell Square. One of her pupils was Eamon de Valera, then a teacher of maths. In the summer of 1909, they attended the Irish college at Tourmakeady, Co Mayo, and were married the following January in St Paul’s Church on Arran Quay; he was 28 and she 32. She gave up her career to look after their family of five sons and two daughters. In February 1936, their son Brian, then aged 20, was killed in a riding accident in the Phoenix Park. After the Easter Rising, with her husband jailed and with no financial income, she moved back to her family home with some of her children (the others were sent to her sister in Balbriggan) and cared for her invalid sister, who died in August, and her mother, who died the following January. When circumstances improved, the de Valera family settled in Greystones, Co Wicklow, but she saw little of her husband in the 1917-23 period as he was on the run, in prison or fundraising in America. Michael Collins frequently visited her in Greystones and provided money and support for her and her family. Although she wanted to avoid public life, she was persuaded by Harry Boland to join de Valera in America in 1920, travelling there on a false passport provided by Collins. She spent six weeks there but saw little of her husband because of his busy schedule and was relieved to return home. She was rumoured to be pro-Treaty, according to Frances Clarke, but never spoke publicly about political events. The break with Collins was said to have aggrieved her particularly, as he had been so good to her during her husband’s absences. When her family were reared, she turned to writing and produced no fewer than 31 books in Irish and in English. She adapted old stories and folktales from Irish, translated European fairytales into Irish and wrote plays and poems for children. Among her works were Coinneal na Nodlag agus Sgéalta Eile (1944), Áilleacht agus an Beithideach (1946), The Emerald Ring and Other Irish Fairy Stories (1951), The Stolen Child and Other Stories (1961), The Four-Leafed Shamrock (1964) and The Miser’s Gold (1970). She maintained her interest in Irish and attended Gaelic League functions and children’s drama competitions. A quiet, shy and retiring person, she shunned the limelight and during the years of her husband’s presidency (1959-73), she made few public appearances and her youngest son, Terry, who wrote a memoir, said she did not enjoy living in Áras an Uachtaráin. After the end of the presidency, they both moved into Linden Convalescent Home in Blackrock, where she died aged 96 on the day before what would have been their 65th wedding anniversary. Her husband died a little under eight months later and they are buried with their son Brian in Glasnevin Cemetery. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Analyst: People Buying Apple Inc (AAPL) Products ‘In Droves’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar In January 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on investors’ radar in January 2025. Drew Pettit, U.S. equity strategist at Citi Research, said in a latest program on CNBC that he believes the AI growth story is still intact moving ahead in 2025. However, the analyst believes a lot of positive news is already “priced in.” He also mentioned the key areas that can benefit this year. “I think the fundamental stories, at least for the pick-and-shovels names, continue. But where we think the trade is actually going to broaden out, and honestly, it has since mid-year, is into some of the users of AI. So, think about car companies that do autonomous driving or software companies putting that into their programs themselves, and even to some of the more cyclical names that, on the back end, can get some more productivity gains. So yes, the picks-and-shovels, the enablers of the trade, were attractive for the most part in 2024. We think AI continues to broaden out.” The analyst said he has done some “reverse DCF work” and believes there are many companies that are mispriced and many that have the good news around them already priced in. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks that analysts are talking about this month. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Andy Swan from LikeFolio‬ explained during a latest program on Schwab Network why he believes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) had a strong holiday shopping season: “Once we saw the September keynote and the reaction that consumers had to that keynote event, we knew that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was setting up for a really good holiday season. And so far, you know, everything that we’re seeing points to that being true. Web visits for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are up year-over-year by a pretty decent margin, but when we break it down by product category and look, you know, at the overall demand for each of these types of products, you really get the sense that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), going into the Christmas holiday gift-giving season, just really has something for everyone on your list. If you want to spend $499, you can get an iPad Mini that is extraordinarily popular. The pencil looks like it’s getting added on at a tremendous clip, which is a high-margin item for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). You know, if you want to spend $129, you can get AirPods for your friend or for your niece or whatever it is, and people are doing so in droves. You know, iPad searches up 26%, AirPods and iPhone up 15-16%. The only real whiff we see on the list is the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch.” Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company’s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple’s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored. Investors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta’s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple’s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon’s and Google’s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market. Apple’s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform. While the company is projected to achieve 9.5% EPS growth this fiscal year and 12.3% growth in the next, much of this growth is already priced in, as the stock trades at nearly 30 times the expected EPS for the fiscal year ending September 2026. Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose during the quarter, making our underweight position a relative detractor. Investors reacted positively to the new iPhone 16 lineup and its advanced features, including generative artificial intelligence, greater durability and increased processing power.” Overall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks on investors’ radar in January 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NYSE:DELL) stock. “Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), to me, as a story, is more the parts are greater than the sum. For next quarter earnings, which are February of 2025, the Street’s looking for 10% and 14% revenue and earnings growth. But underneath the hood, their infrastructure solutions group is where people are buying Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)—that is their networking, their servers, and that’s where they’re getting data center growth. They had 38% growth. So, when I look at this company, you’re going to continue to see that ISG group be a larger and larger part of the earnings. Right now, it’s about 40%.” In the most recently reported quarter, Dell posted mixed results with revenue missing expectations.

This shift shows Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s competitive position, as customers are willing to wait for the latest tech solutions. Dell secured $3.6 billion in AI server orders this quarter, an 11% increase from the previous quarter. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) also signed over 2,000 enterprise customers for their AI solutions. Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) was a top contributor despite reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings results, because investors looked through the near-term disappointment and expected strong growth from AI-related servers and personal computers.

Title: Farm Laws Reborn: “Dismantling Food Security”. Toxic Platter for India’s Farmers and Consumers

India could see an authoritarian central government with subordinate state governments under the control of corporate interests and international finance capital. So says the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a coalition of 40+ farmers’ unions. It contends that the Union Government of India is proposing to undermine the federal rights of state governments by surrendering India’s food security and compromising its national sovereignty under the slogan ‘One Nation. One Market’. In a December 2024 press release, the All India Kisan Sabha (All India Farmers Union, AIKS) called for nationwide protests against attempts to bring back the three repealed farm laws. The AIKS said that the government has opted not to address any of the serious demands raised by the farmers’ movement, including legalising the minimum support price (MSP), increasing public investment in agriculture and boosting pro-farmer credit facilities. Like the SKM, the AIKS says there is an agenda to dismantle the power of the state governments. Proposed reforms to the agrifood sector seek to encroach upon the rights of state governments over agriculture, land, industry and markets — areas that fall under individual states as per the Constitution of India. Pivotal to this plan is the newly introduced draft National Policy Framework on Agriculture Marketing (NPFAM). The SKM states that the NPFAM, if implemented, will erode the federal rights of the state governments and ignore the interests of farmers, agricultural workers, petty producers and small traders since there is no provision to ensure an MSP and minimum wage to farmers and workers. The NPFAM essentially marks the return of the three farm laws that were repealed in late 2021 due to a year-long mass protest by farmers. The SKM states that the farmers’ movement sees through the plan to withdraw government support from agriculture and hand over farming and public food distribution to corporations led by Adani, Ambani, Tata, Cargill, Pepsi, Walmart, Bayer, Amazon and others. The main proposal of the NPFAM is a fundamental restructuring of the existing agricultural marketing system, proposing its transformation into a Unified National Market linked to a Value Chain Centric Infrastructure. The objective is the entry of corporate agribusiness and the conversion and integration (or eradication) of registered state-managed wholesale markets (mandis, overseen by state-regulated Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees, APMCs) and Grameen Haats (rural markets) with Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). Reforms suggested in the NPFAM draft include the establishment of private wholesale markets, direct farm gate purchases by corporate processors and exporters, replacement of traditional market yards with corporate-controlled warehouses and silos and introducing a unified national market fee and trading license system. The draft proposes that big corporations can purchase produce directly from farmers, bypassing APMC market yards. Additionally, handing over storage infrastructure to private corporations eliminates a critical safety net for farmers during price volatility and may pave the way for corporate exploitation by denying farmers any space for bargaining prices. The NPFAM aims to integrate agricultural production and marketing in a way that prioritises corporate interests. It will integrate both the private and public sectors through advanced technologies, such as DPI and blockchain. NPFAM reforms propose deregulation, effectively allowing the private sector — specifically, corporate agribusinesses — to establish dominance over production, processing and marketing. We could see farmers produce raw materials that enter markets controlled by processing industries, trade houses and exporters, who in turn dictate the prices. The NPFAM fails to address provisions that would hold these corporate forces accountable. There is no mention of ensuring an MSP for farmers, which was a central recommendation of the National Commission on Farmers chaired by the late M S Swaminathan and currently a key issue in the national political discourse. That is no surprise because the corporate strategy is to procure produce at the cheapest rate and market it to ensure exorbitant profits. The stranglehold of big business houses is also evident in the suggestions for deepening financialisation via futures and option markets. This will also permit corporations and international finance capital to dominate and control the domestic food industry. The AIKS says that central government is creating a conducive atmosphere for the corporate loot of agriculture. It adds that it will fight tooth and nail the efforts by the government to hand Indian agriculture on a platter to transnational corporations. It demands that the government withdraw the NPFAM and engage in meaningful dialogue with farmers’ organisations and state governments. The three repealed farm laws would have facilitated neoliberal shock therapy to India’s agrifood sector. If it succeeds, the NPFAM will bring about what the laws intended to do. But first, state-supported infrastructure must be dismantled. As things currently stand, mandis are state-regulated marketplaces where farmers sell their produce, facilitating direct transactions with buyers and ensuring fair prices through auctions. Managed by the APMCs, mandis play a crucial role in connecting farmers to larger markets and providing essential infrastructure for agricultural trade. The Public Distribution System (PDS) is a government initiative aimed at ensuring food security for the underprivileged by distributing essential commodities at subsidised rates. Operated jointly by central and state governments, the PDS includes the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), ensuring focused assistance for those in need. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is responsible for implementing food policies, including the procurement, storage, transport and distribution of food grains. By procuring grains at an MSP and maintaining a vast network of depots and Fair Price Shops, the FCI plays a vital role in maintaining food security and nutritional support across the country. Together, mandis, the PDS and the FCI form a comprehensive state-backed framework for supporting India’s agricultural economy and addressing food insecurity. However, the aim is for the state to withdraw from these areas and to let private interests capture the space left open. Indian agriculture has witnessed gross underinvestment over the years, whereby it is now wrongly depicted as a basket case and underperforming and ripe for a sell off to those very interests who had a stake in its underinvestment. The aim is to restructure India’s agri-food sector for the needs of global supply chains and markets. As independent cultivators are bankrupted, the goal is that land will eventually be amalgamated to facilitate large-scale industrial cultivation. Those who remain in farming will be absorbed into corporate supply chains and squeezed as they work on contracts dictated by large agribusiness and chain retailers. The FCI has historically been a stabilising force in India’s food procurement and distribution system, ensuring that (some) farmers receive fair prices through MSP while maintaining strategic food stocks. Once its role is diminished, the Indian government may find itself purchasing essential commodities from volatile (manipulated) international markets using its foreign exchange reserves; food sourced from the very corporations that have replaced the FCI (see chapters 4–7 of Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order). Companies like Bayer attempt to depict these developments as ‘modernising’ Indian agriculture and portray the sector as ‘backward’. However, such corporations cynically exploit notions of backwardness and modernisation to promote their financially lucrative agricultural practices and technologies in a bid to secure control of the sector. Prominent agricultural scientist M S Swaminathan (referred to earlier) highlighted that farmers’ incomes are declining due to inadequate pricing mechanisms and market access, rather than a lack of technological advancements. He advocated for a an MSP that is at least 50% above the cost of production to ensure farmers can sustain their livelihoods. The failure to implement this has contributed significantly to the ongoing agrarian crisis. This situation has led to widespread farmer distress and suicides, which he attributed largely to economic pressures rather than technological shortcomings. And this failure is a deliberate policy decision. Instead of ensuring that all farmers have reliable access to markets where they can sell their produce at fair prices, improving access to timely and affordable credit to prevent farmers from falling into debt traps and strengthening procurement policies and expanding the mandi, MSP and public distribution systems, we are witnessing a reversal. Farmers are being displaced through policies that intentionally render farming financially unviable. We also see policies aimed at facilitating the sale and consolidation of land for industrial agriculture and the undermining of rural communities and traditional farming practices. Additionally, there is a concerning rise in health issues as traditional, nutritious diets are increasingly replaced by unhealthy, ultra-processed foods or less nutrient-dense alternatives. If consumers want to see what the future may bring, look no further than countries reliant on the Western agrifood model. From cultivation to retail, a disease-causing system promoted and protected by corporate lobby groups like the International Life Sciences Institute and CropLife embedded in decision-making processes (both are already firmly established in India). A system that sees international finance firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Fidelity and Capital Group investing in the global food giants that sicken and also in the pharmaceuticals sector that supposedly ‘cure’. A system handed over to agricultural land speculators, toxic agrochemical manufacturers and their proprietary hybridised seeds, global commodity traders and purveyors of junk food. India is on course to be a subsidiary of global capital at the expense of its local agricultural communities and farmers, its ecosystems, its food security, its (limited) democracy and the overall wellbeing of the population. Alternatively, MSPs via state procurement of essential crops and commodities could be extended to the likes of maize, cotton, oilseed and pulses. This would not only boost the nation’s health but also increase farmers’ incomes. At the moment, only farmers in certain states who produce rice and wheat are the main beneficiaries of government procurement at MSP. Instead of rolling back the role of the public sector and surrendering the system to foreign corporations, there is a need to further expand official procurement and public distribution. That would cost around 20% of the handouts (‘incentives’) from the public purse received by corporations and their super-rich owners (based on 2020-21 figures). During the 2020-21 farmers protest, a video that appeared on social media showed Ayush Sinha, a top government official, encouraging officers to “smash the heads of farmers” if they broke through the barricades placed on a highway. Since the farmers renewed their protest in early 2024, tear gas and water cannons have been used against farmers to break up protests and prevent them marching to Delhi. The authorities must show international finance and agri-capital that they are being tough on farmers. They need to demonstrate that they remain steadfast in defeating the farmers movement in order to attract FDI (maintain ‘market confidence’) and pave the way for a corporate-financial takeover of the sector. In late 2021, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait stated that around 750 protesters had died during the year-long struggle. In summing up the situation, we may paraphrase renowned campaigner and environmentalist Aruna Rodrigues: It is a detailed horror tale in the making for India, handing over Indian sovereignty and food security to big business. There will come a time pretty soon — not something out there but imminent, unfolding even now — when we will pay the Cargills, Ambanis, Bill Gates, Walmarts (in the absence of national buffer food stocks) to send us food. We will finance borrowing from international markets to do it. A policy change to cash crops and the end to small-scale farmers, pushed aside by contract farming and GM crops. What is at stake is the integrity of India’s federal governance structure, its food security, the wellbeing of its farmers and farming communities and the overall health of the population. Meanwhile, the future remains uncertain for what has become a more fragmented farmers’ movement. Its capacity to regain momentum and draw in greater support from consumers and consumer groups against the neocolonial ambitions of global finance and foreign agricultural capital remains in question. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. THE BLACKROCK CLINIC has secured the planning green light for a new cardiology department, an eye centre and additional in-patient bedrooms at its south Dublin site. The planned new facilities are the first phase of a 16-year masterplan for the hospital which will also include the construction of a second hospital building on site. Dún-Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has given planning permission after concluding that the two-storey extension to the side of the main hospital is acceptable. Planning documents lodged with the application show that the private hospital is proceeding with the masterplan for the overall site following the acquisition of several neighbour sites adjoining the campus. Advertisement Documents also state that the main elements of the extension will include a new, dedicated cancer centre, a specialised women’s health centre, an additional therapy centre and a high-tech interventional cardiology labs. McGill Planning say that Blackrock Clinic admitted 52,185 inpatient and daycare patients in 2023 and this figure is expected to grow to 78,000 by 2033, which is around 50% increase over the next decade. It adds that the private clinic is currently operating at full capacity and the clinic will need to expand its capacity, significantly, in order to meet future growth. The application states that the hospital’s capacity has doubled since 2008. An existing site will host a second building, and deliver additional theatres and lab capacity to meet demand in its existing services. Henry J. Lyons Architects and Urban Designers were appointed in September 2023 to develop the plan, following competitive tender. The two-storey extension application is the first of several applications that will be submitted to the local authority.
