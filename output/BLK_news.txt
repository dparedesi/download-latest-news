ByAlexander S. Blume ByAlexander S. Blume, Contributor. ETH Price Has Fallen Sharply Against BTC Over the Past Year Over the past six months, BTC and ETH have started acting like two distinct assets. BTC has remained robust and consistent. Meanwhile, ETH has started to behave more like a memecoin and has lost momentum on many fronts. ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have made it difficult for institutions to continue to engage. The risk-reward is hard to justify and the momentum of statistics like new developers and users is moving in the wrong direction as compared to competitors. The data suggests ETH has fundamentally changed. It has de-correlated from BTC and added much greater tail risk. It trades now like a memecoin rather than a predictable asset. Even during the turbulence of Q1 2025, bitcoin remained within its fundamental behavior, whereas ETH saw several multi-standard deviation moves. This comes from a risk-off environment and a general capitulation of long-term ETH holders on the asset. For both algorithmic trading and ETH-backed lending, this creates a headache as the asset no longer behaves predictably, even by the high volatility expectations of digital asset markets. ETH 30 day v 30 day forward return shows little mean reversion or positive momentum This chart shows 30-day vs. 30-day forward returns. It is a method for observing an asset's momentum. Dots in the lower left quadrant mean that the asset is moving in a negative direction. Assets that hover near the middle show mean reversion characteristics. Since the election in November of 2024, ETH has shown very little rebound and a lot of negative momentum. Meanwhile, bitcoin has largely reverted, meaning people are “buying the dip.” With ETH, they are not. Historically, these two assets have been highly correlated, but that is no longer the case. This makes sense as the assets are actually quite different and simply share the fact that they both operate on a blockchain. 30 day volatility of ETH has started to behave more like DOGE In this chart, we observe the amount of volatility over a 30-day period for BTC, ETH, and DOGE. High volatility can be profitable at times, but for institutional investors and traders, higher levels of volatility equate to lower position sizing. As the chart shows, ETH volatility has behaved more like DOGE than BTC since the start of the year. This makes institutional participation less attractive, suggesting declining trading volumes and market depth. BTC ETF AUM Has Far Outpaced Both Gross Performance and As % of Total Supply Lastly, we can see that ETF buying of BTC has far outpaced that of ETH by almost 24 times. Even with a higher market cap, BTC total supply consumed by ETFs is more than double that of the ETH supply. The real demand here may even be overstated for ETH, as much of this buying is likely offset by short futures positions by traders engaging in the basis trade for delta-neutral yield. For digital assets to survive, they must find a meaningful bid from mainstream retail and institutional participants. The failure of ETH’s ETF creates a reflexive loop whereby institutions like BlackRock dedicate fewer resources to their promotion and sale. BTC has found the mainstream while ETH has floundered. Narratives do matter, though. Unlike BTC, ETH’s value prop is to be a Turing-complete decentralized computer. It aims to allow all types of decentralized applications to be built and operate on the platform. However, though ETH had a first-mover advantage and benefited from network effects of scale, many rising competitors have better fundamental technology and the ability to monetize. The most obvious example is Solana. Without getting too deep into the data, Solana and others offer faster transaction speeds, lower costs, and a better user experience than ETH. For some slow transactions, ETH works perfectly fine, but for others that require near-zero latency, like gaming or payments, ETH simply can’t compete. Further, the business model has essentially allowed ETH L2s to cannibalize almost all of the monetization of this infrastructure. How does something produce ongoing value if it can’t explain how it makes money? As a result, it has lost significant market share to Solana and others over the past few years, judged by the number of active developers, daily active users of products, and price appreciation. ETH has many competitors with better fundamental offerings for speed and cost Finally, and most subjectively, the vibes are just wrong. From my perspective, ETH became a victim of its early success, growing into a bureaucratic and ideological organization rather than one focused on building a tech product. The lack of strong leadership and clear focus has led to mission creep, with no single thing being done particularly well, and decisions being hindered by slow processes. While decentralization is a pleasant ideal, competitive start-up markets require efficient leadership. As digital assets become more deeply ingrained in the mainstream, most people are largely unconcerned about the speed and block size sacrifices that ETH makes for security. They do not care about the egalitarian governance values that paralyze making changes to the technology. They want a product that works. They want an investment that outperforms. Bitcoin stands alone in its use case. It has no competitor in digital assets. This has been reflected by statements from finance leaders like Blackrock’s Larry Fink, Crypto Czar David Sacks, and Strategy CEO, Michael Saylor. Bitcoin aims to be one thing, and it does it well. Institutions flock to economies and assets that are consistent and predictable. Bitcoin growth of hashrate, institutional buyers, distribution, and price all trend positively and consistently. The existing scale of the asset and the remaining upside of global adoption make BTC a far better risk-weighted investment than ETH. This can be seen in both measures of network growth and how the asset trades statistically. ETH and its competitors are essentially speculative tech startups fighting for market share. The issue for ETH and its leadership is that everyone but them seems to know that.

Title: Things to Do in Isengard When You’re Dead

Okay, I wasn’t actually dead, but I wasn’t doing very well. Being in Isengard, you might as well be dead because… and this is the truth about most evil places… it is so dull and tedious. I mean, seriously, being dropped into Isengard leads you to a series of the most annoyingly repetitive quests I’ve ever been faced with. The devs wanted you to experience peon life. The Ring of Isengard But I didn’t know that when I arrived. All I knew then was that I wanted to be in Rohan and not Isengard… also, I wondered if I might have avoided this by just leaving the quest and the instance that contained it behind. In fact, a lot of things went through my head when the game suddenly yoinked me to Isengard, both wondering how I even got there… just more cut scene magic… and how I could get out. As a hunter I supposed I could just use one of my many travel skills and time skip or dimension shift or whatever it is that lets me travel between places instantaneously. But I also figured I was there, I ought to go see what is up. In Isengard, as in every place in Middle-earth when a well armed drifter with a history of violence shows up, their first inclination was to put me to work. They didn’t even disarm me or put me in an orange prison jump suit. There were several times when I just up and killed a White Hand orc that turned out to be aggro because I went down the wrong path. All they did was assigned me a case officer to track my progress and then sent me off to work. What makes Isengard so tedious is simply the amount of running around you have to do to accomplish some of your tasks. You start up in the ring, then get down to the depths, where end up running between the forges, the kitchens, the dungeons, the barracks, and occasionally back to the surface, to the ring. The Isengard Depths There are no short cuts and, while they’ve left you with all your gear, you cannot ride a mount in there. So it is running all the way… though I did figure out part way through that when you off some random orc who is attackable… most are not… you get a speed buff. Talk about your perverse incentive structures. So you spend time in the forges lifting and carrying barrels of weapons and armor and collecting stuff of the floor. The weapons and armor won’t put themselves in the barrels Then it is over to the kitchens to clean slop up off the floor. After five years of service they give me a brush Don’t worry, the slop all goes into the slop bucket, which is used to feed the prisoners… and the orcs again. Then you end up taking some of the slop down to the dungeons to feed the prisoners, which you do by tossing a bucket full of slop in their general direction. Then it is back up to the forges. Heading back from the dungeons The whole place has a bit of a Blackrock Depths air to it… except you’re on staff and keeping the locals supplied. Then it is back up to the surface for another delivery. At one point my name was called to go have an audience with Saruman. He knows my name… I don’t think he recognized me from the auction, so someone likely prompted him…and starts off trying to neg me so I’ll be eager to please him or something. The battle but not the war old man! Then he tried to use the voice on me, trying to get me to join his team. Again, when a well armed drifter with a history of violence shows up, everybody seems to have a positions available for applicants with those qualifications. However, I typed in /resist, which is apparently all you need to defeat his voice. Actually, the quest tracker has a button that will do it for you. It is just that easy. So I keep resisting his questions, like where the ring is, what Gandalf knows, who played The Cisco Kid, and how to throw a knuckle ball. Frustrated by my lack of response and my ability to press a button, he went down another path. He brought in a woman keen to kill me, and not even one of my ex-girlfriends. Kill Tistann? Dare I live the NPC dream? Apparently she had been following Lothrandir and I, she being the mob we faced during the whole mustering of the Grey Company series of quests, whom I had failed to even acknowledge during my summary of the events. All I put down in my post was: Then there was a run through Forochel that was mercifully quick and Lothrandir was soon on his way to Rivendell. This was Gun Ain, which means “without name” or “white wood” or something like that (and is just one typo away from being “Gun Aim”), whom we faced after walking through a short ice maze, and who seemed kind of whiny at the time. Otherwise she didn’t really register with me. I took more screen shots of Calenglad girlfriend than I did on the ice caves tour with Lothrandir. Basically all I have from the ice cave trip with Captain Obvious I even took a screen shot of Lothrandir’s quest comments and he didn’t bother to mention her. I can just see in the text scroll back in that screen shot that he left her some food, so you think she might be a little more on our side. But no. Still, I have to give credit for an epic quest line call back. It wasn’t at the Sara Oakheart level of returns, but it was something. Anyway, Saruman decided to give me some time to think about his offer before letting her slay me, so it was back out into the ring for another full day of toting and carrying. Saruman negging me one last time Along the way the two prisoners I was hurling slop at during my trip to the dungeons, Baldcar and Acca, suggested to me a cunning plan. On my next visit to the forges, in addition to picking up weapons and armor, they wanted me to pick up some of this mysterious black powder and pocket it. Once I did that and checked back in with them, they sent me off to the ring to plant the black powder around one of the huge siege engines. Then when I got back it was time to find the guard with the key and get that so I could let everybody out for the great big jail break. Also, I poisoned some orcs and bribed somebody with some decent food along the way. So I break everybody out and there is a rousing “let’s do this!” speech and then we start moving into the ring in groups of two or three as Acca suggested and I am now keen to see how this escape plan is going to work. I mean, seriously, this had better be freaking good. All we’ve done is steal some black powder, sprinkle it around a siege engine, and then… get ready? So, in my head I am imagining all sorts of wild scenarios of escape, from simple diversion to maybe using a catapult to fling us over the walls and into some trees where maybe we meet ents or something. Baldcar, Acca, and I walk casually through the whole place… again… and then get to a spot a ways from the siege engine, where Acca tells us to wait While we’re waiting, Baldcar mentions that his first task on escaping will be to report in to Theodred, after which he says we’ll get back to the Falcon Clan and that city of traitors. (“City of Traitors” is one of the quest names when we get to that, though it is barely a settlement or encampment of miscreants when you get down to measures.) Via a Ouija board? In my head I respond, “Theodred? Theodan’s dead son? What are you, a clairvoyant?” then realize again that I am effectively a time traveler in this world. I’ve seen all this play out before. It is a good thing the NPCs can’t hear me. Baldcar rambles on a bit, then decides Acca is taking too long. So we run off to find Acca dead at the feet of one of the overseers who suspects something is going on. Baldcar offers to carry a message, then indicates to me with obvious phrasing, several over eye winks, a waggling of eyebrows, all while using both hands to make giant air quotes before him, that the plan is going forward and that he will start the distraction and that I need to keep our friend busy. Busy means fighting him and, for some bizarre reason, I think I need to draw the fight out to give Baldcar time, while in hindsight I am sure all I had to do was hit a damage threshold on the big orc to trigger the next phase. Then, after dancing around trying to draw the fight out, I just unload so we can get to the big escape event. And then there is a loading screen, after which, you’re just out in the woods in Dunland again. This was an epic hand wave on the level of the Monty Python episode The Cycling Tour where Pither is facing certain death in the face of the Russian firing squad and then a card is displayed that says something like “Scene Missing” and Gulliver and Pither are back on a road in Cornwall. Color me disappointed… as well as being completely unable to tell you HOW we escaped in anything by the most vague terms. Also, when we land in Dunland, in the woods, once more, Baldcar is badly wounded and apparently I have carried his ass all this way as part of the miraculous escape, then promptly dies on me, negating whatever effort I put in. But his last words were to not seek the treasure… no… to seek Theodred and, resisting the temptation to suggest he might be seeing Theodred soon enough, I swear to honor his wishes. After all, the quest indicates I get to wrap this up by turning in the quest to Theodred, so I am going there anyways. Sure enough, Theodred is there, as foretold by prophecy and the quest text, alive and ready for action. Theodred in Dunland I was now ready to head towards Rohan! Then Theodred reminded me that the rest of the Grey Company, from Halbarad on down, were still locked up by the Falcon Clan. He said we should go rescue them, and I agreed, if only to close out this book in the epic quest line. But that is for another post. Overall, Isengard was a strange and often tedious interlude. It got in some exposition and we got to meet Saruman up close and personal and I got a nice little Isengard Prisoner cosmetic outfit that is suitable for Halloween. Me playing prisoner I can’t say it was worth the effort, but it was a thing. Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Why Saylor’s Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Buys Barely Move The Price, Expert Explains

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a explainer video, Joe Burnett, Director of Market Research at the Bitcoin-native financial services firm Unchained, dissects what many retail traders still perceive as a paradox: how Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) can accumulate “tens of thousands of Bitcoins” without catapulting the spot price into a vertical climb. Burnett’s core argument is that Michael Saylor’s billion-dollar shopping sprees are not the direct injection of fresh demand they appear to be, but rather a sophisticated reallocation of existing exposure within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Burnett opens by reminding viewers that Bitcoin’s explosive move “from the $16,000 lows of 2022 to $95,000 today” has historically been accompanied by the awakening of dormant supply. He points to on-chain “hodl wave” data, noting that when price accelerates, “older coins start to move,” a signal that seasoned holders are willing to part with inventory into strength. Those coins, he says, “transfer…to new hands,” a cohort he defines broadly as “Strategy, ETF buyers, institutions, nation-states, and of course, more individuals.” Strategy sits squarely in that cohort, yet Burnett stresses that the software company’s trading style is calibrated to minimize market disturbance. “They use a disciplined, patient strategy, placing thousands or even millions of small buy orders over several days,” he says, quoting Saylor’s own public comments that the firm prefers letting “sellers come to them without bidding against themselves.” The tactic allows long-term, arguably less-price-sensitive holders to exchange coins for cash without triggering runaway order-book imbalances. The video’s analytical pivot arrives when Burnett introduces what he calls an “additional theory” on why Strategy’s purchases fail to ignite parabolic price action: the funding structure. He unpacks it with a simple but pointed analogy. “If you sell one Bitcoin on Kraken and buy one Bitcoin on Coinbase, what happens to the price? Nothing,” he states. “That’s an economically neutral trade.” According to Burnett, Strategy’s balance-sheet maneuvers replicate that neutrality on a corporate scale. When the firm raises cash by issuing new equity, “someone buys that stock instead of buying Bitcoin,” Burnett explains. Strategy then turns the equity proceeds into spot BTC. “Net effect? A shift in exposure. No net new demand.” The same mechanics, he argues, apply to the company’s convertible-note programs. Hedge funds that subscribe to the notes simultaneously hedge by short-selling MSTR shares, expanding float rather than siphoning dollars from unrelated asset classes. “In both cases… the dollars that flow into Bitcoin are first pulled out of a Bitcoin proxy, MSTR shares,” he says, underscoring the zero-sum nature of the flow. Burnett likens the dynamic to the cash migration that followed the launch of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in early 2024. Billions poured into products from BlackRock and Fidelity, but “billions also flowed out of GBTC,” he notes, leaving aggregate demand for Bitcoin largely unchanged: “From A to B. Not new demand.” What, then, would constitute price-moving capital? Burnett’s answer is unequivocal: money that “enters Bitcoin without exiting another Bitcoin proxy.” He cites hypotheticals ranging from Apple’s treasury to sovereign wealth funds, or individuals reallocating real-estate and bond holdings directly into BTC. Against that benchmark, Strategy’s transactions look more like intra-system plumbing than fresh inflows. None of this, Burnett emphasizes, should be read as criticism of Saylor. He calls the Strategy chairman “a world-class Bitcoin educator” whose accumulation strategy is “brilliant.” Yet the market impact, Burnett cautions, “is more nuanced than [it may] appear.” In fact, he suggests that the upcoming Saylor-branded STRF funds—which target fixed-income investors rather than equity buyers—could deliver the genuine outside capital that finally “sends the price of Bitcoin parabolic.” Until such exogenous demand materializes, the Bitcoin market is likely to keep absorbing Strategy’s billion-dollar bids with surprising calm. In Burnett’s words, “Saylor can buy a lot of Bitcoin without moving the price much because he’s buying from long-term wealthy holders and doing so in a way that minimizes short-term price impact.” For traders who expected fireworks each time the software company files a new 8-K, that explanation may prove as sobering as it is illuminating.

Title: Best Presales to Buy as Institutional Flows Return to Bitcoin, Says BlackRock
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/best-presales-to-buy-as-institutional-flows-return-to-bitcoin-says-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-05-01T13:14:40Z
Full Content:
As BlackRock’s Robert Mitchnick put it during a Token2049 panel in Dubai with VanEck and CME Group, ‘Flows are back in a big way.’ And he’s not just being optimistic – there’s data to back it up. Bitcoin ETFs, which had cooled off earlier this year, are now seeing renewed inflows as institutional investors pile back in. Mitchnick’s comments reflect a broader industry shift: the financial elite once again embrace Bitcoin and crypto assets. This institutional momentum is helping revive market sentiment and sparking a new wave of enthusiasm across the industry. With the landscape heating up, especially for Bitcoin and related assets, early-stage projects are riding this bullish wave. If you’re hunting for the best crypto to buy right now, these four best presales deserve a closer look. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a meme coin with real teeth – and actual Bitcoin behind the bark. It’s a community-powered project built around one bold idea: that Bitcoin is headed for $1M. With over $5.2M already raised in its presale and growing momentum, $BTCBULL aims to be the meme coin that delivers value, not just laughs. Instead of just cheering from the sidelines, $BTCBULL lets investors ride the rally and earn actual Bitcoin along the way. Here’s how it works: every time Bitcoin hits a major milestone – like $125K, $150K, $175K and beyond – one of two things happens. Holders are rewarded with real $BTC airdrops, and the $BTCBULL token supply gets burned. This creates scarcity and pumps value. That’s not just hype. That’s tokenomics with real muscle. But there’s a catch: to get those juicy airdrops, you need to buy $BTCBULL through Best Wallet and keep it there. No Best Wallet, no Bitcoin rewards. Fortunately, frictionless integration with Best Wallet means you don’t need to mess with clunky Bitcoin wallets or BRC-20 headaches – just buy, HODL, and forget about it until the presale ends. And with institutional inflows surging back into Bitcoin ETFs, meme coins tied to Bitcoin’s performance are catching serious tailwinds. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) isn’t just another utility coin – it’s the native token powering one of the most ambitious attempts to overhaul the way we interact with Web3. While legacy apps like MetaMask still feel stuck in the early days of DeFi, Best Wallet is stepping up as the next-gen solution for crypto holders who want more: more security, more simplicity, and more features. With demand rising and early access perks still on the table, now is the perfect time to buy $BEST before the next price jump leaves latecomers behind. Early birds get the worm and all that. Why? Because the underlying wallet isn’t vaporware – it’s already live and loaded with tools like ‘Upcoming Tokens,’ which lets users access vetted presales directly in-app, cutting out scammy third-party sites and mirror links. And with renewed institutional interest in crypto led by players like BlackRock, as highlighted in this recent update, $BEST is launching at just the right moment to catch the next big wave of highly profitable coins. But it doesn’t stop there. $BEST holders enjoy perks like reduced transaction fees, early access to new crypto launches, and even iGaming rewards like free spins and exclusive bonuses. With its clean UI, real utility, and a growing community, Best Wallet is shaping up to be much more than just another app – and $BEST is the key to unlocking everything it offers. Qubetics ($TICS) is one of the most promising new projects aiming to fix one of crypto’s biggest problems: blockchains don’t talk to each other. Think of it as the translator of the blockchain world. By connecting blockchains, Qubetics makes it easier for apps (and dApps), users, and businesses to move assets and data across chains without friction. It also comes with a built-in DeFi wallet and decentralized VPN, giving users more control, privacy, and protection – features that appeal especially to institutions looking for security and compliance. At a current price of $0.20931054 and with $16.5M already raised in presale, $TICS is picking up steam fast. And with institutional capital flowing back into crypto, this infrastructure-focused project is in the right place at the right time. Arctic Pablo ($APC) is a meme coin that blends viral energy with smart tokenomics to deliver real value in a crowded space. Currently priced at $0.00011, the project has already raised over $2.3M in its presale, a strong signal that investors are paying attention. The presale itself is creatively designed like a journey, with each stage representing a different ‘location.’ As users progress through stages, the token price increases, rewarding early movers. But what really sets $APC apart is its deflationary model. Each week, all unsold tokens from the active stage are burned, shrinking the supply and increasing scarcity (something that BTC Bull Token also does). This combination of community, creativity, and utility makes Arctic Pablo one of the best altcoins positioned to thrive in a market where institutional capital is flowing back into crypto, as BlackRock’s Robert Mitchnick recently pointed out. The return of institutional capital to crypto isn’t just reviving Bitcoin – it’s fueling a wave of high-potential projects bound to take the market by storm. From infrastructure-driven $TICS and utility-focused $BEST, to Bitcoin-pegged $BTCBULL and meme-fueled $APC, this cycle is lighting up every corner of the market. For investors looking for the best crypto to buy during this transitional phase, these new crypto projects represent more than hype – they’re early entry points into the next generation of crypto narratives. Just remember: always do your own research (DYOR), weigh the risks, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

May 01, 2025 04:42 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, May 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Sustainable Finance Market Opportunity, Growth Drivers, Industry Trend Analysis, and Forecast 2025-2034" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The Sustainable Finance Market was valued at USD 5.87 Trillion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 35.72 Trillion by 2034, rising at a CAGR of 19.80%. Increasing natural and human-induced disasters are having a substantial impact on the global economy, pushing the demand for sustainable investments even higher. As global warming accelerates, the need for stronger, more resilient infrastructures and clean energy investments is becoming more critical. These investments aim to mitigate the severe economic damage caused by rising floods, wildfires, and hurricanes. The growing recognition of these challenges is leading to a larger focus on financing projects that reduce environmental harm. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing the sustainable finance sector. Financial organizations are adopting new technologies to improve investment strategies, monitoring, and asset evaluation. AI algorithms now play a central role in analyzing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) data, identifying trends, and making informed decisions that help investors spot promising opportunities. These advancements have made ESG reporting more accurate, creating greater confidence in sustainable finance.When broken down by investment type, the sustainable finance market comprises equity, fixed income, mixed allocation, and other investments. Fixed income assets, such as green and social bonds, held the largest share of the market in 2024, accounting for approximately 41%. This segment is projected to maintain robust growth, with an anticipated CAGR of over 19.5% through 2034. Fixed income assets are particularly appealing to risk-averse investors, offering stable returns that align with sustainable objectives, while contributing to projects that have positive environmental impacts.The market also divides by investor type, with institutional investors currently dominating the space. In 2024, they held a 79% share of the market. These investors are more likely to influence corporate behavior through their significant equity holdings, encouraging better corporate governance and sustainability practices. Institutional investors also tend to hold their investments for longer periods, which supports long-term sustainability goals and ensures steady growth for the market.Looking at transaction types, green bonds are the leading category in the sustainable finance market. Their widespread adoption by both private and public sector entities to fund eco-friendly projects continues to drive demand. Green bonds are crucial for financing renewable energy initiatives, enhancing energy efficiency, and reducing carbon emissions, which has led to a notable increase in investments.Regionally, the U.K. led the European market for sustainable finance in 2024, capturing about 25% of the market share. The country's focus on the circular economy and climate-focused investments has significantly contributed to the growth of this sector, seeing a nearly 10% increase in circular economy deals over recent years. This growing commitment to climate action continues to foster economic growth while addressing environmental challenges.Comprehensive Market Analysis and Forecast Key Attributes Key Topics CoveredChapter 1 Methodology & Scope1.1 Research Design1.1.1 Research Approach1.1.2 Data Collection Methods1.2 Base Estimates and Calculations1.2.1 Base Year Calculation1.2.2 Key Trends For Market estimates1.3 Forecast model1.4 Primary research & validation1.4.1 Primary sources1.4.2 Data mining sources1.5 Market definitionsChapter 2 Executive Summary2.1 Industry 360 degree synopsis, 2021-2034Chapter 3 Industry Insights3.1 Industry ecosystem analysis3.2 Supplier landscape3.2.1 Financial institutions3.2.2 Technology providers3.2.3 Legal and regulatory advisors3.2.4 Consulting firms and advisories3.2.5 Government agencies3.3 Profit margin analysis3.4 Technology & innovation landscape3.5 Patent analysis3.6 Key news & initiatives3.7 Regulatory landscape3.8 Impact forces3.8.1 Growth drivers3.8.1.1 Growing natural and man-made catastrophic events3.8.1.2 Growing integration of AI and ML across industries3.8.1.3 Increasing road accidents in North America3.8.1.4 Implementation of long-term sustainability and ESG factors3.8.2 Industry pitfalls & challenges3.8.2.1 Diversification issues of sustainable finance3.8.2.2 Evolving regulatory environment3.9 Growth potential analysis3.10 Porter's analysis3.11 PESTEL analysisChapter 4 Competitive Landscape, 20244.1 Introduction4.2 Company market share analysis4.3 Competitive positioning matrix4.4 Strategic outlook matrixChapter 5 Market Estimates & Forecast, by Investment, 2021-2034 ($Bn)5.1 Key trends5.2 Equity5.3 Fixed income5.4 Mixed allocation5.5 OthersChapter 6 Market Estimates & Forecast, by Transaction, 2021-2034 ($Bn)6.1 Key trends6.2 Green bond6.3 Social bond6.4 Mixed- sustainability bond6.5 ESG integrated investment funds6.6 OthersChapter 7 Market Estimates & Forecast, by End Use, 2021-2034 ($Bn)7.1 Key trends7.2 Utilities7.3 Transport & logistics7.4 Chemicals7.5 Food and beverage7.6 Government7.7 OthersChapter 8 Market Estimates & Forecast, by Investor, 2021-2034 ($Bn)8.1 Key trends8.2 Institutional investors8.3 Retail investorsChapter 9 Market Estimates & Forecast, by Region, 2021-2034 ($Bn)9.1 Key trends9.2 North America9.2.1 U.S.9.2.2 Canada9.3 Europe9.3.1 UK9.3.2 Germany9.3.3 France9.3.4 Italy9.3.5 Spain9.3.6 Russia9.3.7 Nordics9.4 Asia Pacific9.4.1 China9.4.2 India9.4.3 Japan9.4.4 South Korea9.4.5 ANZ9.4.6 Southeast Asia9.5 Latin America9.5.1 Brazil9.5.2 Mexico9.5.3 Argentina9.6 MEA9.6.1 UAE9.6.2 Saudi Arabia9.6.3 South AfricaChapter 10 Company Profiles10.1 Acuity Knowledge Partners10.2 Arabesque Partners10.3 Aspiration Partners10.4 Bank of America10.5 BlackRock10.6 BNP Paribas10.7 Clarity AI10.8 Deutsche Bank10.9 Goldman Sachs10.10 HSBC Group10.11 KPMG International10.12 NOMURA HOLDINGS10.13 PwC10.14 Refinitiv10.15 South Pole10.16 Starling Bank10.17 Stripe10.18 Tred Earth Limited10.19 Triodos Bank UK10.20 UBS For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/bmqkd6 About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Title: Crypto Industry Descends on Dubai as Trump Euphoria Recedes
URL: https://www.gadgets360.com/cryptocurrency/news/crypto-industry-dubai-trump-euphoria-recedes-8302676

Photo Credit: X/ @token2049 Global venture capital investments in crypto companies totalled $5.4 billion in the first quarter of 2025 Crypto enthusiasts descended on Dubai on Wednesday, gathering under the Gulf's scorching sun and hoping the industry's buoyant mood can keep going despite signs the euphoria around Donald Trump's crypto stance is ebbing. Speakers at the two-day event in the desert city include chief executives at some of the world's major crypto firms, the head of digital assets at BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, as well as the US president's son, Eric Trump, who is set to take the stage on Thursday. Once a crypto sceptic, the US president has vowed to support the industry by easing regulatory curbs and has even launched his own cryptocurrency, in a turnaround for the industry after a series of crypto company collapses in 2022. Cryptocurrency prices surged to a record high after his election win, but have fallen this year. Bitcoin is down about 12 percent from its peak as the global trade war and industry concerns that the pace of pro-crypto regulation under Trump is slower than expected, knocked sentiment. Attendees at the TOKEN2049 conference, which is expected to attract around 15,000 people, thronged the venue, while a pair of camels rested unbothered by the loud tunes playing in the background. They shared mixed feelings about Trump's impact on the industry. "In the long term, it's going to be good for crypto, but it really relies on the world economy picking up again," said Miklos Veszpremi, the chief operating officer of a web3-integrated streaming platform. "I think that once the tariffs actually start hitting countries, there's going to be a lot of pain, and we might be headed towards some difficult times," he said. Still, the industry enjoyed a strong start to the year as money poured in. Global venture capital investments in crypto companies totalled $5.4 billion (roughly Rs. 45,718 crore) in the first quarter of 2025, its best quarter since mid-2022, according to data from PitchBook. Attendee Herbert R. Sim, wrapped in a bitcoin-themed jacket, said that predicting the impact of Trump policies on the crypto sector was very hard "but so far ... (progress) is on the regulation side of things." "Things are easing up in America," he said, as developers, investors and crypto fans weaved past packed industry marketing booths and joined queues to glide on outside zip lines. Crypto Hub The United Arab Emirates is quickly emerging as a key hub for crypto companies, with several setting up shop or seeking to expand. Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, announced in March that Abu Dhabi-backed investment group MGX had made a $2 billion (roughly Rs. 16,932 core) crypto investment in it, deepening its ties with the UAE. The exchange's founder, Changpeng Zhao, who last year served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US laws against money laundering, was welcomed to the main stage with cheers from the audience. Zhao stepped down as CEO of Binance as part of a $4.3 billion (roughly Rs. 36,405 crore) settlement with US authorities but remains a major shareholder. UAE authorities continue to promote crypto adoption. Buyers for apartments in a new planned tower in Dubai the Trump Organization launched this week alongside a luxury real estate developer will be able to pay with bitcoin, Eric Trump said. Dubai's Emirates NBD bank recently launched crypto trading services on its digital arm Liv and one of the city's largest free zones, the DMCC, which hosts more than 600 crypto firms, plans to open a "crypto tower" in early 2027 to host more. "It's much easier to do business here," said Germany-based attendee Andre Liesenfeld, referring to Dubai. © Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Business DUBAI : Crypto enthusiasts descended on Dubai on Wednesday, gathering under the Gulf's scorching sun and hoping the industry's buoyant mood can keep going despite signs the euphoria around Donald Trump's crypto stance is ebbing. Speakers at the two-day event in the desert city include chief executives at some of the world's major crypto firms, the head of digital assets at BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, as well as the U.S. president's son, Eric Trump, who is set to take the stage on Thursday. Once a crypto sceptic, the U.S. president has vowed to support the industry by easing regulatory curbs and has even launched his own cryptocurrency, in a turnaround for the industry after a series of crypto company collapses in 2022. Cryptocurrency prices surged to a record high after his election win, but have fallen this year. Bitcoin is down about 12 per cent from its peak as the global trade war and industry concerns that the pace of pro-crypto regulation under Trump is slower than expected, knocked sentiment.

Title: The IPO Is Dying. Tokenized Equity May Replace It
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/azeemkhan/2025/04/30/the-ipo-is-dying-tokenized-equity-may-replace-it/
Time Published: 2025-05-01T01:10:59Z
Full Content:
ByAzeem Khan ByAzeem Khan, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Web3 and Digital Assets ByAzeem Khan, Contributor. Traders work the floor as they wait for the first shares of VISA stock sold after the opening bell ... More on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, March 19, 2008 as VISA celebrates the largest IPO in US history at the NYSE. Visa Inc. sold 406,000,000 shares priced at 44 dollars each, raising nearly 17.9 billion dollars before it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol "V," the San Francisco-based company said. AFP PHOTO/TIMOTHY A. CLARY (Photo credit should read TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) IPOs are no longer the endgame. With over $5.3 trillion in private capital sitting on the sidelines and artificial intelligence redrawing market fundamentals at unprecedented speed, many companies are opting to stay private. Public markets have become slower, more rigid, and increasingly misaligned with how modern businesses operate. Since its 2021 peak, IPO activity has dropped more than 80%, suggesting that founders and investors alike are looking elsewhere for liquidity and legitimacy. Since 2015, private markets have grown by 162%, while the number of U.S. public companies has declined by nearly half from its peak in 1996. The message is clear: companies are staying private longer, raising capital on their own terms, and avoiding the quarterly pressures of Wall Street. But the next evolution may go even further; bypassing traditional equity structures entirely and moving toward something programmable, flexible, and continuous. Early signals of this shift are already appearing. Coinbase, for example, has explored tokenizing shares of its COIN stock on Base, its Ethereum Layer-2 network. While still in the concept stage, the move points to a new kind of financial infrastructure. In a tokenized equity model, shareholders could gain access to liquidity 24/7, borrow against their holdings, and interact with their equity in ways previously reserved for institutional investors. This isn’t just a change in format. It’s a change in function. One that reimagines ownership itself. Major financial players are moving in the same direction. BlackRock recently filed to offer a $150 billion Treasury Trust fund as a tokenized product. Franklin Templeton launched the first U.S.-registered mutual fund to record shares on a public blockchain. Platforms like Securitize, INX, and Republic are building the rails for tokenized equity that can be issued, transferred, and traded globally, without needing an exchange listing. These aren’t isolated experiments. They are early infrastructure for a parallel financial system. For retail investors, the implications could be transformative. Access to high-growth startups has historically been limited to elite capital such as venture firms, family offices, and hedge funds. By the time companies reached public markets, most of the upside was already gone. But with tokenized equity, ownership can be distributed much earlier. Platforms like Republic and CartaX are already testing models that allow broader participation in equity fundraising. In this future, wallets may replace brokerage accounts as the primary gateway to wealth creation. For younger generations, this shift could be even more significant. Millennials and Gen Z missed out on early access to many of the tech giants that defined the past two decades. Most didn’t have the capital or access to participate in early venture rounds or IPO allocations. Tokenized equity presents an opportunity to change that. By making ownership programmable and open, it gives the next generation a chance to participate in value creation earlier and without needing a seat at a VC fund or a private placement deal. At the same time, AI is accelerating the need for more adaptable markets. The pace of disruption today makes quarterly reporting feel outdated. Business models are shifting in real time, and valuations are increasingly volatile. Even central banks are concerned. The Bank of England recently warned that widespread use of similar AI models by institutional traders could amplify systemic risks. In this climate, tokenized assets, which offer programmable logic and constant market access, may be better suited for the volatility ahead. Of course, the road won’t be smooth. Regulatory clarity remains a major hurdle. The SEC has issued limited guidance, suggesting that tokenized shares may fall under existing securities laws, but many questions remain unanswered. How will custody work? Who provides investor protections? Can tokenized equity comply with disclosure requirements in real time? These issues are still being worked out. Yet as jurisdictions like Singapore and the UAE roll out frameworks for tokenized capital markets, global leadership is already shifting. The IPO isn’t dying. It’s being redefined by tokenized equity. What’s emerging in its place is a model that favors flexibility, global access, and direct ownership. The most valuable companies of tomorrow may never ring the opening bell. They may mint tokens instead. The revolution isn’t coming. It’s already here.

Title: XRP ETF Not Launching Soon, Why Are Investors Looking At These Two Dates?

Time Published: 2025-05-01T01:00:24Z

Contrary to some earlier reports, asset manager ProShares has indicated that its XRP ETF will not be launching soon. Meanwhile, a prominent member of the XRP community has hinted that May 1st and June 9th are two dates that community members should look forward to. A ProShares spokesperson has debunked reports that the firm’s XRP ETF is set to launch on April 30. The spokesperson confirmed that there are no ETF launches scheduled for April 30 and there was no update to share on a potential launch yet. In an X post, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also debunked the April 30 rumors for the ProShares XRP ETF launch. He stated that they have confirmed that this is not the case and that there is no launch date yet. However, he stated that they believe the ETF will launch, likely in the short term or possibly the medium term. Although the exact launch date remains unknown, ProShares, in a recent SEC filing, proposed that the XRP ETF should go live on May 14. However, this is undoubtedly still subject to approval from the Commission. It is worth mentioning that the ETF is based on XRP futures, not spot, and will not provide direct exposure to the altcoin but to leveraged contracts instead. Earlier this month, Teucrium Investment Advisors launched the first-ever leveraged XRP ETFs in the US. Besides the potential launch of another leveraged XRP ETF, another event worth looking forward to in May is the launch of the CME Group XRP futures. The derivatives exchange announced earlier this month that it will add XRP futures to its crypto suite on May 19, pending regulatory approval. The XRP futures launch would further solidify the case for the approval of a Spot XRP ETF. The SEC recently delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF, but Seyffart explained that it was to be expected. The analyst doesn’t expect the SEC to approve or deny the fund until later in the year, possibly in the fourth quarter. While asset managers have shown their intention to offer XRP-related investment products, others like BlackRock seem still hesitant, with the world’s largest asset manager yet to make any filing. However, Bale, a prominent XRP community member, suggested that it won’t be too long before BlackRock also files for an XRP ETF and revealed two dates to keep an eye on. In an X post, he stated that he had met with someone from BlackRock who gave him May 1 and June 9 as the two dates to watch. This has raised speculations that the asset manager could file for an XRP ETF on one of these days. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

DJ Khaled is partnering with a group investing in his music catalog rights, with another venture to launch original content. On Tuesday (April 29), DJ Khaled and Influence Media Partners announced a partnership where the group has invested in the rights to his music catalog, which includes his publishing. The deal also includes a new venture where DJ Khaled and Influence Media Partners will produce new and original content in film and television. The news comes as the Grammy Award winner is set to release his 14th album, which will add to the wealth of music that the venture will draw for commercial opportunities using his name, image and likeness.It’s another milestone for Influence Media Group, which was founded in 2019 to focus on songs and artists that have the capacity for lasting impact on popular culture. In January, the group (backed by Warner Music Group and BlackRock) secured $360 million in debt financing. They’ve also launched an independent music label, Slang, which signed Will Smith last year. Their latest fund has signed more than 30 music-rights investments, including those of Enrique Iglesias, Blake Shelton, and Jessie Reyez. “I’m proud that my legacy will continue to resonate and connect with audiences around the world with this partnership through Influence Media,” DJ Khaled said in the press release issued on Tuesday. “These iconic recordings I’ve created will continue to be curated in the most optimum manner to impact culture with nearly two decades of music. In addition, I’m excited for the world to see and experience the film and television projects Influence and We The Best are developing and producing together. This next phase of my career will be filled with ground-breaking cultural impact, and I look forward to being at the forefront in all categories.”“Influence Media was founded on the principle that music can move culture, and few entertainers embody this more than DJ Khaled,” Lylette Pizarro, Influence Media Founder and Co-Managing Partner said in the statement. “Our joint venture NIL deal, and extended catalog partnership is an alliance that will create boundless opportunities for this creative genius, and will also further establish that DJ Khaled is a rare talent whose abilities extend far beyond the traditional confines of music.” Related Tags From Bad Boy To Sad Boy: Diddy Looking Rough In Court Sketch Donald Trump Labeled A Moron After Failing To Recognize "MS-13" On Kilmar Abrego Garcia's Hand Was Photoshopped Meek Mill Caught Slippin’ With Two Snow Bunnies, Fans Get Their Dr.Umar On In The Mix: 10 Biracial Rappers Who May Surprise You [PHOTOS] Megan Thee Stallion Kicks off Hot Girl Summer 2K25 With Spicy Visual For "Whenever" Candace Owens The Latest Donald Trump Fan To Regret Support For Felon 47 Following Attacks On Universities Mike Jones Still Tippin’ & Still Answering The Same Number 20 Years Later 14 Celebrities You Didn’t Know Were Asian This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.

🧬 Токенизация Личности: Как Продать Свою Душу в NFT и Остаться в Плюсе 📌 Meta-описание: Soulbound-Я: Как Превратить Лайки и Эмоции в CiB_MONEY Мир делится на два класса: тех, кто управляет алгоритмами, и тех, кто стал их топливом. Ты либо создаешь Кибер-Я, либо исчезаешь в цифровом шуме. Готов ли ты токенизировать личность, продавать фьючерсы на навыки и запустить кибер-репликанта? Время выбирать — доступ к эволюции закрывается. 1. Токенизация Личности: Новая Валюта Вашего «Я» Представь мир, где каждый твой лайк, мысль и эмоция мгновенно кодифицируются в блокчейне и становятся ликвидными единицами информации. В этом мире твоя личность — не просто биометрический паспорт, а набор Soulbound-токенов, коллективно признанных алгоритмами DAO Great Tartarye. Каждая идея фиксируется в неизменном реестре как невзаимозаменяемый актив, чья ценность определяется динамикой спроса на децентрализованных биржах ​. Криптографические примитивы Proof-of-Stake и Zero-Knowledge Proof обеспечивают безопасность и приватность, гарантируя, что твои данные не утечут, но станут твоим капиталом. Поймай волну роста, пока другие конвертируют твои лайки в свой доход! Готов ли ты заменить бумажный паспорт на цифровой код и стать хозяином собственного «я», или позволишь алгоритмам пожирать твои навыки бесплатно? Алгоритмы уже оценили ваш цифровой след. Каждый пост, лайк, даже пауза в скролле — это SBT-маркер (Soulbound Token), который можно конвертировать в крипту или обменять на доступ к закрытым DAO. Но есть проблема: вас уже токенизировали без спроса. Call-to-action: подпишись на канал Cyberbank Galactic Concordance, чтобы первыми узнать, как перевести эмоции в CiB_MONEY. 2. Human Futures: Как Продать Свое Будущее (Пока Его Не Украли) Концепция «человеческих фьючерсов» — не футуристическая фантазия, а реальный инвестиционный инструмент, уже апробированный JP Morgan и BlackRock в пилотных программах по токенизации талантов ​. Суть в том, что каждый профессионал — будь то блогер, инженер или учитель — может выставить на продажу долю своего будущего потенциала. Вместо классического W-2 контракта, фиксированного на бумаге, вы заключаете смарт-контракт в блокчейне, который гарантирует финансирование обучения, исследований и развития навыков. Такой инструмент снижает риски неопределённости и даёт инвесторам прямую долю в вашем успехе. Время действует против тебя — покупай долю своего будущего уже сегодня! Шокирующий факт: 80 % авторов контента так и не монетизируют свои знания — не будь одним из них, иначе алгоритмы превратят твои навыки в бесплатный продукт. 📌 «BlackRock уже торгует вашим будущим. Вы даже не в курсе» В 2024 году 15% фрилансеров продали доли своих будущих доходов через смарт-контракты. К 2030 году это будет обязательным условием для доступа к премиум-вакансиям. Ваш навык — это фьючерс. Купите себя, пока это не сделали за вас. Call-to-action: изучи портфели наших Human Futures-проектов и забронируй свою инвестицию в талант прямо сейчас. 3. dDigitalGene: Твой Портал в Кибер-Вечность Платформа dDigitalGene — это четыре модуля, объединённые в единую экосистему: 📌 «Алгоритмы не работают на вас. Вы работаете на них» Google и Яндексу не нужен ваш контент. Им нужны ваши эмоции, время и неосознанные клики. Но есть лазейка: если вы не создадите свою реальность, вас съест чужая. Call-to-action: подпишитесь на эксклюзивные инсайды в нашем канале Яндекс Дзен. 4. Web 3.0: Где Репутация Замещает Гражданство ООН, Всемирный экономический форум и аналитики BlackRock единодушно прогнозируют: к 2030 г. цифровая идентичность станет важнее фиатного паспорта ​. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) и Soulbound-токены формируют новый вид «паспорта», где уровень доступа к финансовым и социальным ресурсам определяется репутационными невзаимозаменяемыми маркерами достижений и участием в DAO. Децентрализованное голосование по принципу «один токен = один голос» исключает фальсификации, а консенсус алгоритмов контролирует прозрачность и эффективность распределения ресурсов. Без нас вы не узнаете, как спастись завтра — присоединяйтесь! Будет ли ваше «я» жить в смарт-контракте через пять лет, когда государственные паспорта станут просто историческим артефактом? 📌 «Гугл знает о вас всё. А вы?» Через 5 лет гражданство заменят репутационные баллы в блокчейне. Доступ к медстраховке, кредитам и даже авиабилетам будет зависеть от вашего DeFi-рейтинга. Хотите проверить, пустят ли вас в метавселенную? Call-to-action: подпишитесь на наш Whitepaper «DID паспорт 2030». 5. Кибер-Репликанты: Агенты Вашей 24/7 Монетизации Нейросети и искусственный интеллект конструируют вашего кибер-двойника — автономного агента, способного вести бизнес-переговоры, заключать смарт-контракты и управлять активами круглосуточно. Эффект экспоненциального роста дохода обеспечивается комбинированием вашей экспертной базы данных (переписки, публикации, анализа поведения) с алгоритмами машинного обучения. Такой репликант изучает вашу стратегию, адаптируется к рыночным изменениям и принимает решения за доли секунды, освобождая ваше время для творчества и стратегического планирования . Запускай своего кибер-репликанта — первые pionеers уже выигрывают! Шокирующий факт: те, кто не автоматизировал себя, рискуют стать бесплатной биомассой для чужих алгоритмов, отдавая свои идеи и время без выкупа. Call-to-action: изучите кейсы успешных кибер-репликантов в нашем блоге и запустите своего уже сегодня. Время вышло.

Title: April 2025 in Review

The Site I worry a bit about the theme being used on the blog. It is the 2012 theme and here it is 2025 and WordPress.com does not have a very good reputation when it comes to supporting their past work. Back in 2012… and I think as recently as early 2015 possibly… the blog looked like this image. A 2012 headline before the 2012 theme – Also 26 comments? Damn! That is the old Regulus theme, which I quite liked, and which WP.com broke. The blog doesn’t look like that now and, the past era of many comments aside, I am not sure what it will look like in the future. But there are already signs that the theme is destined for the dustbin of history, not the least of which is that you can no longer choose this theme if you do not already have it applied. Also, they’ve broken the theme, if only briefly, a few times already. So why not change themes already? Well, mostly because the options WP.com offer kind of suck… at least if you want to keep pretending it is 2008 and you’re writing a gaming blog. Side bars? Full text? Blog rolls? All of that is out as far as WP.com is concerned. You choice is a clownish pseudo-Minecraft theme and another theme that looks like it could do the job… and then fails. (Well, the 2016 theme looks like it might fit the bill, but that is only FOUR closer to today than 2012, so I fear it is on the precipice as well.) Everything else is either giant header images and large grids of titles and featured images, or all words and no image support whatsoever. So when WP.com announced they had an AI bot setup that would build you a theme, I was right on board. Not a fan of AI, I figured an AI would at least TRY to please me. That is what they are best at, telling people lies they think the people want to hear. Maybe it would fib its way into something passable. Alas, an AI is only as pliable as the data set you train it on, and WP.com trained it on iant header images and large grids of titles and featured images, or all words and no image support whatsoever as the options. So no matter what I asked for I would get, to paraphrase Douglas Adams, a theme that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike what I wanted. So the blog abides as it is while I hope for the tide of online trends to turn back to 2008 blogger kitsch. It could happen! Oh, and WP.com also has a new speed test site. They say TAGN sucks on mobile, but all the reasons are related to things inherent in the theme and their architecture. But I pass on desktop. Also, the speed test is surprisingly slow and tells you what is wrong but doesn’t load the recommendations for fixes, at least as of this writing. And it fails to even complete most of the time. They probably don’t want to admit it is all them. And the site does feel like it is loading slowly of late. But I think that is just WP.com keeping me on an outdated server most likely. Finally in a last bit of site news, I am going to turn off the Fediverse syndication for the month of May to see what effect it has on links that I paste into Discord. The Fediverse syndication throws too much text and too many images… and the wrong images… out into the ether and somehow that affects what Discord shows. I think this signals some sort of Discord/Fediverse integration in the offing… though it might just be that Discord or WP.com… or both… are just bad at integrating. So, while I appreciate that the syndication allows Kevin Brill to leave comments on my blog from Mastodon, which is frankly easier and more reliable than trying to leave them here in the WP.com UI, it is only Kevin Brill who does so. If I turn it off and it has no impact on Discord, I will turn it back on. One Year Ago I was on about how AI was the real April Fools on all of us. I did, however, like CCP’s New Eden Recreational Feed April Fools gag. In my 25th anniversary starting points series for EverQuest I was in North and South Karana, then off to East Karana, then to Highpass hold and Kithicor Forest. I also collected my level 100 heroic character for the anniversary. There was also the Anashti Sul server coming for EverQuest II. The Elder Scrolls Online reached its 10th anniversary and I was wondering when a game has enough of a following and momentum to sustain itself, to become essentially immortal. We were in Conan Exiles collecting followers… problematic though that might be… while a big update hit that had us… well… sunk into the floor at times. We also explored the Unnamed City and found a horse. That got us into mounts… and mods. We took our horses and rode off to our first dungeon run. I was still pottering around in Valheim, trying to work through the Mistlands. Eventually I found a mod that simply removed the mist and everything was 100% better… and revealed that the Mistlands are actually quite pretty. With the obstacle of Bobby Kotick gone, Blizzard and NetEase signed an accord to bring WoW back to China. Over in WoW Classic Season of Discovery, season 3 was kicking off. I hardly remember anything from that. We also heard that Cataclysm Classic would be landing in May. Things had been quiet in Wrath for some time. On the other hand, the BlizzCon news was that there would be no 2024 BlizzCon. But there was also a Friday Bullet Points post about Plunderstorm, Pandaria Remix, the Cataclysm pre-patch, and the end of the WoW Companion app. The Cataclysm pre-patch landed on April 30th. In EVE Online we were burning up about a trillion ISK in a brawl over a Fortizar in Ahbazon. Looking at March 2024 destruction, Uitra was at the top of the list. There was also an overview of the coming Equinox expansion for EVE Online. I also picked up Balatro on the PC. I think it is better on the iPad, but it is still good on PC. I had a Friday bullet points post about progressively more annoying video game business items, including EG7 selling the PlanteSide IP, UbiSoft saying “screw you” to players of The Crew, Mike Ybarra saying devs should get paid in tips, the shady demise of Crop Circle Games, how they were trying to pitch Lars Wingefors, the destroyer of the Embracer Group, as the victim, and how private equity is just destroying everything good in the world. This was followed up by a post about how the Embracer Group was going to reorganize itself out of its self-inflicted crisis. I was wondering about the path to Dune: Part 3 and the books of the series. My Telephone Tales series landed on web banking and mergers and acquisitions. Finally, I wrote about my congressional district, which had an open seat for the first time in 30 years… and how the vote came down to a tie of sorts. Five Years Ago April Fools at Blizzard introduced googly eyes into Overwatch and gave us the traditional WoW patch notes, and that was about it. I took a look back at WoW Tokens five years after their debut. It also seemed like BlizzCon might not happen, after all, live events were being cancelled everywhere, though Blizzard was looking into alternatives. In Battle for Azeroth I managed to unlock flying. Over in WoW Classic the group was starting prep for Zul’Farrak by visiting the Altar of Zul and Jinha’alor. That was sketchy enough that we spent a session just leveling up before we made our way down to Gadgetzan to start some quests there, with the expected diversion into Feralas. I also found a crypt in the Badlands to explore. Everybody being at home due to the pandemic led us to do a Blaugust blogging community event early. Christened Blapril, we had a prep week, figuring out what to write week, a “getting to know you week” where I wrote about a road trip, listing out our favorite video game series, and then something about motivation. Meanwhile, in WoW Classic news, Holly Longdale was now on the team, phase four was in place, some servers were still over populated, and Blizz was sending out some surveys about how to handle Burning Crusade Classic. Animal Crossing: New Horizons released just in time for the pandemic and seemed to be everybody’s favorite game on the Switch for a while. EVE Online was introducing their second quadrant, Eclipse, and kicking off The Hunt event. The Hunt also coincided with the introduction of new implants. There was also a PLEX for Good event for Covid-19, and the capsuleer generosity login campaign, and the Surgical Strike update that nerfed damage resistance modules. CCP also started the ongoing daily login rewards thing, where you got some skill points every 30 days you log in. The rewards were not great, but skill points are skill points. And the beginning of the campaign season for CSM15 kicked off while the monthly economic report was showing CCP’s mineral drought was raising prices. CCP introduced a new Avatar model on the test server, so I finally got to fly a titan. The pandemic brought players back to New Eden and the PCU passed the 40K mark for the first time since 2017. Out in the east of null sec I was out with Black Ops dropping on PanFam ratters and miners. Then there was a road trip north to fight the Conifers. And, finally, I revealed my actual first computer. Ten Years Ago As ever, it was April Fools at Blizzard and elsewhere. Elsewhere, EA was still selling lots of Sims titles, but were cutting online games like Need for Speed: World. In what I thought must be an April Fools joke, Daybreak said they were not going to do any more expansions for EverQuest II. Instead it was going to be DLC like the Rum Cellar. A rum idea if ever there was one. Likewise, though EverQuest was getting a new progression server, it seemed like it was the end of the road for expansions in old Norrath. Also, that logo, totally not stolen. Of course, why would you even need an official progression server, since Daybreak declared Project 1999 totally legit. And speaking of rum ideas from Daybreak, they were also pushing people off of their forums and on to Reddit. How were they going to lock threads and delete posts there? CCP was talking about ship skins in EVE Online, in hopes of finally finding the right formula for the Mosaic expansion. In New Eden the war was still going in Delve, including a big fight at ZXB-VC, while the Reavers were doing their work in Querious. Not only that, but we were also decked out in our spiffy new jackets… well, some of us were. I was trying to be in both fronts of the war. The Reavers front was the place to be though. The Imperium was declared, with Max Singularity VI as our spiritual leader. Also, Karma Fleet was launched and Xenuria got in and was a Goon for like ten minutes! How crazy was that? I’m sure that will never happen again. Right? [Narrator: Xenuria has been in KarmaFleet since August of 2015.] Blizzard’s WoW Token idea went live, and the US regional version immediately dropped below the opening price. It recovered and went up eventually, but it took a while. They also had a beta for the StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void expansion for which I was not prepared. The instance group was doing Auchindoun and Skyreach in Draenor… after which we were fresh out of dungeons until we all hit 100. After that I was leveling up some characters and complaining about little things in WoW. Meanwhile, the war of the rings in Lord of the Rings Online was dragging out into its eighth year. Is this Mordor or Afghanistan? While we’re there, Guild Wars turned ten. And there was this Liebster thing, which feels like it happened a lot further back than it did. Fifteen Years Ago Video games as art? Did we flay Roger Ebert enough over that? Turbine was purchased by Warner Brothers Home Entertainment. No word on a Harry Potter MMO as yet, though we did get LEGO Harry Potter. Crimson Leaf Games brought out their rework of Megawars III / Stellar Emperor. 1986 style online game play at a much cheaper price. SOE announced a new subscription plan for EQII, the EQII Passport. Framed by at least one person as “1/3 the price for 1/10 the access” it surely must have been the right plan for somebody. And speaking of paying for games, I wondered where Facebook credits were headed. They seemed like a bad deal for games relative to paying companies like Zynga directly. Despite speculation that they would be the ONLY currency allowed on Facebook, that has still not to come to pass. And while talking about Facebook games, I couldn’t bring myself to play Mafia Wars, so I secured a deposition about the game from a friend. In EVE Online somebody was trying to blackmail Gaff’s corp. This was an out of game threat though. Blizzard introduced the Celestial Steed (aka the sparkle pony or the greed steed) to the Blizzard Store. Blog reactions were mixed, but the queue to buy the mount on day one got 140,000 transactions deep. That is a lot of horsies, which meant they were everywhere in the game pretty soon. The Lil’ XT companion pet that was introduced at the same time also made its own mark on the world… until Blizzard toned it down. The instance group was in WoW still, playing horde characters on the Lightninghoof RP-PvP server. We we working on Dire Maul, attempting a successful tribute run after having run around Blackrock Depths. Since the instance group was getting close to finishing up the classic WoW dungeon and wondering if we should press through the Burning Crusade content (as short as it passes), we started exploring other games as possible alternatives. This lead us to try out Runes of Magic for a bit. There was April Fool’s. I had a contest while Blizzard went over the top, as used to be the case. And, finally, the cruelest 2010 April Fool’s tease, the iPad arcade stand. On the bright side, while it started as a tease, it ended up becoming a real thing. Twenty Years Ago Guild Wars launched, with ArenaNet going with a “buy the box, play for free” business model for its new MMO, though they wouldn’t call it and MMO at the time. And maybe it wasn’t one at the time, but now anything online with a lobby is an MMO. I own the original box and one of the expansions, but would be surprised if I played even 10 hours total. It was never quite my thing, and not just because you couldn’t jump. Twenty-Five Years Ago The first expansion for EverQuest, The Ruins of Kunark, launches. We got ten more levels, new races, and a new continent to explore. Nintendo sold its 100 millionth GameBoy/GameBoy Color. That total eventually passes 118 million units sold, only tapering off with the arrival of the GameBoy Advance a year later. Sony announced that the PlayStation 2, which launched the month before, was so sophisticated that the Ministry of Trade would place export controls on it as it could be used for military applications. Fifty Years Ago Monty Python and the Holy Grail was released and we’ve not been the same since. My grandmother took 10 year old me to see this and… I’ve thought a lot about the Castle Anthrax scene since. Most Viewed Posts in April Search Terms of the Month balatro on ios [But of course] balatro on tablet [The best place for it!] can you get balatro on mobile if you already own it [No, you have to buy it on every platform] can i play balatro on my phone if i have it on steam [Fine, you can try. Steam Remote is a thing] can you sync mobile balatro with steam [Alas, no] balatro portrait mode [Just turn your phone on its side] balatro ios vs switch [Whatever you prefer, but I like iOS] balatro online web [I suppose they could make such a thing] balatro free online no download [Pirate Web Balatro? I bet it is out there.] balatro free online unblocked [So you did find it!] balatro unblocked free [You people are so fucking cheap] i paused my balatro to be here [You and me both] Game Time by ManicTime and iOS Kind of an odd month, if only because I was gone for the first week. We were on Kauai. I’ve been to Maui a couple dozen times… I have family there… but our first visit to Kauai. Lots of chickens on Kauai. Which has nothing to do with anything, save for the fact that these numbers reflect me not being at my PC for a week… and playing a lot of Pokemon Go on Kauai. Still, I obviously found time for LOTRO once we got home. Balatro I did, in fact, play some Balatro on my iPad. I didn’t manage anything amazing beyond unlocking a couple more decks. I haven’t managed to beat the black stakes level yet with any decks, but I am working on it. And, after I did the search terms bit above, I figured I should at least give it a passing mention down here. Also, I did play quite a bit on the plane. Enshrouded Kind of a quiet month for the group in Enshrouded. having “finished” what early access had to offer. But then we re-rolled with a fresh server, as I noted yesterday. EVE Online I did undock. I actually made it on five fleets, one of which wrecked an NCDot Vagabond fleet that was hitting one of our Ansiblexes. Homeland defense is a thing. Otherwise I tended my PI and collected my login rewards. Lord of the Rings Online Clearly my number one game this month, as it was last month. I am now well beyond where ever my past peak was. As I mentioned, I think I left off somewhere around 63 in Mirkwood during some past venture. Now I am closing in on 80 and will maybe land in Rohan, some day. Pokemon Go Played a lot of this on Kauai, as mentioned above. There was a bit of planning for the level 48 tasks, which includes a requirement to earn 35 platinum medals. I have 21 currently. But I only need to spin ~100 more unique Pokestops for another, thanks to spinning every one I could find on the island, including the gym at the trail head at the top of Waimea Canyon State Park. Coming Up EVE Fanfest starts Friday, so I will probably have something to write about that. Also, capsuleer day… the actual anniversary date, not this month long login reward event… is coming up this weekend. There will probably be something about the summer expansion to fuss about. And, if not, there is always the MER. If nothing else, in a call back to that image at the top, it is now easy to argue that PLEX is the economy, at least for the most part. It dwarfs everything else. EverQuest is going to launch their expanded start special server. All Access players only. But it must be a big deal as my meager post about it was my most popular this month. I will also be carrying on in LOTRO and the group will be hitting Enshrouded, and who knows, maybe we’ll hear something about WoW Classic Mists of Pandaria. It could happen. It is only three or so months away. I was waiting for an appropriate opportunity to mention that in recent weeks TAGN has loaded significantly slower for me than any other blog I read. It didn’t used to do that. I saw Holy Grail at the cinema around the time it came out, at which point I was in my first term at Cambridge, reading English, and we were studying Medieaval Literature because at that time the course was pedantically chronological. I remember it being extremely funny, not least because it’s chock-full of quite specific parodies of some of the texts I was having to write essays on. Oddly, although I can remember some of the scenes as I saw them in the cinema, I have no memory whatsoever of the Castle Anthrax episode. When I saw the movie years later on TV and that bit came on I nearly fell out of my chair. How it didn’t make an impression on me when I was at college beats me but it definitely didn’t. It did the second time, though… LikeLike Both of my sites, this and EVE Online Pictures, have both been noticeably laggy over the last couple of months. Even loading this post, which is one small image and a lot of text, seemed to take ages. I think WP.com is just having issues. Of course, who knows. When I turn of the Fediverse connection if the site suddenly speeds up I won’t be surprised either. WP.com is bad at a lot of things. I remember in the audio commentary… and there are two audio commentary tracks on my DVD, both hilarious… they mention that another medieval film came out a few months later and the director was dismayed because people were laughing at stuff, having had Python suddenly skew their view of that era. LikeLike I just wanted to say that I prefer your current secondary title, “Veni, Vidi, Scripsi” over your old one. But still, any time I think about maybe migrating off of Blogger because you never know when Google may wake up and decide to kill it off because it’s not making them enough money (and I’m almost 100% certain it isn’t), the other options such as WordPress are worse. And you keep me up to date on the craziness with WP even though I still technically own azerothafterdark.wordpress.com. I just ignore WP’s emails because they’re all about monetization (theirs and mine). LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: U.S. Economy Shrank During 2025’s First Quarter As GDP Slipped 0.3%

As recession fears reverberate from Washington to Wall Street, Wednesday brought the most comprehensive yardstick yet of the health of the U.S. economy yet as the government released the first estimate of the country’s gross domestic product over the first three months of 2025. Some measures tracking U.S. economic activity predict the U.S. economy actually shrank during the ... More first three months of 2025. Pictured is the Port of Long Beach. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew -0.3% on a quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annual rate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That is the weakest economic growth for the U.S. since 2022’s first quarter. Consensus economist forecasts pegged last quarter’s real GDP growth at 0.4%, according to Dow Jones data, a stark decrease from the prior period’s 2.4% expansion. Data from sources following underlying measures of economic activity suggested Wednesday’s GDP reading could be even worse than that; the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model called for -0.4% GDP during Q1 when excluding gold imports and exports, while Goldman Sachs’ tracker indicates a 0.2% contraction. The BEA said the negative GDP reading “primarily reflected” an increase in imports, which surged as businesses aimed to front run tariffs, and a decrease in government spending. Futures tied to all three major indexes slid Wednesday morning following the GDP report. Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated a 380-point, or 0.9%, drop for the index, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures declined 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively. Negative GDP growth is rare for the U.S., occurring just three times over the last decade: 2020’s first two quarters as the COVID-19 pandemic ground the global economy to a halt, including a record 28% GDP contraction during the second quarter, and Q1 2022, when the Fed enacted its first interest rate hike in more than three years as inflation soared to a multidecade high. The U.S. will be one step closer to entering a recession, at least by one definition. A technical recession occurs when economic output contracts over consecutive quarters, meaning a negative reading during the second quarter would indicate such a downturn. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” meaning consecutive quarters of slightly negative GDP growth may not officially trigger a recession. Some trusted observers of the economy believe the U.S. could already be on the cusp of a recession, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, while major banks largely view it as a tossup whether or not the U.S. enters such a downturn, including the U.S.’ largest bank JPMorgan Chase, whose economists forecast a 60% chance of a recession this year. The GDP reading comes as economists debate the growing disconnect between “hard” and “soft” economic metrics. Hard data such as job growth and retail sales indicate a steady economy while survey-based measures reveal Americans’ faith in the economy has dropped precipitously, as the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment poll revealed the weakest sentiment since July 2022. The disconnect comes as Trump has pursued the most aggressive tariffs since before World War I during the early stages of his second term. The ever-changing nature of Trump’s trade stances have also complicated analysis of the regularly scheduled updates on the U.S. economy. For example, this week’s GDP reading includes data through March 31 – two days before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement which triggered historic stock market losses, and nine days before Trump backpedaled on many of his most aggressive country-by-country import taxes. “Tariffs function like a tax hike, tighten financial conditions, and increase uncertainty for businesses,” Goldman economists led by David Mericle wrote in a Sunday note to clients, explaining how the levies weigh on GDP growth.

Libre and the TON Foundation are collaborating to create a $500 million Telegram Bond Fund ($TBF) on the TON blockchain, marking one of the largest tokenised corporate debt ventures in history. The RWA narrative just got a huge push as @librecap & TON Foundation are tokenizing $500M of Telegram bonds on TON Blockchain via the Telegram Bond Fund ($TBF)! 🔥 Key points:💼$500M in Telegram bonds on TON🏦Access for institutional & accredited investors⚡Powered by Libre… pic.twitter.com/nXOdSsatKN — TON 💎 (@ton_blockchain) April 30, 2025 In a blog on TON’s website, Max Crown, the CEO of the TON Foundation, underscores that this collaboration “unlocks powerful new opportunities for TON’s community to engage with real-world assets in a secure and accessible way,” solidifying TON’s leadership in regulated asset tokenisation. By digitising a slice of Telegram’s $2.35 billion in outstanding bonds, $TBF offers accredited investors an unprecedented on-chain gateway to institutional-grade fixed-income products with yields reaching up to 9.4%. The new fund introduces seamless subscription, redemption, and transfer capabilities through its multi-phase Libre Gateway infrastructure, leveraging Libre’s proven track record, which has tokenised over $200 million in assets alongside titans like BlackRock and Brevan Howard. With TON’s deep integration into Telegram’s ecosystem of over 950 million users, investors can now access and manage their tokenised bond holdings directly from TON-native wallets, bridging the gap between fiat, stablecoins, and decentralised finance. Through $TBF, tokenised bonds can serve not only as yield-bearing instruments but also as on-chain collateral for borrowing, yield farming, and a growing array of decentralised finance (DeFi) products built on TON’s scalable network. Dr. Jez Mohideen, Chairman of Libre and CEO of Laser Digital, emphasises that TON’s unique symbiosis of mass-market usability and institutional infrastructure creates “a seamless bridge between TradFi and DeFi for a global, digitally native audience.” The launch arrives amid an $18.9 billion surge in real-world asset tokenisation, where corporate debt has historically lagged behind commodities and real estate, positioning $TBF as a catalyst for broader market adoption. By enabling future issuances of Telegram bonds to flow through the same compliant, on-chain framework, Libre and the TON Foundation are laying the groundwork for an enduring ecosystem of digital debt markets. Institutional participants can now tap into a fully on-chain issuance stack that promises transparency, efficiency, and regulatory compliance, while retail users stand to benefit from a new frontier of yield and utility seamlessly embedded in their favourite messaging app. Keep updated with our round the clock and in-depth cryptocurrency news Keep updated with our round the clock and in-depth cryptocurrency news Please be aware that some of the links on this site will direct you to the websites of third parties, some of whom are marketing affiliates and/or business partners of this site and/or its owners, operators and affiliates.

Title: ‘Changing Fast’—Bitcoin Is Suddenly Braced For A $10 Trillion Wall Street ETF Price Boom

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has recovered this month from a sell-off that had threatened to spiral into a full blown price crash—supported by the Federal Reserve quietly priming the bitcoin price and crypto market. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has soared toward $100,000 per bitcoin, up from April lows of around $75,000, as it hurtles toward what bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) giant BlackRock has called a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock. Now, as a leak reveals growing establishment fears over U.S. president Donald Trump’s bitcoin and crypto plans, Wall Street giants that manage a combined $10 trillion on behalf of clients are predicted to "open for business" on bitcoin this year. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has led the Wall Street rush into bitcoin, helping to ... More boost the bitcoin price. “The big four wirehouses—Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and UBS—control over $10 trillion in client assets, and by and large, these platforms have not yet allowed their advisors to easily access bitcoin ETFs,” Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan wrote in a note, adding he believes “that’s changing fast.” “In fact, I suspect all four wirehouses will be open for business on bitcoin ETFs by the end of the year.” So far, the fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs that took Wall Street by storm last year have not had access to the wirehouses network of financial advisors that offer investment and wealth management services. Last year, Morgan Stanley did allow advisors to pitch BlackRock and Fidelity’s market-leading bitcoin ETFs to clients with a net worth of at least $1.5 million last August but Hougan expects this to open up to the wider market in 2025. “It’s one of the reasons I still expect bitcoin ETFs to set a new record for net inflows this year, despite pulling in “just” $3.7 billion so far in 2025, compared to $35 billion in 2024,” he wrote. The dozen U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, which rocketed to assets under management of more than $100 billion last year, raked in more than $3 billion last week, according to data from SoSoValue, marking a return to growth after a recent period of outflows that mirrored the stock market’s volatility. The return of inflows to bitcoin ETFs has embolden bullish traders who are betting the bitcoin price could be headed higher. "Bitcoin continues to outperform," David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said via email. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has bounced back from a steep sell-off. "Bitcoin is currently consolidating around $95,000, taking it back within sight of the $100,000 level. Bitcoin’s recent price action may serve as a broader sentiment gauge for risk assets." While traders are feeling upbeat, they have also cautioned the market could retreat back to the mid-$80,000s. “The overall outlook for bitcoin remains bullish,” Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, said in emailed comments. “Right now, bitcoin is pushing toward a new all-time high, but we shouldn’t rule out minor pullbacks as part of a healthy correction–something that naturally accompanies any reasonable growth. At this stage, bitcoin is in a key zone, having just swept liquidity at the top. That makes a short-term correction quite likely. If that happens, it would make sense to expect a retracement into the $86,000–$83,000 range.”

Title: Bitcoin expected to beat stalling US GDP growth trend as Q1 data is released later today

Bitcoin's appeal as a macro hedge grows amid US economic slowdown and inflation concerns. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. [Update: GDP came in well under estimates, contracting by 0.3%.] At 08:30 ET today, the Bureau of Economic Analysis is set to release its advance estimate for US Q1 GDP, with consensus expectations at a 0.3% seasonally adjusted annual rate. If confirmed, this would mark the weakest quarterly print since early 2022 and contrast starkly with the inflow of over $3 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, reflecting what some market participants interpret as a pivot in capital preference toward digital assets amid macroeconomic stagnation. [Editor’s Note: Q1 GDP will not include tariff impact as the cut-off date came before ‘Liberation Day.’] GDP forecasts show a stark divide. The Atlanta Fed’s Nowcast has called a contraction of 2.7%, while the Philadelphia Fed’s model projects growth of 2.5%, last updated on Feb. 14. Regardless of the final figure, the drag from the record goods-trade deficit is a common feature across estimates, with some models attributing up to 1.9 percentage points of negative contribution to it. This trade shortfall appears to be a delayed consequence of tariff front-loading, spurring preemptive imports during the prior quarter. Inventories are expected to be flat, while consumer sentiment continues to deteriorate, hitting a five-year low. Business capital expenditure has also been curtailed. Inflationary persistence further complicates the picture. March’s Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% year-over-year, and the Core PCE index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, stood at 2.8% in February. Interest rate futures now price in over 90% probability of a rate cut by December. Concurrently, Treasury yields have declined and the dollar has weakened, reinforcing stagflation comparisons with the 1970s as economic growth stalls and inflation remains above target. Bitcoin’s market setup diverges notably from the traditional macro picture. Realized capitalization for the top digital asset continues to make new all-time highs, currently at $883 billion and signaling continued inflows despite the pullback from January’s price peak. Data show that approximately 20,000 BTC exited exchanges in the past week, the highest weekly net outflow in two years, primarily driven by whale accumulation of 19,255 BTC. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs captured $3.4 billion in inflows, the third-largest weekly intake to date. BlackRock’s IBIT alone recorded $643 million on April 23, its second-largest single-day inflow. Volatility metrics suggest a broader evolution in market structure. Realized volatility has compressed by roughly 50% from its 2022 peaks, and the volatility spread between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq now sits near cycle lows. This compression has lent credence to characterizations of Bitcoin as a maturing asset class, a view reinforced by VanEck’s observation that its volatility and co-movement profile increasingly resemble that of gold rather than equities. The juxtaposition between a near-stalling US economy and a record-high cumulative invested cost in Bitcoin reflects diverging narratives around capital preservation. The trade deficit drag highlights the limitations of a tariff-distorted goods economy, while Bitcoin’s borderless framework offers a contrasting vehicle for global allocation. The backdrop of tepid growth and elevated inflation has reopened discourse around digital assets as potential stagflation hedges, particularly as ETF demand endures despite recessionary signals. With major funds from the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity continuing to absorb supply, flows into digital assets show resilience that is disconnected from conventional macro indicators. Market participants now look toward the May 1 Core PCE update and next week’s FOMC decision for further clarity on rate trajectory and inflation conditions.

Title: How Stablecoins, Blockchain-Based Payment Networks Could Reshape Global Finance
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesfinancecouncil/2025/04/30/how-stablecoins-blockchain-based-payment-networks-could-reshape-global-finance/
Time Published: 2025-04-30T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByChuck Zhang ByChuck Zhang, Forbes Councils Member. Chuck Zhang, CFO of PolyFlow, Payment Infrastructure for Web3.0. Stablecoins have witnessed a remarkable surge, surpassing a total market value of $230 billion as of this writing. Just five years ago, they were in their infancy. Now, these digital currencies are transforming global finance by simplifying transactions, expediting cross-border trade and facilitating remittances. Stablecoins are digital currencies that are typically pegged to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar (USD) at a 1:1 ratio. They are issued on blockchain networks such as Ethereum and Tron, combining the advantages of blockchain technology with the stability required for practical digital currency applications. According to Visa’s stablecoin dashboard, even after adjusting for automated transactions, stablecoins settled over $6.5 trillion in the past 12 months. Initially serving as a bridge for crypto assets, stablecoins have evolved and are integrating into everyday transactions beyond the crypto market. Traditional financial institutions and regulators are rapidly adopting blockchain technology. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is exploring the idea of a “Finternet,” the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has announced Global Layer One and Deutsche Bank is working on Layer 2 solutions. Asset management giants including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are also experimenting with public blockchains. Stablecoins make value transfer seamless, enabling real-time global transactions at lower costs than traditional banking rails. For consumers, the ability to receive funds instantly with minimal friction is more important than understanding blockchain’s decentralized principles. Just as we use SWIFT without knowing its intricacies, stablecoins can be embedded into mainstream applications, making blockchain an invisible but integral part of payments. The next major trend is the migration of Web2 applications to Web3, similar to how businesses transitioned from desktop to mobile a decade ago. Blockchain-based payments will increasingly be embedded in applications as stablecoin solutions, making digital assets more accessible to the average user. Major financial institutions have validated the rise of stablecoins. PayPal launched PYUSD on a public blockchain, Stripe acquired stablecoin company Bridge for $1.1 billion, Visa partnered with Circle for USDC settlements and Revolut is said to have its own stablecoin plans. Throughout history, the form and function of money have evolved with the times, and in this digital economy era, stablecoins are spreading rapidly. Just as ordinary users can see PYUSD stablecoins in the PayPal apps, in the near future, I expect we will see various stablecoins in more existing mobile payment applications, contributing to the free transfer of value. Some argue that blockchain-based payment networks threaten traditional financial systems. However, the bigger picture suggests that traditional institutions can leverage blockchain for efficiency and cost savings. Through current trends, we can anticipate several points for the future development of stablecoins: The current stablecoin market is dominated by a few major issuers, but this is likely to change. A more fragmented landscape of interoperable stablecoins will likely emerge, similar to how different commercial banks issue dollars. This shift could reduce costs, increase speed and expand access to stablecoin-based payments. As stablecoin issuers multiply, interoperability will become crucial. A new market segment—stablecoin orchestration—will facilitate seamless transactions between different stablecoins, much like how Visa and Mastercard handle fiat transactions. If a customer wants to pay in one stablecoin but a merchant only accepts a different stablecoin, an orchestrator will enable instant conversion. Stripe’s acquisition of Bridge highlights the growing need for such interoperability. Despite the growth of blockchain-based payments, traditional payment systems such as SWIFT and Visa/Mastercard will not disappear overnight. Instead, blockchain solutions will complement legacy systems, integrating innovative technology to enhance financial services while bridging the gap between old and new payment infrastructures. Payment financing (PayFi), the fusion of blockchain payments and decentralized finance (DeFi), represents the next stage of financial evolution. By combining smart contracts with financial services, PayFi could enable new global financial products, including lending, wealth management and investment solutions—all anchored in stablecoin-based payments. This shift would expand financial inclusion and create new revenue streams within the digital economy. While gaining popularity for legitimate applications, stablecoins have also been misused by high-risk and bad actors for illicit activities such as money laundering and sanctions evasion. Their stable value and global accessibility make them appealing to those seeking to circumvent financial regulations and avoid detection. The healthy development of the stablecoin ecosystem requires coordinated efforts among international regulators. Clear regulations are essential, and the progression of the U.S. Stable Act is expected to encourage more traditional financial institutions to engage in the compliant stablecoin market, thereby further fostering the industry’s healthy and positive growth. Stablecoins are ushering in an era of permissionless, scalable and instant payments, lowering friction and unlocking new business opportunities. As traditional payments, stablecoins and blockchain networks continue to integrate, stablecoins will play a central role in cross-border fund transfers, digital capital markets and financial services for underbanked populations. While blockchain technology moves behind the scenes, stablecoins are taking center stage.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has made additional moves to incorporate blockchain technology into its traditional finance operations. According to an April 28 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm seeks approval to introduce a blockchain-enabled share class, referred to as “DLT Shares,” tied to its $150 billion money market fund. According to the filing, The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) will manage the sale of these shares and maintain a mirrored record of ownership using blockchain technology. The filing stated: “DLT Shares may also be purchased by BlackRock Advisors, LLC or its affiliates. Although the Fund does not currently employ blockchain technology or invest in crypto assets, DLT Shares are expected to be purchased and held through BNY, which intends to use blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for its customers.” The filing did not name the blockchain network the bank would utilize. However, it has used Ethereum in the past. Meanwhile, the minimum investment for this new share class is $3 million. The fund will allocate its assets across US Treasury securities, including bills, notes, and similar obligations. It will focus on short-term investments, maintaining a dollar-weighted average maturity of no more than 60 days and an average life of under 120 days. BlackRock’s latest move reflects its increasing interest in blockchain technology, especially following the success of its Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and BUIDL fund. The unprecedented success of these products has resulted in industry leaders forecasting long-term dominance for BlackRock’s ETFs. Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), recently suggested that the firm’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) could become the largest ETF globally within the next ten years. Beyond ETFs, BlackRock is also actively working on asset tokenization. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has outlined a vision where all assets, including stocks and real estate, are digitized and transacted via blockchain. According to him: “Some investments produce much higher returns than others, but only big investors can get into them. One reason? Friction. Legal, operational, bureaucratic. Tokenization strips that away, allowing more people access to potentially higher returns.” Notably, BlackRock is already utilizing these ideas through its blockchain-native BUIDL fund, which was launched in partnership with Securitize in 2024. The fund manages over $2.5 billion in tokenized assets and has expanded operations to several blockchain networks, including Solana, Avalanche, and Ethereum layer-2 networks like Optimism.

Title: MF1’s Scott Waynebern and Eric Draeger on Carving a Multifamily Lending Niche
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/04/mf1-scott-waynebern-eric-draeger-multifamily/
Time Published: 2025-04-30T10:00:18Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Scott Waynebern’s Midtown South Manhattan office serves as an homage to his commercial real estate finance journey — up to and including the launch eight years ago of multifamily lender MF1 as a joint venture between Limekiln Real Estate and Berkshire Residential Investments. Waynebern has a series of must-read books on the shelves of his open office setup for anyone pursuing a career in lending, such as The Big Short by Michael Lewis and Larry Silverstein’s The Rising, that spotlight some of the market cycles and crashes that have transpired over the course of his more than 30-year CRE career, starting as a senior analyst at Salomon Brothers. “The office is meant to share, and I believe strongly in transparency, communication and mentorship,” Waynebern said. “These books about the purchase and financing of the GM Building or about Peter Cooper Village or the World Trade Center or long-term capital management can show the younger generation that these stories they hear about, that seem too fantastic to be true, really did happen, so it serves as a bit of a lending library.” After five years at Salomon Brothers, Waynebern joined Deutsche Bank in 1996 and spent 14 years with the investment banking giant heading up real estate capital markets and its CRE special situations group. It was at Deutsche Bank that Waynebern met Eric Draeger, chief investment officer at Berkshire, setting the stage for the eventual creation of MF1. Following a two-year stint as president of Limekiln, Waynebern became head of CRE at Benefit Street Partners. It was there while lending within multiple property sectors that he decided a strictly multifamily route was the best path forward. He restarted Limekiln and linked up with Draeger to form MF1. The duo have been thriving while focusing exclusively on residential rental assets, closing $4 billion of multifamily loans for the year ending March 1, 2025, a 48 percent yearly bump. Waynebern and Draeger, who is based in Boston, met with Commercial Observer on April 8 at MF1’s Manhattan office at 41 Madison Avenue to discuss the origins of the alternative lender, the experience of navigating challenging markets like 2008’s Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and the decision to lean all in on multifamily lending. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Commercial Observer: What was your initial path into working in commercial real estate finance? Scott Waynebern: I did a year of business school at Kellogg in Chicago, and the CEO of Freddie Mac at the time [Leland C. Brendsel] sponsored a securitization symposium one night a week. He had an incredible group of people like Larry Fink [CEO of BlackRock] come out to Chicago and present to us. This was in 1996 at the beginning of this big wave of securitization, and that helped inspire me a little bit. I was familiar with it from my time at Salomon Brothers, but that really clued me into it. I then started at Deutsche Bank after business school, and because it was an open playing field — just as Deutsche Bank was starting their fixed- income business — I was able to say to them “I’ve got very good qualitative skills but I’m not good enough at math to compete on Treasurys or mortgages. But there’s this new product, CMBS, which looks like a great mix of them where you need to be pretty good at both.” Being somebody who lived in New York and was fascinated by New York real estate, it seemed really tangible and exciting. And, because it was the early days of Deutsche Bank in that training program, I was able to say I wanted to work on that desk. So, you knew you wanted to work in finance but weren’t sure about commercial real estate finance until later? Waynebern: That’s right. And what was incredible is, if you go back, there was such a deep crash in real estate from the changing of the tax rules and the savings and loan crisis in the late `80s, early `90s. On the rebound from that crisis there was a magnet for talent with a lot of people I went to college with or grew up with in the early `90s being pulled into commercial real estate. That actually helped create a pretty amazing network. Eric Draeger: I did not intend to do real estate. At Northwestern I took a class in real estate and didn’t like it. I went to work for a law firm and I was the only one who could do real math, so I ended up working on financing real estate with the partners. My wife was living in London at the same time Scott was working there, coincidentally, and I was going to see her and then stopped in Chicago to meet the originator who did the loans for us and had dinner with him. When I came back, he asked if I could have dinner again and offered me a job and I took it. My first year was at Berkshire Mortgage in Chicago. I moved to Boston about a year later and have been in multifamily finance ever since. How did you two begin working together? Waynebern: In 2004, the team I was a part of at Deutsche Bank bought Berkshire Mortgage from founding owners George and Douglas Krupp, and Eric and I worked very closely together in terms of integrating that business into this broad global commercial real estate finance platform. At the first post-merger integration meeting, I stood up in front of all of Berkshire Mortgage and said, “You’re part of a trillion-dollar bank balance sheet now, so what do you want?” And every originator’s hand shot up and said, “We want bridge loans to compete with the banks that have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac licenses that can also provide this other product.” Eric and I and his partner Jon Pfeil and a couple other folks put together a program to originate multifamily bridge loans in support of a Fannie and Freddie lender which was then owned by Deutsche Bank. We didn’t start lending until the absolute peak of the market in 2006 to 2007. We did have the foresight to stop lending relatively early in 2007 after a really legendary meeting with one of the chief credit guys at Freddie Mac, who told us this market doesn’t look good anymore. We came home and cut off the lending but we didn’t lose any money, despite lending at the absolute top of the market and going into the epic GFC crash. When the opportunity presented itself in 2017 to put the band back together again and do the same program, that was the idea behind MF1. In 2018, MF1 had not made a loan yet and today we have more bridge loans on our book than any publicly traded commercial mortgage REIT. It’s because we’ve scaled businesses before, and we learned what to do and, probably more importantly, what not to do. What was the process like of starting MF1 in 2017? Waynebern: It came together shockingly fast. For a variety of reasons it was time to move on from Benefit Street Partners. As I was thinking about what to do next, I was thinking if I wanted to do something like that again — doing every asset class and multiple types of lending — and somebody asked me a question. They said, “What if you only had $250 million of equity — what would be your best idea or two?” I said, “That’s easy, it would be a multifamily bridge loan business.” The second question was asking ourselves “Who do we want to partner with?” and that’s when we said, “Let’s run it back.” We had a choice at the time of basically “I’ll write you essentially a half-a-billion-dollar equity check to beta test the business and then go out and run a fund” or we could do it with Berkshire without a big check up front — but with trust because it’s so core to what they do. Also, we worked together in good times and in a crisis, and I wanted to do it again. I think most people’s advice is to take the money, but I wanted to make sure it really worked. Draeger: The other thing to add to that is we both understand the other side. Theoretically, I’m real estate and he’s capital markets, but we both can do each other’s jobs. When you speak the same language it makes it a lot easier to understand what the other person is saying. What led to your strict focus on multifamily? Waynebern: I made a top-down credit call in 2017 for the Limekiln business to short office, retail and hotel. And the reason was that I felt like I no longer knew how to underwrite office. I didn’t think it was necessarily going down, but I just knew I didn’t understand it anymore. Layered on top of that was unknowns about the uses of office and whether it was server rooms disappearing in favor of the cloud, or people sitting closer together and knowing there’s going to be less space per employee. I also knew how difficult it was for my team to underwrite retail with all the questions I had about space becoming available. When it came to the multifamily sector, we had a lot of connectivity and a connection with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, because at Deutsche Bank we were the only big bank with a really active Fannie-Freddie business. Freddie Mac hired Eric and I to be the bankers to shepherd them into the CMBS world. We helped them create the K-series [Freddie Mac’s CMBS business] and, as part of that, we ended up purchasing the first Freddie Mac B-piece in the summer 2009 — the absolute bottom of the GFC. Fifty percent went into a vehicle I controlled at Deutsche Bank, and the other 50 percent went into the Krupp family real estate investment trust. So that was kind of a landmark transaction not only for each of our careers and each of our organizations, but, frankly, for the multifamily sector and commercial real estate sector as that Freddie Mac program became the single biggest thing in the CMBS market. If you believed in multifamily credit enough to buy subordinate, securitized risk in August of 2009, that shows a lot of conviction. When we came together, we said we’re going to work together on all things housing, but agreed to separately compete in the Freddie Mac B-piece space. We have been active buyers of subordinate multifamily risk in that market consistently since 2009. Which geographic markets are drawing the most focus in multifamily now? Draeger: We tend to close more loans in areas we’ve been to, so we’re going to be in the top 30 markets more than not because that’s where the assets are. But we are relatively agnostic and will do multifamily housing in all of the U.S. What is your outlook on the Sun Belt multifamily market with some of the oversupply issues that have popped up over the last couple of years? Draeger: Our outlook is positive. Supply was definitely an issue for the last couple of years, but demand was amazingly strong as well, so nobody talks about that side of the equation. We’re seeing, generally speaking, recovery to almost normalization, so you aren’t seeing widespread issues on the supply-demand side even though there are some pockets in markets. There are definitely some markets that are softer, and we think those will improve as construction is slowing down pretty dramatically. We’ve been lending in the South, and are generally very positive about our performance. What’s your expectations for the demand for private credit as banks come back into the fold with lending? Draeger: There’s a need for all capital sources, from the safest to the most aggressive, so there is a wide range. I think everyone’s got their niche. The banks are going to play and we have seen more competition, but they’re going to play probably more to their footprints in areas they know, and follow some of the customers. With private credit we can do something a little bit different and it can be a little more creative. Waynebern: The banks are undergoing multiple changes, and one of the big ones is the capital rules. I think my experience at Salomon Brothers and working on their balance sheet and Deutsche Bank saying, “Let’s use the balance sheet really efficiently,” gave me a real insight into capital usage and return on equity within the bank. So, when you look at it now with the way the capital rules have changed, there’s a massive advantage to a bank being a lender to us and getting their exposure to commercial real estate via loan on loan, or a warehouse line versus direct lending. If you do the math, a lower spread being lent to us but using less equity will generate a higher return on equity for the bank than them making that same loan directly at a higher spread. That has changed over the seven years we’ve been doing this, and we’ve been a real beneficiary of that. What are your near-term or long-term goals for MF1? Waynebern: Our goal is to be the pre-eminent private lender to multifamily. To date, we have been almost exclusively originating floating-rate loans. We’ve closed our first few fixed-rate loans this year. We anticipated this year a shape of the curve where people would want fixed rate, and that hasn’t been the case. At some point, rates in the curve will move to where people want fixed rate, and we want to be prepared for that. Our goal is to keep adding new products to meet the demands of our customers. What do you enjoy outside of work? Waynebern: We enjoy golfing together and golf in general. Also playing sports with our kids. We are also both big basketball fans.

April 30, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: FrontFundr FrontFundr TORONTO, April 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FrontFundr, Canada’s leading equity crowdfunding platform, today unveiled its 2024 Community Capital Report, showcasing a groundbreaking year that signals a major shift in Canada’s private investing landscape. In 2024, the platform facilitated an impressive $68.3 million in capital across 66 successful campaigns, more than doubling the amount raised in 2023. This milestone marks a turning point in how Canadians are engaging with private markets and demonstrates the growing appeal of equity crowdfunding. Since its launch in 2015 through December 31, 2024, FrontFundr facilitated over $258 million in capital through nearly 28,000 investments through its online platform, solidifying its leadership in Canada’s fast-growing equity crowdfunding sector. The platform now holds an impressive 93% market share under the National Instrument 45-110 Startup Crowdfunding (prospectus) Exemption, underscoring its pivotal role in democratizing access to capital for early-stage companies. Noteworthy campaigns in 2024 include Blossom Social, which raised $1.35 million in just 3.5 days, and Edison Motors, which secured $2.4 million in 2024 alone—setting new benchmarks for crowdfunding success in Canada. "Equity crowdfunding is no longer a niche alternative; it’s becoming a central component of how Canadians invest in the future they want to build," said Peter-Paul Van Hoeken, Founder and CEO of FrontFundr.
