Amid the second wave of crypto-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Solana (SOL)-based investment products have been leading the charge, fueled by strong demand despite the recent market volatility. As a new group of investment products based on the altcoin hits the market and SOL’s price starts to recover, some suggest that a rebound could be underway. The second wave of Solana ETFs has arrived in the market after the successful launch of SOL-based investment products. On Monday, VanEck debuted its Solana ETF (VSOL) on Nasdaq, becoming the third investment product based on the altcoin to launch over the past month. According to the announcement, the firm is waiving its 0.30% fee on the first $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) or until February 17, 2026. Meanwhile, its third-party staking provider will also waive its fee for staking services under the same conditions. Adding to the momentum, Fidelity and Canary Capital launched their FSOL and SOLC ETFs on Tuesday, after recently filing 8-A forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that Fidelity is “easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out,” adding that it is “Game on” with the other launches. Meanwhile, Nate Geraci also highlighted the new launch, but expressed surprise that BlackRock is “sitting this one out” as many anticipate a successful performance. Notably, Bitwise and Grayscale debuted their BSOL and GSOL ETFs at the end of October, registering a record-breaking performance since their launch. Farside Invest data shows that SOL-based investment products have recorded over $390 million in inflows, with 15 consecutive trading days of positive net flows, signaling strong institutional demand for the products. In a Tuesday X post, Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley, noted BSOL’s positive performance despite the market correction, affirming that “prices are in the eye of the beholder.” “ETF investors continue to buy the dip. Grateful for the trust in Bitwise to steward investor assets,” he added. Amid the Tuesday launches, SOL’s price bounced 8.4% from its five-month low of $128, recorded on Monday. The cryptocurrency has declined 12% over the past month, losing crucial levels during the market correction. However, Bybit recently suggested that the newly launched investment products could reshape “its price trajectory and market structure for years to come.” In a recent report, the crypto exchange’s analysts noted that the altcoin joined Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as one of the few digital assets with regulated brokerage access in the US. This “represents a structural shift in how SOL is accessed, traded and perceived,” significantly expanding SOL’s investor base and confidence. “If historical patterns hold, Solana could be on the cusp of a multi-quarter rally that redefines its position in the crypto hierarchy,” the exchange affirmed. Analyst Ted Pillows pointed out SOL’s price action, calling it “one of the worst-performing large caps recently.” However, he argued that, because of this, most of its downside liquidity has already been taken out, with “decent liquidity clusters around the $170-$200 level.” To analysts, if the market starts to recover and stabilizes, Solana could rally 20%-40% to retest this area. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades affirmed that SOL is “putting in quite the reversal relative to its BTC pair,” as the cryptocurrency has broken out of a three-week downtrend against Bitcoin after some failed attempts. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $141, a 25.3% decline in the monthly timeframe. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Title: Bitcoin Builds Strength for $120K, but Zero Knowledge Proof Becomes the New 100x Presale Everyone’s Rushing Into

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. The cryptocurrency market is entering a defining moment. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to assert its dominance, supported by institutional accumulation and global ETF adoption. At the same time, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is drawing extraordinary attention as its whitelist is now live, introducing a privacy-first vision that could redefine blockchain infrastructure. Together, these two assets, one proven, one emerging, are shaping the narrative of 2025: stability and innovation. Bitcoin represents crypto’s established store of value; ZKP represents the new frontier of private computation and verifiable AI. BTC and ZKP sit on opposite ends of the maturity spectrum but share a common thread, sustained demand driven by utility and institutional interest. Bitcoin’s price performance in late 2025 reflects strong resilience. With macroeconomic uncertainty, fiat inflation, and record ETF inflows, BTC has reclaimed a leading position in risk markets. Analysts cite that Bitcoin is forming a base around $65,000–$70,000, with resistance near $74,000–$80,000, setting the stage for the next potential leg higher. Institutional interest remains the cornerstone of Bitcoin’s growth. Major entities, from BlackRock to Fidelity, have increased exposure through spot ETFs, driving demand that continually absorbs available supply. The 2024 halving has also compressed issuance, reducing daily mining output and pushing BTC closer to a structural supply crunch. Historically, each halving cycle has seen exponential returns within 12–18 months, and analysts at multiple research houses suggest that the Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 could realistically target $100,000–$120,000 if demand continues to rise and ETF participation deepens. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s 200-day moving average remains upward-sloping, a hallmark of bullish continuation. In the near term, BTC may face consolidation between $65,000–$75,000, but the macro structure favors expansion. A decisive breakout above $80,000 could trigger a new cycle phase, with momentum pushing toward six-figure territory. On the downside, the $58,000–$60,000 zone acts as major support, underpinned by whale accumulation and long-term holder conviction. Even in corrective phases, the structural supply scarcity and institutional demand floor keep downside risk relatively constrained. While Bitcoin dominates headlines for institutional adoption, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is defining the next-generation narrative, privacy, AI, and decentralized computation. The ZKP whitelist is live now, and early engagement has been explosive, surpassing 200,000 registrations within the first 24 hours. ZKP’s framework revolves around zero-knowledge cryptography, enabling transactions and computations to be verified without exposing sensitive information. This architecture promises to bridge blockchain, artificial intelligence, and real-world data in a privacy-compliant manner, a theme increasingly sought after by enterprises and regulators alike. What makes ZKP exceptional is its foundation. The project was built with over $100 million in pre-launch, long before a single token was sold. It introduces an Initial Coin Auction (ICA) model, a fair and transparent alternative to conventional presales. Participants contribute daily and receive proportional allocations, ensuring inclusivity and eliminating insider advantages. This combination of real infrastructure, cryptographic rigor, and fair-access mechanics is why analysts are already calling Zero Knowledge Proof the next 100x crypto. The upcoming months could see ZKP become one of the best cryptos for 2025, as privacy and AI narratives converge into mainstream adoption. Analysts believe ZKP’s mix of real infrastructure, transparent tokenomics, and cryptographic innovation could make it the next viral blockchain trend, just as DeFi and layer-2s were in previous cycles. With its whitelist already oversubscribed, ZKP stands out as the most anticipated project in the emerging proof-based AI economy, where privacy and computation integrity become the ultimate currency of trust. Bitcoin and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) symbolize two complementary sides of the crypto revolution. Bitcoin is digital gold, a scarce, decentralized monetary asset recognized globally. ZKP, on the other hand, is a digital infrastructure, a system designed to preserve privacy while powering decentralized computation and AI verification. The combination of the two represents diversification between maturity and innovation. Bitcoin offers long-term store-of-value strength; ZKP provides high-growth exposure to next-gen blockchain technologies. While Bitcoin’s upside may appear steady and predictable, ZKP’s potential lies in early positioning. As its whitelist remains open, early contributors are effectively gaining front-row access to a project that could define how blockchains interact with AI, compliance, and confidential data in the years ahead. Together, they reflect where crypto is heading: one asset securing wealth, the other securing data. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 remains structurally bullish. With ETF inflows, halving-driven scarcity, and growing corporate adoption, BTC’s path toward $100,000–$120,000 appears plausible over the next year. Macro conditions, especially declining interest rates or renewed fiat devaluation, could serve as major accelerators. Simultaneously, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is positioning itself, fueled by its open whitelist, $100M infrastructure foundation, and a vision of verifiable, privacy-preserving computation. As ZKP prepares to go viral, it encapsulates the forward edge of blockchain evolution, one where privacy, proof, and AI converge into the next trillion-dollar narrative. Pairing Bitcoin’s resilience with ZKP’s innovation could represent the ultimate dual strategy: exposure to both proven value and the next major leap in blockchain utility.

Title: Prime Blackrock site zoned for residential development guiding €6m

Agent Vincent Finnegan is offering a high-profile residential site in the south Dublin suburb of Blackrock for sale by tender at a guide price of €6 million. Located on Newtownpark Avenue and just 50m from the N11 quality bus corridor, the subject property, which extends to 0.65 hectares (1.6 acres), comprises two houses – Selandia and the Paddock – and an afterschool centre known as the Willow House Afterschool. The subject site is zoned Objective A under the terms of the Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council Development Plan 2022-2028. This objective supports residential development and residential amenities. A comprehensive planning appraisal of the site has been prepared by Hughes Planning and Development Consultants, and this provides specific advice on the prospect of securing planning permission for residential development, with an emphasis on apartment development. The report notes that a density of “up to 250 dwellings per hectare (162 units) could be considered where it [a planning proposal] meets the outlined development standards and safeguards the residential amenity of neighbouring properties”. It adds that “precedents in the area suggest a density closer to 165 dwellings per hectare (107 units) may be more in keeping with the established context”. The report further notes that the development plan “expresses a preference for retrofit and reuse [of existing properties] in the first instance”. It adds, however, that “there is a planning gain associated with increasing residential density on this site, and this would form a key part of the justification for demolition” notwithstanding the council’s focus on climate action. Any proposal for demolition would need to be robustly justified from an engineering, energy and planning perspective, the report concludes. The subject site is for sale by tender with the final date for receipt of tenders set for Friday, January 30th, 2026.

Title: Ethereum Price Will Bottom This Week, Predicts Tom Lee

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee says Ethereum is nearing a cyclical low, arguing that on-chain fundamentals and relative valuation versus Bitcoin indicate that ETH is “pretty close to bottoming this week.” “Personally, I think that we’re pretty close to bottoming this week,” Lee told CNBC, linking the current drawdown to a broader crypto correction that began after a sharp liquidation event on October 10. Despite that shock, he insisted that Ethereum’s core investment story remains intact. For Lee, that story centers on Ethereum as neutral infrastructure for tokenization and stablecoins, increasingly relevant as Wall Street intensifies its on-chain ambitions. “There are stablecoin creations. Larry Fink and BlackRock and Wall Street want to tokenize assets, bring stocks, bonds, real estate onto the blockchain. And they have to find a neutral 100% uptime blockchain. That’s Ethereum. And that’s the fundamental story,” he said. Lee framed crypto’s extreme volatility as structurally tied to how the market values long-term innovation rather than as a sign of fundamental weakness. “The price, of course, for Ethereum will fluctuate because crypto is hyper volatile. In fact, it’s kind of a… it’s sort of a feature of the blockchain itself,” he noted. “Crypto suffered from that liquidation event on October 10th, but because the fundamental story is intact and crypto discounts the future, that’s why it’s volatile, but it still looks pretty attractive here.” He placed the current move in the context of a broader risk-off environment and a continuing correction across digital assets. According to Lee, macro data remains a crucial driver of crypto cycles, particularly for Bitcoin. “The most correlated factor to Bitcoin prices when you see it… at a peak actually is the ISM,” he said, referring to US activity surveys. “So I think we’re still in a correction phase of crypto.” Asked specifically what underpins his bullish view on Ethereum now, Lee pointed to two structural “floor” mechanisms. First, he cited the value of assets locked on the Ethereum blockchain. “Ethereum kind of has several ways that it establishes a floor. One is the value of all the assets locked onto the blockchain, and that number is growing,” he said. “Historically, Ethereum bottoms when that ratio is about 50%. So I’d say we’re pretty close to that level. That’s why I think Ethereum is probably bottoming this week.” Second, he highlighted Ethereum’s valuation relative to Bitcoin, using both price and network value. “The other way to look at Ethereum is really its price ratio or even its network value ratio to Bitcoin. It currently sits at 0.032,” Lee said. “The long-term average, like the eight-year average, if we were just to trade to that eight-year average, would put Ethereum at around $12,000.” On that basis, Lee characterized Ethereum as undervalued versus its historical relationship with Bitcoin. “So I think Ethereum is undervalued because number one, the story is gaining relative to Bitcoin this year. But two, we’re getting this sort of intrinsic floor because of the value that the assets locked onto the Ethereum blockchain,” he argued. Summarizing Lee’s stance, the CNBC host concluded: “Tom Lee saying that Ethereum is bottoming this week.” Lee did not offer a specific price target or an exact day, but his message was clear: in his view, Ethereum is close to completing its correction as on-chain value and relative valuation metrics converge toward levels that have historically marked major bottoms. At press time, ETH traded at $3,018. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Title: Wondering Why The XRP Price Is Still Lagging Despite Record ETF Launch? Read This

The debut of Canary Capital’s spot-XRP ETF was one of the standout moments for the XRP community this year, bringing the token into the US ETF arena with strong opening volume and heavy attention from traders. Many holders went into launch week expecting that kind of headline event to push XRP into a sharp rally, especially after waiting years for regulated access in the United States. Instead, price action has stayed relatively muted, leaving a gap between expectations and reality. In a new 26-minute video shared on X, finance coach Coach JV tried to close that gap, breaking down why XRP has not exploded higher yet and what he believes holders should actually focus on. XRP’s Spot ETF has undoubtedly been a success, considering the amount of inflows it has had in its first two trading days. However, this has yet to translate into a surge in the price of XRP, as many traders had predicted and expected. Instead, XRP’s price action has been highlighted by a downtrend in recent days. A large part of this price downtrend is due to the wider decline in the crypto market. In his breakdown, Coach JV approached the XRP situation from a macroeconomic perspective. Rather than treating the ETF launch as an isolated trigger, he contextualized XRP’s current price behavior within the larger environment that financial markets are dealing with. A major theme of his outlook was the way people respond to hype. Coach JV stated plainly that the only way is to have discipline and a consistent plan. He did not build his message around chasing short-term excitement or reacting emotionally to price moves. His focus was on having a structure that an individual can stick to, regardless of whether XRP moves fast after the ETF launch or takes longer than many were expecting. Coach JV also addressed one of the most common questions circulating in the community: whether $5 is the next big target for XRP now that an ETF is live. “Is $5 next? I don’t know; I’m not banking on that, I’m not waiting for it, I believe it’s going to happen at some point, and I have my exit strategy set up,” he said. That tone is now being echoed by others in the community who are pushing back against unrealistic targets. Zach Rector recently reminded his audience that XRP is not heading toward triple-digit prices this year, despite widespread speculation. Another commentator, known as Xoom on X, made a similar remark, saying XRP will not reach $100 or even $10 on ETF momentum alone. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.18, down by 3.5% in the past 24 hours. It is still too early to conclude how much long-term influence Spot XRP ETFs will have on price, especially with major issuers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale yet to launch their own offerings.

Title: Why Adam Backs thinks Bitcoin’s 20-year quantum runway matters more than today’s headlines

Bitcoin faces "probably not" any vulnerability to a cryptographically relevant quantum computer for roughly 20 to 40 years. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For years, quantum computing has served as cryptocurrency’s favorite doomsday scenario, a distant but existential threat that periodically resurfaces whenever a lab announces a qubit milestone. The narrative follows a predictable arc where researchers achieve some incremental breakthrough, social media erupts with “Bitcoin is dead” predictions, and the news cycle moves on. But Adam Back’s November 15 remarks on X cut through that noise with something the discourse desperately lacks: a timeline grounded in physics rather than panic. Back, the Blockstream CEO, whose Hashcash proof-of-work system predates Bitcoin itself, responded to a question about accelerating quantum research with a blunt assessment. Bitcoin faces “probably not” any vulnerability to a cryptographically relevant quantum computer for roughly 20 to 40 years. More importantly, he stressed that Bitcoin doesn’t have to wait passively for that day. NIST has already standardized quantum-secure signature schemes, such as SLH-DSA, and Bitcoin can adopt these tools through soft-fork upgrades long before any quantum machine poses a genuine threat. His comment reframes quantum risk from an unsolvable catastrophe into a solvable engineering problem with a multi-decade runway. That distinction matters because Bitcoin’s actual vulnerability isn’t where most people think, as the threat doesn’t come from SHA-256, the hash function that secures the mining process. It comes from ECDSA and Schnorr signatures on the secp256k1 elliptic curve, the cryptography that proves ownership. A quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could solve the discrete logarithm problem on secp256k1, deriving a private key from a public key and invalidating the entire ownership model. In pure mathematics, Shor’s algorithm renders elliptic curve cryptography obsolete. But mathematics and engineering exist in different universes. Breaking a 256-bit elliptic curve requires somewhere between 1,600 and 2,500 logical, error-corrected qubits. Each logical qubit demands thousands of physical qubits to maintain coherence and correct errors. One analysis, based on the work of Martin Roetteler and three other researchers, calculates that breaking a 256-bit EC key within the narrow time window relevant to a Bitcoin transaction would require approximately 317 million physical qubits under realistic error rates. It is essential to consider where quantum hardware actually stands. Caltech’s neutral-atom system operates around 6,100 physical qubits, but these are noisy and lack error correction. More mature gate-based systems from Quantinuum and IBM operate in the tens to low hundreds of logical-quality qubits. The gap between current capability and cryptographic relevance spans several orders of magnitude, not a small incremental step, but a chasm that requires fundamental breakthroughs in qubit quality, error correction, and scalability. NIST’s own post-quantum cryptography explainer states this plainly: no cryptographically relevant quantum computer exists today, and expert estimates for its arrival vary so widely that some specialists think “less than 10 years” remains a possibility. In contrast, others place it firmly past 2040. The median view clusters around the mid-to-late 2030s, making Back’s 20-to-40-year window conservative rather than reckless. Back’s “Bitcoin can add over time” comment points toward concrete proposals already circulating among developers. BIP-360, titled “Pay to Quantum Resistant Hash,” defines new output types where spending conditions include both classical signatures and post-quantum signatures. A single UTXO becomes spendable under either scheme, allowing for a gradual migration rather than a hard cutoff. Jameson Lopp and other developers have built on BIP-360 with a multi-year migration plan. First, add PQ-capable address types via soft fork. Then gradually encourage or subsidize moving coins from vulnerable outputs into PQ-protected ones, reserving some block space each block specifically for these “rescue” moves. Academic work dating back to 2017 has already recommended similar transitions. A 2025 preprint from Robert Campbell proposes hybrid post-quantum signatures, where transactions carry both ECDSA and PQ signatures during an extended transition period. The user-side picture reveals why this matters. Roughly 25% of all Bitcoin, between four and six million BTC, sits in address types where public keys are already exposed on-chain. Early pay-to-public-key outputs from Bitcoin’s first years, reused P2PKH addresses, and some Taproot outputs all fall into this category. These coins become immediate targets once Shor on secp256k1 becomes practical. Modern best practice already provides substantial protection. Users who employ fresh P2PKH, SegWit, or Taproot addresses without reusing them benefit from a critical timing advantage. For these outputs, the public key remains hidden behind a hash until the first spend, compressing the attacker’s window to run Shor within the mempool confirmation period, measured in minutes rather than years. The migration job isn’t starting from scratch, it’s building upon existing good practices and transitioning legacy coins into safer structures. Back’s mention of SLH-DSA wasn’t casual name-dropping. In August 2024, NIST finalized the first wave of post-quantum standards: FIPS 203 ML-KEM for key encapsulation, FIPS 204 ML-DSA for lattice-based digital signatures, and FIPS 205 SLH-DSA for stateless hash-based digital signatures. NIST also standardized XMSS and LMS as stateful hash-based schemes, with the lattice-based Falcon scheme in the pipeline. Bitcoin developers now have a menu of NIST-approved algorithms, along with reference implementations and libraries. Bitcoin-focused implementations already support BIP-360, indicating that the post-quantum toolbox exists and continues to mature. The protocol doesn’t need to invent brand-new mathematics, it can adopt established standards that have undergone years of cryptanalysis. That doesn’t mean implementation comes without challenges. A 2025 paper examining SLH-DSA found susceptibility to Rowhammer-style fault attacks, emphasizing that while security rests on ordinary hash functions, implementations still require hardening. Post-quantum signatures also consume more resources than their classical counterparts, raising questions about transaction sizes and the economics of fees. But these represent engineering problems with known parameters, not unsolved mathematical mysteries. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) amended its prospectus in May 2025 to include extensive disclosures about quantum computing risk, warning that a sufficiently advanced quantum computer could compromise Bitcoin’s cryptography. Analysts immediately recognized this as standard risk-factor disclosure, boilerplate language alongside generic technology and regulatory risks, rather than a signal that BlackRock expects imminent quantum attacks. The near-term threat is investor sentiment, rather than the technology of quantum computing itself. A 2025 SSRN study found that news related to quantum computing triggers some rotation into explicitly quantum-resistant coins. Still, conventional cryptocurrencies exhibit only modest negative returns and volume spikes around such news, rather than structural repricing. When examining what actually drove Bitcoin’s movement throughout 2024 and 2025, going through ETF flows, macroeconomic data, regulation, and liquidity cycles, quantum computing rarely appears as a proximate cause. CPI prints, ETF outflow days, and regulatory shocks drive price action, while quantum computing generates headlines. Even articles sounding the loudest alarms about “25% of Bitcoin at risk” frame the threat as years away while emphasizing the need to start upgrading now. The framing consistently lands on “governance and engineering problem” rather than “sell immediately.” Bitcoin’s quantum story isn’t really about whether a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arrives in 2035 or 2045. It’s about whether the protocol’s governance can coordinate upgrades before that date becomes relevant. Every serious analysis converges on the same conclusion that the time to prepare is now, precisely because migration takes a decade, not because the threat is imminent. The question that will determine Bitcoin’s quantum resilience is whether developers can build consensus around BIP-360 or similar proposals, whether the community can incentivize migration of legacy coins without fracturing, and whether communication can stay grounded enough to prevent panic from outrunning physics. In 2025, quantum computing poses a governance challenge that necessitates a 10- to 20-year roadmap, rather than a catalyst that will dictate this cycle’s price action. Physics advances slowly, and a roadmap is visible. Bitcoin’s role is to adopt PQ-ready tools well before the hardware arrives, and to do so without the governance gridlock that can turn a solvable problem into a self-inflicted crisis.

Title: Bitcoin recovery expected as liquidity conditions change, but US macro remains a threat

Bitcoin’s recent weakness reflects broader economic stress, but improving liquidity and investors’ positive outlook for 2026 could set the stage for a strong rebound. Key takeaways: Federal Reserve balance-sheet limits and possible repo operations point to improving liquidity conditions that could boost Bitcoin and other risk assets. Fiscal strain and sector weakness currently weigh on markets, but easing tariffs and a targeted stimulus plan may support a recovery in crypto demand. Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market could remain under pressure ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Dec. 10. Expectations for the direction of monetary policy remain highly split, with concerns over inflation clashing against signs of slowing economic activity. Traders are divided between a 0.25% cut and keeping rates steady at 4%, based on implied odds on government bond markets. The more cautious Fed members argue that US President Donald Trump’s tariffs have added inflation pressure, reducing the room to ease rates and support growth. At the same time, the US job market shows clear signs of cooling, according to reports from BlackRock. Concerns with sticky inflation have been regularly cited by Fed officials. “I worry that restrictive monetary policy is weighing on the economy, especially about how it is affecting lower-and middle-income consumers,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Monday. Waller dismissed rumors that the missing official data, resulting from the government shutdown, has hurt the Fed’s visibility. Still, blaming Bitcoin’s weakness only on the Fed seems inaccurate, given that the downtrend started in early October. US import tariffs helped narrow the monthly government deficit, and the Fed’s balance sheet continued to shrink, causing the US dollar to strengthen against a basket of major currencies. Historically, Bitcoin holds an inverse correlation to the dollar index (DXY). Pinpointing the exact trigger behind Bitcoin’s weakness since the Oct. 6 all-time high is nearly impossible. Financial conditions worsened as freight activity slowed, housing markets softened and companies faced tighter cash flows, according to a Savvy Wealth report. As a result, Bitcoin’s decline may stem more from broad risk aversion than from dollar strength alone. The Fed has signaled that it will no longer allow its assets under management to fall below the current $6.5 trillion, starting in December. This move could be offset by the launch of repurchase agreement (repo) operations. In practice, the Fed’s balance sheet stays unchanged while cash is injected into financial markets, easing liquidity concerns by adding reserves to banks. Meanwhile, Trump has directed US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to prepare a stimulus campaign aimed at lower-income households for early 2026, and import tariffs may be gradually reduced to lower inflation risks. Still, fiscal conditions worsen in 2026 as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act takes effect. By the start of the year, there should be far less uncertainty in the economic outlook, for better or worse. Currently, weaknesses are evident in the real estate and auto sectors, both of which are placing significant pressure on regional banks. Bitcoin and other riskier assets have already reacted defensively, but they stand to benefit the most once liquidity returns. Related: Bitcoin charts flag $75K bottom, but analysts predict 40% rally before 2025 ends Bitcoin is not hostage to US monetary policy, especially with a weakening job market. The Fed has limited room to act while fiscal conditions stay tight, leaving expansionist measures as its fallback. Over time, liquidity is expected to return to markets, helping to mitigate a sharper economic impact and creating a more favorable environment for a strong rally in scarce assets.

A VIGIL IN Co Monaghan has called on the local community to be a “pillar of strength” after five young adults died in a collision in Co Louth over the weekend. Three separate vigils were arranged this evening, with one in Ardee, Co Louth; Drumconrath, Co Meath; and Aughnamullen, Co Monaghan; to pay tribute to the deceased. The victims in the crash were: Chloe McGee, 23, and Shay Duffy, 21, both from Carrickmacross in Co Monaghan; Alan McCluskey, 23, from Drumconrath in Co Meath; Dylan Commins, 23, from Ardee in Co Louth; and Chloe Hipson, 21, from Bellshill, Lanarkshire, Scotland. They were travelling together in a Volkswagen Golf while on their way to Dundalk for a night out when they died in the crash on Saturday. A sixth person who was in the car, also aged in his 20s, was taken to hospital for non-life threatening injuries and has since been released from hospital. Two other people were also injured in what gardaí described as a “shocking and devastating” crash. The incident, which involved the Golf and a Toyota Land Cruiser, happened on a road near Dundalk just after 9pm. Post-mortem examinations of the deceased have now been completed and their remains have been released to their families. The two occupants of the Toyota Landcruiser, a man and a woman in their 20s, remain in hospital where they continue to receive medical treatment for non-life threatening injuries. At the vigil in Aughnamullen, Co Monaghan, Chloe McGee’s cousin delivered a beautiful rendition of ‘Amazing Grace’. Hundreds gathered on a cold evening to remember the Aughnamullen ladies footballer. Flowers left at vigil for Chloe McGee Diarmuid Pepper / The Journal Diarmuid Pepper / The Journal / The Journal The vigil heard that Chloe was a “stellar” defender in the Aughnamullen ladies football team and at the heart of the team. The vigil was told of one incident where Chloe managed to get a score despite being a defender and jokingly told the management that they could call her Colm ‘Gooch’ Cooper from now on. “That sums her up and her outlook on life – she got stuck in to get the hard work done but could have the craic and a laugh at the same time,” said Annie Hanaway of Aughnamullen GAA. “She was a beautiful girl, inside and out, and anytime you met her you were greeted with the friendliest smile and the biggest ‘hello’.” PJ Markey, Chair of Augnamullen GAA, remarked that the crowd had gathered with “heavy hearts and united in sorrow to honour a life that has been tragically cut short”. He said the incident has sent “ripples of pain throughout every corner of our community”. “It is in moments like this that the true meaning of community, of being part of something bigger than ourselves, is laid bare. “Our GAA club has always been more than just a place to play games – it’s a family, a place of shared triumphs and now of shared grief.” He extended his sympathies to Chloe’s friends who died in the collision and said Aughnamullen GAA club “will stand with them not just today, but tomorrow and in all the days to come.” “We are a community and we always stick together. Let us now be that pillar of strength for each other, let us lean on one another, offer a hand, a listening ear, a comforting word. Advertisement “Our community spirit is the very foundation of Aughnamullen GAA club and it will help us through this tragedy. We will find strength in our unity.” Meanwhile, local priest Owen Gordan asked those gathered to pray for those who survived the collision, as well as the deceased. He prayed for them to find healing “both in body and in soul” and asked that their “memories of what happened neither cause them pain nor torment”. “Enable them to rebuild their lives with their loved ones,” he added. Fr Gordon also prayed for all the emergency services involved and asked that “be comforted when work brings tragedy their way”. Elsewhere, at Drumconrath Gaelic Football Club, hundreds gathered with candles and mobile flashlights.

Those present prayed for those who died that had “so much to live for” as well as those still recovering in hospital. Rev Clarke said the community had gathered in “shock, grief and confused hearts”. He said the vigil meant “a lot to everyone here”, and showed solidarity to the affected families. “As a club, as a community, as a parish, we all are one together.” In prayer, he added: “We ask you to keep everyone safe and in your love as we approach Christmas, a special time for young children, and when we will have families who have people missing from the table this year, we ask you to give them Meanwhile, gardai continue to investigate all the circumstances behind the crash and issued a renewed witness appeal. -With additional reporting from Press Association Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Written by Danny Klein | November 18, 2025 - 1:29 pm Off the Grid Campout founder, visionary and DJ Mikey Made has been on a mission to foster community in the SoCal dance music scene for over a decade. In the past few years, he’s expanded OTG’s footprint from Austin to Mexico City and many points in between. He’s acquired his own remote festival getaway – a sacred outdoor space dotted with Joshua Trees, only 2.5 hours from LA, as well as a new rave-ready warehouse in Santa Ana. Made has also brought The Scarab and The Cloud art cars to the likes of Burning Man, Lightning in a Bottle, Desert Hearts, and more. Each production is ideated and built by Made’s True Crew, a group of live event creatives (many of whom are also DJ’s) that come together for each unique build, whether it’s on home turf or under the often crazy conditions in Blackrock City. OTG events are not about VIP lists or hierarchy. There’s a palpable sense of equality and open access, which isn’t always found at today’s festivals. “This is all for you.” – Mikey Made From early roots throwing remote renegade desert raves with a few dozen friends, to celebrating 10 years in the game with a flagship 4-day festival, the journey has not always been easy. Maintaining harmony in an ecosystem of countless collectives, artists and promoters is always a challenge, but at the end of the day, the unforgettable sets, new friendships, and endless good vibes till the sun comes up make it all worth-while. From international touring legends, to today’s hottest trailblazers, to platforming rising talent that might otherwise not get a shot at the big stage, Made takes great care in curating his lineups, covering a wide range of house, techno, and drum and bass subgenres.

Title: NY Gov. Kathy Hochul enlists Wall Street execs to talk Trump out of sending National Guard to NYC: report

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is reportedly teaming up with Wall Street executives in an effort to talk President Trump out of sending National Guard troops to New York City in the wake of socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s victory earlier this month. A top aide to Hochul, a Dem, has reached out to leaders of the Big Apple’s finance industry in hopes of convincing the Republican Trump administration to refrain from deploying federal troops to the city — arguing that doing so would harm the economy, according to The Wall Street Journal. Jackie Bray, Hochul’s director of homeland security and emergency services, is spearheading the effort and has reportedly met one-on-one with top executives in New York to get their buy-in. According to The Journal, Bray shared data with executives showing that National Guard troop deployments would harm local businesses, as well as tourism. Hochul’s team has yet to ask business leaders to convey the concerns directly to Trump since there is no immediate threat of a federal takeover, the publication reported. Along with sending the National Guard to the city, Trump has reportedly weighed funding cuts in response to Mamdani’s shocking victory. The mayor-elect has promised to stop all cooperation with federal authorities on combating illegal immigration — restoring New York’s status to what he called the “strongest sanctuary city” in the country. The Post has sought comment from the White House and Hochul. New York State officials are trying to follow the example of San Francisco, where Democratic Mayor Daniel Luri enlisted the helpf of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce boss Marc Benioff. The billionaire tech moguls reportedly managed to persuade Trump to stand down from his original plan to send National Guard troops into the city earlier this year. Trump recently hosted some of finance’s most powerful figures — including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, hedge fund mogul Bill Ackman and BlackRock chief Larry Fink — at the White House. The Post was the first to report that Trump picked their brains for ideas on how to make things more affordable for everyday Americans. Among the corporate leaders who took part in the meeting were Morgan Stanley’s Ted Pick, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Blackstone boss Steve Schwarzman. Since his return to the White House earlier this year, Trump has ordered deployments of National Guard units and federal law enforcement to several major US cities — mostly Dem-led. He’s said the moves are needed to address violent crime, homelessness, illegal immigration and protests. The deployments in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, Portland and Memphis have triggered legal challenges and sharp criticism from state and local officials who argue the moves overstep presidential authority.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. A train of SpaceX's Starlink satellites caught on camera above Auckland. Photo / Sky Photography Ltd Should we be thinking more broadly about sustainability, rather than just how it relates to climate emissions? Fran O’Sullivan introduces the Sustainable Business and Finance Report. Billionaire Elon Musk plans to use Starlink technology to create AI data centres in space. Writing on X (formerly Twitter) Musk said Starship could deliver 100GW/year to high Earth orbit within 4 to 5 years “if we can solve the other parts of the equation”. “100TW/year is possible from a lunar base producing solar-powered AI satellites locally and accelerating them to escape velocity with a mass driver.” It all sounds a bit “sci-fi”, right from the playbook of space visionary Gerard K. O’Neill, author of The High Frontier, perhaps? But Musk and SpaceX plan to connect data centres in orbit by scaling up next-generation Starlink V3 satellites connected through high-speed laser links to form a decentralised computing network. What’s driving this is the need to power the increasing computational demands of the disruptive artificial intelligence technologies fast transforming business and economies. AI data centres suck up a great deal of electrical power. This is one reason why nuclear power is back in vogue to reduce the need for more fossil-fuelled electricity grids. But nuclear comes with a very large price tag. The beauty of putting AI data centres in orbit is that they are powered by continuous sunlight and cooled by radiating their heat into deep space. Their protagonists predict space-based data centres would use less energy, zero fresh water, and far lower emissions than their terrestrial counterparts. Others have joined the race. Starcloud co-founders Philip Johnston, Ezra Feilden, and Adi Oltean built a working prototype in just 15 months, making history by launching a satellite with an NVIDIA H100 into orbit — the first time a GPU that powerful has ever operated in space. It all sounds so simple - and perhaps it is. CarbonBrief reports data centres are very geographically concentrated, both in terms of their global distribution and within leading countries. Today, nearly half of their electricity consumption takes place in the US, 25% in China and 15% in Europe, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). It’s still a first-world problem. Data centres are now responsible for just over 1% of global electricity demand and 0.5% of CO2 emissions, according to IEA data. The world is entering what the IEA describes as a “new age of electricity”, in which the electrification of transport, buildings and industry drives a surge in demand for power. It’s only in recent decades that solar-powered grids have become run of the mill along with electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles — so this is very possible. Problem is, this is all at a margin. Microsoft founder Bill Gates now says that while climate change will cause serious harm, it will not lead to ‘humanity’s demise’. We’re now in a world where the very idea of national sustainability is an issue. Indigenous people rioting at COP30 in Brazil are at the sharp end. As we report today, significant New Zealand businesses are wedded to doing their part to address the climate challenge. But the Government is now under fire for taking its foot off the pedal when it comes to prosecuting the need to make deeper inroads towards “net zero” carbon emissions. Climate Change Minister Simon Watts has the unenviable challenge of fronting the Government’s position against charges of back-pedalling by his Labour opponent Deborah Russell and incisive academic analysis on that score. The emissions trading scheme is not a busted flush but it is increasingly looking more logical to have a simple carbon tax. Sustainability is a relatively simple concept in the business world. Perhaps we should be thinking more broadly than how it relates to climate emissions. In a thought-provoking article, Alex Worker raises the question of the sustainability of farmers’ incomes in a Kiwi food-producing industry increasingly subject to foreign takeover. If our farmers become price-takers and miss out on substantial profits accruing to international owners where does that leave the economy longer-term? Fonterra remains a New Zealand-owned co-operative. But other firms are increasingly passing to 100% outside control or into mixed ownership. There are other vulnerabilities. The management of New Zealand’s freshwater resource is critical and that has yet to play out so all interests are taken into account. Energy security is another area where confidence has eroded. Escalating electricity prices have sparked the closure of a number of manufacturing plants in Nelson and the Central North Island. Natural gas supplies are running down. The Government has yet to comprehensively address this. Overshadowing these domestic concerns are the challenges to ESG (environment, social, governance) norms in a world where national security has been challenged by the invasion of Ukraine. European stock exchanges have kicked the traditional definition of ESG investing to the curb, rebranding it as “energy, security and geostrategy”. That’s the upshot of the determined political push under way to boost European defence companies and reduce Nato’s reliance on US armaments after the Trump administration savaged the region for not spending enough on its own security. What’s at stake is not small bikkies. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen believes the EU could mobilise up to €800 billion ($1.55 trillion) to strengthen its defence industry. There are also opportunities for Kiwi companies like Dawn Aerospace, with its dual base in the Netherlands and New Zealand. Some key climate influencers are now recalcitrants. Microsoft founder Bill Gates now says that while climate change will cause serious harm, it will not lead to “humanity’s demise”, and the global strategy should shift its focus to other areas like disease control. Formerly a leading proponent for carbon emissions reductions, Gates now argues climate change is not going to wipe out humanity and past efforts that strive for achieving zero carbon emissions have made little real progress. In the United States, BlackRock founder and CEO Larry Fink has also shifted emphasis. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager with US$12.5 trillion assets under management as of 2025. In his latest letter, Fink’s prior focuses on sustainability, climate change, and diversity, equity and inclusion were notably absent as he pushed for more energy production and the expansion of nuclear power. Fink’s new themes are all about energy pragmatism and stakeholder capitalism. Tell that to the COP30 protesters. Click here for more Sustainable Business & Finance stories.

Title: What Binance’s Latest Partnership With BlackRock’s BUIDL Means For Crypto

Time Published: 2025-11-18T15:30:11Z
Full Content:
Crypto exchange Binance has announced that BlackRock’s tokenized fund, BUIDL, will now be accepted as collateral on the platform. This comes as the tokenized fund expands to the BNB chain, a move welcomed by the exchange’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao. Binance has partnered with BlackRock’s BUIDL to expand its collateral offerings for institutional off-exchange settlement services, Binance Banking Triparty, and MirrorRSV. The exchange has now added support for BUIDL, which is a tokenized short-term U.S. Treasury fund. The exchange explained that its Banking Triparty is a custodial solution designed for institutions that separates asset custody from trading execution. With this, users can trade on the crypto platform by pledging fiat or fiat-equivalent collateral such as BlackRock’s BUIDL, which a regulated third-party banking partner will hold. Meanwhile, the crypto exchange also explained that MirrorRSV is an off-exchange custody solution provided by Ceffu, its institutional crypto custody partner. MirrorRSV allows users to trade on Binance while the assets remain in segregated cold wallets and can be verified on-chain. The exchange noted that this gives institutions enhanced transparency and auditability while retaining access to the exchange’s liquidity. This move is expected to boost institutional crypto adoption, as these options are meant to provide easy access to the crypto space. Binance also announced that BlackRock’s BUIDL will launch on the BNB Chain, further enhancing access and interoperability across on-chain applications. The tokenized fund is already supported on the Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Aptos networks. The fund is also available on Ethereum layer-2 networks such as Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao commented on BlackRock BUIDL’s partnership with Binance and its launch on BNB. He welcomed BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, to the crypto platform and the BNB Chain, noting that BlackRock manages $13 trillion in assets under management (AUM), making the deal a major one for crypto. Notably, Franklin Templeton, which has $1.53 trillion in AUM, also recently launched its tokenization platform, BENJI, on BNB. Binance stated that through the BlackRock BUIDL integration, its institutional users can now hold the tokenized fund off-exchange with Ceffu and Binance’s regulated, third-party banking partners. That way, they will be able to earn yield on their collateral while also trading on the crypto exchange. The crypto exchange added that this move will effectively address user needs, enable confident scaling of allocations, and ensure regulatory compliance. BlackRock’s BUIDL joins other supported yield-bearing assets on Binance, which include USYC and cUSDO, which were integrated earlier this year. Crypto pundit Coachty noted that the partnership is TradFi-crypto convergence in real time. He added that BUIDL is becoming the go-to institutional asset in the tokenization boom and that the flow of capital into on-chain RWAs is only getting started.

Title: Fidelity’s Spot Solana ETF FSOL Expected to Go Live on November 18

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Fidelity is scheduled to launch its Solana ETF today, November 18, after which the Canary Capital fund will follow. Fidelity is preparing to debut its spot Solana Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) following VanEck, which rolled out a similar fund on November 17. The Solana ETF competition is heating up gradually as two other asset management firms have also launched their SOL ETF a few weeks earlier. Overall, there is still a conversation on whether BlackRock will join this race for altcoin ETFs. Fidelity is expected to launch its spot Solana ETF on November 18, coming fourth after VanEck. According to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the asset manager has pegged the management fee for the fund at 0.25%. It is worth noting that reputable firm BlackRock has not filed any application for a Solana ETF or any other altcoin ETF, for that matter. On this basis, Balchunas said Fidelity has a great chance to be the biggest asset manager in this ETF category. His colleague, James Seyffart, noted that Canary Capital is also set to launch its Solana ETF, under the ticker SOLC. ALSO. @CanaryFunds will be launching their Solana ETF — $SOLC — tomorrow too. It’s in partnership with @MarinadeFinance who will be doing the staking. https://t.co/DKsDY3xymg — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 18, 2025 The fund, which is scheduled to roll out on November 19, is a collaborative effort with Marinade Finance. This latter firm will be charged with the staking aspect of the fund. With Fidelity in the “game” and the traction that this fund is beginning to get, it’s still not clear if BlackRock will make a move towards the SOL ETF. On October 28, Bitwise’s BSOL became the first US spot Solana ETP as it commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) market. Many market observers and analysts described the debut as a historic milestone for regulated crypto access. Grayscale’s SOL ETF followed the next day. So far, Bitwise’s BSOL has secured $450 million in trading volume. On November 17, VanEck rolled out a Solana Staking ETF for trading on Chicago’s CBOE with zero fees, even though it was the first issuer to apply to list this fund in June 2024. All fees will remain waived until February 2026, after which investors will be required to pay the 0.30% sponsor fees.

Title: Man (25) continues to be questioned over killing of woman near Cork home
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/11/18/man-25-continues-to-be-questioned-over-killing-of-woman-near-cork-home/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T13:11:36Z
Full Content:
Gardaí are continuing to question a 25-year-old man about the killing of a woman and a knife attack on her husband near their Co Cork home on Monday night. Stella Gallagher (59) was fatally injured and her husband, Brian (63), seriously injured when they were attacked by a man armed with a knife at their detached two-storey home in Shrewsbury Downs in Ballinlough at about 9pm. It is understood the couple fled their home, Ms Gallagher going in to a neighbour’s house to escape the attacker while Mr Gallagher tried to distract the man, who picked up a flowerpot and smashed a window in the neighbour’s house to try to gain entry. Ms Gallagher fled the neighbour’s house and Mr Gallagher again tried to divert the attacker away from his wife. However, he was attacked by the man and suffered a number of knife wounds to the upper body, including a very serious slash wound to his neck. It is understood the attacker then pursued Ms Gallagher to a green area about 45m (50 yards) from their home where he caught up with her and stabbed her a number of times, resulting in her suffering a number of catastrophic injuries. Neighbours had raised the alarm and members of the Garda Armed Support Unit (ASU) were first on the scene. Some of the ASU officers detained the man, who had discarded the knife, as other officers began performing CPR on the injured couple. HSE advanced paramedics quickly arrived and took over the care of the couple before they rushed them by ambulance to Cork University Hospital (CUH) where both underwent surgery. However, Ms Gallagher succumbed to her injuries and died some time before midnight. Mr Gallagher was described on Tuesday as being in a stable but serious condition. Gardaí hope to be given permission by CUH doctors to speak to him over the coming days as they try to piece together the sequence of events leading up to the attack. Both the Gallaghers were chemical engineers who had retired in recent years. Mr Gallagher had retired from PM Group, where he was a company director, and Ms Gallagher from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, where she worked under her maiden name, Stella Griffin. It is understood that Ms Gallagher had taken a five-year career break from Eli Lilly some years back for family reasons and then returned to work for around two years before her retirement from the company two years ago. The couple have one daughter and three sons in their 20s. The eldest, Ciara, is a doctor in Australia and she and the youngest, Mark, a student in Amsterdam, are on their way home while their middle sons, David and Conor, were both in Cork when the tragedy happened. Mr Gallagher is a native of Blackrock in Co Louth and Ms Gallagher is from Ballinspittle in west Cork. In the 1980s she attended what was then the Cork Institute of Technology (now the Munster Technological University) where she obtained a BSc in chemical engineering. Gardaí arrested a 25-year-old suspect, who was known to the Gallaghers, at the scene and he was conveyed to the Bridewell Garda station for questioning. He was detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act which allows gardaí to detain suspects for up to 24 hours. Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster carried out a postmortem on the body of Ms Gallagher at CUH and while the Garda has not released the results for operational reasons, it confirmed she had been the victim of a violent knife attack. Garda technical experts spent much of the day examining the Gallaghers’ home, the home of their neighbour and the green area where Ms Gallagher was attacked. They also recovered a kitchen knife which they believe was used in the fatal assault.

Title: Tom Lee Ascribes Ethereum’s Pain to Market-Makers, Not the Fed | US Crypto News
URL: https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-market-downturn-liquidation-event/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T12:41:09Z

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee and settle in, because the latest crypto pullback may not be what it seems, at least according to BitMine chair Tom Lee. Beneath the headlines and market jitters, a far more unexpected force may be driving Ethereum’s slump, one that has little to do with the Fed, and everything to do with crypto’s own plumbing. Ethereum may be suffering from one of its sharpest drawdowns of the year, but Fundstrat’s Tom Lee argues the real culprit is not the Federal Reserve (Fed). Rather, it is a sudden liquidity shock inside crypto itself. Speaking in a new interview, Lee said the October 10 washout unleashed the largest liquidation event in crypto history, wiping out players and potentially crippling key market-makers, creating what he calls a form of “crypto QT.” According to the BitMine chair, the market’s weakness stems from a combination of macro fear and internal structural stress. “There was this big liquidation event on October 10. One that really was a larger liquidation event than anything seen in history,” he explained. At the same time, crypto’s sensitivity to the interest-rate outlook has kept traders skittish. “If you end up with a hawkish Fed, it gets crypto investors very nervous.” However, for Ethereum specifically, Lee believes the more important factor is the quiet disappearance of crucial liquidity providers following the wipeout. “It does have the signs of that maybe a market maker or two actually is unable to provide market liquidity, and as you know, as liquidity contracts, it’s the same thing as the central bank tightening. So it’s almost like Crypto Qt,” he said. This internal liquidity drought, Lee argues, is why prices have lagged. “It does take a few weeks for the industry to sort of find its footing, and I think that’s why crypto prices have lagged here.” Despite the stress, Lee remains adamant that Ethereum is in the early stages of a long-term Supercycle. Perhaps this is why BitMine continues to accumulate, as reported in a recent US Crypto News publication. He points to surging activity across stablecoins, RWA tokenization, prediction markets, and emerging digital identity rails, most of which depend on Ethereum or its Layer 2 ecosystems. “Ethereum is a smart contract platform… It’s really the rails where I think a lot of things are going to be built,” he said. “Stablecoins… prediction markets… and now talk about tokenizing more than just dollars, but equities, real estate, and alternative assets… these are all rising.” To Lee, those data points reinforce the thesis that it is a story that is still in the earliest stages and one of the reasons why BitMine considers it a super cycle. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan echoed that view, calling the current environment a rare entry point. “I think regardless of what happens on the economy in the next year, stable coins will grow tremendously… tokenization will maybe 10x in the next few years… prediction markets are going to be huge… decentralized identity and digital identity are going to be huge,” he said. For investors looking long-term, he added, “it really is almost a gift.” One open question remains whether Bitcoin has already peaked for the cycle. Lee said the answer will shape how investors interpret the next year. “If Bitcoin makes a new high this year, then it really obviates the fact that there is a four-year cycle.” He expects broader market strength to carry into year-end, helping push Bitcoin back to all-time highs. In other words, the pain may be real, but the cycle is far from over.

Title: Fidelity launching Solana ETF as analysts eye $160 price before December

About us Copy link Solana’s exchange-traded fund season is in full swing and analysts are bullish that it can trigger a rally for the sixth biggest cryptocurrency in the world. The prediction comes as Fidelity, the $7 trillion asset manager, is set to launch its spot Solana ETF under ticker FSOL on Tuesday, marking one of the top institutional endorsements in altcoins, analysts say. The vote of confidence in Solana, combined with the general crypto market recovering from its current $1.2 trillion sell-off, could catapult the price by up to 16% this month, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget. “We could see a recovery toward the $156–$160 range by late November, especially as its ecosystem continues expanding in DeFi, consumer apps, and memecoin volume,” Lee told DL News. Solana’s price is down 27% over the past month to trade at $137. Fidelity’s spot Solana ETF launch lands at a pivotal time for digital assets on Wall Street. Financial giants have muscled into the crypto like never before in 2025, incentivised by the light-touch regulations promised by the White House. The third biggest investment manager in the world swooping in to launch a spot Solana ETF underscores the dramatic shift from how Wall Street used to shun the industry in the past. “Welcome to the future,” Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, said on X. The launch also comes as US regulatory agencies are reopening after a record 43-day shutdown that froze key decisions, and ETF issuers are rushing back into the pipeline. It’s not just Fidelity jumping on Solana. Canary Capital is also scheduled to launch its SOLC fund in partnership with Marinade Finance, adding Solana’s staking capabilities straight out of the gate. Last week, Canary’s XRP ETF stunned even veteran market watchers with nearly $250 million in first-day inflows, setting a new record for 2025. And now Solana is stepping into the same slipstream, analysts say. “For the first time, institutional investors are being invited to consider Solana as a standalone macro asset,” Maria Carola, CEO of crypto exchange StealthEx, told DL News. “This represents a significant shift in perception.” “Every bullish cycle needs a new protagonist, and today, Solana looks like the most likely contender,” Carola said. Fidelity launching a Solana ETF also highlights the absence of one of the key players in previous crypto ETF launches: BlackRock. While the $12.5 trillion asset manager dominates the US Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF market, it has so far not made any public moves to launch a spot Solana ETF. And that’s potentially an opportunity for Fidelity, Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, said. “Easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out,” Balchunas said on X. “[Bitwise] got out first, has $450m, [VanEck] launched today, Grayscale is in [the] mix. Game on.” Grayscale executive Zach Pandl told DL News in October that Solana ETFs could see $5 billion in investment. To be sure, previous Solana ETF releases have not been blockbuster hits. In October, Grayscale’s GSOL saw just $4 million in inflows on its first day while Bitwise’s BSOL fared better, at $129 million. Like Grayscale’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, GSOL began as a trust, meaning it was initially a closed investment vehicle. Grayscale converted the trust into an ETF structure in October, which enables investors to trade it easily. Solana is trading at $137 at time of reporting, down over 50% from its all time high set in January 2025 during the memecoin peak. Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

Title: Fidelity, Canary ignite Solana’s ETF race – So why is retail pulling back?

Could this be the perfect setup for the next bull run? With the launch of FSOL and SOLC, there will be five active spot Solana ETFs in the market. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas confirmed the news and called it a major milestone for Solana. The race to dominate the Solana [SOL] ETF market is heating up once again. This time, it’s Fidelity and Canary Capital stepping into the spotlight with the upcoming launch of the Fidelity Solana ETF (FSOL) and Canary Marinade Solana ETF (SOLC), both set to debut on the 18th of November. Once these funds go live, the crypto market will boast five active Spot Solana ETFs. Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the launch as another milestone moment in Solana’s rapid ascent within the regulated investment landscape. Taking to X, Balchunas noted, “Fidelity recently rolled out *direct* spot solana trading…Tomorrow they’ll launch spot sol ETF.So both direct sol access & spot ETFs. World’s *third* largest asset manager. Welcome to the future.” However, he also expressed his disappointment and mentioned, “Still surprised BlackRock is sitting this one out.” While anticipation had been building that BlackRock might join the Solana ETF wave, the firm seemed content sticking to its established Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] offerings. In fact, in a recent interview, Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, dismissed the broader altcoin market, bluntly stating that “most of the altcoins are worthless.” He said, “One has to be very wary going far down the table with hundreds of thousands of crypto assets today. The vast majority of those are or will be totally worthless.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s James Seyffart also confirmed the Canary ETF listing, adding that issuers were competing aggressively for Solana dominance. Source: James Seyffart/X Yet, despite the wave of ETF launches and institutional excitement, SOL market performance told a different story. At press time, the token was trading at $136.80, down 3.24% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap, reflecting fading market enthusiasm. This showed that investor sentiment around the altcoin has cooled sharply. Data from Polymarket showed that traders assigned just 7% probability of SOL reaching a new all-time high before 2026, a steep fall from 60% odds in September at the height of ETF optimism. This downturn coincided with the debut of VanEck’s Solana ETF (VSOL) on the 17th of November, which officially began trading on Nasdaq after receiving regulatory clearance under the SEC’s updated ETF framework. Farside Investors data showed Solana ETF recording $8.2 million inflows at the same time, with Bitwise’s BSOL recording $7.3 million inflows and Grayscale’s GSOL recording $0.9 million inflows.

Title: BlackRock Sidesteps the Solana ETF Showdown — Is It a Miss or Masterplan?

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Fidelity’s Solana ETF, launching on November 19, 2025, with a 25-basis-point fee, marks the entry of traditional asset managers into the Solana ETF market. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is notably not participating in this competition. As major financial institutions move swiftly to capture market share in the growing Solana ETF sector, BlackRock’s decision to focus solely on Bitcoin and Ethereum products raises questions about the future of altcoin-based funds. The Solana ETF market is expanding quickly as several firms announce new products. Bitwise’s BSOL debuted with around $450 million in assets, while VanEck’s VSOL launched on November 18, 2025. Fidelity’s FSOL, set for release on November 19, is a milestone as it brings the largest traditional asset manager into this growing sector. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the competition, noting Fidelity’s position as the largest asset manager in the Solana ETF category. The 25 basis point fee positions FSOL to compete closely with other leading products as firms strive for market leadership in this new area. Fidelity Solana ETF $FSOL is slated to launch TOMORROW. Fee is 25bps. Easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out. $BSOL got out first, has $450m, $VSOL launched today, Grayscale is in mix. Game on. pic.twitter.com/iCXMkAH9qe Canary Capital is also entering the field with its Solana ETF, ticker SOLC, which features on-chain staking through a partnership with Marinade Finance. ALSO. @CanaryFunds will be launching their Solana ETF — $SOLC — tomorrow too. It’s in partnership with @MarinadeFinance who will be doing the staking. https://t.co/DKsDY3xymg According to Nasdaq’s official listing announcement, the Canary Marinade Solana ETF began trading on November 18, 2025. Grayscale has added further competition in this forming segment. Solana’s market activity demonstrates the growing attention. Open interest in SOL futures is rising as November 19 approaches, indicating increased trader participation and engagement. This recent activity signals rising institutional interest in Solana exposure, even as the price consolidates. Meanwhile, BlackRock has made its position clear, to concentrate exclusively on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, not expanding into altcoins. Robert Mitchnick, the firm’s digital assets head, expressed at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville that assets beyond BTC and ETH lack the maturity, liquidity, and market capitalization necessary for ETF products. According to BlackRock’s leadership, the next-largest cryptocurrency after Ethereum accounts for approximately 3% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, which is well below the firm’s product launch thresholds. “I don’t think we’re going to see a long list of crypto ETFs. If you think of Bitcoin, today it represents about 55% of the market cap. Ethereum is at 18%. The next plausible investible asset is at, like, 3%. It’s just not close to being at that threshold or track record of maturity, liquidity, etc.,” Mitchnick said. Jay Jacobs and Robert Mitchnick have stressed that only a minority of BlackRock’s clients currently own IBIT or ETHA, hence their pivot. “We’re really just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially ethereum. Just a tiny fraction of our clients own ($IBIT and $ETHA) so that’s what we’re focused on (vs launching new alt coin ETFs)” – Jay Jacobs of BlackRock at ETFs in Depth. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has delivered strong results since its January 2024 debut. Similarly, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF, ETHA, reached over $1 billion in assets under management within two months of launch. However, the financial instruments have been recording outflows over the past few weeks, which could move the firm to consider joining the Solana ETF frenzy. Meanwhile, analysts have dissected theories that TradFi players like BlackRock foraying into the Bitcoin ETF market is a demonstration of bullishness. According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, their move is a calculated basis trade, with this hidden institutional strategy now distorting ETF inflows.

Title: Record $1.26B Outflow Hits BlackRock Bitcoin ETF as Bearish Options Cost Soars
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/11/18/record-usd1-26b-outflow-hits-blackrock-bitcoin-etf-as-bearish-options-cost-soars

Full Content:
BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has registered record outflows this month amid a price slide and a sharp rise in the cost of bearish options used to hedge against further market declines. The Nasdaq-listed BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has recorded a net outflow of $1.26 billion so far this month, marking the largest monthly redemption since its launch in January 2024, according to data from SoSoValue. This outflow is part of a broader trend affecting the market, with 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively experiencing withdrawals totaling $2.59 billion. IBIT's price has collapsed 16% to $52, the level last seen on April 22, data from TradingView show. The price crash has traders aggressively chasing put options as a form of protection against further declines. This is reflected in the 250-day put-call skew tracked by MarketChameleon, which measures the relative cost of puts compared to calls. The 250-day put-call skew has surged to a seven-month high of 3.1%, indicating that put options, used to hedge downside risks, are currently at their most expensive relative to calls since April.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs bleed $2.6B – Why Arthur Hayes says ‘investors don’t like BTC’
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-bleed-2-6b-why-arthur-hayes-says-investors-dont-like-btc/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T09:00:58Z

Hayes dumped his atltcoin bags for ZEC amid the ongoing weakness. Per Hayes, hedge funds are liquidating their BTC positions as the basis trade declines. According to him, an improvement in the liquidity conditions in early December could juice risk assets and drive BTC to $200k. Bitcoin’s [BTC] institutional flows have remained negative for the fourth week in a row, further accelerating the ongoing sell-off. So far in November, $2.59 billion has left the U.S. spot BTC ETFs, with half of the outflows ($1.26 billion) driven by BlackRock’s IBIT investors. Source: SoSo Value According to Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, the BlackRock bleed-out was primarily from hedge funds, such as Goldman Sachs, which have been seeking extra yield above Fed rates via BTC basis trade. It involves buying spot BTC ETFs and shorting on the asset on CME to capture the spread (basis trade). However, now that the basis trade is no longer attractive, they have hedge funds with spot BTC ETFs that have exited their positions, noted Hayes. Source: Glassnode Since October, the yield has shrunk from about 14% to below 5%. And with it, the hedge fund-led ETF outflows intensified, further spooking retail investors, added Hayes. “Now retail believes these same investors don’t like Bitcoin and creates a negative feedback loop that influences them to sell, which decreases the basis, finally causing more institutional investors to sell the ETF.” Additionally, the demand from BTC treasuries has also faded, further reinforcing the short-term concern that major players are taking a wait-and-see approach. Hayes highlighted that the dollar liquidity has also been withdrawn and could be re-injected by December when the Fed ends Quantitative Tightening (QT). Source: Bloomberg/Arthur Hayes (Treasury General Account, TGA balance) The Treasury General Balance (TGA) is the U.S government’s primary operating account and directly affects market liquidity. A TGA balance increase leads to liquidity drains as the Treasury collects more money from the market, while a decrease boosts liquidity. According to the chart shared by Hayes, there was an uptick in TGA in late October that further deepened the market rout, particularly for risk assets. Hayes projected that BTC could slip toward $80k–$85k in the short term before surging toward $200k by year-end, contingent on liquidity easing. In the meantime, Hayes expected the privacy narrative, led by Zcash [ZEC], to remain strong despite broader weakening. In fact, he dumped most of the altcoins for ZEC.

Title: Aave Labs Announces App Release On Apple’s Platform: Features And Expectations

Aave Labs, the developer behind the decentralized cryptocurrency lending platform Aave (AAVE), announced on Monday its intentions to launch a new app on Apple’s App Store. According to a report from Fortune, this new product is designed to function similarly to a traditional savings account, but with higher yields than those offered by traditional finance banks. Users can earn a minimum interest rate of 5% on their deposits, which can be funded through bank accounts or debit cards. The app will utilize stablecoins alongside the Aave protocol to offer these financial services. Aave has established itself as a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto lending sectors, boasting over $3.23 trillion in cumulative deposits, nearly $1 trillion in total originated loan volume and $ billion in total interest paid, according to the platform’s website. While DeFi protocols often provide users with higher interest rates compared to conventional banking, they also carry heightened risks, such as the potential for hacks and the absence of government backing. However, Stani Kulechov, the founder and CEO of Aave Labs, assured users of the protocol’s safety. He pointed out that Aave has never encountered an exploit in its five-year history, emphasizing the dual layers of security related to both the market economics and the software code, which has been audited by multiple companies. The forthcoming launch of the Aave app arrives at a time when the gap between traditional financial institutions and crypto-native firms is closing. Major players like BlackRock are adopting Bitcoin (BTC) through the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sector. Stripe has integrated stablecoins into its offerings, and JPMorgan Chase has been actively developing blockchain solutions. In response, crypto firms are increasingly focusing on attracting mainstream customers. The US crypto exchange Kraken, for example, has newly introduced its own payments app, while various others are working to create bank-like products using stablecoins. Kulechov remarked, “Typically, DeFi has been accessible to very savvy, professional users. The next step for DeFi is to bring more direct access for consumers.” Kulechov, a figure in the DeFi movement since launching the protocol in 2020, has expanded the company’s offerings to include a crypto wallet, a decentralized stablecoin, and a protocol for social media. In October, the firm made headlines by acquiring the stablecoin company Stable Finance for an undisclosed amount. Kulechov noted that the acquisition also enhanced their consumer-focused experience, allowing the team to move more swiftly and improve their product offerings. While the broader crypto market continues its downtrend, the price of AAVE saw a 2% uptick following the announcement. At the time of writing, it was trading at $171.87 per token.

Title: VanEck Solana ETF goes live, Grayscale DOGE ETF expected on Monday

The flood of crypto ETFs has begun, with VanEck’s Solana ETF launching on Monday, and many more ETFs expected to go live over the next week. VanEck has launched the US’s third exchange-traded fund (ETF) featuring Solana staking, as more altcoin-tied funds are set to enter the market soon. The VanEck Solana ETF (VSOL) launched on Monday, joining similar funds from Bitwise and Grayscale that debuted late in October and have jointly seen over $380 million in inflows. Like Bitwise and Grayscale’s ETFs, VSOL offers staking yields, where Solana (SOL) is locked up on the blockchain to earn rewards. It has also waived its 0.3% fee until Feb. 17 or until it reaches $1 billion in assets in a bid to compete. Asset managers have been flooding the market with crypto ETFs after the Securities and Exchange Commission changed its listing standards in September, allowing for faster approvals that don’t require an assessment of each fund. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on Monday that the Fidelity Solana ETF (FSOL) is set to launch on Tuesday, competing with three existing similar funds that charge a 0.25% fee. “Easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out,” he added. Balchunas said he expects a Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF from Grayscale to launch on Nov. 24, based on an amended regulatory filing earlier this month kicking off a 20-day period where it can launch if the SEC doesn’t respond. The Grayscale Dogecoin Trust (DOGE) is a conversion from its existing fund and would trade on the New York Stock Exchange, which must still file to list the ETF. “We’ll see, won’t be 100% till exchange notice, but based on SEC guidance, it looks good,” Balchunas added. Related: XRP traders hope fresh wave of ETF launches will restore the bull trend If Grayscale’s fund launches next week, it’ll be the first Dogecoin ETF in the US that will be able to directly hold the memecoin. Asset issuers REX Shares and Osprey Funds jointly launched a DOGE ETF in mid-September, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which limits its investment to a wholly owned offshore subsidiary that holds the cryptocurrency. Bitwise could also see its spot Dogecoin ETF launch late next week, after a change in its regulatory filing for the product on Nov. 6 triggered a 20-day launch timer, unless the SEC intervenes.

Title: It’s 21st anniversary time for World of Warcraft!

NEXT | Get in the Thanksgiving spirit with these super cute Turkeys! Unless you were paying attention when you logged into World of Warcraft yesterday, you may have easily been able to miss that it’s anniversary time again — which means the return of a lot of the things from the 20th anniversary celebration is back for a second run. The biggest difference is that now the game is 21 years old! Congratulations to World of Warcraft on being old enough to drink in bars in the United States. Frankly, the idea I’ve been playing that long makes me need a drink, but instead, let’s run down what you’ll find as part of the anniversary! Once again, the big open area outside of the Caverns of Time has been turned into an activity-filled celebration area. You’ll find a similar setup to last year, including the experience and reputation buff — you get 10% to both just for logging in, and an additional 10% for completing various activities around the celebration. (Shouldn’t that be 11% at this point?) Interestingly, Legion Remix characters are also getting the default 10% bonus, enabling fully maxed out Timerunners to have 410% bonus experience during the anniversary. Why not make it a tiny bit more ridiculous? Many of the same activities from last year are present, as well — Mount Mania, Storytime with Lorewalker Cho, the transmog contest, world bosses ravaging Tanaris, that thing in Silithus with Chromie, it’s all here. If you missed out on any of the Secrets of Azeroth event, that seems to be back again with no timegating at all, so you can just zoom right through it. You’ll also find that the Blackrock Depths raid is back — in LFR difficulty, at least. A lot of the rewards from last year are back, as well as ways to earn the Bronze Celebration Tokens you’ll need to buy them, so if you missed out on any rewards like the high-definition Tier 2 sets and you’ve been kicking yourself about it for a year, now’s your chance! Also, it was a late addition to the party, but the Trader’s Gilded Brutosaur and its $90 USD price tag has returned to the cash shop. While it was originally tied to the 20th Anniversary, now it appears it’s come back for this one, so don’t let FOMO trick you into buying it — we may have years of Brutosaurs to come. There are also a couple of new things to pick up for anniversary aficionados. Traeya, who sells the high-definition Tier 2 armor sets, now also sells a Loyal Watchman cosmetic gear set that will make you look like the guard you’ve always dreamed about being, for a grand total of 230 Timewarped Badges for the entire set. Additionally, Notary Grably — the goblin who had a whole array of expansion-themed titles for purchase — has added Khaz Algar Enthusiast for 100 Timewarped Badges. And… that’s it! There are only a couple things missing entirely this year, and some of them are not entirely a surprise. One is Storekeeper Reginald, who sells you items from prior anniversary events; his dialogue last year hinted that he’d only return every five years, and he’s true to his word, apparently. Also not present is Bobadormu, who you may have already noticed sells the same exact goods (such as scaling classic gear and Season of Discovery class exclusive item replicas) during Classic Timewalking — since he’s tied to that event, and not the anniversary, he’s missing this year. One surprising thing missing, however, is any version of the Blackrock Depths raid that isn’t LFR. Moira is present, but does not offer to send players into Normal and Heroic Blackrock Depths, and the vendors you would normally exchange Timewarped Relic Coffer Keys with after the raid are also missing. It may be that the harder version was meant to be exclusive to the 20th anniversary, but it’s slightly disappointing to not see this return — it was hard as nails last time on Heroic, and I’m sure some players would love to take another swing at the higher difficulty of this raid. For now, we’ll just have to wait and see if Blizzard switches it back on! Blizzard Watch is a safe space for all readers.

Turn-based tactics RPG Demonschool and a new SpongeBob game lead this week's latest Xbox games. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Another new week is here, with another wave of games soon to populate the Xbox storefront. This is something of a quieter week, with fewer "heavy hitters" as the big first and third-party titles have mainly launched in preparation for the holidays. Still, there are some games worth noticing, including Necrosoft's Demonschool, an eerie turn-based tactics role-playing game set on a strange island filled with monsters. Demonschool was initially supposed to arrive back in September, but was delayed due to the sudden arrival of Team Cherry's highly anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong. If you missed last week's titles, be sure to check them out as well. Now, here are all the new games launching on Xbox this week, listed below. So, there you go, that's the new games on the Xbox store this week. Personally, I'm mainly just expecting to continue mopping up Achievements in titles I've been playing for the last couple of weeks, but I do want to check out Demonschool.

Harvard is home to top intellectuals, famous alumni, and, more recently, a sizable hoard of Bitcoin. The university has more than $442 million dollars in the BlackRock-issued ETF called iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which provides exposure to the cryptocurrency in the form of stock, according to filings released on Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2025, major companies and institutions have lined up to invest in crypto, including those from Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and increasingly, the Ivy League. Brown University has also disclosed roughly $14 million in crypto ETF holdings. Harvard has more money in the Bitcoin ETF than it does in any other stock, including its stakes in mainstay companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon. While half a billion dollars in IBIT is nothing to sneeze at, it accounts for less than 1% of the university’s nearly $57 billion endowment. Harvard did not respond to a request for comment about its decision to invest in Bitcoin. Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, posted on X on Friday that Harvard’s investment in IBIT was “as good a validation as an ETF can get.” The fund Harvard invested in is one of the first spot crypto ETFs to launch in the U.S. When it went public in January 2024, it marked the end of a more than decade-long battle between the crypto sector and the SEC. It was also the first time that U.S. investors could invest in Bitcoin through their brokerage accounts, rather than through crypto exchanges. Even with a recent slump in Bitcoin prices, IBIT’s total market cap is well over $70 billion. Although Harvard’s $442 million stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is yet another sign of crypto’s growing institutional acceptance, a year of wins for the industry hasn’t translated to a big price increase for Bitcoin. In the last year, Bitcoin has gone up less than 0.5%, a fraction of the S&P 500’s 13% rise during that time. Bitcoin shot up to its all-time high price of almost $126,000 last month but is down roughly 27% to less than $92,000.

Title: Inside Commercial Observer’s 2025 Fall Finance Forum

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Some of the biggest names in commercial real estate finance discussed the state of capital markets during Commercial Observer’s National Finance Forum, as the conversation touched on an improved lending market, especially for securitized products, where opportunities are found in a highly competitive credit space, and how lenders can best protect themselves. The symposium, held Nov. 13 at The Metropolitan Club at 1 East 60th Street in Midtown Manhattan, opened with a keynote general discussion between Chad Tredway, managing director, global head of real estate at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, and Bonnie Neuman, partner and global head of real estate group at law firm Sidley Austin, one moderated by CO Executive Editor Cathy Cunningham. Tredway began by noting that since CRE capital markets hit bottom at the end of 2024, J.P. Morgan has seen each aspect of its entire $80 billion CRE portfolio appreciate every quarter since then and that investors are taking notice. “Real estate still has room to recover, but we’re finding people shift out of cash, shift out of equities, and shift out of fixed-income and they’re coming back into real estate, and we firmly believe 2026 should be a great vintage,” said Tredway. “The headline is real estate is coming back.” Neuman noted that while the year started off with lingering valuation issues due to high interest rates, the valuation disconnect has evaporated, interest rates have dropped, and the office market has seen sales finally gain some momentum, due to commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) financing aiding the repricing of risk as conditions have shifted. “In the securitized space, where I spent most of my time, it’s been a roaring year, with a huge amount of originations,” she said, noting the CMBS market will have at least $150 billion in originations in 2025. “It’s been a busy year in the syndicated and balance sheet securitized loan markets.” Neuman emphasized the transaction market for debt has become “highly competitive,” due to the re-emergence of commercial banks, as well as the growth of debt funds, private credit, bank-backed leverage, and bridge leverage gaps being closed by preferred equity, which she called “a bit of trend recently in some transactions.” Tredway closed his remarks by stating how J.P. Morgan is moving as quickly as it can to capture value in the market by buying assets below replacement cost, where cash yields should improve as interest rates come down in the months ahead. “For those that have equity, the time is now,” he said. “We strongly believe that we’re going into a massive tailwind here, and if rates continue to go down it gets even better.” The next panel, moderated by Jay Neveloff, chair of U.S. real estate at HSF Kramer, examined the state of the market in 2025 and what we should expect in 2026 and beyond with a diverse collection of lenders, brokers and investors. Kyle Jeffers, chief investment officer at Acore Capital, said his firm is “aggressively going back” into the market, with most lenders lending at a basis that’s been significantly reset below replacement cost, and that his firm recently financed an office deal that was 30 percent the previous owner’s basis. “You can’t predict the bottom, but it certainly feels like we bounced off the bottom and are on our way up,” said Jeffers. “So this is the time to be leaning into the market.” Nick Scribani, vice chairman at Newmark, noted that investment sale activity is up 20 percent compared to 2024, when the market had been muted due to the high cost of debt and most balance sheet lenders chose to remain on the sidelines. But the last 12 months has been “a proliferation of repressed energy,” Scribani said, concerning the deployment of capital, especially into the CMBS market. “There’s so much ability to access capital, particularly in the debt marketplace, where you can actually borrow with positive leverage,” he said. “People are coming off the sidelines as quickly as they can, because you’re going to miss the train if you’re still sidelined.” Karen Ramos, managing director and head of distribution and asset rotation Americas at Crédit Agricole CIB, agreed that commercial banks have returned from the sidelines, but the real liquidity story is debt funds and private credit increasing their activity to finance huge deals, mainly for data centers, with back leverage. “We’re seeing the debt funds and private credit come in such a huge way in terms of big commitments as much as $2 billion,” she said. “And that’s bringing a lot of the liquidity from a new source, in addition to the typical banks.” Aaron Kraus, managing director and head of market development and strategy at Nuveen Green Capital, spoke of what it’s like to finance C-PACE projects, which typically fill gaps in ground-up construction capital stacks, and how the underwriting among debt funds is often too high for those deals, but with spreads tightening in recent months, the entire financing space has become more competitive. “Spreads have come in so tightly in the last six months,” Kraus emphasized. “On the terms we’re seeing, from both debt funds and banks, it’s a much tighter rate environment,and everyone is competing.” Neveloff then asked the lenders how they remain competitive and find an advantage in a market awash in borrower friendly capital and filled with hundreds of new sources for CRE loans that are changing the game on debt service coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios. Yorick Starr, managing director at Invesco, pointed to prioritizing quality sponsorship when underwriting and assessing deals. “We’re first and foremost all about the sponsor,” he said. “We’ve seen it time and time again, if you lend to the right people, structure aside, you typically get paid back or they have enough money that they’ll figure it out.” He also said that as a firm that primarily invests equity into deals, Invesco underwrites the quality of the real estate aggressively. “Is it real estate that we want to own? Is it a market that we currently own in? Do we understand the asset class?” he said. “Am I lending to the right person on the right asset in the right market?” Jeffers pointed to leaning in to relationships formed in the fires of COVID-19, the regional banking crisis of 2023, and the recent interest rate upheaval. “You compete on relationships,” he said. “What we’ve learned in the last couple of years is knowing your lender, knowing what your relationship is, and knowing how you work together in hard times makes a difference.” The third panel examined market volatility and was hosted by Michael Vines, partner at Fried Frank. Ironically, the discussion first examined how strong the market is right now and how little volatility there is relative to previous years in this decade. John Lippmann, head of U.S. real estate capital markets at Barings, pointed ot the strength of the CMBS market, where issuance stands at $106 billion, up 15 percent year-to-date, largely fueled by a surge of single-asset, single-borrower (SASB) financing up nearly 30 percent. He noted that commercial bank balance sheets right now hold more than $250 billion in capital available to loan as back leverage or note-on-note financings for debt funds. “That number may grow as we see continued regulatory benefits for banks to be the Senior lender of choice but maybe not the direct lender of choice to commercial real estate,” Lippmann said. The topic then turned to distress. Natalia Sosnina, head of acquisitions at Terra Strategies, said that it’s become harder for her firm to find deals during a time of distress due to the competition for opportunistic debt buys — with office buildings being the only asset class providing discounts. “Most of the time, even if the borrower is in distress and the situation of the building is bad, lenders are not really in distress — they all want close to par,” she said. “For us, it’s very difficult to assume that kind of risk to buy a distressed note and then pay a lender close to par.” Andrew Huggett, managing director of loan syndications at First Citizens Bank, said that the volatility amid a new, highly competitive lending landscape has made it necessary for banks to make large whole loan amounts and leave them on their books or use syndication agreements with other lenders to win large CRE deals. “You won’t win a deal unless you’re willing to either fully take it down, book and hold [the loan], or raise your hand and be willing to selectively syndicate,” he said. Shawn Katz, president of Silverstein Capital Partners, said that with so much liquidity in the market, especially in private credit, his firm is finding opportunities lending into broken capital stacks that need just a bit of equity to close a persistent gap, rather than riskier whole loans into big construction projects. “Our underwriting doesn’t change, it stays consistent, and when you look at risk-adjusted returns, where we lend, we’re seeing the most opportunity in the gap equity space,” he said. “And where we’re delivering whole loans in ground-up construction, or value-add, those risk-adjusted returns aren’t there.” When asked how lenders and investors are viewing risk in today’s market, David Friedman, chief credit officer and head of non-agency production and syndications at Arbor Realty Trust, said that it all comes down to who one is lending to or investing with, especially construction loans, bridge and mezzanine financings, or preferred equity. “We’re looking under the hood, not just at the asset, but who is the borrower, who is the sponsor, what is their equity contribution,” he said. “We lend on real estate, but we lend to people — you can see structure erode away or be totally structured up with the wrong sponsor.” The ensuing panel “The Role & Impact of Non-Bank Lenders in the Market Today” discussed the increased role of private credit over the past decade and a half as banks and insurance companies look to reduce their exposure to CRE risk. Michael Lavipour, senior managing director, head of lending at Affinius Capital, said private lenders have filled a void for providing necessary recap funding for 2021 vintage development loans issued when interest rates were at near zero borrowing levels. Lavipour also noted that non-bank lenders are also increasingly lending on behalf of insurance companies. Lavipour said he expects that the growth of private lenders will likely slow down in the couple years similar to what happened with the CMBS market 10 years ago. He stressed, however, that the last 90 days has seen more competition which has pushed leverage levels up about 5 percent. “When you find a deal that makes a good credit, you lean in on it. And when you find a deal that is being bid like crazy, and you are kind of wishy-washy on it, you take a step back, and if you can’t deploy you can’t deploy,” Lavipour said. “It’s not an easy market from that perspective, but there is still opportunity for sure with a large number of deals.” The non-bank lenders panel — moderated by Christine O’Connell, partner at King & Spalding — also featured Maxwell Wu, co-founder and CEO of Fulcrum Lending, and Robert Rothschild, managing director at InterVest Capital Partners. Rothschild said many private credit shops now also have an equity business which has proven to be advantageous in the marketplace because of the increased institutional knowledge about individual assets that require equity positions. “As we’ve grown and evolved into the space, the borrowers, the sponsors and developers have seen that the lenders are much more agile,” Rothschild said. “[Private credit lenders] understand the risks and they understand the real estate a lot more than maybe the bank lender might have five to 10 years ago, and that ultimately is the advantage for the underlying sponsor because they have a lender that really understands to underwrite different hypothetical situations.” The following panel, “Recaps & Filling the Capital Stack,” addressed how private credit has played a pivotal role in helping more deals pencil in an elevated interest rate environment with more common and preferred equity products. “The solutions that you see supporting the capital are pretty wide ranging and the depth of market is pretty strong because of the perceived relative value there,” said Brad Bitting, managing director at Post Brothers, speaking on sponsors’ preference for private credit. Ethan Elser, executive vice president of PACE Equity, said commercial property accessed clean energy (C-PACE) loans can also be an effective tool to reduce the cost of capital in an expensive debt deal. He noted that C-PACE is also for recaps often used in mid-construction, or up to three years post construction, that can help sponsors achieve more favorable terms with the senior lender if they need more time to achieve their business plan. Elser added that C-PACE continues to grow as a lending tool with originations on pace for $3.5 billion to $4 billion this year up from $2.5 billion in 2024. The panel — moderated by Mark Fawer, partner at Greenspoon Marder — also consisted of Morris Betesh, founder and managing partner at Arrow Real Estate Advisors, and Daniella Marca, executive director, real estate debt, at BlackRock. Betesh said the CRE debt markets are “very healthy” now, with insurance companies aggressively bidding for deals and banks also back lending on all CRE asset classes. He said regional banks including Flagstar Bank (formerly New York Community Bank) have returned to the CRE debt market and cleaned out their portfolios after getting saddled with some troubled New York City loans when interest rates soared in 2022. The day’s penultimate panel, “Old vs. New: Showcasing the Most Coveted Lending Opportunities,” stressed that the office market has made a comeback in certain markets. Keith Kurland, senior managing director and co-head of New York City capital markets at Walker & Dunlop, said the brokerage has arranged billions of loans for Manhattan office assets this year with banks showing particular interest in lending on the asset class from their balance sheets. Kurland said the bank appetite for New York City office hasn’t existed since pre-COVID. Zachary Cohn, managing partner at Brookfield, said with interest rates 150 basis points lower than a year ago, 2026 is shaping up to see a bounce back in the acquisitions market. He also stressed that the CRE industry is well positioned for a transition of CRE assets from banks to private credit since lenders are not overleveraged to levels they were during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. “The capital space is stable,” Cohn said. “It’s a long-term theme that will drive our markets in a really impactful way.” The last panel — moderated by Joseph Lanzkron, partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton — also featured Dan Cooperman, head of investments at Mavik Capital Management; Jacob Weinstein, executive vice president, head of real estate and health care at BHI; and Annemarie DiCola, CEO at Trepp. DiCola said CMBS volume is on pace for a banner 2026, likely to reach $120 billion by year’s end, which would be the highest total since 2007. She noted that 75 percent of the CMBS volume has single-asset, single-borrower deals with most of the transactions for Class A office properties.

The speculation surrounding a potential BlackRock XRP ETF has surged to new heights. This surge is a direct consequence of the astonishing market debut of the Canary XRPC ETF. Canary XRP ETF’s launch has painted a clear picture of robust institutional and retail demand for a regulated XRP investment product. As the speculation around a potential BlackRock XRP ETF is heating up again, the Canary XRPC ETF has delivered one of the strongest launches of the year. An analyst known as Skipper_xrp has noted on X that the newly listed fund stunned the market with over $58 million in first-day trading volume and $245 million in net inflows, outperforming hundreds of ETF debuts of 2025. Skipper_xrp mentioned that many supporters in the XRP community still believe that BlackRock might already be quietly experimenting with or even testing the idea of an XRP trust behind closed doors. The momentum has increased further after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made a statement at the company’s Swell event, highlighting that Ripple’s ongoing collaboration with major traditional financial firms will bring digital asset adoption into regulated global markets. However, with the ETF inflows accelerating and XRP gaining more visibility among institutions, many investors are now arguing that it’s only a matter of time before a heavyweight firm like BlackRock will consider stepping into the XRP space. Crypto trader Adam_Xrp has also offered some insight on why XRP didn’t moon when the first ETF was launched. According to the expert, the XRP ETF launch was never going to be a flip-the-switch moment. Even with the first XRP ETF going live, price action was building slowly, and the institutional money did not pour in all at once. Rather, it scales over time as confidence and liquidity grow. Furthermore, the altcoin is still early in the rollout, and more XRP ETFs are scheduled to begin trading. Each new product will increase exposure, volume, and demand. This is how true institutional adoption is slowly progressing. BlackRock has stated that the company is not launching an XRP ETF right now, but this isn’t something they would ignore forever. However, once the regulatory path is fully cleared and institutional demand strengthens, it’s only a matter of time before the biggest players, like BlackRock, will step into the arena. Adam_Xrp concluded that the altcoin wasn’t supposed to skyrocket overnight. This phase is a gradual process of foundation building as the ecosystem, liquidity expansion, and the institutional framework grow. The expert added that if you expect to get rich overnight, without understanding the long-term game plan, then XRP might not be the right investment for you.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: Ripple Exec Addresses Tax Issue On XRP Ledger, Where Does It Go?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A debate over the XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) economy model has ignited after Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, directly addressed questions about taxation on the blockchain. Critics have suggested that if XRP holders do not earn from the ecosystem, someone must be collecting a tax. Schwartz’s response challenges this assumption, framing the XRP Ledger as a public utility rather than a profit-generating mechanism for token holders. The debate has since sparked broader conversations about real-world use cases, passive income expectations, and the underlying purpose of the XRPL blockchain. In a post on X social media, Schwartz clarified that the XRP Ledger does not impose a tax on its users. He explained that the ledger allows holders to issue assets, trade, create NFTs, and make payments without central authority extracting value from these financial activities. He also stated that transaction fees and reserves exist solely as anti-spam measures, not as a mechanism for wealth extraction. The Ripple CTO emphasized that ownership of XRP does not give anyone the right to collect fees or profits from the ledger itself. He drew a comparison to Bitcoin’s blockchain, highlighting that the XRPL provides similar decentralized functionality while also supporting features such as Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), stablecoins, and NFTs. These features work without XRP holders needing to profit from the system’s operations. Schwartz’s remarks on taxes on the XRPL blockchain come after Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, raised questions about who benefits if XRP holders do not earn anything from the ecosystem and the protocol itself does not generate value. In response, other members of the community, including XRPL dUNL validator Vet, emphasized that the absence of a tax encourages developers and users to focus on building meaningful, functional use cases rather than relying on passive income. The XRPL tax debate between Schwartz and Sigel also intersected with discussions about the blockchain’s real-world applications. In a much earlier post, Sigel questioned the blockchain’s relevance, subtly hinting that its supporters overstate its functionality. In response, an XRP community member pointed to the recent collaboration between Ondo Finance, Ripple, and BlackRock, in which the XRP Ledger will be utilized for stablecoin issuance, minting, Treasury asset redemption, and liquidity enhancement in financial markets. While Sigel acknowledged the innovative initiative, he reiterated that these applications do not directly generate revenue for XRP token holders, highlighting a gap between network activity and personal gain. Schwartz responded by explaining that the value of XRPL stems from enabling financial independence and reducing reliance on intermediaries, rather than providing passive income. He added that focusing on tax collection as a measure of success can overshadow the blockchain’s purpose of promoting open access and meaningful innovation.

Michael Saylor has kept his word, making yet another massive Bitcoin BTC $90 420 24h volatility: 3.0% Market cap: $1.80 T Vol. 24h: $82.28 B purchase of 8,178 BTC, adding it to the Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) portfolio. His purchase comes despite sharp volatility in BTC, which is currently trading around $93,500. The MSTR stock price has meanwhile slipped, falling 2.28 percent in Monday’s pre-market trading. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor announced that the company has purchased an additional 8,178 BTC for roughly $835.6 million. This latest acquisition came at an average price of about $102,171 per Bitcoin. Strategy has acquired 8,178 BTC for ~$835.6 million at ~$102,171 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 27.8% YTD 2025.

As of November 16, 2025, Strategy holds 649,870 BTC in its corporate treasury, accumulated at a total cost of roughly $48.37 billion, or an average of $74,433 per BTC. This puts to rest the rumors that Michael Saylor’s Strategy has been selling BTC during the recent price correction. Saylor rejected the claims and said they are firmly “HODLing with diamond hands.” Despite this, MSTR stock price has failed to see the upside, and has slipped further under $200. On Monday’s pre-market trading session, MSTR stock is down by another 2.28% and is currently trading at $195 levels. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that the MSTR stock could further drop to $120 levels if bulls fail with a strong recovery. If this fractal continues to play out, Strategy $MSTR could soon rebound to $260 before rolling over toward $120. https://t.co/hwQ5zMu9BM pic.twitter.com/Vg4ZaPGHHP — Ali (@ali_charts) November 14, 2025 On the other hand, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff called Strategy’s business model as fraud. MSTR’s entire business model is a fraud. Saylor and I will both be speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in early December. I challenge @saylor to debate this proposition with me. Regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, I believe $MSTR will eventually go bankrupt. Let’s go! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 16, 2025 Bitcoin price is showing extreme fragility, extending losses to over 10% during the past week, and currently flirting with $93,500. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows said Bitcoin remains in a Wyckoff distribution phase, signaling continued corrective pressure in the market. According to Pillows, the $88,000-$90,000 range represents a notable support zone that could serve as a potential local bottom if selling eases. $BTC Wyckoff distribution is still happening. There's some support around the $88K-$90K zone, which could act like a local bottom. What's your prediction for BTC bottom this time? pic.twitter.com/24ylurknBr — Ted (@TedPillows) November 17, 2025 While Michael Saylor’s Strategy remains firm on its Bitcoin purchase, big asset managers like BlackRock are selling big.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs’ 100% Rally Raises More Questions Than Answers | US Crypto News

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee and settle in—this one might make you rethink what you thought you knew about crypto. In the past year, Bitcoin has surged dramatically, posting returns that rival traditional safe-haven assets. Yet, while some see a story of stability, others see lingering questions about risk, reward, and where cryptocurrencies really belong in a portfolio. Since January 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have surged roughly 100%, mirroring the returns of physical gold ETFs, while the S&P 500 returned just 45%. This performance has sparked a fresh debate over Bitcoin’s role in investor portfolios: is it a “risk-on” asset like stocks, or a “store of value” like gold? Since spot btc ETFs launched in Jan 2024, they’ve returned same % as physical gold ETFs…Approx 100%.S&P 500 has returned nearly 45%.So is btc a “risk on” asset like stocks or “store of value” like gold? Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, highlighted the surprising parity, with the striking similarity to gold returns prompting investors to reassess Bitcoin’s traditional narrative. While Bitcoin is widely viewed as a volatile, high-risk asset, its ETF performance over the past year has aligned with one of the most stable investment vehicles in history. Against this backdrop, investors weigh whether the risk is worth the return. “I think the question for cripto is… especially ETH. Do you want to hold a high-volatility asset for that kind of return? ETH flat or down for the past 4/5 years,” one user chimed. This remark highlights the challenge for investors, who see Bitcoin’s rally offering gold-like gains, but but the risks due to volatility remain a persistent threat for crypto as an asset class. Risk-adjusted returns remain a key factor when evaluating crypto’s place in a diversified portfolio. Risks notwithstanding, BlackRock’s recent People & Money report reveals the growing retail appetite for ETFs, especially among younger investors. According to Nate Geraci’s summary: This data highlights a generational shift in investing behavior. Younger investors are increasingly incorporating crypto into their portfolios alongside traditional assets. This shows that the market is growing faster than conventional wisdom suggests. Institutional activity adds another layer to the debate. Whale tracker reports indicate that BlackRock recently deposited 4,880 BTC, worth approximately $467 million, and 54,730 ETH valued at nearly $176 million into the Coinbase exchange. BlackRock deposits 4,880 $BTC, worth $467.19 million, and 54,730 $ETH, worth $175.93 million into Coinbase – Arkham. pic.twitter.com/Q7RSl6c6k3 The transaction marks the second move this month. Barely two weeks ago, the asset manager transferred 2,042 BTC, worth $213 million, and 22,681 ETH, valued at $80 million, to the same exchange. Moving tokens to exchanges often suggest possible plans to sell, a move that could be bearish for Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. “Last time they did this, the market dipped soon after. Now with Bitcoin sitting near $104K… is sub-$100K next?” Kyle Doops posed on X after the initial transaction. Nonetheless, large transfers from major fund managers to exchanges could also mean strategic rebalancing. With both possibilities likely to weigh on near-term price sentiment, it is worth noting that concentrated institutional holdings could amplify market swings, particularly in high-volatility environments. Should Bitcoin be treated like digital gold, offering portfolio stability? Or is it a high-risk, high-reward asset akin to equities? Looking ahead, retail and institutional flows, ETF innovation, and macroeconomic conditions will likely define crypto’s trajectory in 2026. As younger investors increasingly allocate to crypto ETFs, the market may see both rapid growth and heightened volatility, reinforcing the need for careful portfolio strategy.

Title: Stocks Go 24-7 in New Crypto Betting Markets With 100x Leverage
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/crypto/stocks-go-24-7-in-new-crypto-betting-markets-with-100x-leverage
Time Published: 2025-11-17T14:08:06Z
Full Content:
A product born in crypto’s most fevered era is being quietly rebuilt for the US stock market — trading 24-7, with no brokers and no closing bell. The perpetual swap, or perp, is a derivative that lets traders take long or short positions on a digital asset’s price, without ever owning it. In crypto, perps have reshaped trading, becoming a multi-trillion-dollar engine of leverage and liquidity, where positions can run as high as 100-to-1 and never expire. Now developers are extending that model to traditional assets and benchmarks, including Nasdaq 100, Tesla Inc., and Coinbase Global Inc., and more. Think of it as fantasy sports for equities: traders bet on where a stock or index will go, using crypto as collateral — bypassing Wall Street’s investment ecosystem altogether. The offerings, which are gaining momentum despite past blowups and regulatory strain, are technically off-limits to US users because no domestic framework currently permits them. On the Hyperliquid blockchain — known for its fast-growing namesake exchange — a Nasdaq-linked contract known as XYZ100 has already drawn as much as more than $60 million in open interest. Wall Street is already paying attention. The likes of Jane Street are backing Vest Labs, which is building a venue for global equity perp trading. Crypto exchanges “are realizing that equities are much better tradable asset at least in the current economy,” said Justin Ma, CEO of Vest Labs. “I really want this to be a venue for 24-7 price discovery for US companies as well as something that’s fully accessible for investors all around the world.” The experiment captures two defining forces in today’s markets: unstoppable retail speculation, and crypto’s drive to rebuild finance in its own image. While big institutions cautiously pilot the likes of tokenized Treasuries, digital-asset developers are reviving the experiments that defined the industry’s early boom — from perpetual swaps to prediction markets — with bets that are fast-moving, lightly regulated, and wired for volatility. Here’s how it works: A trader posts crypto collateral — typically the USDC stablecoin — and opens a long or short position on, say, the Nasdaq 100. They’re not buying actual shares; they’re entering a smart contract that tracks the index’s price using external data feeds. If the trade goes their way, they earn the difference. If it moves against them, their position is typically auto-liquidated once their margin runs out. A dynamic fee — the funding rate — balances demand between longs and shorts, so the price of the perp stays tethered to the real-world asset. Platforms can lean on price oracles and market makers to model stock moves when markets close – a fragile but functional, for now, setup. “Perps were uniquely suited for nascent, speculative crypto markets as the structure allowed for outsized leverage with an objective, fair and self‑regulating funding mechanism in continuous 24-7 markets,” said Darius Sit, founder of crypto investment firm QCP. It echoes a broader race toward 24-7 markets. Traditional markets are inching that way. Cboe has proposed longer option sessions, and brokerages already offer extended access on alternative venues. The crypto version goes further: nonstop stock bets without Wall Street’s machinery. Whether these contracts truly track the stocks is debatable. Whether they grant rights — dividends, votes, ownership — is not. They don’t. Risky Business When markets close, the funding rate becomes the pulse: bullish weekends push it positive and prices drift up; fear flips it. It works, mostly, while markets are open. After-hours is murkier. Ostium, one of the perps platforms for equity and other assets, pauses trading when stocks stop; Others, such as the ones on Hyperliquid, don’t. They model underlying equity prices while exchanges sleep, keeping liquidity alive but risking distortion. “This structure enables perpetual-futures protocols to serve as natural venues for price discovery when primary markets are offline,” said Wyatt Raich, a former BlackRock executive, who is starting a new equity derivatives platform. Kaledora Fontana Kiernan-Linn, co-founder of Ostium, said letting markets run while stocks are closed creates risks that outweigh the benefits, citing examples like sudden tariff announcements or surprise earnings-related announcements. “You can get wicked out on the weekend of someone’s moves of a massive order,” she said. “You might suddenly have all of your position being completely eroded by funding, like unpredictable things can happen when no one else can hedge.” For many traders, though, that volatility is the point. US rules cap equity margin at roughly three-times leverage. Perps offer 10X, 50X, even 100X, with commensurate risk. “One of the biggest trends in retail financial products in the US is the rise of demand for leverage,” said Tom Schmidt, general partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly. “The DTCC effectively limits leverage on US equities through traditional margin lending to 3X, but there’s clearly demand for more than that.” There’s just one problem: they’re not legal in the US. Perps sit in a legal no‑man’s‑land. They behave like futures, mimic securities, and run on crypto infrastructure. Michael Marcantonio, head of decentralized finance at Galaxy Digital, calls it “the holy trinity of regulation.” Such contracts, he noted, would be overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Derivatives Clearing Organizations. And under current US law, approved futures must have a defined expiration date. That’s why these products still block US users — though most run directly on blockchains, meaning anyone determined enough can still find a way in. Precedent is discouraging. In 2021, the SEC subpoenaed Terra’s Do Kwon over Mirror Protocol’s synthetic stocks. Still, there are signs of openness. In September this year, the SEC and CFTC proposed a joint pilot for novel market structures. And under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, hopes have risen that US access to these products may follow. Coinbase has already introduced regulated Bitcoin and Ether perps for US traders. “The SEC continues to be deliberate in their efforts to find a path to the US market for innovative products,” said Ryne Miller, a partner at Lowenstein Sandler and former general counsel at FTX US, who adds that incoming CFTC chair Michael Selig may also look for ways in.

Title: Exclusive: Popular crypto lending service Aave to launch app in Apple store that offers high-yield returns to consumers

The recent crypto boom has been marked by blockchain companies working to expand their appeal to mainstream consumers. That now includes Aave Labs, the developer behind a popular decentralized lending service, which on Monday announced plans to launch an app in Apple’s App Store and opened up a waitlist for interested users. Aave is well-known in crypto as a leading project in DeFi, or decentralized finance. By opening up the waitlist for the app, it seeks to offer a version of its services without the litany of lingo, such as “stablecoins” and “protocol,” that is common in crypto but that may be unfamiliar or offputting to outsiders. Aave’s new product acts like a savings account—but with a higher yield. Users can earn a minimum 5% in interest on their holdings and can deposit money in with a bank account or debit card. The product uses stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, as well as the Aave protocol. Aave has been one of the longest-standing networks of its kind, boasting over $30 billion in deposits, according to data from the crypto analytics site DefiLlama. Customers typically can get more interest on their assets on DeFi protocols than through conventional banks, but they often come with a greater risk of hacks—and no government backing. Still, Stani Kulechov, founder and CEO of Aave Labs, stressed that the Aave protocol—and therefore the forthcoming Aave app—is safe, especially since Aave has never experienced an exploit in its five-year history. “There is a security on the actual market economics. And then there’s also security on the actual code basis,” he said, pointing to how multiple companies have audited the software. The planned launch of the Aave app comes as the chasm between traditional finance companies and crypto-native startups is growing smaller. The marquee asset manager BlackRock has leaned into Bitcoin, the fintech Stripe has embraced stablecoins, and the banking giant JPMorgan Chase has steadily deployed new blockchain products. Meanwhile, crypto companies have sought to attract more mainstream users. The U.S. crypto exchange Kraken has launched its own payments app and a slew of others are aiming to create their own bank-like products built with stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar. “Typically, DeFi has been accessible to very savvy, professional users,” Kulechov, CEO of Aave Labs, told Fortune. “The next step for DeFi is to bring more direct access for consumers.” Kulechov is one of DeFi’s torchbearers. In 2020, he launched the Aave protocol. Since then, he’s expanded out his DeFi offerings to include a crypto wallet, a decentralized stablecoin, and a decentralized protocol for social media. In October, Aave Labs acquired the stablecoin company Stable Finance for an undisclosed sum. “They had more of a consumer DeFi experience that helped our team to move faster and and improve our offering down the line,” said Kulechov.
