Nearly 400 people who say they are "a person of wealth" signed an open letter calling for global leaders to increase taxes on the superrich. Signatories of the letter, which was addressed to leaders at the World Economic Forum's Davos conference this week, include actor Mark Ruffalo, film producer and activist Abigail Disney, and musician Brian Eno. The letter said that a few ultrawealthy people are negatively influencing nearly every aspect of society. "A handful of global oligarchs with extreme wealth have bought up our democracies; taken over our governments; gagged the freedom of our media; placed a stranglehold on technology and innovation; deepened poverty and social exclusion; and accelerated the breakdown of our planet," the letter read. They said that higher taxes, on people — including themselves — was the solution. "As our elected representatives—whether it's those of you at Davos, local councillors, city mayors, or regional leaders—it's your duty to deliver it," it said. "So tax us. Tax the super rich." The annual WEF conference has gathered some of the world's richest and most powerful people in the Swiss mountain town. Business Insider tracked at least 157 private jets that arrived near Davos, using data from ADS-B Exchange and JetSpy. They included airplanes belonging to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Jets from companies like Aramco, BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Google, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma also arrived in the area. In April, President Donald Trump said he wouldn't mind paying more in taxes himself, but he's not convinced that he should raise taxes on millionaires. "I think it would be very disruptive, because a lot of the millionaires would leave the country," Trump said. "The old days, they left states. They go from one state to the other. Now with transportation so quick and so easy, they leave countries." Trump said the US would "lose a lot of money" if the country raised taxes on millionaires. Oxfam reported this week that a record number of billionaires were created last year, bringing the global total to more than 3,000 for the first time. Billionaire wealth has increased by 81% since 2020, the study found. The tax petition was organized by the nonprofits Patriotic Millionaires, Millionaires for Humanity, and development charity Oxfam. The letter is published on a website that allows more people who identify as "a person of wealth" to also sign their names. Jump to

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto’s BTC stash – 17 years later, how much is it worth?

Seventeen years of untouched Bitcoin outweighs any single week of tariffs, sell-offs, or headline-driven volatility. The cryptocurrency market is currently caught between short-term global shocks and the long-term confidence of Bitcoin’s earliest holders. At the time of writing, Bitcoin [BTC] was trading at $89,490, down over 3% in the last 24 hours. Its latest drop was triggered by rising global trade concerns after U.S President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on eight European countries. While short-term traders moved money into safer assets like gold, blockchain data revealed that long-term Bitcoin holders remain confident. According to Arkham Intelligence, Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, has now held their original Bitcoin holdings for 17 years without moving them. What started at $0 in 2009 grew to $4,500 in 2010, $317,000 in 2011, $5.5 million in 2012, $14.5 million in 2013, and $827 million in 2014. Through every boom, crash, and headline since, all that Bitcoin has remained untouched. Today, 17 years later, Satoshi’s holdings are worth around $100 billion. This contrast highlights the current mood in the market. Even though retail investors might be nervous, exchange data seemed to suggest that the latest sell-off was not random. In fact, it looked more like a planned move by large players. Over the last 24 hours alone, some of the biggest players in the crypto industry moved large amounts of Bitcoin to exchanges at the same time. Source: X In total, more than 64,000 BTC was added to the sell side. This sudden hike in supply made it harder for Bitcoin’s price to move higher. When large institutions and market makers sell at the same time, it often points to a planned move rather than panic. These actions are usually meant to push the price lower, while also triggering stop-loss orders and forcing highly leveraged retail traders out of the market. And yet, despite short-term price swings, Bitcoin’s ownership remains heavily concentrated among long-term holders. According to Arkham Intelligence’s latest blog post, while the list of Bitcoin’s largest holders has been changing, the top spot remains the same. Satoshi Nakamoto is still the largest holder, with 1,096,358 BTC, or about 5.5% of the total supply. Following Satoshi’s lead is Coinbase, which holds 884,675 BTC, worth about $82 billion, or 4.4% of the total supply. BlackRock is third, with its holdings valued at $72 billion or 3.9% of supply. Strategy and the U.S government come in at 4th and 5th, with their holdings amounting to $38 billion and $30 billion, respectively. For its part, Tether has 96,369 BTC, representing approximately 0.48% of Bitcoin’s total supply. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s Dominance was strong with a reading of 59.76%. However, other on-chain datasets suggested that retail investors may be becoming less active. In fact, the 7-day average of active Bitcoin addresses has been declining since October 2025’s price peak. Source: The Block In the past, this has usually meant that smaller investors were reducing activity due to fear or uncertainty. However, this trend often happens just before institutions take a bigger role. Finally, while the number of active users has been falling, total on-chain transaction volume climbed on the charts again. Source: The Block Such a pattern usually means that large holders are quietly buying while the prices are lower. To put it simply, Bitcoin has evolved from being worth nothing in 2009 to creating a $100 billion fortune for its creator. This is evidence of the fact that its long-term value is not shaped by a few days of negative headlines.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang plans China trip amid push to reopen key market — Check out his itinerary

Time Published: 2026-01-21T05:26:58Z

Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang is planning to travel to China in late January as he works to reopen a crucial market for his company’s artificial intelligence chips. Huang will be in the country to attend company parties ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, according to a person familiar with the matter. The executive is also expected to visit Beijing, though it’s unclear whether he will meet with senior Chinese officials, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. Huang’s itinerary could still change, depending on whether prospective meetings come through. The China visit — a trip that Huang regularly takes at this time of year — comes at a pivotal moment for the world’s most valuable company. The US is loosening export restrictions on AI processors, letting Nvidia sell its H200 model in the Asian nation. But on the Chinese side, government officials are deciding how many of the chips to let in. Beijing plans to approve imports of the products as soon as this quarter for certain uses, Bloomberg News has reported. A representative for Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia declined to comment. China, the largest market for semiconductors, is looking to build up its homegrown chip industry and decrease reliance on US products. For now, though, local producers can’t match the capabilities of Nvidia’s processors, which are used to develop and run AI models. Though the H200 is a generation behind the Nvidia chips available in the US, it’s still seen as more powerful than Chinese offerings. Due to security concerns, Beijing will bar the H200 chip from the military, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure and state-owned enterprises, people familiar with the matter have said. That mirrors similar measures that the Chinese government adopted for foreign products such as Apple Inc. devices and Micron Technology Inc. chips. During a China trip in July, Huang managed to secure meetings with Vice Premier He Lifeng and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. He also celebrated the Lunar New Year holidays with his employees in China in January 2025, opting to skip US President Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony. On Wednesday, Huang is scheduled to appear at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he’ll be interviewed by BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink. Meanwhile, the US is imposing a 25% tariff on certain advanced semiconductors ahead of their shipment to China, a move aimed at fulfilling Trump’s desire for a surcharge on the sales. Washington has also stipulated additional requirements for H200 licensing applications. Exporters have to certify that approved China shipments won’t create a shortage in the US market. And companies must ensure that production for Chinese customers won’t displace manufacturing capacity that could be used to make chips for American buyers. Even with those restrictions, letting China buy Nvidia AI chips remains controversial among US lawmakers. In a hearing last week, US Representative Brian Mast said that China “would likely overtake us in the AI arms race” if the country had free access to Nvidia processors. The Florida Republican, who chairs the House panel on foreign affairs, added that Nvidia chips are far better than anything China can make domestically. Mast went further on social media over the weekend, accusing Huang and his “paid minions” of “fighting to sell millions of advanced AI chips to Chinese military companies like Alibaba and Tencent.” In the same post on X, Mast challenged Huang to debate him on Fox News. The lawmaker is working to advance a draft bill that would introduce arms-style congressional oversight over the sale of advanced AI chips and give the legislative branch the ability to block H200 sales through a joint resolution. Huang has said that such power should remain with Trump and the Department of Commerce. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Time Published: 2026-01-21T02:10:29Z
Full Content:
Microsoft CEO and Chairman Satya Nadella on Tuesday issued a rare warning about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), saying that if it stays limited to big tech companies and wealthy economies, and does not spread to other areas, the ongoing AI boom may turn into a bubble. Speaking with BlackRock Chair and CEO Laurence D. Fink, at a session during the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella said that the long-term success of AI would depend on the fast-advancing technology being deployed across a broad range of industries, as well as through adoption by countries outside the developed world. “For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,” Nadella said at the forum. It will be a "tell-tale" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focuses only on the supply side or on technology companies, rather than on adoption across sectors and the industry as a whole, he warned. Nadella stressed that he was confident AI would become more transformative across industries. “I am much more confident that this is a technology that will, in fact, build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster, bend the productivity curve and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world,” he said. He said the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate their trials. He said that an increasing amount of data from big tech companies, including Microsoft, has shown an unequal adoption rate of AI, implying that productivity benefits and work applications are restricted to wealthier countries and companies. Nadella called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. He noted how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and reshaping the way we work. “We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,” the Microsoft CEO said. Nadella added that the strongest challenge with AI is ensuring its rapid and equitable diffusion across the world. “I think when it comes to AI, the real question in front of all of us is how do you ensure that the diffusion of AI happens, and happens fast,” he said. Nadella also discussed the need for public-private cooperation to ensure that the AI revolution is supported by adequate energy infrastructure and examined data sovereignty and the risk of a so-called AI bubble.

Title: BlackRock partners with Delaware Life to bring Bitcoin into fixed index annuities

Time Published: 2026-01-21T01:47:16Z

This partnership signifies a shift in retirement planning, integrating cryptocurrency exposure into traditional financial products, potentially broadening market appeal. Powered by Gloria Delaware Life Insurance Company, which provides annuity-based retirement solutions through a nationwide network of financial advisors, is partnering with BlackRock to bring Bitcoin into its fixed indexed annuities via the BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index. A fixed indexed annuity is a contract with an insurance company designed to offer growth potential tied to a market index while protecting the principal from losses. The annuity credits interest based on the performance of a specific index, with gains limited by caps or participation rates. The account grows tax-deferred, and many FIAs allow the accumulated balance to be converted into a guaranteed income stream during retirement. Under the partnership, Delaware Life has added the BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index to three of its products, including Momentum Growth, Momentum Growth Plus, and DualTrack Income. “We’re proud to partner with BlackRock as the first insurance carrier to offer cryptocurrency exposure through a fixed index annuity,” said Colin Lake, President & CEO of Delaware Life Marketing. “As the retirement-planning landscape evolves, we’re continuously and thoughtfully innovating to meet the needs of financial professionals and their clients.” BlackRock’s benchmark blends US stocks and Bitcoin exposure into a single benchmark, using dynamic cash allocations to maintain a 12% volatility target. Bitcoin exposure is delivered through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management and liquidity. According to Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, the launch responds to growing demand for IBIT and enables insurance clients to integrate Bitcoin exposure into a diversified annuity strategy. The index is designed to offer measured participation in digital assets while preserving the principal protection annuities provide, he stated.

Title: Palantir CEO says AI will eliminate the need for mass immigration
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/20/palantir-ceo-says-ai-will-eliminate-need-mass-immigration/
Time Published: 2026-01-21T01:39:36Z

UPDATED 20:39 EST / JANUARY 20 2026 by James Farrell Palantir Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp said he believes that when the world hits peak artificial intelligence, there will be so many jobs on offer that mass immigration will be obsolete. “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp (pictured) said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “I do think these trends really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large-scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill.” Karp, who Forbes says has a net worth of around $14.3 billion, used himself as an example of job displacement when he talked about his Ph.D. in philosophy. “Elite” white-collar workers like him, he said, will be the first to be affected by the great job disruption. Vocational workers, he believes, will hold on for longer. His 30-minute conversation with BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Larry Fink has already drawn criticism from the media, which was quick to point out that these titans of the military-industrial complex and surveillance industry may not have their feet firmly on the ground. Karp often has called himself as a “card-carrying progressive,” and not too long ago said his company’s surveillance technology would not be used to track immigrants in the U.S., according to a recent article in The Washington Post. Nonetheless, Palantir’s software has played a major role in helping Immigration and Customs Enforcement unearth undocumented immigrants and deport them in line with the current administration’s mass deportation campaign. Karp was once a critic of mass deportations, but he has more recently aligned himself with President Trump, describing his company’s technology as “anti-woke” and praising the immigration crackdowns. If his predictions hold, it won’t be long until crackdowns on undocumented workers become a thing of the past, along with liberal arts degrees, because, according to Karp, AI “will destroy humanities jobs.” Some executives attending the conference told Business Insider that they believe critical thinking skills will actually become a much sought-after commodity. Anthropic PBC Chief Executive Dario Amodei said the technicians that Karp values so highly are not in demand at his company, as software and coding roles decline.

White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Michael Kratsios discusses the Trump administration’s push on AI, data center expansion and innovation on ‘Mornings with Maria.’ Palantir CEO Alex Karp suggested Tuesday that usage of artificial intelligence "bolsters civil liberties," while also warning Europe that its adoption of technology is falling behind the U.S. and China. In a wide-ranging conversation with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Karp said his company powers "tons and tons of hospitals," but that they all have an "intake problem" and a "shortage of doctors and nurses." "They are working in a low-margin environment, but every single one has a different way of processing their patients, according to what their specialty is and the kind of patients they don't do well with, and how do you manage that? And so the intake flow and into your enterprise in a way that you can actually process these things 10, 15 times faster than you could before," Karp said. "It saves a lot of lives." "Despite what people may want to believe, it also bolsters civil liberties, because now you can see, well, I mean, just simple questions — Was someone processed based on economic considerations, or were they processed based on their background? Like those things are impossible to see, unless you have, like, there's a huge civil liberties betterment side of this that typically people don't believe we care about or, but it's actually exactly the opposite," he continued.

It's like we can granularly show why someone came in, why they were taken, why they were rejected, and we can do it in a way that makes business sense for the business itself," Karp said. When asked by Fink if AI is going to create a greater imbalance in the world in terms of growth, Karp said, "Well, I think the obvious first imbalance is, it seems like America and China understand versions of making this work, and they're different, but they both work, and they work at scale, and I think that is very likely to accelerate way beyond what most people believe is possible." "Like the discount rate, I think, not in the short term, but in the long term is way too high on what will be done and how this will impact every aspect of our society," Karp added. He also said: "The tech adoption in Europe is a serious and very, very structural problem, and what scares me the most is, I haven't seen any political leader just stand up and say we have a serious and structural problem that we are going to fix."

"But like technicians. If you are a vocational technician. Or, like, we're building batteries for a battery company and the people who are doing it in America are doing roughly the same job that Japanese engineers are doing, and they went to high school," he continued. "And now, they're very valuable, if not irreplaceable, because we can make them into something different than what they were, very rapidly. And those jobs are going to become more valuable."

Title: Bitcoin pulls back to $91K – Spot buyers quietly take control
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-pulls-back-to-91k-spot-buyers-quietly-take-control/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T23:30:37Z

Bitcoin demand continues to build, supported by clear signs of underlying momentum rather than speculative excess. Bitcoin [BTC] has slipped back to the $91,000 zone after failing to sustain a move above the $95,000 level it defended for most of the previous week. While the pullback reflects short-term exhaustion, it has not meaningfully weakened broader market participation. Activity among Spot buyers and institutions suggests demand remains intact, providing a potential base for recovery as macro and crypto-specific developments unfold. Spot market sentiment has turned constructive for the first time in several weeks, with the Bitcoin Spot Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Difference) flipping decisively positive. This metric tracks whether aggressive market activity over a defined period—typically 90 days—is dominated by buyers or sellers. A positive reading indicates that buyers are once again setting the tone. Source: CryptoQuant The shift signals a transfer of control from sellers to buyers, a development that often precedes more durable price action. Importantly, Spot-led demand points to organic accumulation rather than leverage-driven momentum, strengthening the case for medium-term upside. Exchange data reinforces this narrative. Spot exchange Netflow shows that $171.83 million worth of Bitcoin has been withdrawn from exchanges, reflecting sustained buying pressure. This marks a sharp reversal from the $203 million in net selling recorded in the week ending January 12. If this pace of accumulation holds, shrinking exchange balances could begin to tighten supply and support a price rebound. Institutional investors appear unfazed by recent volatility. CryptoQuant data tracking U.S.-based wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC shows steady accumulation over the past year. Over this period, institutions have absorbed approximately $53 billion worth of Bitcoin, equivalent to around 577,000 BTC. On a monthly basis, this translates to average purchases of $4.4 billion. Source: CryproQuant These inflows are largely driven by U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, backed by major asset managers including BlackRock and Fidelity. AMBCrypto’s review of ETF flows shows that $1.21 billion worth of Bitcoin has already been purchased in January. Based on historical averages, additional inflows of up to $3.19 billion remain possible before month-end. That said, these figures remain conditional. Institutional positioning will continue to hinge on broader risk sentiment and macroeconomic signals. Bitcoin’s long-term relationship with global liquidity continues to favor higher prices. Historically, Bitcoin has topped out when global M2 money supply growth exceeds 14.4 percent. At present, global M2 growth sits near 11 percent, suggesting liquidity conditions remain supportive and have not yet reached levels typically associated with cycle peaks. Source: Alphractal Still, macro risks remain in focus. Farzam Ehsani, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange VALR, warned that renewed U.S.-EU tariff tensions could pressure risk assets, including Bitcoin. Ehsani said in an email to AMBCrypto. “President Trump’s aggressive trade rhetoric is pushing markets back into a full de-risking phase.” He added that the tariff dispute has weighed on cryptocurrencies primarily because they are treated as risk assets rather than due to market-specific weakness. “While U.S.-EU trade concerns have weighed most heavily on sentiment, other risk assets such as the KOSPI are trading flat or higher. This points to crypto-specific caution, with capital rotating toward alternative risk markets,” he noted. For now, institutional accumulation and Spot demand provide constructive signals, but tariff developments remain a key variable that could shape near-term market direction.

Title: Did BlackRock Make A Billion-Dollar XRP Bet? Here’s The Real Tea
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-billion-dollar-xrp-bet/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T23:00:49Z
Full Content:
Rumors of a large-scale XRP purchase by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, have captured the attention of the crypto world this week. Screenshots circulating on X suggest that the global investment company had invested over a billion dollars in the altcoin, sparking both bullish excitement and skepticism across the crypto community. The frenzy began when several popular crypto influencers, including The Crypto Bull, shared a post and portfolio screenshot claiming that BlackRock had added $1.85 billion worth of XRP to its already substantial crypto holdings. Given BlackRock’s significant influence in the crypto space, the idea that the asset manager had invested in XRP seemed like a major signal for institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. The rumors triggered a wave of speculation about the token, with some market participants viewing the alleged purchase as extremely bullish. A closer examination of BlackRock’s actual portfolio, however, shows that the reports were unfounded and lacked any evidence to support them. Data from Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics company, revealed that, contrary to expectations, BlackRock holds just 5.267 XRP, valued at just $10.32—a far cry from the acclaimed $1.85 billion in holdings. The data also showed that the asset manager held the majority of its holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum. BlackRock’s total crypto portfolio is estimated at $82.1 billion, including 784,424 BTC valued at $71.31 billion, 3.494 million ETH worth approximately $10.8 billion, and other assets. Investigations also revealed that the original screenshots, which showed BlackRock owning 911.76 million XRP, had been edited to exaggerate the asset manager’s holdings. This misrepresentation created a temporary buzz, but did not reflect any real investment in the altcoin by the firm. Despite the false alarm, the incident highlights how quickly misinformation can spread in the crypto space, especially when shared by crypto influencers with thousands of followers. The Crypto Bull’s post drew a variety of reactions from the community. Some questioned why XRP’s price had not moved if the reports were accurate, while others remained skeptical, and a few outrightly dismissed the claims. False rumors have become a recurrent theme in the crypto world, and the latest incident with XRP and BlackRock is just one example. This is alson’t the first time false claims have been made about the token. Earlier this month, rumours of a potential Ripple partnership with Amazon spread across the community, sparking speculation about how such a collaboration could positively impact XRP’s price. Similarly, overly optimistic price forecasts can also contribute to misinformation. Some analysts have predicted that XRP could surge to $50,000, fueling unrealistic expectations for investors. In a market predominantly driven by speculation and volatility, it’s important for investors to verify sources and avoid making decisions based on unproven claims.

Some economists and experts say that critical thinking and creativity will be more important than ever in the age of artificial intelligence, when a robot can do much of the heavy lifting in coding or research. Take Benjamin Shiller, the Brandeis economics professor who recently told Fortune that a “weirdness premium” will be valued in the labor market of the future. Alex Karp, the Palantir cofounder and CEO, isn’t one of these voices. “It will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said when asked how AI will affect jobs in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy—I’ll use myself as an example—hopefully, you have some other skill, that one is going to be hard to market.” Karp attended Haverford College, a small, elite liberal arts college outside his hometown of Philadelphia. He earned a JD from Stanford Law School and a PhD in philosophy from Goethe University in Germany. He spoke about his own experience getting his first job. Of his own career, Karp told Fink that he remembered thinking: “I’m not sure who’s going to give me my first job.” The answer echoed past comments Karp has made about certain types of elite college graduates who lack specialized skills. “If you are the kind of person that would’ve gone to Yale, classically high IQ, and you have generalized knowledge but it’s not specific, you’re effed,” Karp said in an interview with Axios in November. Not every CEO agrees with Karp’s assessment that humanities graduates are doomed. BlackRock COO Robert Goldstein told Fortune in 2024 that the company was recruiting graduates who studied “things that have nothing to do with finance or technology.” McKinsey global managing partner Bob Sternfels recently said in an interview with Harvard Business Review that the company is “looking more at liberal arts majors, whom we had deprioritized, as potential sources of creativity,” to break out of AI’s linear problem-solving. Karp has long been an advocate of vocational training over traditional college degrees. Last year, Palantir launched a Meritocracy Fellowship, offering high school students a paid internship with the chance to interview for a full-time position at the end of four months. The company criticized American universities for “indoctrinating” students and having “opaque” admissions that “displaced meritocracy and excellence,” in their announcement of the fellowship. “If you did not go to school, or you went to a school that’s not that great, or you went to Harvard or Princeton or Yale, once you come to Palantir, you’re a Palantirian—no one cares about the other stuff,” Karp said during a Q2 earnings call last year. “I think we need different ways of testing aptitude,” Karp told Fink. He pointed to the former police officer who attended a junior college, who now manages the U.S. Army’s Maven system, a Palantir-made AI tool that processes drone imagery and video. “In the past, the way we tested for aptitude would not have fully exposed how irreplaceable that person’s talents are,” he said. Karp also gave the example of technicians building batteries at a battery company, saying those workers are “very valuable if not irreplaceable because we can make them into something different than what they were very rapidly.” He said what he does all day at Palantir is “figuring out what is someone’s outlier aptitude. Then I’m putting them on that thing and trying to get them to stay on that thing and not on the five other things they think they’re great at.” Karp’s comments come as more employers report a gap between the skills applicants are offering and what employers are looking for in a tough labor market. The unemployment rate for young workers ages 16 to 24 hit 10.4% in December and is growing among college graduates. Karp isn’t too worried, though. “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” he said.

The company is making that possible by adding the BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index as an option in its fixed index annuity, or FIA, portfolio. An FIA is a type of insurance contract designed to provide principal protection with the potential for limited upside growth. The principal is comprised of the payments made to an insurance company. In return, the insurer promises to protect that principal against market declines. And while the gains are linked to an index—usually something like the S&P 500—the policyholder isn't directly invested in the market. So that means returns are typically capped. And if the index goes down, then the policy holder's return for that period would typically be zero instead of negative. This means that the Bitcoin exposure for Delaware Life Insurance Company policyholders will be indirect, since it's access through an ETF inside the index. "As the retirement-planning landscape evolves, we're continuously and thoughtfully innovating to meet the needs of financial professionals and their clients" Colin Lake, president and CEO of Delaware Life marketing, said in a press release. The BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index combines U.S. stocks and Bitcoin and targets 12% volatility. It uses cash adjustments to help offset Bitcoin's price swings. The Bitcoin component comes in with the iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, which had amassed $74.5 billion worth of assets under management by the end of last week. The new index option will be available to policyholders for three of Delaware Life's products: Momentum Growth, Momentum Growth Plus, and DualTrack Income. Since Bitcoin ETFs launched in the U.S. two years ago, Wall Street has found lots of ways to incorporate them. Jefferies issued the first U.S. structured note tied to a Bitcoin ETF in July last year, and Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan have now sold more than $530 million in structured notes linked to IBIT. Life insurance companies have been slow to embrace Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs because of market volatility. Up until now, the interest has been more in using blockchain to streamline back office functions. For example, the Bank of China put 4 million insurance records on a private blockchain in 2019. But the rate of investment in crypto product from insurers took a while to catch on. By 2021, U.S. insurers had invested only $3 million in Grayscale's Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts—before either had been converted into spot ETFs. Late last year, Morgan Stanley broadened crypto exposure for its wealth clients, including those with retirement accounts.

Title: Palantir CEO Says AI Will Somehow Be So Great That People Will Stop Immigrating

Reading time 3 minutes When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. All Palantir CEO Alex Karp has is AI, and boy, is he ready to nail some things down with it. During an appearance at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Karp sat down with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to create a nightmare blunt rotation: two guys who are heavily invested in the military industrial complex and surveillance industry, talking about how great those things are for society. Karp, as he is wont to do lately, made some outlandish statements throughout the half-hour conversation, but perhaps none more eye-popping than his barely complete thought that AI will create so many jobs that there will basically be no reason for anyone to ever immigrate to another country. Asked if AI will destroy or create jobs, Karp started answering the question in a roundabout ramble about how white-collar jobs will get hit, and vocational jobs will thrive. Then, after stating, “Not to diverge into one of my political screeds,” he proceeded to diverge into one of his political screeds. “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training. I do think these trends really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large-scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill,” he said. There are, of course, many reasons that people leave their home country to try to start a life somewhere else, other than job seeking; from political instability and war to environmental dangers (*cough AI*). And there are, of course, many reasons that a country might want to accept immigrants other than the fact that they could contribute to the economyâlike, for instance, believing it a moral imperative to accept people fleeing from political persecution, especially when it was American meddling in foreign affairs that greatly contributed to that instability in the first place. Karp, who at least managed to stay in his seat for the majority of the interview this time, had a lot to say about a lot of things, most seemingly unconnected from whatever the original prompt was. In response to a question about whether the future will require fewer white-collar workers, he somehow landed on his engineers recommending that he stop speaking in public. Obviously, he didn’t take that advice. The incoherence was on full display throughout, with strange asides about how, despite his seeming distaste for higher education, he dreams of going back to grad schoolâbut not for the education, just for the “fun.” At one point, he noted that one of the heads of Palantir’s Maven system, an AI tool meant to be used on the battlefield by the US Army, only completed junior college and declared that he probably didn’t even need that. “Would they been as talented if they had not gone to their college? Yes,” he said, as if whatever talent or intelligence the person has is simply inherent. Maybe Karp believes he truly didn’t pick up any skills through university and was not in any way influenced in how to think, communicate, or understand the world, and he would have come out exactly the same as he is now without setting foot in school. Given that he has a PhD in philosophy, it probably says more about him than his education if he went through all of that coursework without ever challenging his own beliefs. Trying to piece together Karp’s ideas and ideology is a fool’s errand. The thing that seems like he most clearly believes is that he should be successful and rich, and the world should go along with what leads to that outcome.

Title: Strategy just crossed 700k BTC but its “circular” Bitcoin funding loop risks a massive high-yield credit disaster

With its Bitcoin-backed preferred stock, Strategy attracts income tourists, including high-profile institutional investors like BlackRock. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) acquired an additional 22,305 Bitcoin for approximately $2.13 billion between Jan. 12 and Jan. 19, continuing an aggressive accumulation campaign that has absorbed 3.38% of the top crypto's total supply. That works out to 3.55% of the circulating supply of 19.97 million coins. The purchases were executed at an average price of $95,284 per bitcoin, according to a Jan. 20 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The latest acquisition brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 709,715 BTC, a hoard worth roughly $64 billion. The company’s cost basis for the total stack is approximately $53.92 billion, or an average of $75,979 per bitcoin, implying around $10.5 billion in paper gains at current prices. The strategy that transformed MicroStrategy into a corporate Bitcoin giant appears to be hindering its S&P 500 aspirations as market skepticism fuels stock volatility. While the headline number highlights the company’s relentless buying, the mechanics behind the purchase reveal a significant shift in how Strategy funds its operations. These latest acquisitions were funded using proceeds from the firm's at-the-market sales of its Class A common stock (MSTR), its perpetual Stretch preferred stock (STRC), and the Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK). According to the SEC filing, the Michael Saylor-led Strategy sold 10,399,650 MSTR shares for approximately $1.8 billion last week. It still has about $8.4 billion worth of shares to fund future BTC purchases. However, the preferred channel is seeing increased activity. The filing showed Strategy sold 2,945,371 STRC shares for around $294.3 million (with $3.6 billion shares remaining) and 38,796 STRK shares for $3.4 million (with $20.3 billion shares remaining). This increased bet shows that the company's attempt to turn its bitcoin treasury strategy into a repeatable “yield SKU” that can sit quietly in brokerage accounts and income portfolios is yielding significant interest. Notably, this financial engineering has produced four distinct exposure tiers that trade on the Nasdaq exchange. This means investors do not need any BTC know-how to invest, as they can simply buy them through a regular brokerage account. The product lineup is segmented by risk appetite, offering four distinct ways to play the Strategy trade. The headline act is the Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock, or STRC. Marketed explicitly as “short duration high yield credit,” this security currently pays an 11.00% annual dividend in monthly cash installments. Strategy expands its Bitcoin-linked securities, offering innovative options for income-seeking investors to potentially outpace inflation. Unlike a standard bond where market forces dictate the yield, STRC is an issuer-managed product. Strategy retains the policy power to adjust the dividend rate to ensure the stock trades near its $100 par value. Data from STRC.live shows that the firm has accumulated 27,000 BTC from the STRC fundraiser. Below STRC sits a tiered structure of fixed-rate perpetuals. For the investor who wants a piece of the equity upside, there is STRK (“Strike”). It pays an 8% annual dividend and is non-cumulative (meaning missed payments are lost forever). However, it functions as a hybrid, offering convertibility to stock that captures about 40% of the gains if Strategy’s common shares rally. For the risk-averse income seeker, the company offers STRF (“Strife”). This 10% perpetual preferred cannot be converted to stock, but it sits higher in the capital structure. It is cumulative, meaning the company must make up any missed dividend payments later. With $1.6 billion remaining in capacity, it represents the most conservative tier. Crypto analysts liken Strategy's risky dividend plan to historical hedge fund calamities, raising alarms. There is also the STRD (“Stride”) instrument, which matches the 10% yield of STRF but removes the safety net. It is non-cumulative and non-convertible. If Strategy skips a payment, the investor has no recourse, giving STRD the sharpest risk-reward profile among the fixed-rate options. It has $1.4 billion remaining. Meanwhile, the company has even opened a European front. Last November, Strategy introduced the Series A Perpetual Stream Preferred (STRE), a euro-denominated security that carries a 10% annual dividend paid quarterly. This instrument carries sharp teeth regarding non-payment. The dividend is cumulative and increases by 100 basis points per missed period, up to a maximum of 18%. Strategy's financial engineering product list has successfully courted a demographic that typically shuns crypto: the income tourist. Data from several institutional filings show that high-income and preferred-focused funds are populating the STRC holders list. The roster includes the Fidelity Capital & Income Fund (FAGIX), Fidelity Advisor Floating Rate High Income (FFRAX), and the Virtus InfraCap U.S. Preferred Stock ETF (PFFA). Meanwhile, the most striking validation comes from BlackRock. The BlackRock iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF) is a massive fund that tracks an index usually dominated by sleepy bank and utility preferreds. As of Jan. 16, the fund held $14.25 billion in net assets. Inside that conservative portfolio, Strategy’s Bitcoin-linked paper has established a beachhead. The ETF disclosed a position of approximately $210 million in Strategy’s STRC. It holds another ~$260 million across STRF, STRK, and STRD. In total, BlackRock’s ETF exposure to Strategy preferreds sits at roughly $470 million (or 3.3% of the total fund). Valentin Kosanovic, a deputy director at Capital B, views this as a watershed moment for digital credit. According to him: “This is another clear, factual, unquestionable demonstration of the materialization of the wave of institutionalized legacy BTC-pegged financial products.” The machinery required to sustain these dividends creates a unique set of risks. Strategy is not paying these yields from operating profits in the traditional sense. It is funding them through the capital markets. The company’s prospectus for STRC states that cash dividends are expected to be funded primarily through additional capital raising, including at-the-market stock offerings. This creates a circular dependency: Strategy sells securities to buy Bitcoin and then pays dividends on those securities. Considering this, Michael Fanelli, a partner at RSM US, highlighted several risks associated with this model, including Bitcoin price crashes, the lack of insurance coverage, and the fact that the products are unproven in recessions. He also noted that the perpetual products have no maturity date. However, Bitcoin analyst Adam Livingston countered that the products are a “mind-bender” for traditional analysts. He argued that “STRC is quietly turning Strategy into a private central bank for the yield-starved world.” According to him: “STRC is a coupon-bearing ‘credit rail’ that can absorb fixed-income demand, convert it into BTC at scale, then feed the equity premium that makes the next raise easier, cheaper, and faster. That is a flywheel with a bid inside it.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is the Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate and host of the SlateCast. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. European leaders eye U.S. Treasurys as Greenland leverage, risking a one-month yield shock on Americans. As 40-year yields skyrocket past 4%, the sudden evaporation of cheap yen is forcing a messy global reset. NYSE is moving to "continuous" settlement, leaving traditional banking hours in the dust forever. Bitcoin stability is under threat as a diverging "protein stress ratio" reveals hidden economic risks most experts are missing. Card fees can hit 3.5%, but without smooth on-ramps, off-ramps, and compliance, “cheap settlement” stays theoretical.

Title: Bitcoin enters Delaware Life’s retirement annuity portfolio

The product gives retirement investors indirect Bitcoin exposure through a BlackRock index built on the company's spot Bitcoin ETF. Cointelegraph in your social feed Delaware Life Insurance Company is adding limited Bitcoin-linked exposure to its retirement annuity portfolio through an index developed by BlackRock. The insurer will offer an index that blends US stocks with a small, risk-managed allocation to Bitcoin (BTC). The Bitcoin exposure comes through BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, meaning investors do not hold Bitcoin directly. The index combines US equities with managed BTC exposure and applies volatility controls designed to limit fluctuations to about 12%. Delaware Life said the structure allows policyholders to gain indirect exposure to BTC price movements while still preserving their principal under the annuity’s terms. The index will be available across three of Delaware Life’s fixed indexed annuity products. Fixed indexed annuities are insurance-based retirement products that protect the initial investment and offer tax-deferred growth, with returns tied to the performance of a referenced market index rather than direct asset ownership. Delaware Life Insurance Company is a US life insurance and annuity provider focused on retirement products. The company said it surpassed $40 billion in cumulative annuity sales as of November 2025. BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, launched its Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. According to CoinMarketCap data, the fund has a market capitalization of more than $70 billion, making it the largest spot Bitcoin fund. In December, BlackRock said the ETF ranked among the company’s three largest investment themes in 2025.

Meanwhile Group, a company that offers Bitcoin life insurance, launched in June 2023 backed by investors including Sam Altman and Gradient Ventures. In October 2025, the company raised $82 million in a funding round, which it said would be used to support growing demand for Bitcoin-denominated retirement and savings products. Tabit, a Barbados-based insurer, has taken a different approach by using Bitcoin to fund its balance sheet rather than offering crypto-linked insurance products. In March, the company raised $40 million in Bitcoin to back traditional US dollar-denominated property and casualty insurance policies, saying its entire regulatory reserve was held in Bitcoin. Beyond insurance products, US policymakers have moved to expand access to crypto exposure through other retirement vehicles. In August, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing US regulators to expand access to cryptocurrency in 401(k) retirement plans.

Title: Billionaires Gather To Tell World No One Likes Them, But To Please Come Back, They Miss Us

It’s that time of year again. All the billionaires, technocrats, and corporate media shills are gathering in Davos, Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum (WEF) to ask why everyone else in the world despises them. For example, does it ever occur to them that flying private jets into the Swiss ski town, while insisting that the rest of us make consumption changes to fight climate change, is a tremendously stupid display of hypocrisy that will only further erode trust in institutions? (RELATED: Lower-Caste Davos Attendees Left Stranded In Cold During Fyre Fest Of The Alps) Take BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who controls the world’s largest asset management company. Fink is a Davos man, par excellence. He knows why everyone hates the WEF and the 850 CEOs and 65 heads of state who attended, yet still isn’t willing to give it up. France’s President Emmanuel Macron (R) gestures as he speaks next to BlackRock chairman and WEF co-chairman Larry Fink during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 20, 2026.

(Photo by Ludovic MARIN / AFP via Getty Images) Fink acknowledged the deep distrust surrounding the World Economic Forum (WEF), stating Tuesday that for many the annual Davos meeting “feels out of step with the moment: elites in an age of populism, an established institution in an era of deep institutional distrust.” He admitted there is “truth in that critique,” and that the world now “places far less trust in us to help shape what comes next.” He then insisted he would not lead the WEF if he didn’t believe in its potential, but stressed that for it to be “useful going forward, it has to regain that trust.” He conceded that a major failure of the Davos attendees has been their inability to listen to those left behind by globalization. Adding to this concern, the BlackRock CEO warned that Artificial Intelligence “threatens to replay the same pattern,” potentially putting millions out of work while the gains flow “to the owners of models, data, and infrastructure.” The observation is particularly salient considering BlackRock itself is a significant investor in AI data centers and infrastructure.

(Photo by INA FASSBENDER / AFP via Getty Images) The decline of public trust stems from fundamental issues that Fink failed to address, such as the total financialization of the economy, the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs, forever wars, and corporate bailouts. Rebuilding trust will not be achieved through more WEF gatherings, cheap rhetoric, non-profits, or data sheets. Instead, trust can only be restored when leaders are held accountable for the detrimental policies they impose on the public. It requires high-profile climate activists to stop using private jets and demands that those at the top have skin in the game. If you’re a billionaire who’s worried about carbon emissions, book your next flight on economy with the rest of us proles. Without skin in the game and real consequences for those in power, institutions — including governments, banks, and universities — will continue to exploit the average citizen across the globe, not just in this decade, but in decades to come.

Title: Satya Nadella’s biggest AI bubble warning yet is a challenge to the Fortune 500: it’s time to reinvent the knowledge worker
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/20/is-ai-a-bubble-satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo-new-knowledge-worker-davos-fink/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T18:35:08Z
Full Content:
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been leading the charge on artificial intelligence for years, owing to his long alliance with OpenAI’s Sam Altman and the groundbreaking work from his own AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, particularly with the Copilot tool. But Nadella has not spoken often about the fears that rattled Wall Street for much of the back half of 2025: whether AI is a bubble. At the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella sat down for a conversation with the forum’s interim co-chair, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, explaining that if AI growth spawns solely from investment, then that could be a sign of a bubble. “A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” However, Nadella offers a fix to that productivity dilemma, calling on business leaders to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.” This change is not wholly unprecedented, as Nadella pointed out, comparing the current moment to that of the 1980s, when computing revolutionized the workplace and opened up new opportunities for growth and productivity and created a new class of workers. “We invented this entire class of thing called knowledge work, where people started really using computers to amplify what we were trying to achieve using software,” he said. “I think in the context of AI, that same thing is going to happen.” Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “No, no, it’s actually—it flattens the entire information flow. So once you start having that, you have to redesign structurally.” That shift may be harder for some Fortune 500 companies as structural changes could be accompanied by uncomfortable growing pains. Nadella says that leaner companies will be able to more easily adopt AI because their organizational structures are fresher and more malleable. On the other hand, large companies could take time to adopt new workflows. Despite widespread adoption of AI, the 29th edition of PwC’s Global CEO Survey found that only 10% to 12% of companies reported seeing benefits from the technology on the revenue or cost side, while 56% reported getting nothing out of it. It follows up on an even more pessimistic finding about AI returns from August 2025: that 95% of generative AI pilots were failing. PwC global chairman Mohamed Kande spoke to Fortune’s Diane Brady at Davos about the finding that many CEOs are cautious and lack confidence at this stage of the AI adoption cycle. “Somehow AI moves so fast … that people forgot that the adoption of technology, you have to go to the basics,” he explained, with the survey finding that the companies seeing benefits from AI are “putting the foundations in place.” It’s about execution more than it is about technology, he argued, and good management and leadership are really going to matter going forward. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools.” New entrants have the advantage of “starting fresh” and constructing workflows around AI capabilities, while larger firms will have to contend with the flattening effect AI has on entire departments and specializations. To be sure, Nadella says that large organizations have kept an upper hand, especially when it comes to relationships, data, and know-how. However, he maintains that firms must understand how to use those resources to their advantage to change management style, which could otherwise pose a major roadblock. “The bottom line is, if you don’t translate that with a new production function, then you really will be stuck,” he said .

Title: No Company ‘Can Just Coast’ in the A.I. Era, Warns Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella

No corporation, big or small, can avoid the challenges of adapting to A.I., according to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Larger corporations will be forced to integrate the technology to ward off newcomers, while smaller players must contend with barriers to achieving scale. “It’s going to be a very competitively intense world,” said Nadella during an interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, today (Jan. 20). “Neither side, whether you’re a new entrant or an incumbent, can just coast.” Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. In some ways, it may be easier for newer, smaller competitors to accommodate A.I.’s pervasiveness, since they can build their organizations with the technology in mind from the outset. Bigger and more established rivals, meanwhile, will be forced to navigate sweeping organizational change. “Unless your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools,” said Nadella. For now, large companies appear to have the edge. Across corporations with annual revenues exceeding $15 billion, nearly three-quarters of leaders said their organizations are using A.I. on an enterprise-wide basis, compared with just 22 percent of executives at companies with revenues of between $1 billion and $4.9 billion, according to a recent study from Forbes Research. But the disruptive effects of adopting A.I. also grow as companies scale. Most leaders at smaller firms predicted that fewer than 2 percent of roles would be eliminated by the technology over the next few years, compared with 45 percent of executives at larger corporations. It isn’t just companies that A.I. will help equalize, but countries as well. The quality of software developers, startups and large-scale organizations does not vary dramatically from nation to nation, according to Nadella. “It’s fascinating—you can show up in Jakarta, you can show up in Istanbul, you can show up in Mexico City. It’s not that different than showing up even in say Seattle or San Francisco,” Nadella said. The growing accessibility of A.I. has fueled its global spread. Still, Western countries—and in particular the U.S.—retain “more of an energy” when it comes to embracing the technology, said Nadella. As A.I. continues to integrate across societies and economies, the size of a corporation—and the country in which it’s located—will matter less and less. What will matter more, Nadella suggested, is how much control companies maintain over A.I. systems that incorporate their proprietary knowledge. If companies fail to embed that data, they risk “leaking” enterprise value to outside model developers, Nadella noted, describing this as an emerging competitive concern. “The topic that’s least talked about, but I feel will be most talked about in this calendar year, will be the sovereignty of a firm,” said Nadella. “It’s sort of fascinating that nobody’s talking about that.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: BlackRock’s billionaire CEO warns AI could be capitalism’s next big failure after 30 years of unsustainable inequality after the Cold War
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/20/blackrock-billionaire-ceo-larry-fink-capitalism-critique-ai-world-economic-forum-davos/

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink opened the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with a stark message to the global elite: AI’s unfettered growth risks pummelling the world’s working and professional classes. Beyond that, he warned that it could be capitalism’s next big failure after a 30-year reign after the Cold War that has failed to deliver for the average human being in society. In his opening remarks on Tuesday at the gathering of thousands of executives and global leaders, the billionaire boss of the world’s largest asset manager—often called one of Wall Street’s “Masters of the Universe”—said that as those in power discuss the future of AI, they risk leaving behind the vast majority of the world, just as they have for much of the last generation. “Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more wealth has been created than in any time prior in human history, but in advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain,” Fink said. Fink, who has used his annual BlackRock letters and annual appearances at Davos to set the agenda for a more progressive kind of capitalism, even one that is arguably “woke,” making him at times the face of ESG and of stakeholder capitalism, warned that the gains of the tremendous wealth creation since the 1990s have not been equitably shared. And the capitalist ideology driving AI development and implementation forward could come at the expense of the wage-earning majority, he added. “Early gains are flowing to the owners of models, owners of data and owners of infrastructure,” Fink said. “The open question: What happens to everyone else if AI does to white-collar workers what globalization did to blue-collar workers? We need to confront that today directly. It is not about the future. The future is now.” Fink, who was appointed interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab, has long espoused the reshaping of capitalism, seeing it as a responsibility of large asset managers like himself. Fink was formerly vociferous about the importance of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing, and has argued that climate change is reshaping finance, creating an imperative for executives to reallocate their capital to address the crisis accordingly. In a 2022 letter to investors, published the day before the Davos summit, Fink emphasized a model of “stakeholder capitalism” of a business’s mandate to serve not just shareholders, but employees, consumers, and the public. Fink’s new primacy in Davos is the first without Schwab, following allegations that he had expensed more than $1 million, billed to the World Economic Forum, on questionable travel spending, as well as claims of workplace misconduct and research report manipulation. The BlackRock chief emphasized the need for the gathering to demonstrate its legitimacy in part by showing that it’s concerned with more than just swelling growth of companies and countries, but also the economic welfare of its employees and citizens. “Many of the people most affected by what we talk about here will never come to this conference,” Fink said. “That’s a central tension of this forum. Davos is an elite gathering trying to shape a world that belongs to everyone.” Though BlackRock announced in early 2025 it would roll back many of the diversity, equity, and inclusion goals it created a few years before, Fink has once again used his spotlight to call on leaders to transform their capitalist sensibilities, this time in how they imagine the AI future. Last year capped an explosion of growth in the AI sector, with Morningstar analysts finding a group of 34 AI stocks, including Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, shot up 50.8% in 2025. AI firms and investors have seen their wealth skyrocket in the past year, with Per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the median increase in net worth last year was nearly $10 billion among the 50 wealthiest Americans. Google co-founder Larry Page and Sergey Brin, for example, got $101 billion and $92 billion richer, respectively, in 2025. The BlackRock CEO noted these gains, however, have been reserved for the richest few, alluding to a K-shaped economy of the rich getting richer, while the poor continue to struggle: The bottom half of Americans, in short, are not cashing in on the AI race. Although Fink didn’t get into the politics of utilities setting electricity prices, it seems the poor are actually paying higher bills to support the data centers powering the AI boom. According to Federal Reserve data, the poorer demographic owns about 1% of stock market wealth, translating to about 165 million people owning $628 billion in stock. Conversely, the top 1% of wealthiest households own nearly 50% of corporate equity. Fink’s framing of the post-Cold War era as one of exploding inequality represents a mainstreaming of a once niche view that has become increasingly mainstream in the 21st century. While the triumph of the west over communism was seen as the ultimate victory for capitalism, as epitomized by Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man, history has in fact continued. The unprecedented rise of China as an economic superpower, through its fusion of socialism and capitalism “with Chinese characteristics,” has complicated the narrative, as has the inequality alluded to by Fink. An internal critic of the post-Cold War world order is Andrew Bacevich, a military veteran and historian who likened the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 as “akin to removing the speed limiter from an internal combustion engine.” Bacevich’s 2020 book The Age of Illusions: How America Squandered Its Cold War Victory, was an early articulation of the once niche viewpoint that Fink lent support to on Tuesday. Similarly, the risks of the AI boom on workers extends beyond who has a stake in the technology industry’s growth. Nobel laureate and “godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton has previously warned this explosion of wealth for the few will come at the expense of white-collar workers, who will be displaced by the technology. “What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” Hinton said in September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.” Some companies have already leaned into culling headcount to grow profits, including enterprise-software firm IgniteTech. CEO Eric Vaughan laid off nearly 80% of his staff in early 2023, according to figures reviewed by Fortune. Vaughan said the reductions happened during an inflection point in the tech industry, where failure to efficiently adopt AI could be fatal for a company. He’s since rehired for all of those roles, and he would make the same choice again today, he told Fortune. According to Fink, sustaining a white-collar workforce will depend on the world’s most powerful people creating an actionable plan that will defy the critiques of capitalism that has, so far, stood to predominantly benefit them. “Now with abstractions about the jobs of tomorrow, but with a credible plan for broad participation in these gains, this is going to be the test,” Fink said. “Capitalism can evolve to turn more people into owners of growth, instead of spectators watching it happen.”

Title: Trump may name Jerome Powell’s replacement at Davos: Meet the top 4 candidates for Fed Chair

Between the usual panels and buzzier geopolitical debates grabbing headlines, the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, is playing host to a high-stakes drama: Who will emerge as the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and on what terms? President Donald Trump is nearing an announcement on who should lead the Federal Reserve once Jerome Powell’s term ends in May, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and speculation is growing that Trump could do so during his Davos address on Wednesday. Although Trump has claimed for weeks that he already knows his pick, he has appeared to relish turning what is typically a staid confirmation process into a political spectacle—what some analysts have likened to a Celebrity Apprentice–style reveal. What began as showmanship has now evolved into a full-blown institutional standoff among the Justice Department, members of the Senate, and jittery financial markets parsing every hint about whether the next Fed chair will lean dovish or hawkish. The search process has been upended by a Department of Justice investigation into Chair Powell, centered on renovations at the Federal Reserve’s headquarters. Powell has publicly decried the investigation as a “pretext” for political intimidation, a sentiment echoed by a bipartisan coalition of former Fed chairs and sitting GOP senators. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has already signaled a potential blockade, vowing to oppose any nominee until the DOJ investigation is fully resolved. This move could prevent Trump’s pick from even reaching a floor vote, at least in the foreseeable future. For much of the past year, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett appeared to be the natural heir apparent. A veteran of Republican economic policymaking and a key architect of the 2017 tax overhaul, Hassett enjoys credibility with GOP lawmakers and Fed officials alike. Yet his prominence inside the Trump administration has become a liability. Hassett has emerged as one of the White House’s most visible economic messengers, frequently defending administration policy on television. He’s good at that unsavory job, Trump said on Friday, and the president is afraid of “losing him” in that position. “I’m saying, ‘Wait a minute, if I move him, these Fed guys—certainly the one we have now—they don’t talk much,’” Trump said to reporters at a White House event, then addressed Hassett, who was listening in the audience. “I would lose you. It’s a serious concern to me.” Analysts suggest the move reflects a pragmatic calculation by the administration; given the toxic environment surrounding the Powell investigation, Hassett’s close political ties to the president might have made him an impossible sell for a Senate Banking Committee determined to reassert the Fed’s institutional independence. Markets were unhappy about the potential loss of a clear Fed dove, however, and the 10-year Treasury closed on a four-month high Friday. As Hassett’s path narrows, attention has increasingly shifted back to Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who led the forced takeovers and bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis before publicly breaking with Chair Ben Bernanke over quantitative easing, in which the Fed creates money to buy bonds to push down interest rates. Warsh is widely viewed by markets as the “independence candidate,” hawkish on inflation, skeptical of political pressure, and institutionally orthodox. The more toxic the Powell investigation becomes, the stronger Warsh’s appeal grows among senators eager to reassert the Fed’s credibility. He was in the final running for Fed chair against Powell in 2017, and while he was praised (many times) by Trump for his good looks, he was ultimately passed up because of his relative youth.In the second Trump term, Warsh is not only 55, but has seen his main dogmas grow more in vogue. His famous slogan, “Inflation is a choice,” refers to his belief that the Fed raises interest rates when the economy “grows too much” and workers “get paid too much,” rather than owing to real inflation. He has warned for years that the government’s $38 trillion debt is influencing the Fed’s decision-making, incentivizing it to keep interest rates artificially low to reduce the cost of servicing the debt. Now that many economists and politicians have begun warning of “fiscal dominance,” Warsh’s views might be palatable to the markets and his potential fellow Fed governors. But if Warsh is also considered too political, Trump may turn to a quieter option, Christopher Waller. A sitting Fed governor with a reputation for accurate forecasting, Waller is seen by many as the technocratic fallback: less politically exposed, less polarizing, and potentially easier to confirm. When a group of CEOs at a recent Yale event responded to a live poll about who they wanted for Fed chair, 81% chose Waller. That’s likely because Waller has consistently argued for more rate cuts, with little evidence he is politically captured. That ability to thread the needle is more important now than ever. Markets might rejoice if Trump announces BlackRock executive Rick Rieder as the dark-horse pick. The only person on the short list with no Fed experience—something considered a positive in the administration—Rieder oversees $2.4 trillion in bonds as BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income. He has also vocally called for a lower neutral interest rate, noting that AI gains will be disinflationary and that the Fed’s challenge now is to avoid “labor potholes.” As the Davos summit begins, the focus remains on the “two Kevins” and the looming decision that will define the American economy for the latter end of the Trump era. If Trump does use his Davos address to name Jerome Powell’s successor, the pick would still need to get past the Senate Banking Committee to make it to the floor for a vote. If the DOJ investigation doesn’t get resolved, Trump might not be able to get anyone through the GOP coalition on the banking committee that is standing by Powell. But investors are betting that Powell will not be indicted, and Justice Department official Jeanine Pirro, who apparently spearheaded the investigation, has softened her posture slightly, writing on X that the matter is just a question of Powell responding to Justice Department “outreach.”

"You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill," Karp said, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market. The Palantir CEO said it would probably be possible for those with humanities backgrounds to keep a job once they secure it, but he said technicians and those with other vocational skill sets are going to be in the highest demand. He gave the example of people building batteries for a battery company, saying that "they're very valuable, if not irreplaceable, because we can make them into something different than what they were very rapidly." "There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training," Karp told Fink. But not all at Davos agree with the tech leader's assessment of the future of jobs. Finance executives attending the global forum have been telling Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco that liberal arts degrees might be the new hot commodity. As AI takes on more of the hard financial analysis, it is transforming the skill set executives prioritize in young recruits. Critical creative thinkers are back in the spotlight. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei also weighed in on jobs during a joint panel on Tuesday, saying that entry-level hiring at their companies was already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down in both the junior and mid-levels of his company. Jump to

Title: Explaining the Japanese bond-market rebellion that has the whole world on edge

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump's latest threats to hike tariffs on major European economies are shaking up markets on Tuesday, but a surge in Japanese bonds yields is also weighing on investor sentiment. Japanese 40-year bond yields surged to 4.2% on Tuesday from 3.94% on Monday — the first time ever they've crossed the 4% mark. Yields started the year at 3.6%. Rates on 30- and 20-year bonds have also spiked. In a note to clients on Tuesday, Jeffrey Favuzza, an equities trader at Jefferies, called the Tuesday sell-off a two-standard-deviation move lower. When yields rise, bond prices fall. What's behind the volatility? A potential pause on food taxes. On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called a snap parliamentary election set to be held on February 8. Takaichi's goal is to gain more support for her agenda — which includes a proposed 2-year break from the 8% tax on food products — in the new parliament. The news has been too much for investors to swallow. Japan's government debt levels have already been a concern for markets, and investors fear such a tax holiday would exacerbate an already shaky fiscal situation. As of 10:30 am ET, the S&P 500 was down 1.16%, while the Nikkei 225 had fallen 1.11%. Meanwhile, gold, which investors have increasingly seen as a hedge to the threat of global fiat currency debasement, was up 3.3%. The Japanese bond turmoil was part of a one-two punch battering markets, along with Donald Trump's increasingly aggressive rhetoric on Greenland. "These moves highlight the extent to which investors are souring on this snap election that is promising a food sales tax holiday, which will only make a bad fiscal situation worse," David Rosenberg, the founder of Rosenberg Research, said in a note on Tuesday. "Since Takaichi took office in October, longer-term interest rates have jumped +80 basis points, with obvious spillover effects across the globe." Rising Japanese bond yields have an impact on broader markets because of the country's outsize influence on global capital flows. Both domestic and foreign investors have used low yields to lever up positions in higher-yielding assets like US Treasurys and stocks. With yields surging, Japanese investors could pivot away from US bond markets and simply buy domestic government debt. It also revives fears of an unwind of the "carry trade." Concerns about the carry trade have been on display in recent years, as investors fear an unwind of levered positions amid rising Japanese yields. Yields on 30-year US Treasurys rose to 4.9% on Tuesday from 4.84% on Monday. Generally, higher long-term government bond yields tend to hurt equity performance as investors can get attractive returns on risk-free assets. How things develop in Japan in the days ahead should be top of mind for investors, said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, in a note on Tuesday. "On a quieter data week, we are looking at what global flash PMIs say about global activity. Otherwise, the focus is on Japan where the expected snap election may pave the way for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to pursue looser fiscal policy and add more pressure to global long-term bond yields," Boivin and his team wrote. There are plenty of other things happening this week for investors to keep an eye on, too. For one, Trump is speaking in Davos on Wednesday, perhaps offering another update to his approach to acquiring Greenland from Denmark. Trump may also join G7 leaders for dinner in Paris on Thursday, per an invite from French President Emmanuel Macron. Michigan Consumer Sentiment data is also out on Friday, which could provide a window into whether renewed tariff uncertainty is weighing on Americans' economic outlook. Jump to

Title: Disney Reverses Exclusion of Shareholder Proposal to Review Controversial Disability Access Pass Changes
URL: https://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-reverses-exclusion-of-shareholder-proposal-to-review-controversial-disability-access-pass-changes/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T16:23:02Z
Full Content:
Last month, we reported on a new proposal made on behalf of DAS Defenders calling on the Walt Disney Company to conduct an independent and public review of its controversial Disability Access Service policy changes. This resolution was originally excluded from shareholder consideration, but now Disney is reversing course and including it in its proxy materials for a vote. Here’s the latest on that, what it means and doesn’t, and why this is happening. As quick background, Disney overhauled DAS at Walt Disney World and Disneyland back in May 2024. According to the company, the changes were due in large part to abuse, misuse, and proliferation of the program’s use–with issuances of DAS tripling from 2019 to last year. For more about the specifics of the overhauled DAS, see Disability Access Service (DAS) Changes at Walt Disney World FAQ. The new system has now been in place for well over a year, and there have been direct impacts for disabled guests as well as indirect ones for all guests. To the latter point, we’ve written a lot about the impact of the DAS changes on wait times at Walt Disney World. Most recently, in Is Lightning Lane Multi Pass Still “Worth It” at Disney World? Suffice to say, standby lines are shorter and faster moving, with wait times being lower year-over-year as a result of the DAS crackdown. Even over 18 months later, the DAS overhaul remains controversial. It’s also a sensitive subject that is personal since it’s make or break for some guests trying to experience Walt Disney World and Disneyland. There have been reports of guests who previously had DAS being denied and advised to use alternative accommodations instead. here have also been a number of small tweaks to DAS over the last year, some of which could be attributed to a pending class action lawsuit. With that background out of the way, let’s turn to the shareholder proposal. Our previous coverage of this confused some readers, and the latest wrinkle is only going to compound that confusion (just look at that headline–quite the mouthful). Accordingly, we’re going to try to simplify and condense this to the greatest extent possible. Here goes nothing… Disney’s brand and financial stability are under strain from underperforming films, rising park costs, consumer boycotts, and waning trust. According to the resolution, a significant contributor to this strain is the company’s recent overhaul of disability accommodations at its parks due to negative media coverage, social media, guests canceling trips and Annual Passes, as well as legal exposure to a class action lawsuit. As a result of the controversial DAS changes, Disney exposed itself to legal claims, regulatory scrutiny, and brand damage. Other companies have faced multimillion-dollar settlements under accessibility-related actions. Future liabilities could include costly settlements, operational disruption, and weakened market positioning. Accordingly, shareholder resolution requests that Disney commission an independent review of DAS, conducted by a qualified third party. This review should assess legal, financial, and reputational risks; evaluate Disney’s policies against competitors; and identify opportunities for improvement. The resolution further requests a public summary on the findings for accountability and transparency. In its original response letter from late last year, the Walt Disney Company wrote that it intended to exclude the aforementioned shareholder proposal from the proxy materials for its 2026 annual meeting of shareholders. This meant that shareholders would not vote on whether to approve the resolution for the independent review. Disney also sought assurance of no enforcement action from the SEC following the exclusion. Disney’s argument for exclusion was that any attendance decrease in the last fiscal year was attributable to hurricanes. Moreover, park operations are ordinary business and not subject to shareholder micromanagement; that they’ve already done their due diligence on the DAS changes, and there’s no duty to disclose any nonpublic information. You can read Disney’s full argument here. Fast forward to January 2026, and Disney has sent a new letter to the SEC withdrawing its no-action request, meaning that they no longer are seeking any assurances from the SEC. The reason they’re doing this is simple: because they’ve reversed course and decided to include the aforementioned shareholder proposal in their proxy materials for the 2026 annual meeting. If you’re confused, you’re probably not alone. Here’s what this does and doesn’t mean, along with some quick commentary… For starters, this does NOT mean that the Walt Disney Company has suddenly had a change of heart and is agreeing with the shareholder proposal in any way, shape, or form. It does not mean they have agreed to the independent audit being sought. If that were the case, this would be a different letter entirely; probably a joint statement from Disney and the shareholder (or the advocacy group behind him) indicating that the parties are moving forward with collaborative and constructive efforts on reviewing the DAS changes and current policies. That sort of thing. Instead, what Disney is saying is that they’re going to let shareholders vote on whether to conduct such a review. This shareholder proposal will almost certainly be voted down. One of the reader misconceptions in response to our previous coverage was that this proposal was being driven by investors concerned about the impact of the DAS changes on the company’s financials. It’s probably better viewed as a subset of shareholders framing an issue that’s personally important to them in such a way to make it appropriate for proxy vote; a different angle for contesting the DAS changes, aside from litigation. Anyone who has listened to the annual meetings knows that there are a lot of politically-charged and niche causes presented. All of them are summarily shot down without much in the way of further discussion. As a Disney shareholder, I could write a proposal about how the company’s refusal to reimagine Journey into Imagination has resulted in financial strain, underperformance, unrealized earnings, social media backlash, and brand damage. I could cite things like popcorn bucket, merchandise sales, and DTB blog posts in support of my position. It would be a more ‘legitimate’ way of raising the issue (as opposed to during the Q&A), but it would be an equally futile effort. There’s no reason to believe the fate of this DAS proposal will be any different. While we strongly believe Disney should do a better job at finding a middle ground and have a more delicate touch in handling DAS, it’s hard to see this as something with which shareholders will concern themselves. One important thing to keep in mind here is that it’s not the individual shareholders who are outcome-determine on things like this. It won’t be plugged-in fans who are sympathetic to the plight of disabled guests casting the deciding votes. It’s the large institutional ones who are make or break. And although Disney’s stock has underperformed for the last several years, that’s definitely not attributable to the theme parks. If anything, the parks are what is carrying the company and preventing that share price from dipping well below $100. As we’ve covered in earnings call reports and crowds coverage, attendance was down year-over-year (by about 1%), but that was largely attributable to hurricanes ($120 million disclosed losses). Meanwhile, the parks continue to set revenue records and hotel occupancy continues to rise. Right or wrong, that’s what matters to shareholders. Simply put, institutional investors like BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity are not going to concern themselves with this. It will be deemed too trivial, and they will accept Disney’s arguments that were laid out above. The shareholder proposal will fail, and it won’t even be a close vote. Given that, the more curious question from my perspective is why Disney even bothered to exclude the shareholder proposal in the first place? One particularly astute commenter, Jack, offered this explanation in response on the previous post: First, they’ll have to draft a response in their proxy statement as to why shareholders should vote no on the campaign. This opens up its own can of worms – if they make a material misstatement, they could be liable for false/misleading proxy materials. The legal due diligence to prevent such an error probably isn’t cheap either. Second, letting the proposal come to vote is far more “public” than asking the SEC to issue a no-action letter. Most Disney tourists and media outlets aren’t going to search through EDGAR to see Disney’s request for non-enforcement from the SEC on this proposal (you are the exception that proves the rule, of course). But I could certainly see far more media attention on this issue if it came up during the annual shareholder meeting. Moreover, they’d be “on the record” as well. Disney can’t just point to Wall Street and say that businessmen voted against the proposal: Disney is the one *telling Wall Street* to vote against it! Finally, allowing the proposal to move forward would draw more attention to the DAS Defenders and activists proposals in general. As it stands, Disney is taking the position that this proposal isn’t even worth voting on – it’s shareholder micromanagement, substantially overlapping with current plans to review DAS access, etc. If Disney actually responded to the proposal in the proxy statement, it almost legitimizes the opposition. Disney, with its history of hostile activist campaigns since the ’80s and especially recently with Trian, likely doesn’t want to give even one inch here lest other shareholder activists get any ideas about taking a mile. I found this explanation to be persuasive at the time (and largely still do). Although the no-action request drew some media attention (including from the mainstream), more eyeballs will certainly be on the annual shareholder meeting. At the same time, there are always a lot of shareholder proposals that are quickly shot down and I seldom (if ever?) see coverage of those. It’s easy to zone out during that section of the call, as anyone who has ever listened can likely tell you. The signal to noise ratio is not so hot during that portion of the meeting. Regardless, it’s odd for Disney to reverse course at this point. Attention has now been drawn to an (likely doomed) shareholder proposal twice, and theoretically will again once the annual meeting rolls around. It makes me wonder what change happened in the background over the course of the last month. UPDATE: As KenMH pointed out in the comments to this post, the SEC issued a Statement Regarding the Division of Corporation Finance’s Role in the Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 Process for the Current Proxy Season on November 17, 2025. With this, the SEC has determined to not respond to no-action requests for, and express no views on, companies’ intended reliance on any basis for exclusion of shareholder proposals. That statement was made 10 days after Disney submitted its no-action letter, so Disney wouldn’t have known of that position when making the request. Basically, this means that the Walt Disney Company is not going to get a response from the SEC with regard to its no-action letter. On this same basis, many other companies have withdrawn their no-action requests, presumably due to the legal uncertainty of them (just look at all of the “withdrawn” parentheticals here). That’s the simplest and most straightforward for this reversal; that Disney is taking the certainty of the proposal being shot down by shareholders over the risk of an enforcement action resulting from excluding it without the backing of the SEC. My guess is that Disney’s proxy response will say as little as possible (for the reasons Jack laid out), likely just reiterating the ground covered in their original letter to the SEC. That’s probably all the convincing it’ll take for BlackRock, Vanguard, etc. Ultimately, we do not anticipate any major changes to DAS at Walt Disney World or Disneyland. Nor do we view there being any likelihood of success with the shareholder proposal. There is not going to be another overhaul to Disability Access Service, absent the aforementioned class action lawsuit or other litigation prevailing. That happening is also doubtful. Disney has been sued over every single iteration of its disability accommodations, and I’ve yet to find any record of them losing on any count. I can’t see anything different about this lawsuit; if anything, Disney might be able to better argue that lines and crowds are inherent to the theme park experience. The company has already endured a lengthy PR hit over these changes, there’s no chance they’ll voluntarily endure that again with another overhaul. What, if anything, does happen will be a slow trickle of rule relaxations. But with no major changes in the last several months, even that is now looking increasingly unlikely. We’ll conclude by once again reiterating our position that Disney should work towards improving DAS. Just because we believe this shareholder proposal is almost certain to fail doesn’t mean we don’t think Disney should take a second-look at its DAS policies. They should. The company has an exemplary reputation for guest service. The need for DAS reform was absolutely understandable, as there was rampant abuse exacerbated by social media, entitlement, and Disney creating an incentive for DAS scammers by monetizing line-skipping via Lightning Lanes. There have been heartbreaking stories of DAS denials, and these have made clear that a more flexible and humane approach offering greater discretion to Cast Members is optimal. It seems that Disney went too far with the DAS overhaul; the pendulum swung from one extreme to another. There has been a lot of collateral damage among disabled guests who needed DAS and have been denied under the overly-stringent system. The DAS changes haven’t just eradicated the scammers, they have hurt guests who are actually disabled. It’s time to recalibrate from the extremes to the center. The most obvious change we’d like to see is a “humanizing” of the interview, not just expanded rules and policies for the mechanics of that process. We’ve heard from many readers who have been denied, and there’s a word that has been used repeatedly to describe the process: interrogation. While we can appreciate how stressful this process is for Cast Members and the verbal abuse they take for disgruntled guests, there’s a better way of handling the process that feels less adversarial. Even if the letter of the DAS policies isn’t going to change, the company still should live up to its reputation by finding a gentler way to handle the process. Planning a Walt Disney World trip?

Thoughts on the shareholder proposal for an independent review of DAS changes at Walt Disney World and Disneyland? Hopeful that further changes will be made that result in increased approvals for those who truly need DAS while keeping abuse low? Agree or disagree with our assessment of the changes or policy as a whole? Please try to stay on topic–we’ve noticed some of these DAS comments sections get heated and personal. Discuss the policy itself, not others’ use (or lack thereof) of it. This one will take a lot of “thinking out of the box” ideas. In my work place, whenever a particularly sticky problem comes up, the boss assembles a team of folks impacted by the problem and everyone is encouraged to throw out ideas including any that seem DOA. In these brainstorming sessions all ideas are treated equally, recorded and no one is allowed to make fun of any ideas put forth regardless of what you may personally think of them. But frequently, one of those DOA ideas puts a “spark of imagination” into the situation and helps lead to the best answer. So, with that in mind, I’ll start with this one: How about designated day(s) on certain weeks or months that ONLY those that qualify for DAS and their families can attend X park? I certainly could plan my trip around those if known well in advance. And those that qualify for DAS are still welcomed into the other parks on that day but not afforded most of these accommodations? What else can you come up with. Let’s give the Disney folks something to mull over. Honestly in my opinion I feel Disney went overboard with the DAS changes. My philosophy has always been you don’t make radical changes in a policy because people are following it . You should be figuring out who exactly is t following the rules. There are significant changes that affect the actual disabled person negatively . The cap being only four people can be on the DAS ticket is silly . There are plenty of families where mom and dad bring the kids and there are more than two. That’s just wrong. Also there’s no setting up rides in advance anymore you have to be in the park to make inly one choice of a ride. Then waiting ten minutes after you swipe in for your ride to get another one. Generally you are in line or on the ride and it’s impossible to get on your phone and try to prepare your next ride. Most of this doesn’t affect us as our daughter is an adult and we only bring her. However, it does make it difficult to enjoy any more than two to three rides. She cannot tolerate being in the park long so it’s very difficult . The changes made to DAS were supposed to identify abusers but it also is penalizing disabled people . I have to agree with the comment that many accommodations were thought up in a different time- when you didn’t see half the attendees at the park qualifying with a disability and bringing their entire family in tow. Even if we ignore that gen z 53% stat – you can just add up general population percentages for some major diagnoses (autism, ADHD, anaphylaxis allergies, IBD, etc) and without much trouble you’re right up in the 30-40% range before looking at things like PTSD and anxiety. I would love the idea of a sensory waiting area – but that gets back to a combination of things people don’t want to say and things that they are already complaining about- the drama at the moment with the current situation is that people are saying it’s only autism that qualifies, so if you made the accommodation something that only addressed the needs of a specific stereotype of autism, we haven’t made progress. People want the freedom to do whatever with that wait time. (need and want, but it’s VERY individual) Penning them into a dark quiet room with half the park with the same pass is no better than leaving them in line. It begs the question of what about those of us who NEED that time for the bathroom? NEED to eat on a schedule, NEED to be away from the smells, the foods, etc. The people who see it as fair use and a need to go nap and return for their ride? It would be a massive endeavor significantly altering the business model (the amount of space would be mindboggling) and still nobody would be happy with it. You would now have a dark, sensory room crammed to the gills with screaming children waiting with their sibling who create the exact environment people in the room were escaping in the first place. There obviously isn’t an easy answer, but the reality that there IS significant data that giving a “do whatever with your time without waiting in the physical line” pass to everyone with a disability is an unreasonable tax on park operations and is unsustainable for not only everyone without the pass, but also for those who had the strongest need for it. It must be acknowledged that can be both unfair that people who are uncomfortable with a line are stuck in a line, and also unfair that the alternative asks others to wait in a line that takes 4x as long so that others don’t have to wait in the line. It might become more equitable if they could work out a system that considered usage – because when someone with a DAS can ride multiple times what a non-DAS user can in the same time, that is not equal. Then you get into it not being fair to limit the disabled group when others aren’t “limited” but the reality is the non-DAS group is in every practical way limited BY those using the DAS due to their lowered capability to accomplish the same tasks. We need DAS to return. The return time is important but especially with DAS Pass. The best part of DAS is that I receive a return time but I do not have to return at that particular time. I can come back anytime up until park closes. Yes, I can not get another pass until this one is used but it allows me to go on mine train when I feel I can without any issues. (Epileptic) I continue to go to WDW several times a year for the love of Walt Disney himself. My last trip a week ago was not able to get on anything. I have another trip planed in March at the BC and I know I will not get on anything again. Yes, I still have the shows. It is my hope that the powers to be will come up with something even if it is one ride per day. George MC My autistic son just got denied to get the DAS since the third party Health representative at the guest services decided that she can not give it to him unless he goes into the que inside Disneyland and if he gets a panic attack then she might consider. We have all the reports of his neurological assessment and a proof that he has autism, epilepsy, and severe anxiety, in addition to social disorder, still, she said that she can Not see his medical record and Does not want to read them.:” he doesn’t qualify for DAS. “He gets panic attacks around people especially in crowds and ques, yet he loves Disneyland. We always had the privilege to get him a DAS at Disney where he gets the best time of his life. After spending 3-7 pm ( 4 hrs) today asking for different managers, at the guest services, they all said that she is the one who decides on whether he qualifies or not. I am really heart-broken, we have booked the annual non-refundable magic passes, only to go back home with a mental and emotional breakdown. Thank you truly for writing that article, it is meant to be for me today. Disneyland is Not the Happiest Place On Earth Anymore. It is discriminatory, where families of special needs kids feel left out and never ever would make the same mistake of purchasing tickets again. Some thoughts: 1. KenMH is on the money, definitely missed that as well in the first news cycle. I think that there are some plausible explanations for the delay between asking for SEC staff comment on excluding the proposal and then the about-face here. There are the holidays, filing requirements for 10-Qs/10-Ks, and weighing the uncertain litigation risk from DAS Defenders if they were to exclude the proposal without SEC approval. The last factor is likely the most important. My guess is that after the SEC’s updated guidance, Disney Legal took their time mulling over the costs and decided that letting it come to a vote was worth it for a few reasons. First, shareholder litigation takes place in a specialized court in Delaware. Whereas in-house counsel probably deals with hundreds of tort cases in FL courts every year for slip-and-falls and the like, they’d have to hire (expensive!) outside counsel to deal with a shareholder suit. After a cost-benefit analysis of potential litigation vs. drafting a proxy statement, the latter was presumably cheaper. Second, Disney would be facing sophisticated counsel. Disney has dealt with shareholder litigation that is well-financed by outside parties as recently as 2023. See Simeone v. The Walt Disney Company (Del. Ch. June 27, 2023) (finding that a shareholder’s books-and-records request was pretextual, as they had been solicited to make the request by the Thomas More Society, a “public interest law firm championing Life, Family, and Freedom.”). While Disney Legal isn’t afraid of some heads-up baseball, so to speak, the off-chance that a shareholder suit is successful could have significant implications for how domestic park operations are managed. Why take the risk? Finally, Disney has already faced enough bad PR in recent times with regard to public litigation. The 2024 public’s reaction to Disney’s attempt to use mandatory arbitration under a Disney+ T&C clause was less than favorable. I don’t think they’re eager to take a stand in a court of law that would put then put them back in the court of public opinion for supposedly discriminating against disabled folks. 2. The next question is what will actually be in the proxy statement and if it even matters. Like you’ve pointed out, the institutional giants are probably going to vote No against the proposal no matter what. Thus, Disney is incentivized to minimize their exposure to bad PR by drafting a concise proxy statement with something along the lines of “We have been working in park operations and line management for 50+ years, world-class industry experts, carefully tuned the DAS system to appropriately deter cheaters and maximize accessibility, etc.” If the media even picks it up (as you’ve pointed out, most just tune out during this portion of the earnings call…), it’ll be one bad news cycle. Then Disney won’t have to deal with a similar proposal for 3-4 years due to exclusion rules related to unsuccessful shareholder proposals. 3. Finally, there’s the question of where we go from here. I think that DAS Defenders rightly points out that the park experience is declining in quality due to, in part, monstrous wait times. This is essentially a supply-and-demand problem. There is not enough ride supply to meet current guest demand. There are only so many rides at each park. Moreover, given the price of entry, people want to experience everything! So much so that they’re willing to pay an additional premium (Lightning Lane) to raise their chances of doing so. Thus, Disney faces conflicting incentives to solving the wait time problem by either shifting ride demand to other forms of entertainment (shows, street performers, dining options, etc.) or by increasing the supply of rides. They want to improve the guest experience and encourage repeat visits, but boy…that Lightning Lane money sure does juice up quarterly earnings – especially around the holidays! Not to mention, having guests wait in line is free. Street performers and new rides cost money. I’m not sure that we’re at a breaking point since ticket prices go up every year and the parks, aside from the pandemic years, have only increased their attendance figures. But I do think that the company recognizes that they are rapidly drawing from a water table of goodwill that may not last for much longer absent any major changes: hence, the massive influx of investment into Villains Land, Monsters Inc., Tropical Americas. The only issue is that these additions have to meaningfully offset the additional demand that they induce. If these additions are like adding an additional lane of traffic to the Texas interstate (“Just one more lane will solve traffic, trust me bro.”), then the problem will only get worse. But if the company follows a dense, singles-and-doubles approach to supply of entertainment where cheaper rides have high capacity, the park experience will meaningfully improve. It’s difficult but doable for the company and guests to have the best of both worlds – higher attendance figures and shorter wait-times. I think this is going to be an uncomfortable, controversial topic for a long time to come. A Deloitte survey found that 53% of Gen Z identify as neurodivergent. Even if there’s some substantial sampling error there, and even if some of that neurodiversity involves things like dyslexia only (which doesn’t typically involve things like sensory issues, unless there’s a co-occurring condition) – that’s still a substantial portion of Gen Z. Even if not every person who identifies as ADHD or autistic feels they need accommodations, presumably a significant number do, as sensory issues, anxiety, and difficulty with self regulation are fairly core for a lot of people. Honestly I’m not sure what to make of those numbers. I know rates of autism, ADHD, and learning disabilities have been rising exponentially, but are we really at 53% for young people? I don’t know. That doesn’t even get into other conditions, such as physical disabilities, PTSD, seizures, etc. I think the idea of disability accommodations as we know them were created in a different era, and we’ll see a lot of changes over the next few decades. I wouldn’t rule out a situation where theme parks simply have to create an alternative to lines in general (not in the next few years, of course, but in 30 some years I could see it.) “I know rates of autism, ADHD, and learning disabilities have been rising exponentially, but are we really at 53% for young people?” I wonder how much of this is rates of those disabilities increasing, versus diagnoses increasing. I’m not saying it’s solely an either/or proposition, but it also wouldn’t surprise me if we’re getting better at identifying those conditions–or testing has become more sensitive to catch borderline cases. Either way, your point stands–just another layer to the discussion that will assuredly play out in the years to come, and not just with Disney. I think the reason it’s so polarising is because it is an unusual combination of both necessary and unfair. It’s necessary because nobody would argue that people with disabilities should be prevented from experiencing attractions. But if someone with DAS uses it to ride Guardians 5 times in a day, is that fair? If they would have spent 5×90 mins queueing for the ride had they been able to, then absolutely yes it is fair. But statistically, not many people would do that. What I would say (and I don’t think this is controversial) is that hardening the eligibility is the wrong approach. That is a recipe for heartbroken guests. Better to err on the side of inclusivity, as implied in this article – and if this volume causes operational issues (or – more cynically – revenue loss from LL), the corrective should come from moderating the extent of the accommodation. For example (just one idea), use metrics on how much time guests are prepared to queue (on average) per day, and DAS uses come out of that quota. Completely agree! Although with DAS, you still have to wait in a queue – it’s just virtual. So if the line is 90 minutes, you would still need to wait that amount of time which prevents people to ride things immediately or over and over. If you have das, you can only use it once for each attraction. The only way you could ride 5 times is once with das and 4 times waiting in the standard cue. That’s how it always worked for my son Jaynee there is not a usage cap on DAS. You can do the same ride over and over. The paid service limits to one use per ride, but there has long been an argument that a non-disabled person could ride again, so the disabled must be able to as well. It’s interesting you mentioned above that Disney already offers a line skipping product. Why isn’t that an alternative to DAS for most? The accommodation could be that a person who needs DAS can buy it even when sold out. And for attractions where a LL is not offered, then use a return time. ADA is supposed to make things accessible to all equitably, DAS is not necessarily that. With DAS, the person is given a return time for the attraction, granted it is the same amount of time as the wait time, however, they can go and do other things such a shop or eat lunch or even experience another attraction, while someone without DAS has to stand and wait in line. That’s really not equitable. I’m not really sure what the solution is, I will vote for no review. There is an obvious solution to the “doing two things” problem you describe, namely a sensory waiting area. Eligible guests and their party could check in to the waiting area (designed as a comfortable inclusive space with seats, soft drinks etc), and time spent inside the waiting area counts toward DAS queue time that they can use for a future ride. This would cost Disney more as they would have to staff it (and lose some F&B sales), but firstly facilities like this would be good PR in the first place, and secondly it would arguably be more profitable in the long run. Full disclosure, I have a decent number of Disney shares (not even a rounding error to the DIS market cap, I assure you LOL) and when the proxy arrives I will vote no. Not because I know much about the DAS changes – I count myself fortunate in that regard – but because putting park operations changes (or even studies of them) “up to a vote” strikes me as a terrible precedent. I do hope, per Tom’s comments, that a satisfactory middle ground can be found! Appreciate this perspective, and agree with it. Unfortunately, the DAS discourse has become so polarized that I fear this type of nuance is being lost. It’s okay to acknowledge that a proposal like this is destined to fail (because it is), or shouldn’t even be up for vote in the first place (because of the precedent it sets) and also think that DAS has been mishandled and needs further fine-tuning. I wonder if it’s worth considering the strategy of the other side. In respect of which, I am wondering if those challenging the current policy actually quietly accept it and do not envision a reversal, and rather their true motivation is to prevent further limitations. In this regard, Disney will be forced to make statements as to why the current system is balanced, proportionate and sustainable. Once those statements are on record, those statements can be used to directly argue against further erosion. I’d be very surprised if it’s about the long game. I’d also be surprised if Disney has anything now that functions as precedent preventing future changes. Keep in mind that there’s already past litigation that went through a lot of discovery, and that didn’t stop Disney from making subsequent changes. Pretty easy to argue that circumstances have changed if further changes are deemed necessary down the road. I worry that people need to stop pushing or Disney will get rid of DAS entirely. The ADA requires things like ramps, bathrooms, parking spaces for Disabled, and communication (phone calls that help the deaf, etc…). Line skipping isn’t an ADA thing. When I was young, the DAS pass didn’t even exist. DAS seems to have become a headache, and they don’t legally need to provide it. There’s a bit more nuance to it than that, but you’re on the right track. Businesses must make “reasonable modifications” in their policies, practices, and procedures to accommodate a person with a disability. However, they do not need to modify a policy if it would “fundamentally alter” the nature of the business’s goods or services. There’s a lot more to it than that, but that’s the nutshell version. The question thus becomes whether the requested accommodations pass a reasonableness test, and also whether waiting in lines is fundamental to the theme park experience. Disney does offer a paid line-skipping product, so the answer to the second question might be no. But maybe not–it’s something that could end up eventually playing out in court. Interested to see what Jack says, but the SEC limited their no-action relief in November, right? So Disney either has to supplement to get a formal response or just exclude the proposal without SEC opinion. Maybe just letting the proposal take the L in ordinary course is SOP now if you can’t get the no-action from the SEC? Great call–that’s gotta be it. Totally missed that in the aftermath of the government shutdown. And the timing of Disney’s original letter would’ve been before the SEC made the announcement of that limitation. Assuming this is the explanation (and I can’t think of anything else even remotely plausible), it really just comes down to Disney not being able to take the uncertainty. Outcome will still be the same, of course, but wow, what a long road to get there. I’ll go back and update the commentary in a bit in light of this…have to move on to F&F coaster for now.

Title: Trump’s Fed chair decision could come next week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says

Full Content:
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday lodged a pointed attack against Fed Chair Jerome Powell – accusing him of putting “his thumb on the scale” if he attends upcoming Supreme Court arguments over President Trump’s attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Powell, who is named as a defendant in Cook’s case seeking to block Trump from ousting her over mortgage fraud allegations, is reportedly planning to attend Supreme Court arguments on Wednesday. “I actually think that’s a mistake,” Bessent told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Tuesday during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “If you’re trying not to politicize the Fed, for the Fed chair to be sitting there trying to put his thumb on the scale, that’s a mistake.” Bessent himself sat in the front row of the gallery during Supreme Court arguments in November about Trump’s authority to impose sweeping tariffs, alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and top trade negotiator Jamieson Greer. In a different line of attack on Tuesday, the treasury chief took aim at Powell for not meeting with federal prosecutors last month before they issued subpoenas related to the criminal probe of the Fed’s headquarters project. Bessent also blasted Powell for asset purchases made around the pandemic that resulted in huge losses and for the resignation of “four to six” senior Fed officials related to compliance issues. “If that happened at a Wall Street firm, the CEO would be out,” Bessent said. Trump has repeatedly threatened to fire Powell, bashing the chairman for not lowering interest rates fast enough – but Bessent has previously appeared to take a more neutral stance on Powell. During a November speech at a US-Saudi investment forum, Trump even insinuated that Bessent had talked him out of firing Powell and let him serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in May. Trump’s decision on his choice for the next Federal Reserve chairman could come as soon as next week, Bessent said Tuesday. The president has narrowed the race down to four potential candidates, including Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock exec Rick Rieder. “We’ve had substantial conversations about this. We’ve run a process that started in September – 11 very strong candidates. We’re now down to four candidates. The president has personally met with all of them, and it’s going to be his decision,” Bessent said. Powell could choose to stay on the board through 2028. He has so far declined to comment on whether he will remain a Fed governor. Last week, Powell revealed that he’s under criminal investigation for allegedly lying during congressional testimony last summer over the Fed’s $2.5 billion headquarters renovation in DC. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,” Powell said in a stunning video statement. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions – or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.” Trump first nominated Powell to lead the Fed at the start of his first presidential term. Last week, Warsh surged ahead of Hassett on prediction markets betting on the next Fed chairman after Trump said he’d like to keep Hassett in his current role as an economic adviser. Trump also ruled out Bessent for the role “because he wants to stay where he is.” Markets had placed better odds on Hassett for weeks. While Trump said he’d like to keep Hassett in his current job, it’s not impossible for him to win the nomination. After Fed Governor Adriana Kugler unexpectedly resigned last summer, Trump tapped Stephen Miran, then a top White House economic adviser, to fill the role. Miran refused to fully resign from his White House job, instead taking an unpaid leave of absence. Advertisement

This includes launching of a Sector Rotation Fund, setting up its entity at Gift City, rollout of Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) and gearing up for a comprehensive ETF build-out. “Having crossed 10 lakh customers since our launch last year, we are looking to expand our suite of offerings with a key focus on diversification. We intend to offer differentiated exposures to our investors via SIFs, ETFs and Gift City,” Sid Swaminathan, MD and CEO, JioBlackRock AMC, said. Additionally, the AMC intends to launch a series of funds across debt, equity and hybrid. “We continue on our path of giving our investors a choice of products with focus on cost efficiency, accessibility and long-term value creation,” he said. He also added that out of 10 lakh investors, nearly 18 per cent are first-time mutual fund investors. The joint venture between Jio Financial Services and BlackRock has also seen strong participation from investors beyond major metros, with 40 per cent of its retail investors coming from B-30 cities, significantly higher than the industry average of 28 per cent. B-30 cities in India refer to cities beyond the top 30. Giving details of the new offerings, a statement by the AMC said active funds will be based on BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) platform – the same platform that powers its maiden Active Equity offering – the JioBlackRock Flexicap Fund. The first of these is the JioBlackRock Sector Rotation Fund, the NFO of which will open on January 27 and continue till February 9. “With equity markets tending to move in cycles, which impact each sector in different ways, the JioBlackRock Sector Rotation Fund is built to adapt to these shifts by dynamically rotating across sectors based on macro and market indicators, while also managing risk in response to evolving market dynamics and emerging opportunities,” the company said. Further, the AMC plans rolling out SIFs aimed at meeting sophisticated investment requirements, deepening engagement with investors through differentiated products and risk-managed outcomes. As part of its broader product expansion, it is also gearing up for a comprehensive ETF build-out, with a focus on evaluating building blocks that can enable deeper retail penetration, institutional participation while creating scalable and cost-effective solutions, the statement added. The AMC is also in the process of setting up its entity in Gift City and securing the required regulatory permissions that will allow the development of cross-border fund structures and a retail presence. This will enable Indian investors to responsibly access global allocation opportunities and international investors to obtain access to differentiated investment opportunities in India, the statement said.

KeyCorp NYSE: KEY executives highlighted improved profitability, strengthening credit trends, and an accelerated capital return plan during the company’s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings call on Jan. 20, 2026. Management also outlined 2026 financial guidance and discussed continued investments in hiring, technology, and artificial intelligence, alongside several board changes announced the same morning. Get KeyCorp alerts:Sign UpFourth-quarter results: revenue growth outpaced expenses Chairman and CEO Chris Gorman said fourth-quarter and full-year results reflected progress on KeyCorp’s “organic path to achieving consistently higher returns on capital.” The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $0.43 per share, while CFO Clark Khayat noted earnings were $0.41 per share on an adjusted basis. Revenue exceeded $2 billion, growing 12% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, while expenses grew 2%. Keysight Technologies' Surge: The Market Wakes Up to This AI PlayKhayat said tax-equivalent net interest income rose 15% year-over-year and net interest margin (NIM) ended the quarter at 2.82%, up 7 basis points sequentially and above the company’s previously indicated target range of 2.75% to 2.8%. He attributed sequential NII growth to commercial client deposit growth and balance sheet optimization, including running off lower-yielding consumer loans and allowing higher-cost brokered CDs and borrowings to roll off. Non-interest income increased 8% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, which management described as broad-based across priority fee businesses. Fourth-quarter investment banking and debt placement fees were $243 million, up 10% year-over-year, driven by debt capital markets and commercial mortgage debt placement. Trust and investment services income rose 10%, supported by record positive net flows and higher market values, while assets under management reached a record $70 billion. Big Buybacks: 3 Large Caps Exceed 5% Repurchase PowerKhayat said fourth-quarter non-interest expense totaled $1.3 billion, up 7% sequentially and 2% year-over-year, but included roughly $30 million of “unusually elevated expenses,” which he cautioned should not be treated as a run rate. Full-year 2025: record revenue and operating leverage Management said KeyCorp met or exceeded the financial targets it provided at the beginning of 2025. Gorman described 2025 as a “substantial year of progress,” including record full-year revenue that increased 16% from the prior year. Expenses rose 4.6%, which the company said translated into approximately 1,200 basis points of operating leverage and PP&R growth of about 44%. Khayat said net interest income increased 23%, outperforming the company’s original expectation for 20% growth, aided by stronger commercial loan growth and deposit performance. Fees grew 7.5% versus an original expectation of “5%-plus,” with investment banking fees up 13% despite muted middle-market M&A activity for much of the year. Gorman said the company added nearly 10% to frontline banker staff across wealth management, commercial payments, middle market, and investment banking, and invested an additional $100 million in technology focused on customer-facing capabilities. Credit and balance sheet: improving trends and continued remix Both Gorman and Khayat emphasized improving asset quality metrics. The fourth-quarter provision for credit losses was $108 million, including $104 million of net charge-offs and a $4 million reserve build. The net charge-off ratio was 39 basis points in the quarter, and full-year net charge-offs were 41 basis points, which Khayat said was toward the better end of the company’s 40 to 45 basis point target range. Non-performing assets declined 6% sequentially, criticized loans fell by $500 million (down 8% sequentially), and delinquencies also improved, according to management. On the balance sheet, KeyCorp said average loans were relatively flat sequentially. Khayat pointed to a $1 billion increase in C&I loans, offset by the intentional runoff of $550 million of lower-yielding consumer loans and some paydowns in commercial real estate. Spot commercial loan growth was about $1.2 billion, with growth in both C&I and CRE, which Khayat said was driven primarily by the power and utility sector and broad-based middle-market growth across regions. Deposit trends were described as favorable. Average deposits increased by about $300 million sequentially, with $2 billion of commercial client deposit growth offset by a decline of $1.3 billion in higher-cost brokered CDs. Total deposit costs declined 16 basis points to 1.81%, and the cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta declined modestly to 51% through the fourth quarter. In Q&A, Khayat said the company expects a “low-to-mid 50s” beta in 2026 on a relatively stable deposit base. Management also discussed the continued runoff of the consumer loan portfolio, which Gorman described as largely super-prime mortgages to doctors and dentists yielding about 3.3%. He said KeyCorp expects roughly $600 million per quarter of runoff and that it could bottom out “in the next couple of years,” while the bank builds home equity capabilities and maintains its student loan refinancing platform for when vintages and rates align. Capital return ramps up; guidance and strategic priorities for 2026 Gorman said KeyCorp began a “more meaningful return of capital” in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $200 million of common stock—double the original commitment announced in October—at an average price of $18 per share. The company ended the quarter with a 10.3% marked CET1 ratio, which management described as peer-leading, and said it intends to manage the ratio down toward the higher end of its 9.5% to 10% targeted range by the end of 2026. Khayat said CET1 was 11.7% on a reported basis and reiterated plans to repurchase at least $300 million of shares in the first quarter and at least $1.2 billion for the full year 2026. Gorman added the company anticipates similar quarterly repurchase levels through 2026, supported by ongoing capital generation. For 2026, KeyCorp’s guidance included: Revenue up about 7%, driven by NII growth of 8% to 10% and non-interest income growth of 3% to 4%. Adjusting for business decisions described as net neutral to earnings, non-interest income is expected to grow 5% to 6%. Expenses up 3% to 4%, implying positive operating leverage of roughly 300 to 400 basis points. Average loans up 1% to 2%, with commercial loans up about 5% as consumer runoff continues and the bank remixes into higher-yielding relationship-based commercial loans. Net charge-off ratio stable at 40 to 45 basis points. Tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% on a taxable equivalent basis. In Q&A, Gorman said the company’s organic focus remains on three areas: middle market and payments, investment banking, and wealth—particularly mass affluent. He also emphasized ongoing investments in AI and technology, noting tech and ops investments increased from $800 million to $900 million last year and to $1 billion this year, with a goal of improving processes such as loan underwriting and processing. On M&A, Gorman said the company is “not focused on” bank acquisitions, reiterating that position when asked directly. However, he said KeyCorp is interested in “complementary fee-based and capability-enhancing acquisitions,” including group hires or boutiques, particularly in knowledge-worker-heavy businesses. Separately, management detailed board changes, including planned nominations of Tony DeSpirito (most recently Global CIO for Fundamental Equities at BlackRock) and Chris Henson (former head of banking and insurance at Truist and former president/COO/CFO at BB&T). The lead independent director role transitioned from Sandy Cutler to Todd Vassos, CEO of Dollar General. The company also said Carlton Highsmith and Ruth Ann Gillis plan to retire from the board at the annual meeting, and David Wilson retired immediately due to health considerations.About KeyCorp NYSE: KEYKeyCorp is a bank holding company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, that operates through its primary banking subsidiary, KeyBank.

Khayat pointed to a $1 billion increase in C&I loans, offset by the intentional runoff of $550 million of lower-yielding consumer loans and some paydowns in commercial real estate. Spot commercial loan growth was about $1.2 billion, with growth in both C&I and CRE, which Khayat said was driven primarily by the power and utility sector and broad-based middle-market growth across regions. Deposit trends were described as favorable. Average deposits increased by about $300 million sequentially, with $2 billion of commercial client deposit growth offset by a decline of $1.3 billion in higher-cost brokered CDs. Total deposit costs declined 16 basis points to 1.81%, and the cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta declined modestly to 51% through the fourth quarter. In Q&A, Khayat said the company expects a “low-to-mid 50s” beta in 2026 on a relatively stable deposit base. Management also discussed the continued runoff of the consumer loan portfolio, which Gorman described as largely super-prime mortgages to doctors and dentists yielding about 3.3%. He said KeyCorp expects roughly $600 million per quarter of runoff and that it could bottom out “in the next couple of years,” while the bank builds home equity capabilities and maintains its student loan refinancing platform for when vintages and rates align. Capital return ramps up; guidance and strategic priorities for 2026 Gorman said KeyCorp began a “more meaningful return of capital” in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $200 million of common stock—double the original commitment announced in October—at an average price of $18 per share. The company ended the quarter with a 10.3% marked CET1 ratio, which management described as peer-leading, and said it intends to manage the ratio down toward the higher end of its 9.5% to 10% targeted range by the end of 2026. Khayat said CET1 was 11.7% on a reported basis and reiterated plans to repurchase at least $300 million of shares in the first quarter and at least $1.2 billion for the full year 2026. Gorman added the company anticipates similar quarterly repurchase levels through 2026, supported by ongoing capital generation. For 2026, KeyCorp’s guidance included: Revenue up about 7%, driven by NII growth of 8% to 10% and non-interest income growth of 3% to 4%. Adjusting for business decisions described as net neutral to earnings, non-interest income is expected to grow 5% to 6%. Expenses up 3% to 4%, implying positive operating leverage of roughly 300 to 400 basis points. Average loans up 1% to 2%, with commercial loans up about 5% as consumer runoff continues and the bank remixes into higher-yielding relationship-based commercial loans. Net charge-off ratio stable at 40 to 45 basis points. Tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% on a taxable equivalent basis. In Q&A, Gorman said the company’s organic focus remains on three areas: middle market and payments, investment banking, and wealth—particularly mass affluent. He also emphasized ongoing investments in AI and technology, noting tech and ops investments increased from $800 million to $900 million last year and to $1 billion this year, with a goal of improving processes such as loan underwriting and processing. On M&A, Gorman said the company is “not focused on” bank acquisitions, reiterating that position when asked directly. However, he said KeyCorp is interested in “complementary fee-based and capability-enhancing acquisitions,” including group hires or boutiques, particularly in knowledge-worker-heavy businesses. Separately, management detailed board changes, including planned nominations of Tony DeSpirito (most recently Global CIO for Fundamental Equities at BlackRock) and Chris Henson (former head of banking and insurance at Truist and former president/COO/CFO at BB&T). The lead independent director role transitioned from Sandy Cutler to Todd Vassos, CEO of Dollar General. The company also said Carlton Highsmith and Ruth Ann Gillis plan to retire from the board at the annual meeting, and David Wilson retired immediately due to health considerations.About KeyCorp NYSE: KEYKeyCorp is a bank holding company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, that operates through its primary banking subsidiary, KeyBank.

Gorman described 2025 as a “substantial year of progress,” including record full-year revenue that increased 16% from the prior year. Expenses rose 4.6%, which the company said translated into approximately 1,200 basis points of operating leverage and PP&R growth of about 44%. Khayat said net interest income increased 23%, outperforming the company’s original expectation for 20% growth, aided by stronger commercial loan growth and deposit performance. Fees grew 7.5% versus an original expectation of “5%-plus,” with investment banking fees up 13% despite muted middle-market M&A activity for much of the year. Gorman said the company added nearly 10% to frontline banker staff across wealth management, commercial payments, middle market, and investment banking, and invested an additional $100 million in technology focused on customer-facing capabilities. Credit and balance sheet: improving trends and continued remix Both Gorman and Khayat emphasized improving asset quality metrics. The fourth-quarter provision for credit losses was $108 million, including $104 million of net charge-offs and a $4 million reserve build. The net charge-off ratio was 39 basis points in the quarter, and full-year net charge-offs were 41 basis points, which Khayat said was toward the better end of the company’s 40 to 45 basis point target range.

Departments, agencies and public bodies News stories, speeches, letters and notices Detailed guidance, regulations and rules Reports, analysis and official statistics Consultations and strategy Data, Freedom of Information releases and corporate reports Cities and regions initiative to 'enhance capability, attract investment, and accelerate growth for the benefit of all of Scotland' Business leaders joined representatives from the UK Government and Scottish local authorities today [Tuesday 20 January] at the launch of a new initiative to boost investment in Scotland’s eight cities and its regions. As part of Scottish Cities Week 2026, Scotland Office Minister Kirsty McNeill launched the Scotland Investment Acceleration Programme at an event bringing together Scottish city leaders, investors, finance sector stakeholders, and officials from the Scotland Office, Department for Business and Trade and the Office for Investment. A collaborative initiative between the UK Government, TheCityUK and the Scottish Cities Alliance (SCA), the Scotland Investment Acceleration Programme will provide structured support, technical guidance and market intelligence to enable local authorities and cities attract inward investment from around the globe. Scotland Office Minister Kirsty McNeill said: Scotland’s cities and regions hold immense potential for inward investment: We have the talent, the ingenuity, and the resources. This is about building a competitive advantage for Scotland, ensuring our regions and communities are ready to secure the vital capital that drives growth and creates jobs. Together, we will enhance capability, attract investment, and accelerate growth for the benefit of all of Scotland. Cllr Raymond Bremner, Chair, Scottish Cities Alliance and Leader, Highland Council said: Scottish Cities Alliance is proud to support the Scotland Investment Acceleration Programme. Building capability and fostering collaboration between governments, investors, and our Scottish city partners is essential to unlocking transformative investment. Through initiatives like Scottish Cities Week London, we champion inclusive, sustainable growth and showcase Scotland’s strengths to ensure our cities thrive in a competitive global economy. Miles Celic OBE, Chief Executive Officer, TheCityUK, said: Scotland’s world-class financial and professional services are key drivers of growth and innovation [and a core element of the wider British industry]. We are excited to team up with our public sector partners to boost investment and enhance collaboration between industry and government. This partnership will unlock new opportunities, create high-value jobs, and ensure Scotland remains at the forefront of the UK’s international competitiveness. The Programme will run throughout 2026, starting with the inaugural Scottish Cities Week Round Table in London, and continuing through events in Scotland.

Title: Bridge Loan Platform Atlas Invest Raises $25M

© 2026 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Atlas Invest, an artificial intelligence-powered commercial real estate lending platform, announced Tuesday that it has raised $25 million in funding to expand access for institutional-quality debt investments. BlackRock led the mixed debt and equity partnership with Manhattan-based Atlas Invest. Along with $13 million previously raised, the new infusion increased the startup’s overall funding to $38 million, said Tal Shahar, co-founder and CEO at Atlas Invest. “We started the company a bit more than three years ago,” Shahar said. “Atlas is an AI operating system, and that means we see customers who are borrowers looking for financing. They reach out to Atlas and get quick and simple financing with certainty. On the other side, we enable institutional investors to invest in this space of real estate financing, real estate debt, through customized managed accounts.” Reflecting the growing institutional adoption of AI-driven bridge lending, Atlas Invest uses its proprietary technology for data-driven processes across sourcing, underwriting and servicing with risk-adjusted practices to redefine how private investors access, engage with and scale real estate debt investments nationwide. The company aims to scale significantly with the new funding, targeting a greater than 10-fold increase in transactions in 2026 over 2025, said Shahar. “The market is shifting, investors are demanding income strategies that combine security, predictable returns and professional oversight,” Nir Peled, Atlas Invest’s chief revenue officer and co-founder, said in a statement. “We built Atlas to deliver institutional-grade underwriting and monitoring at software speed, combining a deep operating platform with a disciplined credit approach. This scale and consistency allow us to raise the bar for transparency and reliability in real estate debt.” Atlas Invest speeds the entire lending process for borrowers, said Shahar. “A borrower can send an email and say, ‘Hey, my name is John. I want a loan for this property,’ and on the same day they’re going to get a term sheet, and in a couple of days they can get the financing,” Shahar explained. “Our system does the full analysis super quick, because it uses AI technology. In a few days we will give you the capital itself. So it’s very fast, with certainty, and a simple process.” Currently, due diligence to assess risk on deals is a lengthy, costly and limited process in terms of the visibility and value it provides. Atlas Invest claims to offer institutional-grade due diligence at regular intervals, tapping into a broader pool of information spanning facets of the developer and the asset, and continuously monitoring to mitigate risk. Atlas Invest’s key distinction is that its AI does not replace credit judgment, but compresses time, expands depth, and enforces consistency, allowing its team to make higher-quality decisions at scale with full auditability and human oversight, according to the company. The company works with hundreds of brokers and the borrowers behind them, as well as institutional investors from multiple continents, said Shahar. “We have insurance companies, banks and family offices,” he said. “And they’re coming to the platform because they want to invest their money in real estate debt. So they open their account, and the platform is doing everything for them, from sourcing opportunities, doing a very deep analysis, and then building their portfolio of investments and monitoring that for them.” Philip Russo can be reached at prusso@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Bishti named captain as Ireland U20 squad confirmed

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Leinster's academy prop Sam Bishti has been confirmed as captain for Ireland Under-20s in the 2026 Six Nations Championship, after head coach Andrew Browne named a 29-player squad for the early rounds of the tournament. Bishti, who has been playing for UCD in the Energia All-Ireland League this season, skippered Blackrock College to Leinster Schools Senior Cup success last year, and will lead the Ireland U20s as they bid to recover from last year’s calamitous championship, where they finished bottom of the table with just one win. Just four of that 2025 squad remain in place this year, with Leinster trio Donnacha McGuire, Charlie Molony and Derry Moloney, as well as Munster’s Tom Wood – son of former Ireland captain Keith - playing a second year of U20s. Browne has also included recent Leinster academy back row Josh Neill in his squad. The highly-rated teenager (below, right) only linked up with the province’s academy this month following his arrival from his native South Africa, and the Irish-qualified flanker scored two tries in Saturday’s 29-10 warm-up win against Italy in Dublin. Ireland get their Championship campaign under way in France before returning home to Virgin Media Park in Cork to face Italy on Friday, 13 February. Browne’s side then travel to Bath to face England on Friday, 20 February, before welcoming Wales and Scotland to Cork for back-to-back home fixtures to finish the campaign on Saturday, 7 March and Sunday, 15 March respectively. "We have been working hard together as an extended squad for a number of months and it’s an exciting time for these young players, who have the honour of representing the wider group in the Six Nations," head coach Browne said. "We, as coaches, have pushed the players over the last number of months and I have been impressed by their work-rate, commitment, and application. Now our focus turns to performance and the opening game against France, which we know will be a big challenge first up." Forwards: Tyrese Abolarin (Queen’s University/Ulster), Sami Bishti (UCD/Leinster)(captain), Ben Blaney (Terenure/Leinster), Jonathan Byrne (Garryowen/Munster) Max Doyle (UCD/Leinster), Joe Finn (Garryowen/Munster), Christian Foley (Young Munster/Munster), Rian Handley (Old Wesley/Leinster), Bill Hayes (Garryowen/Munster), Alex Lautsou (Shannon/Munster), Duinn Maguire (UCD/Leinster), Blake McClean (Instonians/Ulster), Donnacha McGuire (UCD/Leinster), Dylan McNeice (UCD/Leinster) Josh Neill (Old Wesley/Leinster), Diarmaid O’Connell (Corinthians/Connacht), Sean Walsh (MU Barnhall/Leinster) Backs: Christopher Barrett (UCC/Munster), Ethan Black (Old Wesley/Leinster), Noah Byrne (Dublin University/Leinster), Luke Fogarty (MU Barnhall/Leinster), Derry Moloney (Blackrock College/Leinster), Charlie Molony (UCD/Leinster), James O’Dwyer (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Charlie O’Shea (UCC/Munster), Johnny O’Sullivan (Dublin University/Leinster), Daniel Ryan (Corinthians/Connacht), Harry Waters (Blackrock College/Leinster), Tom Wood (Garryowen/Munster). © RTÉ 2026.

Today’s top news: Wall Street is finally capitulating into blockchain and around-the-clock trading. 📌 What Happened The New York Stock Exchange is preparing infrastructure to support 24/7 trading of tokenized stocks and ETFs. The effort is being developed under NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange, and would allow traditional securities to trade continuously using blockchain-based rails, rather than the fixed market hours and delayed settlement that define today’s equity markets. Key elements under consideration include: The platform would still require regulatory approval and isn’t live yet, but moving in the right direction for the crypto natives who have been calling for this eventuality for years. 🗣️ What They’re Saying “For more than two centuries, the NYSE has transformed the way markets operate. We are leading the industry toward fully on-chain solutions, grounded in the unmatched protections and high regulatory standards that position us to marry trust with state-of-the-art technology.” - Lynn Martin, President of NYSE Group Back in December, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein said that finance is “entering the next major evolution in market infrastructure,” one that could move assets “faster and more securely than systems that have served investors for decades.” 🧠 Why It Matters The world’s most important stock exchange is building for a crypto-native market structure. This is a big deal for a few reasons: Now what does it mean for prices? Again, it will be slow moving. But the blockchains that become the home of the majority of tokenization (potentially Ethereum and Solana) are set up to be winners. And as the overall pie grows and crypto is taken more seriously, the bull case for crypto majors becomes easier to digest. This won’t happen overnight.

Scores of private jets landed near Davos on Monday as the rich and powerful descended on the Alpine town for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. Business Insider tracked at least 157 private jets that arrived near the Alpine town, using data from ADS-B Exchange and JetSpy. These flight-tracking tools don't participate in privacy systems that many business-jet owners have signed up for to hide their movements from most similar tools. More than half of the flights tracked landed at Zurich International Airport. Another 45 came into Friedrichshafen, a German city on the shore of Lake Constance, just over the Swiss border. The rest were spread across other smaller airports in Switzerland. They included airplanes belonging to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, according to data from JetSpy. JetSpy also showed numerous companies' private jets arriving in the area, including those of Aramco, BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Google, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.

The most popular private jet was the Gulfstream G650, representing 31 of the flights tracked by Business Insider. Buying one typically costs over $65 million. It can accommodate up to 19 people or be configured with a double bed and a shower. The world's newest private jet, the G800, also appeared three times on Monday. Gulfstream only delivered the first one in August. At 7,600 miles, the longest trip was made by the Gulfstream G700 that JetSpy says belongs to Benioff. It flew for 14½ hours from Hawaii. Meanwhile, a commercial flight would have taken two stops and over 24 hours. Other major journeys included airplanes arriving from Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, and Uruguay. Private jets flew in from dozens of different countries, including Sierra Leone and Montenegro. London was the most popular departure point, with 19 flights coming from four airports in and around the British capital. However, many of these planes appear to have stopped only briefly on the way toward Davos. For example, a Google private jet spent 13 hours on the ground near London after arriving from San Jose. 10 private jets departed from around New York, seven from the Bay Area metropolitan regions, and six from Dubai. Dozens more are expected to arrive throughout the week. Tuesday also saw the arrival of jets belonging to Bill Gates, Michael Dell, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to data from JetSpy. Jump to

Title: AI boom could falter without wider adoption, Microsoft chief Satya Nadella warns
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2026/01/20/ai-boom-could-falter-without-wider-adoption-microsoft-chief-satya-nadella-warns/

Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) risks becoming a speculative bubble unless its use spreads beyond big tech companies and wealthy economies. Mr Nadella on Tuesday said that the long-term success of the fast-developing technology would depend on it being used by a broad range of industries as well as on uptake outside of the developed world. “For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,” said Mr Nadella. He noted that a “telltale sign of if it’s a bubble” would be if only tech groups were benefiting from the rise of AI, rather than companies in other sectors. However, Mr Nadella said he was confident that AI would prove to be transformative across industries, such as helping to develop new drugs. “I’m much more confident that this is a technology that will, in fact, build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster, bend the productivity curve and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world,” he said. The Microsoft chief’s comments came as part of a talk with BlackRock chief Larry Fink on the first day of the World Economic Forum annual meeting at Davos, kicking off the first of several speeches by tech executives, including Google DeepMind chief, Sir Demis Hassabis and Anthropic’s Dario Amodei. A growing body of data from tech companies, including Microsoft, has shown a global divide in AI adoption rates, pointing to productivity benefits and work applications being concentrated in richer developed countries. Mr Nadella also reiterated his view that the future of AI adoption would not rely on one dominant model provider, which has driven the tech giant’s decision to work with several AI groups, such as Anthropic and xAI, as well as OpenAI. Microsoft gained an early advantage in AI through its $14 billion (€11.9 billion) bet on OpenAI, which gave the software group unique access to the ChatGPT maker’s technology and first claim on its data centre contracts. But after restructuring its partnership with Sam Altman’s start-up in October, Microsoft has dropped exclusivity over its data centre needs and will lose exclusive access to its research and models in the early 2030s. Mr Nadella said companies would be able to take advantage of multiple models, including open-source ones, or even building their own models using a technique called “distillation” to produce smaller, cheaper versions of powerful models. “So the [intellectual property] of any application or any firm is, how do you use all these models with context engineering or your data?” Mr Nadella said. “As long as firms can answer that question, they’re gonna be getting ahead.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2026 From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Capitalism has failed to spread wealth and prosperity — and AI could do the same, says BlackRock CEO

Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, kicked off the World Economic Forum on Tuesday with a critique of capitalism. More wealth has been created since the fall of the Berlin Wall than at any other time in human history, but it has not translated into shared prosperity, said Fink, who was appointed as interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab. "In advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain," he said. Fink warned that the pattern of unequal wealth distribution could repeat in the era of AI. "Early gains are flowing to the owners of models, owners of data, and owners of infrastructure," said Fink.

If AI does to white collar workers what globalisation did to blue collar workers, we need to confront that today, directly." He urged those gathered at the annual meeting in Davos to rethink how prosperity is defined and to create a "credible plan" for broad participation in the gains AI can deliver. "This is going to be the test. Capitalism can evolve to turn more people into owners of growth instead of spectators watching it happen," said Fink. The world's wealthiest 10% own roughly 75% of global wealth, while the poorest half hold only about 2%, according to the World Inequality Report 2026, released in December 2025 and based on data compiled by 200 researchers. Fink acknowledged in his speech that the World Economic Forum has lost trust and "feels out of step with the moment." "Davos is an elite gathering trying to shape a world that belongs to everyone," Fink said, adding that the forum should be more transparent and precise about what economic success means, especially with those who don't feel represented at gatherings like Davos. "Prosperity just isn't the growth in the aggregate. It's not just GDP. It can't be measured by GDP or the market caps of companies. It has to be judged by many people who see it, who can touch it, can feel it, and can build their own future on it," said Fink. Fink has previously spoken about how the pandemic fueled a rethink of the US economy. In his 2022 annual letter to shareholders, Fink said the growth of stakeholder capitalism — the idea that companies should prioritize interests beyond shareholders — was a natural evolution of how capitalism can best work to build a strong economy. "It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long-term," he said. BlackRock, which manages some $14 trillion in assets, has been one of the loudest voices in support of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing, with Fink often highlighting climate change and sustainability in his annual letters.

Jio BlackRock Asset Management, which launched its services in May, has built an investor base of 10 lakh, with nearly 18 per cent comprising first-time mutual fund investors, its MD and CEO Sid Swaminathan said on Tuesday. The joint venture between Jio Financial Services and BlackRock has also seen strong participation from investors beyond major metros, with 40 per cent of its retail investors coming from B-30 cities, significantly higher than the industry average of 28 per cent. B-30 cities in India refer to cities beyond the top 30. Speaking to reporters here, Swaminathan attributed this deeper market penetration to its technology-led approach and sustained focus on investor education. Jio BlackRock AMC manages assets worth over ₹13,700 crore, with equities accounting for around 30 per cent of the total assets under management, while the remaining 70 per cent is invested in fixed income and cash. Looking ahead, the company plans to focus on key strategic initiatives, including the launch of Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and on offering international investment exposure through GIFT City. "We have recently received a no-objection certificate from Sebi to launch Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs), and we are very excited about this opportunity," he said. The initiative will enable Indian investors to access global allocation opportunities in a responsible manner, while also allowing international investors to tap into differentiated investment opportunities in India. Alongside this, the company is exploring the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to ensure investors have access to a comprehensive set of core investment building blocks. The year could also see the rollout of a series of mutual fund offerings. The active funds will be powered by BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) platform, the same platform underpinning its maiden active equity offering, the JioBlackRock Flexicap Fund. The first of these new launches will be the JioBlackRock Sector Rotation Fund, with its new fund offer (NFO) opening on January 27 and closing on February 9. As equity markets tend to move in cycles, impacting sectors differently, the fund is designed to dynamically rotate across sectors based on macroeconomic and market indicators, while actively managing risk amid evolving market conditions and emerging opportunities.

Title: Natural gas surged 17% yesterday and it’s triggering a macro trap that could suddenly tank Bitcoin prices

If the spike sticks, inflation expectations can reprice, real yields can jump, and Bitcoin’s liquidity tailwind can flip fast. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Natural gas prices surged 17.76% on Jan. 19, driven by cold forecasts across Northeast Asia and Europe, tightening liquidity in global LNG markets, and short-covering in European storage inventories sitting 15% points below the five-year average. For most crypto traders, a weather-driven commodity spike registers as irrelevant noise. Something for energy desks to manage, not Bitcoin portfolios. However, the transmission mechanism from energy shocks to Bitcoin runs through real interest rates and dollar liquidity conditions. When those channels activate, the impact can materialize faster than the market price. The question isn't whether a single-day natural gas move dictates Bitcoin's trajectory. It's whether the energy shock reprices inflation expectations, drags real yields higher, and tightens the dollar-denominated liquidity conditions that Bitcoin increasingly tracks as it integrates deeper into macro markets. The evidence suggests the infrastructure for that transmission exists, even if the magnitude and duration of today's move remain uncertain. Bitcoin’s 2026 price may turn on macro liquidity, SEC market access, ETF flows, stablecoin supply, and exchange rules. Track the chokepoint bosses, not influencers. Real yields, which are nominal Treasury yields minus inflation expectations, have emerged as one of the clearest macro drivers of Bitcoin performance. NYDIG research frames Bitcoin as a liquidity barometer with a strengthening inverse relationship to real interest rates. BlackRock has similarly highlighted real yields as a driver of crypto volatility, noting that higher real rates tend to create headwinds for digital assets by making yield-bearing alternatives more attractive and signaling tighter financial conditions. The mechanism linking natural gas to real yields runs through breakeven inflation rates, which the Federal Reserve defines as the difference between nominal 10-year Treasury yields and 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) yields. When energy prices spike persistently, they can push market-based inflation expectations higher, lifting breakevens. If breakevens rise faster than nominal yields, real yields fall, a configuration that tends to support Bitcoin. If nominal yields rise faster, or if the Federal Reserve reprices its policy path amid inflation fears, real yields climb, working as a headwind for risk assets. IMF research documents that commodity price shocks, particularly oil, can move longer-term inflation breakevens. European research ties natural gas price shocks specifically to inflation and inflation expectations, given gas's systemic role in power generation and heating across the continent. The current move differs from typical US-only weather squeezes because it's globally coupled: Asian spot LNG prices hit six-week highs on colder forecasts, while European gas inventories are roughly 52% of capacity, versus a five-year average of 67%. That tightness creates the conditions for a sustained premium rather than a transient weather-driven blip. Bitcoin stability is under threat as a diverging "protein stress ratio" reveals hidden economic risks most experts are missing. Not every energy spike reprices macro. For the natural gas move to translate into real-yield pressure and dollar liquidity shifts, three gates need to open. First, the move must persist beyond the day, changing forward curves and expectations rather than reverting as weather models adjust. The Energy Information Administration expects Henry Hub prices to ease slightly in 2026 but rise sharply in 2027 as LNG export demand growth outpaces domestic supply growth. If the market begins pricing that structural dynamic now, the spike becomes more than positioning noise. Second, inflation expectations must move meaningfully. If 5-year and 10-year breakeven rates drift higher in response to sustained energy pressure, the Fed's policy calculus shifts. Rate cuts get priced out, front-end rates reprice, and real yields climb. This is a configuration Bitcoin tends to struggle against. Third, the dollar must strengthen. Energy-driven inflation scares often support the US dollar as markets anticipate tighter monetary policy or as global risk appetite fades. A stronger dollar typically correlates with tighter financial conditions, reducing the marginal flow of deployable capital into crypto markets. Stablecoin circulation, now exceeding $310 billion, functions as a practical proxy for crypto-native liquidity. Reuters reports USDT circulation at $187 billion, reflecting institutional adoption and scale. When macro conditions tighten, consisting of real yields rising and the dollar strengthening, stablecoin supply growth tends to slow or risk appetite fades, reducing the dry powder available for Bitcoin purchases. The linkage isn't mechanical, but it's observable: Bitcoin performance correlates with periods of stablecoin expansion and loosening dollar liquidity, and underperforms when those conditions reverse. The "rates up, Bitcoin down" era is over. Here is the exact dashboard you need to trade the fallout. The clearest path to Bitcoin resilience is for the weather squeeze to fade quickly. If cold forecasts moderate, LNG demand normalizes, and the natural gas spike retraces, breakevens and real yields remain stable. In that scenario, the macro bite never happens, as this was positioning and weather, not a structural energy premium. Bitcoin's narrative remains insulated from the energy shock, and the move becomes irrelevant beyond a brief correlation blip. The more complex scenario involves the energy premium sticking. Europe and Asia remain cold, low storage keeps LNG bids elevated, and US exports remain high to meet global demand. Breakevens drift upward in response, but the critical variable becomes whether breakevens rise faster than nominal yields or whether the Fed reprices its path more aggressively. If breakevens outpace nominals, real yields fall, a configuration that can support Bitcoin by signaling looser real financial conditions. If the Fed path tightens and nominal yields rise faster, real yields climb, creating a headwind. The worst-case scenario for Bitcoin involves a broader inflation scare. Breakevens jump sharply, front-end rates reprice hawkish as markets price out cuts or price in hikes, the dollar strengthens, and risk assets wobble. That configuration matches the “Bitcoin as liquidity barometer” framing precisely: Bitcoin tends to struggle when real rates rise, and dollar liquidity tightens, as those conditions reduce speculative capital flows and increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. Bitcoin's sensitivity to real yields and dollar liquidity has intensified as institutional participation has grown and as crypto markets have become more tightly integrated with traditional macro flows. The stablecoin infrastructure that now channels hundreds of billions of dollars into crypto markets operates within dollar-denominated liquidity conditions, making crypto markets more reactive to Fed policy, real rates, and currency strength than during earlier cycles, when retail speculation dominated flows. Natural gas spiking 19% in a day doesn't guarantee Bitcoin will sell off, but it activates transmission channels that can reprice real yields and tighten liquidity. Whether those channels stay open depends on how long the energy premium persists, whether inflation expectations adjust, and how the Fed responds. For Bitcoin traders, the relevant question isn't whether natural gas matters in isolation, but whether the energy shock triggers the macro repricing that increasingly governs risk asset performance. The infrastructure for that transmission exists. The next few weeks will clarify whether it activates.

Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. European leaders eye U.S. Treasurys as Greenland leverage, risking a one-month yield shock on Americans. As 40-year yields skyrocket past 4%, the sudden evaporation of cheap yen is forcing a messy global reset.

Title: Wall Street's latest gold rush has found its new target: your retirement

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. What do an employee at a dental imaging company, an English Premier League soccer player, and a saver with an account at BlackRock all have in common? They're all quietly connected to Wall Street's hottest investment class: private credit. The debt that most Americans have dealt with — from credit cards to mortgages — has been upfront: there are bills to pay, balances that are visible, and credit ratings that assess a borrower's creditworthiness. Private credit, or loans made to companies by private investor money gathered into a fund, is much less regulated and much more opaque. The exact terms of the loans, their price, and their ratings can be kept in the shadows and out of regulators' sight. Once a relative backwater in finance, private credit has grown into a $3 trillion industry that is increasingly intertwined with the economy. Small and midsize businesses are utilizing these loans to scale up, from manufacturing plants seeking to purchase new equipment to dental practices looking to expand. Meanwhile, private credit has become the hottest business for some of the finance industry's premier names, including Blackstone and Apollo. To proponents, like Apollo CEO Marc Rowan and Blue Owl co-CEO Marc Lipschultz, access to funding with less onerous requirements is helping American businesses thrive. To naysayers, including UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher and IMF Head Kristalina Georgieva, this explosion of less-transparent debt is unsustainable, and the dubious terms of many of these loans could lead to economic trouble. This fight has now reached a fever pitch as private credit prepares for a retail investor gold rush. There's already $80 billion in retail investor cash in private credit, but Deloitte projects that number will rise to $2.4 trillion by the start of the next decade, thanks to changing rules that will allow more everyday Americans to buy the assets. Depending on who you ask, putting private credit into regular Americans' retirement savings is the key to helping people achieve financial freedom or a recipe for disaster for the entire economy. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter. At its most basic, private credit involves pooling money from investors to then lend to businesses. To facilitate this transaction, an investment firm launches a fund and goes around to people or groups with money — pension funds, ultrawealthy individuals, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments — and gives them a sense of what sort of loans they want to make. Once enough investors agree to pony up, the fund then goes out and finds businesses that need a loan. It could be for hiring employees, building a new factory, or acquiring a competitor. In an ideal world, the loan enables the company to expand operations and revenue and repay the loan plus interest, which ultimately benefits the private credit fund and its own investors as a profit. Companies like these loans because they can be more flexible than bank loans, come together much more quickly, and can be more personalized. Private credit firms and the investors in their funds prefer these loans because the returns are more lucrative than public bonds, with interest rates charged to borrowers 1.5 to 3% higher. The modern private credit industry dates back to Michael Milken and the junk bond boom of the 1980s, but it really took off in the wake of post-2008 financial crisis banking regulations. New laws such as Dodd-Frank prompted banks to move away from risky loans, allowing lenders that didn't operate as banks, including private credit funds, to fill the gap. The idea was that only sophisticated institutional investors or fabulously wealthy individuals who could afford to risk losses would have their money on the line. McKinsey researchers estimated that the industry grew tenfold from 2008 to 2023, while Morgan Stanley analysts estimated that the industry expanded from $2 trillion in 2020 to $3 trillion by the beginning of 2025. As private lending expands, there's an ever-increasing need for capital to fund it — and only so many billionaires and oil-rich nations to ask for money. Kevin Desai, PWC's US and Mexico head of deals, told me that competition for investor money is "at an all-time high." The next step, both regulatorily and logistically, is to open up the funds to private wealth advisors, who can provide access to the money held by America's well-to-do dentists, doctors, small business owners, and less flashy millionaires. And from there, the final step is to get these products out to anyone with a 401(k) or IRA. Why is a fairly esoteric and risky industry looking to the general public to fund its growth, especially since it will require tangling with a thicket of new regulations? To hear the private debt lenders tell it, the move is an evangelical calling. The industry claims that access to its outsize returns will bring wealth to the masses and even help alleviate concerns about the future of retirement. Rowan, Apollo's CEO, has said that countries like Australia, Israel, and Mexico that allow private assets in retirement accounts have had "40% to 50% better outcomes." But it's not so simple. For one, the push may not be as altruistic as the industry claims. Traditional sources of capital for private credit funds are already overallocated to the industry. And while some firms can rest on their laurels, the largest are now publicly traded, which means they face shareholder pressure to continue growing. That's why many private credit funds are willing to take the regulatory and legal risks to open themselves to the average American — the numbers are simply too juicy. The country has about $12 trillion invested in its 401(k)s, and Boston Consulting Group estimates that private wealth could have a $3 trillion stake by 2030. The main roadblock has never been the law — private assets can legally be part of a retirement fund — it's the risk of a lawsuit. American retirement laws give plaintiffs a range of ways they can sue the provider of their retirement plan for not acting as a "fiduciary" or legally-responsible steward of their clients' financial future. The higher fees associated with these private asset funds create a greater opportunity for future retirees to sue their retirement provider for charging excessive fees. After Trump's election, many of the industry's bosses made it clear that they were seeking "litigation relief" to fully move into 401(k) plans. This August, Trump issued an executive order to "democratize access to alternative assets for 401(k) investors" that supported the idea of making it harder to sue, and BlackRock CFO Martin Small told a conference in December that he expects to see real changes in the first quarter of 2026 from both regulatory agencies and Congress. "I have worked in this space my whole career in asset management, and I can tell you that we have seen more progress on this topic of private markets into 401(k) basically in the last year than we've seen in the last 20 years," Small said. For years, private asset funds — both on the equity and debt side — were thought of as the ultimate "smart money." But as the private debt industry eyes your retirement account, the cracks in this mythmaking are starting to show. At the core of the concerns about private debt is the very thing that makes them special — that they're private. The deal terms are opaque, and there's substantially less information about who is lending money to whom and the financial safety of those underlying businesses. Let's say you're lending to a pipe-manufacturing company that buys all of its materials from China. If this loan were public, the impact of tariffs would be immediately reflected in its value, with the price dropping substantially in the publicly traded bond market. But in private credit, the lack of real-time pricing could mean your seemingly high-performing portfolio is actually full of lemons, and you might not know that until you get a note that one of the loans in your portfolio is defaulting. Admittedly, the regular retirement investor isn't taking full advantage of the information available on their investments as it stands. The retirement process in America, whether the underlying asset is public or private, requires trusting that your employer will act as a good steward of your money. "You're hoping that your employer picks the right managers," Alex Blostein, an analyst for Goldman Sachs who covers the large private equity and credit investors, says. The bigger concern is that the kinds of groups and industry watchdogs that do dig into these minutiae may also not have access to the information they need to properly assess risks. In the public markets, every bond offering or debt deal is closely scrutinized by huge rating agencies like Moody's and S&P, which assign publicly available grades. There are ratings in private credit deals, but not only are their ratings under the radar, but some private credit rating firms have attracted attention for the sheer number of ratings they produce per analyst. Egan Jones, which issued over 3,600 ratings on private debt deals in 2024, had only 20 analysts and a substantially higher analyst-to-rating ratio than its competitors. The eye-popping volume recently attracted the attention of the SEC, which is investigating its rating practices. Michael Dimler, a Senior Vice President of Private Corporate Credit at Morningstar, told me that when the firm reviews private credit deals, it receives the same confidential information that lenders do to generate its ratings, and there are "reliable channels of information" to keep investors in the know. In a recent paper, Morningstar DBRS explained how it uses the same policies, procedures, and methodologies for public and private credit ratings, and that the company receives information like "financial statements" and "credit agreements" to rate both public and private credit. This is particularly important for retail investors and everyday savers, as some market watchers worry that the industry will offload its worst private assets to unsophisticated retail investors. Their institutional investors and their own pocketbooks could reap a substantial payout by selling off bad assets at high prices, while retail investors will be left holding worthless assets. "A couple of bad actors could really spoil the party," Blostein says, noting that "some bad examples" could "create big reputational issues for the whole channel" even if most are "trying to do the best thing for their customers." Beyond the fundamental concerns with the private debt business, there are also growing worries that the asset class is not delivering the kind of mega-returns that justify the higher risks. As with credit ratings, actually comparing the public and private debt markets is harder than it sounds. While private credit has a strong case for outperforming its public market equivalents due to the higher interest rates, a recent study by business school academics at Johns Hopkins and UC Irvine argued that the industry's returns are "illusory" and that it fails to consistently beat the public markets. Industry executives and insiders have strongly disputed their findings, but it's a known problem that comparing the performance of different assets in the less standardized private credit market can be challenging. "The investors receive thousands of pages of PDFs, but it is very hard for them to aggregate and have an overview of what is going on and where the money goes," Oxford economist Ludovic Phallipou told the UK House of Lords last year. This presents "quite a mess," and he recommends more standardization of how information is presented. Just as owing money to someone else is a bit nerve-racking, so can relying on being paid back. This is especially true when questions about the borrower's financial stability begin to arise. Therein lies the real heartburn about private credit: What happens if the economy slows and a rash of these companies can't pay back their loans at once? Or a series of private credit funds come under stress? Goldman Sachs' Blostein tells me that private credit is unlikely to cause a market contagion. In layman's terms, you can't pull your money out of these funds whenever you feel like it, with "redemptions" usually restricted to 5% of the fund's total value per quarter. This prevents these funds from being forced to sell off their assets, which would drive down prices and cause a negative feedback loop. "The bank-run style contagion doesn't really exist here," Blostein says, explaining that it's hard to imagine funds blowing up the way, say, Silicon Valley Bank or Lehman Brothers did. Private crediteers also argue that the risk of the asset class causing issues for the financial system or the economy is overblown. For one thing, the industry is still less than a tenth of the size of the US corporate bond market, which is valued at $36 trillion. Advocates also point out that private credit funds are required to maintain a more protective cash reserve compared to the loans they make, compared to banks. While the big banks can lend out more than 10 times what they have in their coffers, the average leverage in private credit is around 1.4 times, said Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman. Responding to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's 2024 quote that "there could be hell to pay" if the private credit market starts to crack, Apollo CEO Rowan said that Dimon has it wrong. "Every dollar that moves out of the banking industry and into the investment marketplace makes the system safer and more resilient and less levered," Rowan said. But there are many other ways these funds are connected to the broader financial world. Institutional investors who provide the capital to launch private debt funds can actually borrow the money they put in, banking on high returns. Private credit funds can borrow money to make investments before investors are able to wire over their commitments or to help cash out investors earlier. These additional levels of leverage increase the potential blast zone for any private credit failures. And the source for many of these loans? Banks. So even if the mega-banks have exited the riskiest lending directly, they are still enmeshed with private investors. In a paper published earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston concluded that there is certainly risk of bank exposure to private credit, but that bank loans to the sector are largely secured and would be among the first to be repaid. This would blunt the broader financial impact of a failure in private credit, though the money would likely be lost in "severely adverse economic conditions." Michael Imerman, who co-authored the piece about private credit returns not being up to snuff, said he did "not want to cry wolf", but there's still a "non-zero" chance private credit could cause a crisis in ways that people aren't anticipating. After all, as a researcher who began studying big banks in 2007, he has seen "black swan" events before. "There's no way that all thousand loans or ten thousand loans will default at the same time. It's a consistent and reliable stream of income, let's add that to your retirement account," Immernam says, mimicking the pre-crash mentality. "What happened? They were wrong, all 10,000 loans defaulted at the same time, and retirement accounts took a giant hit." Beyond the possibility of a larger meltdown, some of the industry's biggest critics, such as Phalippou, are concerned about other issues in private credit, like stronger protections for investors. "I always thought it was quite an emergency, and now with retail in that space, I think it's a drama to not have strong investor protection," Phallipou told the UK Parliament. As for the companies being lent to, the biggest risk is that they may default. Already, some are taking on additional debt to pay off their initial loans or the interest, a process known as "extend and pretend." And if there's a wave of defaults, lenders are likely to become much more selective with who they lend to and increase what they charge to lend, making it even harder for companies to access debt without signing up for extremely unfavorable terms. "The only way to improve perception around all of these issues is more transparency," Blostein says. "And we would always argue for more clarity, more transparency, more data that will enable people to really think through all these issues." While the debate over broader risks rages on, private credit continues to grow. Even firms run by skeptics like JPMorgan are putting aside $50 billion to invest in private credit. And, soon enough, you will be part of the potential money supply. That could create a more stable private credit market, focused on consistent returns for retail customers and providing them with an opportunity to invest in the 87% of US companies with more than $100 million in revenue that are privately held. Or it could mean your retirement is going to be gambled on increasingly novel and risky credit structures that could come crashing down in the next crisis.
