Share this article The Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed approval of staking capabilities for BlackRock’s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund. The regulatory agency has not provided a timeline for when staking features might be approved for the ETF. BlackRock had sought to include staking functionality, which would allow the fund to earn additional returns by participating in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake validation process. Staking involves locking up Ethereum tokens to help secure the network and validate transactions, typically generating annual yields for participants. The decision affects one of the largest asset managers’ efforts to offer comprehensive Ethereum exposure through a regulated investment vehicle. BlackRock manages approximately $10 trillion in assets globally. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: Top Asset Managers Drop Support for Left-Wing Corporate Activism

His work has been published in The Epoch Times, The Federalist, The Daily Signal and The American Conservative. Previously, he worked more than a decade on Wall Street. A decade-long effort to leverage asset managers to impose net-zero and social justice policies on corporations has gone into reverse with reports from this year’s corporate voting season that the most influential fund managers are no longer voting for these policies. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with more than $11 trillion in assets under management, reported that it voted against 98% of the environmental and social shareholder proposals in 2025, up from 96% against in 2024. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest fund manager with more than $10 trillion in assets, did not vote in favor of a single environmental or social proposal. State Street Investment Management, the third largest with more than $5 trillion under management, has not yet released its 2025 proxy voting report. These three fund managers, often called the “Big Three,” together represent about 25% of the votes cast at annual meetings of S&P 500 companies, a 2022 report by Harvard law professor Lucian A. Bebchuk and Boston University law professor Scott Hirst states. The vast majority of U.S. corporate shares are owned by institutional investors such as asset managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, banks, and insurance companies. These institutions owned 78% of the companies in the Russell 3000 index and 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 index, according to a 2017 study by Pensions & Investments. When individuals buy into investment funds, the fund typically owns the companies’ shares and the voting rights that come with them. And many fund managers have in turn voted for environmental and social agendas, according to an analysis by Lindsey Stewart, an investment analyst at Morningstar Inc. In 2020, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative was formed and grew to 330 members, which until recently included the Big Three, pledging to leverage their influence as shareholders to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As a sign of changing times, however, Vanguard quit the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2022, and BlackRock exited this past January, prompting the club to halt operations soon thereafter. Proxy voting has moved in a similar direction. “The Big Three have indeed effectively ended their support for [environmental, social, and governance] proposals in just a few short years,” Tim Schwarzenberger, portfolio manager for Inspire Investing, told The Daily Signal. “The legal landscape and public perception have shifted quickly, and these major players are now catching up, which is a major victory for common sense,” he said. “Most Americans and shareholders do not want corporations engaged in politics.” In addition, red state attorneys general have recently threatened legal action for alleged violations of antitrust laws, and state treasurers have threatened boycotts of left-wing fund managers. Pressure has also come from conservative shareholders, and this, combined with a Trump administration that opposes climate and social-justice agendas, has taken a toll on corporate activism. “Vanguard and BlackRock have skated where the puck has gone, and should be commended for it,” David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, said of this year’s proxy votes. “Investors want investment strategies connected to return on their capital—they do not want the intrusion of a poorly-defined social agenda. “That 2019-2022 experiment has ended, and the verdict was clear,” he told The Daily Signal. Some asset managers also faced charges that political goals diverted them from their fiduciary duties to maximize investor returns. Whether or not this was the case, current rhetoric indicates a focus on shareholder value this voting season. In its 2025 proxy voting report, BlackRock stated that many of the environmental and social proposals it rejected “were overreaching, lacked economic merit, or sought outcomes that were unlikely to promote long-term financial value.” Vanguard likewise stated that it rejected proposals that “did not address financially material risks to shareholders.” Conservatives lauded this approach but say they remain vigilant. “Vanguard’s apparent return to sanity and their fiduciary duty to their clients is welcome news,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Daily Signal. “While there are many other ways that asset managers wield influence over corporations, support for extremist, left-wing activist shareholder proposals has been one of the most noxious.” Vanguard’s report referenced the “voluntary withdrawal of proposals by proponents, often following reported engagement with the company.” Conservatives say that in many cases, corporate management settles with activists prior to the vote, in return for having the proposal dropped. Advocates for corporate activism say it is prudent risk management and that companies that pursue climate and social goals will be more profitable. Critics counter that those issues should be left to voters. “Issues of climate policy and social justice should be addressed primarily at the election ballot box, not through corporate activism that is at odds with the values of many Americans,” Schwarzenberger said. “And in truth, most [Environmental, Social, and Governance] risks are already captured in stock prices, so symbolic shareholder votes add little value.” The Daily Signal reached out to BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street for comment.

Title: Quantum computing startup PsiQuantum raises $1B, aiming to build 1M qubit-scale machine
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/10/quantum-computing-startup-psiquantum-raises-1b-aiming-build-1m-qubit-scale-machine/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T16:50:56Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 12:50 EDT / SEPTEMBER 10 2025 by Kyt Dotson PsiQuantum Inc., a well-funded quantum computing startup, said today it has raised $1 billion in late-stage funding to accelerate its efforts to build a large-scale, reliable quantum computer with more than a million qubits. The Series E deal was led by BlackRock Inc., alongside Temasek and Baillie Gifford. The fundraise brings the valuation of the company to $7 billion, more than doubling the company’s valuation since its $450 million Series D in 2021. The round brought on more than a half-dozen new investors, including Macquarie Capital, Ribbit Capital, Nvidia Corp.’s venture arm NVentures andAdage Capital Management, with participation from existing investors that include Blackbird, Third Point Ventures and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Quantum computers at any scale require error correction and at a scale as large as 1 million qubits, doing so will become a challenging proposition. Qubits are the quantum equivalent of bits in classical computers. Qubits are used to perform calculations similar to traditional computing; however, they possess properties that allow them to represent both a 1 and a 0 simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform extremely complex calculations faster than the largest supercomputers currently available. “Only building the real thing — million-qubit-scale, fault-tolerant machines — will unlock the promise of quantum computing,” said Prof. Jeremy O’Brien, PsiQuantum’s co-founder and chief executive. “We defined what it takes from day one: this is a grand engineering challenge, not a science experiment.” To meet practical demands, quantum computing firms have been pushing machines to larger and larger sizes. Although only suited for very specific computations, quantum computers have shown promise for solving problems in drug discovery, genetics and materials science. When combined with supercomputers in hybrid systems, quantum computers can solve problems in minutes that would take a traditional system months or years. Since 2021, PsiQuantum has scaled its manufacturing process for its integrated photonic chipset, which uses light for storage and communications within the quantum computer. Additionally, the company has incorporated Barium Titanate into its manufacturing process; this is ideal for ultra-high-performance optical switches, which the company states are the missing component for scaling its machines. The company said the funds will help it build its ambitious quantum machine by 2028. PsiQuantum is not the only quantum outfit with plans to build large-scale machines before the end of the decade. IBM Corp. revealed a roadmap with plans for IBM Quantum Starling, a quantum computer capable of performing 20,000 times more operations than today’s machines. The investment comes shortly after rival Quantinuum raised $600 million at a $10 billion valuation this month and Google LLC unveiled Willow, its largest error-correcting quantum computing chip, at the end of 2024. Along with the funding, the company announced a collaboration with Nvidia that will cover the development of quantum algorithms and software, and the integration of graphics processing units with quantum computing chips using its infrastructure. GPUs are a fundamental technology used for the training, deployment and computational acceleration of artificial intelligence models. “AI is built on classical computing, which has underpinned the last fifty years of technology,” said Tony Kim, head of the Fundamental Equities Technology Group at BlackRock. “Now, we are at the dawn of an adjacent computing platform — rooted in quantum mechanics — that will allow us to simulate the physical world with transformative accuracy.” PsiQuantum also develops the cooling, networking and control systems for utility-scale quantum computers. By harnessing light for networking and control, the company said its systems don’t depend on the now iconic-looking “chandelier”-style cryostats often used to chill quantum computers. Using its specialized technology, the company designed a new high-density cooling solution that can be slotted into modular racks at data centers, capable of cooling hundreds of chips in a single cabinet.

Business FILE PHOTO: A specialist trader works at the post where BlackRock is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., July 21, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo DUBAI : A group of investors led by BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners is in talks with lenders to secure up to $10.3 billion in financing for Aramco's Jafurah infrastructure deal, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Banks including JPMorgan and Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation are in talks to participate in the transaction, the two sources said, which will allow Aramco to raise cash upfront in return for steady payments over time. The debt financing will be split into two parts, a short-term and a long-term loan, said the people, declining to be named because the matter is not public. Aramco, BlackRock, JPM and SMBC declined to comment. Under the deal, a newly formed subsidiary, Jafurah Midstream Gas Company (JMGC), will lease development and usage rights for gas processing facilities around the Jafurah gas development and lease them back to Aramco for 20 years.

It drew more than $16.5 billion in orders on Wednesday for the sukuk, expected to price later in the day.The deal also reflects Saudi Arabia's broader energy strategy. By displacing crude oil in domestic power generation, more barrels will be available to export, as feedstock for petrochemicals, and to power emerging sectors such as artificial intelligence data centres.The GIP consortium is injecting about $1.8 billion of their own funds into the transaction, the two sources said.Roughly three-quarters of the debt financing will have a seven-year tenor - and could be refinanced via bonds - and the rest will be due in 19 years, one of the sources said. Chinese banks have shown interest in helping to finance the short tenor, the source added. Goldman Sachs, Citi, Mizuho and MUFG have also signalled interest in participating in the financing, a third source told Reuters.

The Jafurah field, estimated to contain 229 trillion standard cubic feet of raw gas, is the largest non-associated gas development in Saudi Arabia and a cornerstone of Aramco's plan to boost gas output by 60 per cent by 2030 from 2021 levels.

HYPE holders are smiling to the bank as potential issuers fight over USDH. The Hyperliquid’s USDH race is now down to Native Markets and Paxos. Who will win the deal by the 14th of September? Hyperliquid’s [HYPE] proposed stablecoin, USDH, has triggered one of the most aggressive bidding wars in the crypto sector. Top issuers like Ethena [ENA], Paxos, Sky [SKY] (formerly Maker), Frax, and others are all out fighting to be the official partner. But the top contender in the race, Native Markets, is a new player with no experience, which Dragonfly claims has been ‘fixed’ to win. Slamming the process as a ‘farce,’ Dragonfly VC managing partner Haseeb Qureshi alleged that it was rigged in favor of Native Markets. “Hearing from multiple bidders that none of the validators are interested in considering anyone besides Native Markets. It’s not even a serious discussion, as though there was a backroom deal already done.” Source: X He cited Polymarket odds, bidders, and Native Markets’ immediate proposal after Hyperliquid floated the request, suggesting the team had prior knowledge before the announcement was made public. At the time of writing, however, the contest has narrowed to Paxos and Native Markets. The chances of Paxos winning the bid surged to 47% after the revised proposal, but dropped a few hours later. Still, the market was pricing Native Markets for a likely win at nearly 60%. Source: Polymarket Most of the potential issuers are pledging 95%-100% HYPE value accrual, alongside support by regulated entities like BlackRock. Source: AMBCrypto All proposals from potential issuers should be finalized by the 10th of September. On the 11th of September, Hyperliquid validators should state their preferred potential issuer. The final vote by validators will be done on the 14th of September to allow stakers to align with the validators that mirror their choice. But what does Hyperliquid want to achieve with the USDH? And why now? Currently, Circle’s USDC dominates the decentralized exchange (DEX) and the chain, with $5.5 billion worth of USDC. However, the yield gained ($100M) is not shared with Hyperliquid but with rival Coinbase (as per its agreement with Circle). Source: Reciprocal Ventures Apart from ecosystem growth, the stablecoin should help handle regulatory risks. Especially on the on/off ramp side, according to James Evans, investment analyst at Reciprocal Ventures. “That risk could materialize as an attack on Hyperliquid’s on/off ramps. So in addition to being a product decision, having a compliant stablecoin could be a first step to building regulatory legitimacy.” Some, like Arthur Hayes, have backed Ethena for the USDH bid. But others have pointed out that Paxos and Ethena have existing stablecoin products that would lead to conflicting interests. Amid the bidding wars for USDH, HYPE holders have come out as the main beneficiary. The altcoin printed a new high of $55, up about 20% since the bidding began over the weekend.

Title: US  judge approves Vanguard’s $25m settlement over inflated tax bills

Time Published: 2025-09-10T12:54:08Z
Full Content:
A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to Vanguard Group’s $25m settlement of a lawsuit alleging that the mutual fund giant improperly burdened investors with excessive tax bills, reported Reuters. The settlement relates to the company’s target-date funds and comes after a previous $40m proposal was rejected. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more US District Judge John Murphy in Philadelphia deemed the settlement “sufficiently fair, reasonable, and adequate.” The initial $40m settlement offer, rejected on 19 May, was turned down by Murphy due to concerns that Vanguard could offset this amount against its January settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he believed would better serve investors as it did not involve legal fees. Investors’ attorneys have highlighted that the $25m is in addition to a $133m fair fund established in the SEC case. Judge Murphy has scheduled a hearing for 6 January 2026, to consider final approval of the settlement. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The lawsuit stemmed from a December 2020 decision by Vanguard to lower the minimum investment required for its cheaper institutional fund classes from $100m to $5m. This change prompted a shift of investors from higher-cost retail classes to these institutional classes, resulting in asset sales and the distribution of taxable capital gains to the remaining investors. Vanguard, with headquarters in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, manages $11tn in assets as of 31 July, the news agency added. The case, known as In re Vanguard Chester Funds Litigation, is being heard in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, under case number 22-00955. In a separate development, a Texas federal court ruled against dismissing a separate lawsuit accusing Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and State Street’s asset management division of anti-competitive behaviour in the coal industry. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle determined that most of the claims, which allege anti-competitive conduct by BlackRock, Vanguard Group, and State Street’s asset management branch, merit further examination in court.

Title: Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin race heats up as Native Markets takes lead amid Paxos’ proposal

With 84% Polymarket odds, Native Markets aims to solidify its lead against evolving proposals from industry veterans. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Hyperliquid’s decision to launch its stablecoin has sparked one of the most competitive governance battles in recent memory. Last week, the decentralized exchange, which had been relying on Circle’s USDC for its liquidity, announced plans to introduce USDH as its native stablecoin. The move immediately attracted a wave of bidders, each vying for the right to issue the token and capture billions in potential value. At least eight organizations have already submitted proposals, including established players like Paxos, Ethena, Agora, and OpenEden. Validators on the Hyperliquid network will ultimately decide who secures the mandate, but in the meantime, speculators have taken to Polymarket to place their bets on the outcome. According to Polymarket odds, one group, Native Markets, stands out as the clear favorite in a market above the $1 million trading volume mark as of press time. Crypto traders on the decentralized marketplace assigned the newcomer a 90% chance of winning the validator vote, but that percentage has dropped to 84% at the time of this report. Native Markets was formed specifically to compete for USDH and is led by Max Fiege, an investor within the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The firm’s pitch proposes a hybrid reserve model in which off-chain assets would be managed by BlackRock, while the on-chain reserves would be held through Superstate using Bridge, a Stripe-owned platform. Native Markets also pledged to split yield from reserve assets, with half earmarked for HYPE token buybacks and half for USDH expansion. Meanwhile, Native Market’s proposal structure has generated both interest and skepticism from community members. In Agora’s proposal, Nick Van Eck, the founder of Agora, pointed out that Native Markets’ proposal reliance on Stripe could prove detrimental to Hyperliquid in the long run. According to him: Join The Crypto Investor Blueprint — 5 days of pro-level strategies to turbocharge your portfolio. Please add [email protected] to your email whitelist. Stay connected via “Stripe recently announced their plans for Tempo, a new layer 1 blockchain. Stripe is committed to driving activity to this ecosystem from a variety of players. How long until Stripe and Bridge start pushing users and perps from other financial applications directly to Tempo instead of Hyperliquid?” Despite these concerns, Dragonfly Capital’s Haseeb Qureshi suggested that Native Markets may have had advance notice of the request-for-proposals process, given how quickly its submission appeared. He wrote: “Everyone else scrambled over the weekend to put something together. So this whole USDH RFP was basically custom made for Native Markets.” However, Alex Svavenik, the CEO of Nansen, countered this claim by stressing that validators have been deeply engaged with all bidders. According to him, the process is far more competitive than critics suggest, with validators actively seeking the best long-term option for Hyperliquid. While Hyperliquid validators might appear inclined toward Native Markets, observers point to Paxos, Ethena, and Agora as candidates with stronger institutional track records. Moreover, these rival firms have been refining their offers, and new entrants are introducing new bids for the USDH stablecoin. On Sept. 10, Paxos unveiled a revised plan centered on a partnership with PayPal. According to the firm, this collaboration would embed USDH into PayPal and Venmo products, list HYPE on PayPal’s ramps, and inject $20 million in incentives for the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Paxos also set strict revenue caps to assure the community of its long-term alignment. It wrote: “Paxos takes nothing until we reach $1 billion in TVL and stays capped at 5% post $5 billion TVL. Any fees earned by Paxos through this milestone will be held in HYPE tokens.” Speaking on the updated proposal, Max Fantle, a Paxos executive, said: “PayPal and Venmo have 400M+ users. Paxos is the only neutral, regulated issuer that can unlock an entirely new institutional customer segment for Hyperliquid that no other issuer can reach.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Polymarket’s Top Trader Bets on a 50bps Fed Rate Cut Next Week
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/10/polymarket-s-top-trader-bets-on-a-50bps-fed-rate-cut-next-week
Time Published: 2025-09-10T06:12:26Z
Full Content:
A leading trader on decentralized betting platform Polymarket, who goes by the name JustWakingUp, is wagering that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates by 50 basis points (bps) next week. According to X handle Polymarket Whales, JustWakingUp is the platform’s most prolific trader, boasting nearly $400 million in total trading volume to date and profits exceeding $2 million. The trader has placed a $15,000 bet that the Fed will reduce rates by 50 bps to 3.75% next week and is already showing a 3% gain on the position as of writing. The trader stands to make roughly $226,000 if the Fed does cut rates by 5 bps. The market, however, largely expects the Fed to deliver a 25 basis point cut next week, with the CME’s FedWatch Tool assigning a 91% probability to such an outcome. That said, the odds of a jumbo 50 bps cut have surged to nearly 10% following Friday’s disappointing August jobs report, reflecting growing expectations of more aggressive easing. BlackRock and StanChart have called for a 50 bps cut. Adding to market expectations, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Tuesday that the economy added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months ending March 2025 than previously estimated, marking the largest annual downward revision on record. Traders are now closely watching Wednesday’s U.S. Producer Price Index and Thursday’s Consumer Price Index data releases. Softer-than-expected readings could add to expectations for a 50 bps cut, potentially sending bitcoin and stocks higher.

Title: CoinShares Sets Sights on Wall Street: Will the $1.2B Nasdaq Debut Redefine Crypto
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/coinshares-sets-sights-on-wall-street-1-2b-nasdaq/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T03:00:56Z
Full Content:
CoinShares, Europe’s largest digital asset manager with approximately $10 billion in assets under management, has announced plans to go public in the United States through a $1.2 billion merger with Vine Hill Capital, a Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The transaction would see CoinShares shift from Stockholm to Wall Street, signaling a major step in its bid for global dominance. Ranked as the fourth-largest digital asset exchange-traded product (ETP) manager globally, behind BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, CoinShares currently holds a commanding 34% market share in Europe. Over the past two years, its assets under management have tripled, fueled by strong inflows and the rapid expansion of its product lineup, which has grown from just four offerings in 2021 to 32 across multiple platforms. CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti described the move as “far more than a venue change,” framing the Nasdaq listing as a gateway to global leadership. He highlighted the U.S. as the hub of digital asset innovation, where institutional demand and improving regulatory clarity are creating fertile ground for expansion. CoinShares operates with industry-leading margins, 76% adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2025, and has built a diversified business model based on recurring fee revenues supplemented by trading activities. With its proven European strategy, the company now seeks to capture U.S. investors by introducing a broader suite of digital asset products, including tokenized real-world assets. The $1.2 billion deal, priced at a discount compared to peer valuations, includes a $50 million institutional anchor investment. Both company boards have approved the merger, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. Upon completion, the combined entity will trade under Odysseus Holdings Limited. The timing of CoinShares’ U.S. expansion coincides with a wave of favorable regulatory developments, including the rollback of restrictive SEC policies and the drafting of new legislation aimed at fostering a clearer market structure for crypto. If successful, CoinShares’ Nasdaq debut could not only strengthen its foothold in the world’s largest asset management market but also set a precedent for how European crypto firms scale globally.

Title: BlackRock Continues to Offload Millions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, But for How Long?
URL: https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-continues-to-offload-millions-in-bitcoin-ethereum-but-for-how-long/
Time Published: 2025-09-09T22:24:24Z

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock moved $640 million in crypto assets to Coinbase Prime over two days, with deposits of 44,774 ETH and 900 BTC on September 9, following similar moves on September 8. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager and the leading institution in Bitcoin BTC $114 011 24h volatility: 1.6% Market cap: $2.27 T Vol. 24h: $48.11 B and Ethereum ETH $4 433 24h volatility: 2.4% Market cap: $535.09 B Vol. 24h: $36.58 B exchange-traded funds (ETFs), offering via iShares products IBIT and ETHA, traded on Nasdaq. Differently from TradFi, part of BlackRock’s activities can be seen on-chain, with BTC and ETH moves to (deposits) and from (withdrawals) Coinbase Prime accounts, usually representing sales and purchases, respectively. On that note, Lookonchain and other on-chain analytic tools have been monitoring BlackRock activity, spotting recent likely sell-offs in the past two days, with significant deposits to Coinbase. On September 9, BlackRock-owned accounts deposited 44,774 ETH, worth $195.29 million, and 900 BTC, worth $101.67 million, to Coinbase Prime, based on Lookonchain’s post. Before that, on September 8, the asset manager was seen depositing 72,370 ETH, worth $312 million, and 266.79 BTC, worth $29.88 million. BlackRock just sold 44,774 $ETH($195.29M) and 900 $BTC($101.67M) again.https://t.co/bcKGkl1VXE pic.twitter.com/xyubPNpGjK — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 9, 2025 BlackRock’s market-making activities are a direct reflection of the ETFs’ net capital flows. They should represent the real-world adjustment and settlement of the ETFs’ holdings to match investor demand for shares, bridging traditional finance (TradFi) trading on Nasdaq with the crypto market. Nevertheless, the deposits and withdrawals are not necessarily representing all the sales and purchases in real time—simply reserve adjustments. For example, on September 8, IBIT and ETHA saw net flows of +229 BTC, worth $25.50 million, and -43,770 ETH, worth $192.70 million, respectively, according to data from Coinglass. On September 9, however, IBIT added 227 BTC. Lookonchain reported this movement in the September 9 update, showing similar numbers that conflict with the recently observed on-chain activity. Total Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETF net inflows | Source: Coinglass Both assets had massive outflows last Friday, on September 5, which may have required the reserve adjustments on Coinbase Prime, as seen earlier today from the Lookonchain report, causing large deposits and sell-offs. Or, institutions are positioning in advance of a yet unknown pricing event, as smart money like BlackRock can be seen as a market canary. Now, the price charts appear to be forming a bullish structure for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, potentially signaling a recovering institutional interest, again conflicting with the signal from Wall Street whales. Additionally, Arkham has reported BlackRock is “buying more” cryptocurrencies, reaching over $100 billion in total reserves. BLACKROCK NOW HOLDS OVER $100B IN CRYPTO AND THEY’RE BUYING MORE pic.twitter.com/7eRAzJ0fod — Arkham (@arkham) September 9, 2025 CrypNuevo, a prominent Bitcoin analyst with a relevant accuracy rate, believes BTC is poised for a bull rally in the following days, hunting upward liquidity in the expectation of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. $BTC Sunday update: 10 days until the first Interest Rate cut this cycle, and the chart is undecided with choppy Price Action. Uptrend structure is intact but sentiment is bearish in this pullback and many are calling it a sell the news event. How am I playing this? 🧵↓(1/7) pic.twitter.com/h1Y4DhFXK7 — CrypNuevo 🔨 (@CrypNuevo) September 7, 2025 Other indicators, like Tether minting 2 billion USDT during a market dip, very similar to what happened in December 2024, could also suggest it is time to buy and not sell, as seen in BlackRock’s recent activities. All that only evidences the volatility and complexity of short-term speculation, which is affected by a lot of nuance and different factors, together with big players’ movements.

The decentralized exchange and layer-1 network is currently being powered by Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT0, but Hyperliquid’s community is currently soliciting proposals on a “Hyperliquid-alinged” stablecoin that could serve as an alternative. Proposals have already been penned by entities including stablecoin issuer Paxos, but Ethena’s proposal emphasizes that its support would also come with that of its partners. Ethena flexed partnerships with Anchorage Digital, a federally chartered digital assets bank, and Securitize, the BlackRock-backed, real-world asset tokenization firm. Anchorage issues Ethena’s USDtb stablecoin, which is backed by BlackRock’s tokenized BUIDL fund. “We are excited to enable Ethena’s USDtb, which is 100% backed by BUIDL and uniquely positioned to offer institutional grade cash management as well as on-chain liquidity to Hyperliquid users,” BlackRock Head of Digital Assets Robert Mitchnick said in the proposal. Introduced in the first quarter of 2023, Hyperliquid was viewed as a scrappy DeFi Startup not too long ago. But now projects like Ethena are clamoring for its feedback, underscoring how that perception is changing. Hyperliquid has $5.7 billion in stablecoins on its network, for example, according to crypto data provider DefiLlama. Under Ethena’s proposal, USDH would be initially backed by USDtb, and therefore have indirect backing from the $14 trillion asset manager’s BUIDL fund. With at least 95% of the revenue generated by USDH’s reserves, distributions would be made to Hyperliquid’s so-called Assistance Fund, alongside HYPE purchases and distributions to validators. HYPE changed hands around $53 on Tuesday, a 20% increase over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The token serves as Hyperliquid’s governance token, letting holders participate in the process of voting on software upgrades and other initiatives. If Ethena receives a green light, the project would cover transaction costs associated with making USDH the go-to stablecoin within Hyperliquid’s exchange, its proposal adds. Among other notable benefits, the proposal states that Anchorage would issue Ethena’s USDtb stablecoin natively on Hyperliquid’s network. On top of that, Securitize would deploy its platform on the layer-1, bringing “institutional grade tokenized funds, stocks, and other financial products to the Hyperliquid ecosystem for no deployment cost.” CORRECTION (September 10, 2025, 12:17 p.m. PT): Removes mention of World Liberty Financial, which is not among the suitors for Hyperliquid's stablecoin.

Title: BlackRock Just Sold $192 Million Worth of Ethereum — Has ETH Peaked?

Ethereum ETFs recently witnessed major selling activity as the crypto market remained under pressure overall. The second-largest digital currency by market capitalization experienced a bullish August overall, as the price index witnessed significant appreciation fueled by a buying frenzy from institutional investors. However, the bullish ETF action has cooled considerably in September, and this is reflected in the price index. Ethereum is currently changing hands at around $4.3k at press time. The cryptocurrency has been trading flat around this level for the better part of the last week despite sizable ETF outflows. Here are details of ETF flows for the last 10 days or so: According to the figures from CoinGlass, Ethereum ETFs have witnessed around $1 billion in consecutive outflows since 29 August. In the last two days alone, more than $540 million has been pulled out of these financial instruments, which is generally not a good sign for any underlying asset. BlackRock alone sold $192 million yesterday, while Grayscale witnessed a minor addition of $11 million. Some Ethereum and crypto critics were quick to jump on this prolonged selling spree over at the ETFs as a sign that a bear market is imminent. However, ETFs are only a small portion of the market. Most of the Ethereum is still being bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges or held in private wallets. Over there, the situation is opposite. According to one crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), known as The Martini Guy, the premier programmable digital currency is experiencing a record decline on exchanges. He tweeted: “ETHEREUM ON EXCHANGES HAVE DROPPED TO A NEW LOW WHALES ARE BUYING SO MUCH $ETH RIGHT NOW!” His analysis indicates that exchange activity is showing massive Ethereum buying by whales who are snapping it up at relatively cheap prices and taking it offline in their wallets. Conventional wisdom suggests that once these ETH are removed from the exchanges, it helps create a supply shock that benefits the bulls. The stark contrast between ETF activity and exchange activity reveals that two major market forces are at work on these respective platforms, with the former exhibiting a bearish inclination and the latter witnessing bullish action. It remains to be seen which of these two will be able to dominate the market in the coming weeks and months, which are absolutely crucial as we approach the anticipated end of the 2025 bull market.

Ethena is committed to returning 95% of net revenue generated from USDH reserves directly to the Hyperliquid community through HYPE token purchases. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethena Labs submitted a proposal on Sept. 9 to become the issuer of Hyperliquid’s native stablecoin USDH, joining an increasingly competitive race. The bid consists of backing USDH entirely by USDtb, a stablecoin backed by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, with the support of Anchorage Digital. Ethena is committed to returning 95% of net revenue generated from USDH reserves directly to the Hyperliquid community through HYPE token purchases and ecosystem development. Hyperliquid launched the competitive selection process for USDH following a Sept. 5 announcement that the protocol would introduce its native stablecoin in the next network upgrade. The move targets the $5.5 billion in USDC deposits currently serving as the primary settlement currency on the decentralized exchange. The selection carries significant financial implications for Hyperliquid, which currently records nearly $1.3 billion in estimated annualized revenue, according to DefiLlama data. Additionally, the network achieved an all-time high monthly trading volume of $405.8 billion in perpetual contracts during August. Ethena’s proposal differentiates itself through institutional partnerships and proposed security infrastructure. The company plans to establish an elected guardian network of Hyperliquid validators to oversee USDH operations, removing single-issuer control over the stablecoin’s security management. Beyond basic stablecoin issuance, Ethena outlined plans to launch hUSDe, a Hyperliquid-native variant of its synthetic dollar product, and committed $75 million in incentives to support HIP-3 market development.

Stay connected via The firm also announced partnerships with Securitize to deploy tokenized real-world assets on HyperEVM and native USDtb integration. Competing proposals offer distinct approaches to USDH backing and governance. Paxos proposes backing through New York Department of Financial Services-protected accounts with monthly KPMG attestations. Frax Finance plans frUSD backing through treasury partnerships with BlackRock and Superstate. Agora offers short-dated US Treasuries with proof of reserves powered by Chaos Labs. Sky proposes flexible collateral backing through its risk management framework with LayerZero interoperability. The validator-driven selection process requires proposal approval through community governance before proceeding to a gas auction for final deployment rights. Omar Kanji from Dragonfly estimates the transition could generate $220 million in additional annualized revenue for HYPE holders while reducing Circle’s USDC supply by 7%. Ethena emphasized its track record managing over $23 billion in tokenized dollar assets and positioned itself as the largest counterparty capable of supporting Hyperliquid’s expansion into equity perpetual swaps through HIP-3 markets.

Title: Tokenization Scales From Checkout Security to Central Bank Pilots

Highlights Payment tokenization masks card data, slashes fraud and boosts authorization. Asset tokenization enables fractional ownership, instant settlement and 24/7 trading. Central banks and the BIS are modeling tokenized money and unified ledgers. Tokenization has emerged from a niche concept to a strategic imperative across financial services, increasingly underpinning payment security and the trading of real-world assets.

Δ The catch-all moniker might be viewed as shorthand for the secure transmission of information, but use cases differ, and what follows is a primer to shed some light on the finer points of this digital shift. Distinct tracks are developing in parallel: Credit card networks such as Visa and Mastercard convert a card’s primary account number (PAN) into a token. That token is used in place of the real card number across digital wallets, card-on-file providers and in-store NFC payments. Visa now issues billions of tokens, roughly half of global eCommerce transactions are tokenized, with 7% growth in the last quarter alone, bringing total tokens to 15 billion. Visa CEO Ryan McInerney said on a second-quarter 2025 earnings call with analysts in April that tokenization also plays a role in artificial intelligence-facilitated commerce. “Visa Intelligent Commerce … enables consumers to shop and buy with AI agents,” he said. “It combines a suite of integrated APIs, including AI-ready cards with tokenization and authentication, together with a commercial partner program for AI platforms, enabling developers to deploy Visa’s AI commerce capabilities securely and at scale.” Mastercard reported in June that nearly half of its online transactions in Europe are tokenized, and the company is moving toward fully phasing out manual card entries by 2030. Building on this, Mastercard in April unveiled Agent Pay, a product suite embedding programmable token services into agent-led commerce and subscription flows. The initiative positions tokenization as an enabler of new business models, from delegated payments to merchant-agnostic loyalty linking. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization involves turning tangible assets, like real estate, stocks, bonds or commodities, into tradable blockchain tokens. Kraken, BlackRock and R3 are among firms advancing RWA tokenization. Kraken now offers tokenized U.S. equities for eligible non-U.S. clients via offshore subsidiaries, allowing 24/7 trading and settlement. R3 and Solana are collaborating to bring regulated assets on-chain, with R3 reporting over $10 billion in regulated assets already live across its private networks. Tokenization offers benefits: Yet challenges remain: Tokenization is also redefining global money movement. On-chain rails bypass the frictions of correspondent banking and support programmable features like real-time compliance checks. Examples are multiplying. Vera Capital announced in April a partnership with Blocksquare to tokenize commercial real estate, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink declared in a shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized.” R3 and Solana’s tie-up illustrates this shift. “The future of capital markets will be built on public infrastructure,” Solana Foundation President Lily Liu said, while R3 CEO David E. Rutter called it “a strategic realignment for the entire industry.” Kraken’s launch of xStocks, or tokenized U.S. equities tradable 24/7, demonstrates the leap from pilot to production. Backed one-to-one by custodied shares, these tokens allow fractional ownership and instant settlement. Kraken has since announced multichain expansions, aiming to give investors a choice of blockchain ecosystems while maintaining regulatory compliance. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said tokenized money and assets could reshape monetary policy and payments. A BIS study said a tokenized, unified ledger run by public authorities could replicate stablecoin benefits without private-coin risks. The BIS and Federal Reserve Bank of New York also co-authored experimental work showing how smart contracts might automate liquidity operations and policy transmission. The Federal Reserve is likewise active, hosting workshops and joint research with the BIS on tokenization and payments modernization. Fed staff have stressed the need for interoperable standards on settlement finality, identity and dispute resolution to ensure tokenization scales responsibly. Through Project Pine, which offers a prototypical tokenization “toolkit” to pay interest on reserves, there’s the exploration where “central bank reserves are digital tokens that exist in the token arrangement with other types of money and securities … Above the settlement layer is the ‘asset layer,’ consisting of the wholesale money and securities issued … These tokens represented the reserves, commercial bank deposits, securities and unsecuritized assets that would be used in testing scenarios.” Together, these projects underscore how public authorities aim to integrate tokenization into regulated infrastructures while private firms race ahead with commercial deployments.

Decentralized finance protocol Ethena ENA$0.7667 submitted Tuesday a proposal to issue Hyperliquid's upcoming stablecoin, joining a bidding race that has already attracted a slew of companies like Paxos, Sky, Frax and Agora. The token would be fully backed by Ethena's USDtb, a stablecoin issued with federally chartered bank Anchorage Digital and fully backed by BUIDL, the tokenized money market fund by asset management giant BlackRock and Securitize. "We are excited to enable Ethena’s USDtb, which is 100% backed by BUIDL and uniquely positioned to offer institutional grade cash management as well as on-chain liquidity to Hyperliquid users," said Robert Mitchnick, Blackrock's head of digital assets, in the proposal. If adopted, Ethena pledged that 95% of net revenue from USDH reserves would flow back to the Hyperliquid ecosystem, the proposal said. Ethena also said it would cover the costs of migrating existing USDC trading pairs on Hyperliquid to USDH to ease adoption. The proposal comes as competition to win the issuance of Hyperliquid's USDH stablecoin is intensifies. The decentralized exchange executed almost $400 billion in perpetuals trading volume last month, making it an attractive market for stablecoin providers to corner. Sky (formerly MakerDAO), Paxos, Sky, Frax, Agora and Native Markets threw their hat in the ring. Validators are set to vote on proposals on September 14.

Title: Elon Musk’s Trillion-Dollar Pay Package Is Just Bad Corporate Governance

Time Published: 2025-09-09T13:20:53Z

Yale SOM leadership expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and co-author Stephen Henriques write that the gargantuan package proposed by Tesla—based on a series of implausible performance targets—suggests a board in thrall to its charismatic, erratic CEO. Elon Musk at the grand opening of the Tesla Giga Texas plant in 2022. This commentary originally appeared in Fortune. The views expressed are the author’s own. Elon Musk has once again captured media attention. This time, however, it isn’t a rogue X rant or embittered comments about President Trump’s abuse of executive authority. Instead, a proposed $1 trillion pay package crafted by Tesla’s board and Musk has grabbed headlines. The proposed scheme is ludicrous not only in terms of the highly aspirational 12 milestones that would unlock the benefits, but also in terms of good governance practice. Even needing to support 14 children with four different mothers, how much capital does Musk need? The argument that Musk needs additional incentive to lead Tesla to new heights runs entirely counter to the fact that he owns nearly 20% of the company’s outstanding shares and will already be well rewarded from any upside in the company’s performance. If Tesla were to achieve an $8.5 trillion market cap, as outlined by one of the pay package milestones, Musk would be worth over $1.6 trillion, based on that current ownership stake. Musk is the richest person in the world (or second if you believe that number one is Vladimir Putin), and nearly twice as wealthy as the individuals ranked third and fourth, Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg, respectively. Estimated to be worth over $437 billion, none of Musk’s lifestyle, resources, or influence will meaningfully change from any material increase in wealth. After threatening to walk away from Tesla earlier this year, Musk received a $30 billion pay package after a federal judge denied him a $50 billion package. It is shameful for Musk to now be holding shareholders hostage to suit his need for power. Renowned founders such as Bernie Marcus of Home Depot, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Michael Dell of Dell Technologies, Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone, Sam Walton of Walmart, and Larry Fink of BlackRock never fabricated shakedown strategies like this to regain more control of their companies after they went public. Moreover, should Musk act on his threat and leave Tesla, he would be the biggest loser as the largest shareholder of the biggest meme stock in financial market history. Tesla has a P/E ratio of over 200x, compared to the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia, at nearly 50x, so a 50% drop in the existing Tesla market cap of $1.1 trillion would result in a $110 billion loss in paper wealth, a quarter of Musk’s estimated worth. The performance milestones in the proposed pay package are both illusional and delusional. According to the proposal, Tesla is required to deliver 20 million vehicles, a significant increase from the 1.8 million delivered in 2024. The company must also distribute one million robots. They have not even developed a fully functional humanoid robot. Additional benchmarks require one million robotaxis to be placed into commercial operation, versus 30 on the roads today, and 10 million subscribers for its Full Self Driving service, compared to approximately 1 million in 2024. Most jarring are the mandates for the company to more than double the $4 trillion market cap of Nvidia and to notch $400 billion of adjusted EBITDA, versus $16.65 billion in 2024. Despite the absurdity of the performance package, the federal government does not need to intervene, as it has been so inclined to do lately. If stockholders do not like the proposed pay package, then they will vote against the proposal or sell their stock holdings. Of course, shareholders, not the government, should be asking important questions—of which there are many—about the necessity for such a rich payout and high ownership stake. One of those burning questions: If Musk preferred maintaining so much control, then why did he take Tesla public? The centrality of the chief executive to the success of the company is far more symbolic in the eyes of tech bros than it is substantive in the eyes of the average customer. In fact, as of late, he has been the most detrimental factor to the Tesla sales pipeline, which is on track to fall for the second year in a row. Sales in Europe have notably fallen by 40% year-over-year, ceding its dominant market position to Chinese EV automaker BYD for the first time. The Chinese market has been just as challenging for Tesla, which has experienced repeated sales declines over several months this year and has yielded more than half its market share to competitors since 2021. Many Tesla enthusiasts would be surprised to know that Musk did not create Tesla, but he squeezed out its first CEO, co-founder Martin Eberhard, along with Tesla’s other co-founder Marc Tarpenning. They were the ones who named the company for the brilliant, penniless inventor of alternating currents, wireless remote controls, and X-rays in 2003. The plunging sales of Telsa have been directly linked to a global consumer backlash after Musk’s endorsement of the German AFD party—considered a Nazi apologist group—and a U.S. consumer backlash against his DOGE initiative, a tornado of cruel, dangerous, self-interested destruction of vital federal agencies, in partisan service to President Trump. While Musk may be the greatest inventor of our time, his magic wand is overhyped. Most of his private companies, such as Neuralink, The Boring Company, X/Twitter, and SolarCity, have been a bust or seen lackluster performance. Solar City was a failure that got jammed down the throats of unrelated Tesla shareholders. It would take a lot of nerve to celebrate the delayed success of Neuralink. X/Twitter’s value collapsed after Musk took control. At least there is truth in advertising for the Boring Company. It lives up to its name by failing to connect the scores of cities with high speed tunnels that were promised years ago. SpaceX has seen success primarily due to a stable flow of government contracts and subsidies, and the steady operating hand of president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell. xAI has potential but its Grok chatbot raised many concerns when it began spewing pro-Nazi/Hitler and antisemitic pronouncements soon after Musk tampered with the large language model’s algorithm. The board is suffering from what political scientists and psychologists call “groupthink,” psychiatrists label folie à deux, social workers call “codependence,” and normal people recognize as an infatuation with a charismatic, cultish powerful figure. We have seen this happen before at Viacom with Sumner Redstone and CBS with Bill Paley. We’ve seen it with Ken Olsen at Digital Equipment Corporation, once the world’s second-largest tech company but no longer in business. And we saw it with Juan Trippe at Pan American World Airways, the now-defunct pioneer of transoceanic travel that was once America’s flagship carrier. The original nationwide coffee house pioneer, William Black, ran the Chock full O’Nuts chain that he founded into his mid-80s when he was flat on his back in the hospital while his full-time physician and lifelong friend served as the president. Those boards followed such charismatic CEOs, who lived on the edge, until they ran right off the cliff.

Title: Real-World Assets Nearly Died. Now They’re Soaring In Crypto
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/09/09/real-world-assets-nearly-died-now-theyre-soaring-in-crypto/

BySandy Peng, Contributor. For years, tokenization was where good ideas went to die. Hundreds of projects promised to change the financial world forever, by putting real estate, stocks, and commodities on different blockchains. But by 2021, over 90% had failed to achieve meaningful trading volume, with many industry insiders writing post-mortems, and investors moving on. The experiment, it seemed, was over. Then, something strange started to happen. While everyone turned their heads to Capitol Hill in the hopes of regulations clearing, tokenized RWAs grew from $5 billion to $24 billion in just two years. It seemed that the years of failed experiments didn’t stop the idea – but refined it instead. Some argue this is only the beginning. While most RWAs today see limited transaction volume, their long-term implications could be transformative. As assets from real estate to commodities and intellectual property move onchain, we may edge closer to a system where value is swapped directly for value, a modern form of digital bartering. In such a world, dollar-denominated settlements in global trade could diminish, especially as AI-driven financial coordination accelerates. Last month, in July 2025, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group acquired a ¥100 billion office tower in Osaka. The bank’s plan was unusual: convert the entire 30-story building into onchain tokens. Soon, retail investors will be able to buy fractional ownership, with institutional allocations handled via Japan’s digital securities rails (Progmat/STs). Every transaction will settle in seconds, and every ownership transfer will carry full legal weight under Japan’s security-token framework. What happened in Osaka represents one of largest single-asset tokenizations in history. At the same time, this news headline led to many people looking into RWAs again – and discovering their quiet, but explosive growth. RWA tokenization expanded from $5B (2022) to ~$24B (June 2025), a ~380% surge, outpaced only by stablecoins. And the growth doesn’t stop there - Boston Consulting Group projects $16T market by 2030; while Standard Chartered projects $30.1T by 2034. Even a fraction of these numbers would reshape how value moves through the global economy. The St. Regis Aspen resort was one of the first examples of tokenizing real estate. In 2018, the luxury hotel sold $18M of tokens to accredited investors. The tokens then closed at $1.32 on their first trading day (up 32% from the $1.00 offering price). Yet, the liquidity dwindled quickly – by 2020 the tokenized-real-estate market saw anemic volumes. The concept made sense, the execution didn’t. Aspen buyers owned shares in an intermediate entity, not the property directly, with stacked SPV structures, extra fees, and unclear rights. Next was Harbor’s $20M student-housing tokenization, which secured approvals but struggled to find sustained investor demand. The Hub consisted of a premier off-campus and student housing at the University of South Carolina. Equity in the property was divided into 955 shares (as tokens) priced at $21,000 each. However, the project failed after the lender blocked it, due to legal conflicts with mortgage terms. By 2021, observers noted that <10% of tokenized real-estate projects showed meaningful secondary trading. Three failures defined the first wave: (1) legal non-recognition of tokenized title, (2) tiny accredited-only investor pools with $10k+ minimums, and (3) no market-maker/liquidity infrastructure. By 2022, it was clear – in order for tokenization to survive and for the market to attract more novel use cases, these foundations would have to be fixed. Dubai addressed core problems first, proposing a direct property tokenization model with improved legal recognition. The Dubai Land Department launched Prypco Mint in May 2025 – minimums started at AED 2,000 (~$540), with token transfers synced directly to government land records. The agency itself projects tokenized real estate could reach AED 60B (~$16B), about 7% of all transactions, by 2033. Early offerings sold out rapidly. Behind the scenes, Japan followed with clear security-token rules: since 2021, the country has recorded dozens of tokenized real-estate and bond issues under its ST regime, paving the way for MUFG’s ¥100B tower. Technical rails needed to adapt in parallel in order to allow the masses to participate in more tokenization events. Chainlink launched real-time Data Streams for U.S. equities/ETFs across 37 blockchains, which was critical for pricing tokenized stocks/bonds onchain. Then, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon launched tokenized money-market fund shares on a private chain, covering funds from managers like BlackRock and Fidelity – a key bridge for a $7T asset class. Most importantly, tokenized assets found buyers in DeFi. MakerDAO has at times held >$1B in real-world assets backing DAI, with RWAs contributing the majority of revenue. Ondo Finance attracted ~$650M AUM and ~15,000 holders in USDY (as of mid-2025), making tokenized T-bill yield accessible outside the US. Composability solved the early liquidity problem: tokens could serve as collateral, move across venues, and generate yield. Larry Fink was right when he declared tokenization "the next generation for markets" in 2022. But the shift over the past few years looks different than how most expected. Rather than disrupting traditional finance through confrontation, tokenization is being absorbed and deployed by incumbents themselves. When MUFG tokenizes a $681 million building, when Goldman creates blockchain-based money market funds, when BlackRock engineers MakerDAO’s Treasury investments, they've acknowledged something that has been hiding in plain sight. The current system, with its settlement delays, access restrictions, and operational friction, has become competitively disadvantaged. The objections that stopped earlier attempts are now dissolving. The SEC’s Project Crypto explicitly aims to facilitate tokenized securities trading on decentralized platforms. Major custodians like BNY Mellon are managing tokenized funds, giving institutional blessing to the concept. The infrastructure now handles everything from compliance to price discovery to secondary trading. Yet perhaps the most significant shift is competitive pressure. Every asset that remains exclusively offchain becomes less liquid, less accessible, and more expensive to trade relative to tokenized alternatives. Financial institutions that resist tokenization risk watching their assets and services become obsolete. Stocks, bonds, and real estate were just the beginning. Even more interesting use cases will be happening at the edges – as more variety of assets is brought into the onchain world. One example worth highlighting is Project Mocha, who are building on Scroll – a blockchain that I co-founded, which tokenizes individual coffee trees in Kenya. Their model allows coffee lovers to directly invest in coffee trees, funding farmers who need upfront capital to allocate for faster farm growth, whilst also getting a share of the revenue. Similar approaches are emerging for solar farms sharing energy revenue, cargo containers generating shipping fees, and even music royalties flowing directly to fans. Today’s $24 billion in tokenized assets represents less than 0.01% of global wealth. The surface has barely been scratched. But the trajectory points clearly toward a future where every asset (whether it is stocks or real estate) exists natively onchain. The question facing every financial institution, every asset manager, every investor, is simple: How quickly can you adapt to a world where everything is tokenized? Because ready or not, that world is arriving.

Fidelity Investments has rolled out its tokenized money market fund on the Ethereum ETH$4,429.55 blockchain, marking the Boston-based investment management giant's entrance in the rapidly growing tokenized asset field. Some $202 million in Fidelity Digital Interest Tokens (FDIT) were minted blockchain in early September, blockchain data on Etherscan shows. FDIT is the token representation of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYOXX), the on-chain share class of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), which seeks to provide yield to investors by holding U.S. Treasury bills. The asset manager first unveiled the facility in March in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The key investor in the offering is tokenization platform Ondo Finance, holding $202 million in FBIT as a reserve asset for its OUSG yield-generating token, Ondo's daily report shows. OUSG uses a range of tokenized money market funds including BUIDL by BlackRock and Securitize, Franklin Templeton's BENJI and WisdomTree's WTGXX to back the token's value. Tokenization of government debt, a crucial collateral asset in global markets, is part of a broader push to bring financial instruments, or real-world assets (RWA), onto blockchain rails. Global banks and asset managers like Fidelity Investments explore tokenization to cut settlement times, increase transparency and keep markets open around the clock. The market of tokenized U.S. Treasuries is growing rapidly, more than tripling in the last year to $7.5 billion, RWA.xyz data shows. BlackRock and tokenization specialist Securitize dominates the market with the $2.4 billion BUIDL token, followed by offerings by Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. These tokens are increasingly used as a key piece of infrastructure for yield-earning strategies and collateral in the crypto economy.

VideoVerse’s clients include the Indian Premier League and Women’s Premier League (cricket) tournaments, FIFA+, and broadcasters Nippon TV and Clubber TV. Mumbai-based VideoVerse was founded in 2016 by Vinayak Shrivastav, Saket Dandotia, and Alok Patil. The company is backed by Bluestone Equity Partners, A91 Partners (a fund by former Sequoia India execs), Alpha Wave, Evolvence India, and Moneta Ventures, and have raised $105 million in funding to date. While Minute Media or VideoVerse didn’t provide a valuation for the deal, sources told TechCrunch that VideoVerse was valued between $200 million and $250 million during its last round in 2023, and Minute Media’s deal was in a similar range. Minute Media CEO Asaf Peled said that VideoVerse’s acquisition is the biggest for the company in terms of both value and company size. Minute Media has largely grown through strategic mergers and acquisitions, including The Players’ Tribune, FanSided, Mental Floss, and STN Video. Shrivastav said that in its initial days, VideoVerse built multiple AI tools, including one to detect smoking and drinking, which was helpful for the Indian sensor board to flag certain scenes for movie certification. It also worked on object identification and deployed that tech for e-commerce sites for identifying items in a video. However, the startup transitioned to building video editing and detection tools for sports broadcasters. “In 2016, Hotstar (which is now owned by Jio) was growing, and they were looking for a solution that could identify certain action points in sports and primarily in cricket,” Shrivastav said about starting its sports journey. A few years later, VideoVerse dropped its other products and concentrated on video-editing features for sports content. The company said that it operates like a SaaS tool for which it charges based on the number of hours of footage a broadcaster or streaming service wants to process. The company said it has grown to $65 million in revenue and a healthy EBIDTA margin of 35% to 40%. The company’s chief strategy officer, Prateek Sharma, said that VideoVerse has launched new AI-powered tools in the last few months that let its clients define rules to automatically generate content. For instance, for a basketball game, a broadcaster can create a package for all three-pointers scored by a particular player and automatically publish it on social media. The platform has also added AI-powered translation features to let sports properties reach fans across the globe. Sharma noted that while the platform uses third-party models in its AI workflows, the company uses its own core model to identify key moments in a game. Minute Media’s main reason behind the acquisition is to use VideoVerse’s tech and its own publisher network to better distribute content across various sports properties and generate ad revenue out of distributed content. The sports media company, which has raised $260 million according to Crunchbase data, said that the company reaches over 200 million monthly users through its properties. It also offers a B2B platform for content distribution, used by nearly 500 publishers. Minute Media’s Peled said that this presents a good opportunity to create more content through VideoVerse’s platform and monetize it. “With the VideoVerse acquisition, we can go to customers and pitch the AI suite, which is helpful for content creation. Then we can add our distribution and monetization capabilities on top of it to get more value out of the content,” Peled said. Minute Media wants to target more U.S.-based leagues with this new acquisition to get them to adopt the highlight-generating platform. Multiple reports suggest that fans are looking for a different kind of content outside traditional coverage, especially on their mobile phones. Minute Media is banking on AI to create that content. Peled said that while the company is not in an active funding round, it might look for more funds in the coming quarters for acquisitions.

Title: Here's what happens when private equity buys homes in your neighborhood

Time Published: 2025-09-09T11:00:00Z

Alex Mayyasi This comes from the Planet Money newsletter. Subscribe now to get more insights into how our economy works delivered to your inbox each week. Daniel Erb became a corporate landlord kind of by accident. It started in 2020, when he received his first bonus as an investment banker. It was more money than he was used to. He wanted to invest in real estate, so he called his cousin, a research analyst at BlackRock, for advice. As they talked over options, his cousin showed him a striking chart of the number of "housing starts" in the U.S. since 1950 (basically the number of new houses and apartments built each year). It showed that the last 10 years had the fewest starts since the 1960s, even though the U.S. population was now much larger. Loading... It was a full decade of underinvestment. They focused on single-family homes — the classic house with a yard, often in the suburbs. "I'm a millennial," says Erb. "I've always envisioned having a home." But none of his friends had bought a house yet. Neither had he. Contemplating this lack of new houses and rising demand from millennials like him, he saw "a big opportunity … something that I was willing to spend my career on." So Erb and his cousin raised money from investors, bought homes in places like the Chatham-Arch neighborhood in Indianapolis (which was affordable, had a growing population and was benefiting from redevelopment), and rented them out — presumably to people who wanted a house with a yard but couldn't afford to buy one. Erb says it was a profitable business. He was not the first New York finance person to profit from single-family rentals across the United States. The private equity firm Blackstone (commonly confused with BlackRock) more or less invented this buy-to-rent strategy in 2012, under the moniker Invitation Homes. It's now a public company valued at more than $18 billion. The response to this development — of Wall Street buying Main Street, or at least some of its cul-de-sacs — has been bipartisan, populist and patriotic condemnation. Both JD Vance and Kamala Harris called for bans on these corporate landlords. Since houses tend to rise in value over time, homeownership has been a primary way that middle-class families build wealth. But now private equity was outbidding aspiring homeowners, making it more expensive to buy a home and pocketing the appreciation in home values. Even some of Erb's friends told him they thought he was making homes unaffordable. "Nothing that has stuck with me or made me second-guess what I'm doing," he says. He wasn't responsible for the decade of underinvestment; he felt they were giving young couples the option to live in a house without breaking their bank account. "But, yeah, very emotional conversations." Now that these institutional investors have been buying and renting out houses for more than a decade, researchers have had time to study their impact. And they've found a surprising nuance. These investors can and do make homeownership harder to attain, just as their critics claim. But by providing rentals, they also make neighborhoods more affordable and more diverse. They are diversifying the suburbs. When institutional investors first started buying single-family homes, the U.S. government laid out the welcome mat. Before the Great Recession, major investors hadn't had much interest in the suburbs. In the early 2000s, a firm called Redbrick Partners tried buy-to-rent. It ultimately abandoned the effort. Unlike in an apartment building, its leadership noted, where corporate management is common, fixing faucets and other maintenance were much less efficient when dealing with geographically dispersed homes. But during the Great Recession — just before the decline of new starts in Erb's chart — the U.S. had a glut of single-family homes in foreclosure. Many were auctioned off en masse, including by the federal government, which organized auctions for investors like Blackstone and even provided a $1 billion loan guarantee to encourage Blackstone to buy. This allowed private equity firms (which raise money from wealthy families, pension funds and other organizations to seek out profits, often by buying private companies) and real estate investors to efficiently and cheaply buy, say, a dozen similar homes located in the same Phoenix suburb. This solved two big problems for these institutional investors. It reduced the "search costs" of finding suitable homes (often starter homes with three bedrooms), and it allowed them to buy similar homes clustered in one area (which ameliorated the dispersed-faucets problem). Blackstone then introduced a financial product that supercharged the buy-to-rent sector: the rent-backed security. It was a bond, or IOU. Investors bought them, providing Blackstone with more money to buy and renovate homes. In exchange, investors were entitled to a cut of future rent payments. Wall Street could now buy homes by paying with the rent they would collect in the future. Per the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the number of homes owned by Blackstone and similar firms increased from almost nothing in 2010 to around 400,000 by 2021. This is around when Erb and his cousin started buying homes. The batch auctions were long gone. But Erb says new technology allows companies like his to have a geographically dispersed portfolio of homes. The universality of listing platforms such as Redfin and Zillow keeps search costs down. Products like Ring cameras allow potential tenants to tour properties without being shown around by an agent. And software like Zoom has made it easier for them, like other executives, to manage a remote workforce. In 2012, many government officials had welcomed firms like Blackstone into the housing market because they worried about abandoned houses and saw rental conversions as a win. Today, though, institutional investors compete with middle-class families for starter homes. Is that why homeownership has gotten more expensive? As Kamala Harris and JD Vance were calling for bans on corporate landlords, Konhee Chang was a Ph.D. student in economics. Born in Korea, Chang had always rented while living in the U.S. but never the "quintessential house that I think of when I think about an American house," with a front yard and a backyard. He wanted to know why there were so few rentals in the suburbs and who would live there if renting was an option. Chang realized these investors' buy-to-rent strategy provided an ideal case study of what happens when more rentals are available. If someone had built new homes to rent out, that would increase the supply of homes, changing the neighborhood. But since they converted homes into rentals, only one variable had changed, like in an experiment. So Chang assembled and analyzed data on neighborhoods before and after corporate landlords showed up, including demographic data on the residents. His biggest finding? Institutional investors were reducing segregation. When private equity rented out homes, the new tenants tended to be lower income than the prior owners and more likely to be young and nonwhite. "I think I was most surprised by the fact that the effect was so sharp and immediate," says Chang, who has since earned his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. He took it as a sign that these families really wanted to live in these areas but were prevented by the lack of rentals and their inability to get a mortgage. This is particularly notable because one of the most important economics findings of the past decade is the impact on children's development and career prospects of their hometown and neighborhood. (You can listen to a Planet Money episode on moving to opportunity here.) Suburban neighborhoods are not inherently better than rural or urban areas. But another study, for example, showed that single-family rentals in North Carolina served "as a pathway for access to high-performing public schools" for economically disadvantaged children. These results did not turn Chang into a cheerleader for private equity. He's too careful a scholar, and his results hold for rentals in general, regardless of whether the landlord is Invitation Homes or a couple down the street. Plus, he did not investigate other criticisms of corporate ownership. (For example, a Bloomberg investigation in 2013 found that Magnetar Capital LLC became the largest landlord in Huber Heights, Ohio, and then pushed for lower assessments of its properties' value. If it had succeeded, it would have been the largest property tax cut in county history, reducing the school district's budget by $800,000 a year.) Most of all, Chang found that the buy-to-rent strategy was hurting the middle class. Creating rentals aided lower-income families and nudged rents down. But reducing the supply of homes available for sale also pushed home prices up, hurting families on the cusp of homeownership. Erb says he feels good about the rental service they provide. (In 2024, he and his cousin teamed up with a veteran real estate investor to co-found a larger investment firm, Strand Capital.) But he agrees this trade-off exists. "There's always gonna be a cost and a benefit," he says. But the bigger problem for housing affordability, he adds, is that "we just haven't built enough [homes] to keep up with the population growth and household formation." "People get really riled up about this idea of private equity coming in and buying the block," says Daryl Fairweather. "I think they are kind of the boogeyman though." That's because institutional investors own a very small slice of single-family homes in the United States. As the chief economist at the real estate platform Redfin, Fairweather says investors purchase about 17% of homes. But most of those purchases are by mom-and-pop investors, not big firms like Blackstone. Institutional investors just don't own enough homes to be the main culprit for high home prices. In fact, Fairweather sees some societal benefits of institutional investors. Unlike with mom-and-pop landlords, it's easier to regulate large corporate landlords and check whether they are, say, following the Fair Housing Act. Plus, in places like Silicon Valley, where politicians are trying to address housing crises by encouraging the development of duplexes and triplexes, profit-driven institutional investors are a potential boon, since they're more likely to turn suburban homes into duplexes. And in areas with more open land, like the suburbs near Denver, institutional investors are building new housing specifically to rent out. Think cookie-cutter homes, perhaps with a dog park or pool. "I think that we should embrace investors who want to make those kinds of investments," Fairweather says. Still, she thinks middle-class families are right to worry about private equity displacing them from the housing market. She worries about fewer families achieving homeownership and gaining control over this intimate part of their lives, which has also been the dominant path to building wealth in America. But a ban? As an economist, she hates bans. If politicians succeed in banning corporate landlords, perhaps by making it illegal to own more than 300 homes, she suspects we'd see lots of 300-home companies replacing Blackstone — without doing anything to increase homeownership among the middle class. Instead, she advocates for policies that will incentivize and allow developers to build more housing. The trade-off caused by single-family rentals — that they benefit some low-income renters but hurt some aspiring homebuyers — is "because we are restricting the number of homes that can be built in neighborhoods." Many desirable neighborhoods are zoned so that it's impossible to build the duplexes or apartment buildings that would make them accessible to low-income families. Many prosperous towns block the building of new single-family homes, often at the behest of current homeowners who don't want to deal with construction or who want to restrict supply and boost their home's value. The best way to stick it to Blackstone and private equity, to prevent Wall Street firms from profiting off the housing crisis, is to make it easier to build more homes. As for Daniel Erb, even though he has spent his career responding to the dearth of suburban homes, betting on our collective underinvestment in American dream properties, he might appreciate that too. He says he doesn't own a home, in part because he often travels to the towns where his company buys homes. And he says he's not buying for himself at today's prices.

Title: Private Prisons: An Exceptionally Niche Asset Class Meets It Moment
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/09/private-prisons-investment-immigration/
Time Published: 2025-09-09T10:22:57Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy It’s certainly a niche asset class. But one that’s rapidly expanding. The ongoing, record-breaking expansion of the nation’s immigrant detention capacity — due to an expedited mass deportation push that’s been the subject of significant protests, legal rulings and due process complaints — has made private prisons a burgeoning business during the start of the second Trump administration. Industry stalwarts GEO Group and CoreCivic, which have substantial experience in prison operations and a nationwide portfolio of carceral real estate, have seen the coming flood of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) funding as part of a series of “unprecedented growth opportunities,” said GEO Group Chairman George C. Zoley during the firm’s latest earnings call in August. Roughly $45 billion has been earmarked for detention through September 2029 via the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill. ICE plans to double its detention capacity to nearly 110,000 by the end of this year, which, at full capacity, would make the agency’s wards the 20th largest incarcerated populations in the world. For the private prison industry, this opportunity is one they claim they’re singularly suited to meet. “Our decades-long history of constructing facilities for government use has given us a marketable portfolio of existing, ready-to-activate, high-quality capacity that we view as ideally suited to meet ICE’s immediate needs,” said Ryan Gustin, CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, in a statement sent to Commercial Observer. GEO Group declined to respond to repeated requests for comment. This moment highlights just how these two firms have continuously evolved their operations. The methods by which these companies finance and construct facilities have changed over time, as shifting funding streams and priorities of different administrations — as well as advocacy campaigns and waves of public pushback — have changed the reality on the ground. Generally speaking, the contracts that GEO Group or CoreCivic would get from the federal government have been for operations and management. It’s the recurring revenue fee for running private prison sites. Construction funding comes from a number of sources, which have changed for these firms over time. Bob Libal, a criminal legal reform and immigrant rights advocate in Austin, Texas, had more experience with these companies during their initial wave of expansion in the early 2000s under the George W. Bush administration. During that period, especially in Texas, there was a lot of public financing around private prisons that utilized municipal revenue bonds. During the twilight of the Obama administration, the federal government decided to end federal contracts with private prisons, sending a memo to the Bureau of Prisons instructing the federal agency to decline to renew contracts. During Joe Biden’s administration, the government was instructed to phase out funding to private prisons, but continued to use them for a growing population of detained immigrants. “I think the liability they’ve experienced is that at different times in their corporate history, if the demand for private prisons decreases, then they have empty facilities sitting there, right?” said Shar Habibi, research and policy director of In the Public Interest, a nonprofit that has advocated against private prisons. “That’s not good.” During the first Trump administration, a number of advocacy groups challenged the larger financial institutions — including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and SunTrust (now part of Truist) — that backed these private prison firms in a sustained campaign between 2016 and 2019. Called Families Belong Together, in response to policies that separated detained families, the coalition sought financial pressure points. At the time, the companies were structured as REITs, and needed to distribute most of their taxable income to investors annually, making them dependent on financing, term loans and revolving credit facilities for new construction, said Dov Baum, director of American Friends Service Committee’s Action Center for Corporate Accountability. The allied groups then identified and successfully pressured banks and financial groups to stop funding private prisons. Since then, GEO Group and CoreCivic have dropped their REIT status, which means they aren’t as reliant on external loans, and don’t have to be as transparent about financial records. By and large, the current funding GEO Group and CoreCivic utilizes is administered by Alter Domus, a private lender whose funding sources are much more opaque. Both companies have in-house planning and design capacity as well as in-house construction experience. CoreCivic boasts it can achieve 25 percent cost savings and finish a new facility in 18 months or less. But the recent wave of funding for immigrant detention facilities has been overly focused on speed, which has altered the way vendors have competed for federal dollars, and the facilities they are building or, in most cases, reopening. The Trump administration’s rush to accommodate higher immigrant detention figures has meant a focus on reactivating closed facilities or constructing temporary tent structures on federal land, particularly on Army bases. A number of new contractors, such as disaster-relief providers and other firms like GothamsLLC and Deployed Resources, which sometimes lack direct prison management experience, have been contracted to rapidly erect tents on federal sites. Governors in Indiana, Florida, Louisiana and Nebraska have offered up shuttered state prisons or state-run detention camps, according to data gathered by the nonprofit Detention Watch network. A number of military bases — such as Indiana’s Camp Atterbury, Fort Bliss in Texas, Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey — are being used to expand capacity. The haste has led to wasted efforts. The “Alligator Alcatraz” project in the Florida Everglades, funded in part by Federal Management Emergency Agency funds meant for asylum seekers and migrants, was recently ordered closed by a federal judge because the rapidly assembled project skipped over a federal environmental review process, among other issues. (As of press time, the facility remained open following an appeals court ruling staying the judge’s decision.) But the big contractors are still seeing significant revenue opportunities. In many cases, older, underutilized or closed facilities owned by CoreCivic or GEO Group are being reactivated, turning empty and idle facilities into new profit centers. Roughly 20 such facilities existed between both companies at the start of Trump’s second term, due in part to sentencing reforms that shrunk prison populations. Meanwhile, some big names are taking stakes — albeit, for many of them, minor ones — in owner-operators like GEO Group. BlackRock, for instance, has a significant stake in GEO Group. But that’s via its investments in index funds tied to the stock market, not to any particular effort by the firm to single out the private prison company. BlackRock, Vanguard, Goldman Sachs, State Street Global Advisers and Guggenheim Partners didn’t respond to requests to gain more insight into their own holdings of GEO Group or CoreCivic stock. Geo Group’s Zoley specifically called out the “intrinsic value of our owned real estate assets,” and expects all the firm’s shuttered prisons to be reactivated by the end of the year. CoreCivic purchased the Farmville Detention Center in Virginia for $67 million, which is already accepting detainees, and made substantial progress reactivating three facilities in the spring of this year, with the activation team preparing for additional contracting activity. These reopenings can attract significant protest and pushback from local and state governments, as well as prisoner and immigrant rights groups, over complaints about poor food and lax oversight that in some cases has left prisoners seriously injured. The California City detention center outside of Los Angeles, which CoreCivic reopened in June, raised the ire of local activists and leaders; the state had tried to ban private prisons until the action was judged unconstitutional in 2023. The move to reopen the infamous Leavenworth prison in Kansas via an expedited process known as a letter contract, angered local officials, who filed a lawsuit in opposition. The potential, however, has already shifted the financial performance of these firms. GEO Group’s net income during the first half of 2025 was $48.6 million, a stark turnaround from the first half of 2024, where the firm lost $9.8 million. CoreCivic saw net income jump 103.4 percent in the second quarter versus the same period last year, hitting $38.5 million. These reopened facilities are predicted to make an immediate financial impact. For instance, GEO Group resumed services at the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall in Newark, N.J., starting this year — despite active efforts to sue by the city, which alleged improper permits — and it’s projected to generate $60 million in annualized revenue when it hits full capacity. “There are some people who say that private prisons are better than public prisons because they’re easily closed, because there isn’t pressure from public sector unions,” said Libal, the immigrant rights advocate in Texas. “But my argument is, they’re always trying to reopen, right?” Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!
