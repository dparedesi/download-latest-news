Bitcoin would need to match its 2024 surge for that $500K bet to become a reality. What are the odds? While Bitcoin [BTC] faces a bearish pullback driven by macroeconomic uncertainty, Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s Head of Digital Asset Research sees a brighter future. In fact, he’s in the news today after he set a bold $500k target for the leading crypto asset before the end of Trump’s presidency. AMBCrypto unpacks the key drivers that could make—or break—this bold prediction. 2025 kicked off with bold predictions – Bitcoin strategic reserves, banks offering BTC services, and a $150k price target. Two months in, BTC’s still under $100k. Clearly, the market’s gone the other way, with investors playing it safe and chasing quick profits. In this environment, a $500k prediction from Standard Chartered might sound a bit too ambitious. However, what grabbed AMBCrypto’s attention? This target was made under Trump’s administration – and there’s a reason behind it. Since November’s elections, BTC has surged by over 30%, with $90k as the average market bottom. To hit $500k, Bitcoin would need a 455% jump before 2028. Source: TradingView (BTC/USD) Looking back, BTC registered gains of 156% in 2024. If it pulls off similar growth in the next few years, Standard Chartered’s bold prediction might just hit the mark. Additionally, Trump’s regulatory shake-up, the SEC overhaul, his dislike of high interest rates, the DOGE cabinet, and a new crypto task force are pushing big targets forward – calling the current volatility as just a “temporary dip.” A big chunk of BTC’s 156% YTD jump is thanks to U.S Spot ETFs, which have pumped billions into Bitcoin. BlackRock (IBIT) alone saw its Bitcoin holdings jump by a staggering 726%, now sitting at 585,393 BTC at press time. Source: BitBo And, it doesn’t stop there – BlackRock is set to launch a Bitcoin ETP (Exchange-Traded Product) in Europe, bringing even more global exposure and a flood of new capital into the market. With all these factors at play, Standard Chartered’s bold Bitcoin prediction is starting to look more like a calculated bet on strong fundamentals, not just speculation. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 So, a repeat of the 2024 pump doesn’t seem too far off. But now, it all comes down to whether Trump’s promises are executed swiftly as 2025 plays out. The market is watching closely, especially as the ongoing trade war has already driven many into “extreme” fear.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Chip Stocks In Focus Amid Tech Selloff. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) stands against the other chip stocks. The semiconductor industry is on a trajectory of rapid growth, with global revenues expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2030. According to a report on the industry by professional services firm PwC, this expansion is fueled by advancements in memory technology, the rise of automotive semiconductors, regional self-sufficiency initiatives, purpose-built silicon, and the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Per the report, Memory integrated circuits (ICs), particularly DRAM and high-bandwidth memory (HBM), have been the fastest-growing semiconductor segment. In 2024, DRAM is projected to contribute 14% of total semiconductor revenue. HBM, essential for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), is expected to grow at a 64% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in bit growth and a 58% CAGR in revenue through 2028. As big companies leverage HBM for AI workloads, closer collaboration is required between foundries and memory firms to integrate logic and memory components effectively.

PwC highlights that the automotive semiconductor market reached $76 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $117 billion by 2028, driven by electric vehicle (EV) adoption and software-defined vehicles (SDVs). Power semiconductors, particularly those utilizing silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), are expected to reach $6 billion, comprising 18% of the market by 2028. Meanwhile, automotive system-on-chip (SoC) revenue was $7 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a 17% CAGR through 2028, supporting real-time data processing, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and infotainment. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in the semiconductor supply chain, prompting major economies to pursue self-sufficiency. By 2027, approximately $400 billion in government funding is expected to be allocated to semiconductor initiatives. The US has already awarded $29.5 billion in grants and $25.1 billion in loans, with total investments projected to reach $348 billion by 2030. The European Union has allocated $46 billion for incentives, while China has invested over $190 billion through its National Integrated Circuit Investment Fund and local initiatives. South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have also introduced tax incentives and subsidies to boost domestic semiconductor production. The demand for custom ICs tailored to specific applications is surging, especially in data centers, video processing, and network security. By 2028, the market for data center custom ICs is expected to reach $24 billion. AI is a critical growth driver for the semiconductor industry, requiring GPUs, accelerators, and HBM. The AI-specific silicon market is forecasted to reach $150 billion by 2028.

Will BlackRock replicate the remarkable success of its U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF in Europe? BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $11 trillion in AUM (assets under management), plans to expand its Bitcoin-related exchange-traded products to Europe. According to a Bloomberg report, the fund is likely to be domiciled in Switzerland, and the marketing efforts for the product could kick off as early as this month, per close sources interviewed by the publisher. Commenting on the update, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst noted that the U.S. and Asia currently dominate the BTC ETF market. The analyst also said that Europe isn’t much into ‘hot’ trends. “Europe barely on leaderboard of spot bitcoin ETFs by size.. US spot ETFs only year old and have 91%(!) share of world…If BlackRock brings even some of the US Terrordome over there, should see success, although keep in mind Europeans much less into ‘hot sauce’ than US and certain Asian countries.” Source: X As of this writing, details on the product’s fees were not public yet. That said, BlackRock was among the first issuers to get approval to launch a U.S. spot BTC ETF in early 2024. The product, iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), has been most successful both crypto scene and across traditional markets, too. As of the 4th of February, IBIT had amassed over 585.3K BTC, worth nearly $58 billion based on press time market prices. Source: iShares Interestingly, BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink has also doubled down on BTC. He reiterated that it was the best asset of choice for anyone seeking refuge from fiat debasement (inflation) or political instability. In fact, during the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he stated, “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency, or… of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears.. BTC could be $500k, $600k, $700k” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

The Ethereum-based ONDO is now the 33rd biggest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $4.3 billion, CoinGecko shows. Institutions in the traditional finance world have been banging the RWA drum for some time now. BlackRock boss Larry Fink praised Ethereum for how it would lead to the tokenization of financial markets, while Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson has said that the technology of securities will change thanks to the blockchain. “[Blockchain] technology is going to open up a lot of really interesting types of investment opportunities,” Johnson said last year.

Truth.fi, the new financial arm of Trump Media and Technology Group—of which the president is the majority shareholder—said Thursday that it had applied to register trademarks for brand names for six new investment vehicles. Of the six vehicles, two will be Bitcoin funds: the Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus ETF and the Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus SMA. ETFs are funds that let speculators buy shares tracking the price of commodities or securities. Top fund managers—including BlackRock and Fidelity—last year launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, giving more traditional investors the chance to buy exposure to the biggest cryptocurrency. An SMA, or separately managed account, is a type of investment product that allows clients—particularly high net-worth individuals—to have greater say over what the investment vehicle contains. “We aim to give investors a means to invest in American energy, manufacturing, and other firms that provide a competitive alternative to the woke funds and debanking problems that you find throughout the market," said Trump Media CEO and Chairman Devin Nunes. It's not currently clear what the "Plus" part of the Bitcoin Plus products would entail. Decrypt reached out to Trump Media for comment about what the Bitcoin Plus products will entail, but did not receive an immediate response. TMTG—which owns the Truth Social network that Trump posts on daily—last week announced the launch of Truth.Fi. The fintech-focused brand said it would be crypto-involved, with $250 million cash that would be custodied by Charles Schwab. The announcement said that the brand “may buy Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies or crypto-related securities” as a way to diversify its portfolio. Bitcoin ETFs have been wildly successful in the U.S. since launching in January 2024, breaking records and bringing in billions of dollars worth of trading volume. The price of Bitcoin has in part shot up as a result, repeatedly pushing to new all-time high marks over the last year.

Then it turned into a tsunami. In 2019, just two battery factories were operating in the United States with another two under construction. Today there are about 34 battery factories either planned, under construction, or operational in the country. Former U.S. President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law August 16, 2022, might not have been the initial catalyst behind the onshoring battery factory trend. But it did help open the spigot and accelerate the pace of factory projects — not to mention sparking a climate tech arms race with the EU. Two and a half years later, we’re still tracking the fallout, even though the IRA’s fate is now uncertain. In January 2025, President Donald Trump ordered a freeze on IRA funding disbursements, but many of those funds have already made it into manufacturers’ hands. That order also hasn’t stopped the already-moving train of billions of private sector dollars invested in clean energy. Because whether Trump wants to back clean energy or not, the fact remains that the U.S. needs to have more control over its battery supply chain, rather than ceding control to China. That’s particularly true in light of Trump’s 10% tariffs on Chinese imports. Automakers saw what happened during the chip shortage crisis that hampered manufacturing during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they are loathe to repeat the same mistakes. What has followed is a wave of automakers and battery makers — foreign and domestic — pledging to produce North American–made batteries before 2030. (See each automaker’s plans here and battery maker’s plans here.) Why so much investment into onshoring EV battery production? One reason was because the IRA is rife with incentives for automakers and consumers to produce domestically — a concerted effort to end the U.S.’s reliance on China for batteries, while simultaneously meeting Biden’s goal to make 50% of all new vehicle sales in the U.S. electric or hybrid by 2030. And though Trump has taken a step back from the IRA, electric vehicles can still qualify for the full $7,500 EV tax credit if they meet certain battery sourcing and production guidelines. The IRA requires that 60% of the value of battery components be produced or assembled in North America in 2024 to qualify for half of the tax credit, $3,750. That percentage will increase to 100% starting in 2029. To get the remaining half, 50% of the value of critical materials must be sourced from the U.S. or a free trade agreement country in 2024. That percentage increases to 60%, 70% and 80% for vehicles produced in 2025, 2026 and 2027 and beyond, respectively. The IRA’s advanced manufacturing credits that give the producer a payout from the Treasury are likely at risk of being eliminated, but it’s worth explaining how they went for the past couple of years. Under Section 45X, the production of battery cells qualifies for a credit of $35 per kilowatt-hour of capacity, and the production of battery modules qualifies for $10 per kilowatt-hour. (Battery cells are containers that chemically store energy, and they are arranged into modules. Battery packs can be made up of cells or modules.) Companies can also be reimbursed 10% of the costs incurred due to the production of electrode active materials, like the cathode and anode. The cathode stores lithium when a battery is discharged, and the anode stores lithium when a battery is charging. They are both components of a cell and can contain materials like graphite, silicon, zinc, aluminum, magnesium, nickel and cobalt. Automakers and battery manufacturers have collectively invested and promised to invest around $112 billion in building domestic cell and module manufacturing. Together, these companies promise to deliver an annual capacity of close to 1,200 gigawatt-hours before 2030, if each factory reaches maximum capacity. That’s roughly enough batteries for 18 million EVs, based on previous Tesla predictions that say about 100 GWh capacity can power around 1.5 million EVs. Outside of the battery sector, the IRA has helped fuel a total $245 billion in private investment into clean energy and technology manufacturing, according to Atlas Public Policy’s Clean Economy Tracker. The investment into producing batteries in the U.S. and Canada changes regularly, so we’ve started tracking these promises. TechCrunch created a handy map showing the location of each battery factory plus some basic information, including planned capacity. For those looking for more details and context, scroll down to read about each manufacturer’s planned or operational battery factories. Or click on a location on the map for a pop-up to appear. Note: The factories included below are producing or will produce battery cells and modules. We did not include things like battery materials production. Therefore, it is not an exhaustive list of all the production going into creating EV batteries in North America. Where are the EV batteries being produced in North America? This article was originally published August 16, 2023, and was last updated February 6, 2025. In October 2022, BMW announced a $1.7 billion investment in the U.S. that would see its Spartanburg, South Carolina, plant readied for the production of EVs. Of the total funding, $700 million was allocated to the buildout of a battery assembly facility in nearby Woodruff. The automaker told TechCrunch that the start of production is scheduled for the end of 2026, but it hasn’t confirmed which EVs will be produced there. BMW’s Spartanburg factory is currently where its sports utility and crossovers are built, including the X3, X4, X5, X6, X7 and XM. BMW also partnered up with battery maker AESC (formerly Envision AESC) to invest additional funds in a battery cell plant in Florence, South Carolina (more on that in the AESC section). The AESC plant will produce BMW’s new sixth-generation round lithium-ion battery cells for Plant Spartanburg EVs. Groundbreaking on both the Woodruff and Florence facilities occurred in June. In September 2023, Daimler Truck and Paccar announced a joint venture with energy technology company Accelera and Chinese battery maker EVE Energy to build a battery cell production plant that would support the adoption of EVs for medium- and heavy-duty commercial transportation. The companies said in January 2024 that they selected a site in Mississippi. Accelera, Daimler and Paccar will each own 30% of the combined company, called Amplify Cell Technologies, and jointly control the business, which will focus on lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery tech. EVE will serve as a technology provider, contributing its battery cell design and manufacturing expertise in exchange for 10% of ownership. In September 2021, Ford created a joint venture (JV) with South Korean battery maker SK On. The goal of the JV, called BlueOval SK, is to build three battery plants in the United States. Two are located in Kentucky; the third factory in Tennessee will be co-located with a Ford assembly plant, which will produce the automaker’s second-generation electric truck, code named Project T3. Ford and SK On secured a $9.2 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy to help finance the construction of the three battery factories in Kentucky and Tennessee. While one of the Kentucky plants is scheduled to begin production in 2025, the second plant’s production has been paused as Ford keeps an eye on consumer demand for EVs. Ford is also building a lithium-iron-phosphate plant in Michigan. Chinese battery maker CATL is licensing its technology to Ford as a service provider on a contractual basis. That might change in the future, though, as Ford has now attracted the ire of House Republicans who are probing the automaker’s relationship with the Chinese battery company. In November 2023, Ford made the decision to scale back investment in its Michigan plant from $3.5 billion down to $2 billion amid slower-than-expected demand for EVs, which means a 43% drop in production capacity and reduced expected employment. General Motors aims to have three total battery plants in the U.S. through its joint venture with LG Energy Solutions, which was named Ultium Cells until October 2024. That joint venture secured in December 2022 a $2.5 billion loan from the government to help fund its battery factory projects. Not only has GM dropped the brand name Ultium, but it also plans to adopt lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology to reduce the cost of its EVs by “up to $6,000,” GM’s VP of batteries Kurt Kelty said at the automaker’s investor day. The Ultium platform uses the more common nickel manganese cobalt recipe. GM also said during its October 2024 investor day that it would build a new battery cell development center in Warren, Michigan, with start of production targeted for early 2027. LG isn’t the only battery maker GM is working with. The automaker in April 2023 announced a joint venture with Samsung SDI to build a new battery plant in the United States. Aside from volume production, GM has also partnered with startup SolidEnergy Systems in 2021 to build a prototyping facility in Woburn, Massachusetts. The goal is to build a high-capacity, pre-production lithium-ion battery. GM is working on taking control of the battery materials supply chain as well. In March 2022, the company partnered with South Korea’s Posco Chemical to build a $400 million battery materials facility in Canada. The plant will produce cathode active materials. GM announced in February 2024 a deal with LG Chem that would see the automaker investing $19 billion over the next decade to source critical materials from LG Chem’s Tennessee plant. In August 2022, Honda announced its joint venture with South Korea’s LG Energy Solutions to supply the North American market with “pouch type” battery cells. The facility in Ohio will produce both cells and modules. The automaker has also made strides to secure battery resource recycling channels and has agreements with businesses, including Ascend Elements, Cirba Solutions and Posco Holdings. Honda’s engine plant in Anna, Ohio, is also in the process of being retooled to add production of casing for battery modules that will power Honda and Acura EVs made in Ohio. In April 2023, Hyundai and SK On approved plans to set up a joint venture to build a $5 billion battery plant in Bartow County, Georgia. Within a few months, Hyundai and LG Energy Solution formed another JV to build a battery cell factory near Savannah, Georgia, that will support the production of 300,000 units of EVs annually once the plant reaches mass production. The automaker said Hyundai Mobis, Hyundai’s parts and service arm, will assemble battery packs using cells from the plant. Hyundai Mobis in 2022 also announced plans to build an EV battery module plant in Alabama that will be able to supply more than 200,000 EV batteries annually to its parent company once the plant reaches full capacity. Mercedes-Benz opened a battery plant at its existing manufacturing facility in Alabama in 2022. That summer, the plant also became the production site for the automaker’s fully electric EQS SUV. The Alabama facility is also assembling the EQE SUV and the Maybach EQS SUV, according to a spokesperson from the company. Mercedes is also working with Sila, a next-gen battery materials company, to incorporate Sila’s battery chemistry into batteries as an option for buyers of the upcoming G-Class. Sila replaces the graphite in a battery cell with silicon and is in the process of scaling up at its new Washington state facility. The companies are targeting mid-decade for a range-extended version of the G-class. Stellantis and Samsung SDI commenced construction on their joint-venture EV battery facility in Indiana in March 2023. The factory will produce both lithium-ion cells and modules. The company announced in July 2023 it would build a second battery factory with Samsung, which will open in early 2027. In October, Stellantis shared more details. Stellantis, which includes brands Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Jeep and Ram, also announced a joint venture with LG Energy Solution in 2021, called NextStar Energy, to build a North American factory with an annual capacity of 40 GWh. In March 2022, the two companies announced a binding agreement to invest (CAD $5 billion) $3.7 billion to produce cells and modules at a manufacturing plant in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Since beginning production at Gigafactory Nevada in 2017, Tesla has produced more than 7.3 billion battery cells and 1.5 million battery packs, which provide about 39 GWh capacity annually, according to Panasonic. Tesla in January 2023 announced plans to invest billions more into the Nevada factory to include a new 4680 cell factory with capacity to produce enough batteries for 1.5 million light-duty vehicles annually. The 4680 cells, which were designed by Tesla and revealed at Battery Day 2020, are meant to reduce battery cost by over 50%. Tesla has been trying to get the cells to volume production over the last few years but has run into roadblocks. A recent report from The Information shows that Elon Musk may have to rely on outside suppliers for batteries soon if the 4680 team doesn’t make headway. At the start of 2023, Tesla also laid out plans to expand its existing Gigafactory Austin to include battery cell testing and the manufacture of cathode and drive units, but hasn’t shared more details on those plans. In May 2023, Tesla broke ground on a Texas lithium refinery, making it one of the only U.S. automakers to refine its own lithium. The automaker said it would spend $375 million on the Corpus Christi factory that will have a capacity of 50 GWh. Tesla included an update in its Q4 2024 earnings report on the refinery, saying that it plans to bring the plant online in 2025 before scaling production. Toyota’s planned battery plant in North Carolina, initially announced in 2021, will produce both cells and modules, according to the company. In late October 2023, Toyota announced that it would invest billions more into the factory. When it comes online, it’ll have 10 production lines to support both hybrid and EVs. In February 2025, Toyota announced that its North Carolina plant is ready to begin production and will start shipping batteries for North American electrified vehicles in April. Toyota has also enlisted the help of South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution, which will exclusively build EV batteries for the Japanese automaker out of its Michigan plant (more on that below.) The Japanese automaker is also building a battery lab at its North American research and development headquarters in Michigan, where it can develop and evaluate the quality of its EV batteries. The $48 million lab is expected to begin operations in 2025, and it will support the company’s manufacturing at factories in North Carolina and Kentucky. In July 2022, Volkswagen set up a separate battery company, PowerCo SE, to build batteries for its upcoming EVs. Since its launch, the company has decided on the location of three cell factories: Two in Europe (Salzgitter, Germany, and Valencia, Spain) and one in North America (St. Thomas, Canada). PowerCo expects to generate an annual revenue of over 20 billion euros by 2030. While VW’s battery factory is in Canada and not technically in the U.S., it should still be eligible to receive Inflation Reduction Act incentives. Volvo has a battery assembly factory in Charleston, South Carolina, but the automaker does not manufacture batteries or battery components there. Volvo would not confirm any other plans it has for battery production in North America. AESC (formerly Envision AESC) is a Japanese battery technology company that has promised to build three U.S. facilities before the end of the decade. The company’s Tennessee plant has been in operation for some time. AESC broke ground at its Kentucky and South Carolina plants in August 2022 and June 2023, respectively. In March 2024, AESC said it would expand its South Carolina operations, bringing total investment in the project up to $3.12 billion. But in February 2025, AESC paused those expansion plans after the state pulled $100 million in bonds to support the project. The company said its existing plant will have enough capacity to serve BMW. Gotion Inc., which is headquartered in Silicon Valley and owned by Chinese company Gotion High-Tech, first announced its intent to build a battery factory in Michigan in October 2022. The factory, which secured $175 million in state funds in April 2023, aimed to build both cathode and anodes that could be used for both EVs and solar generators, according to a spokesperson from the company. However, Gotion has faced pushback from locals. The township’s board voted to reverse a previously approved plan to extend the city’s water supply to the location of the factory. In March, Gotion filed a lawsuit against the town, which is ongoing. While the Michigan factory is clearly on hold, Gotion has another one in the works. In September 2023, Gotion also announced plans to set up a second battery manufacturing plant in Illinois. The company is on the receiving end of state incentives valued at $536 million and expects to receive tax benefits totaling $213 million over 30 years, as long as Gotion invests a minimum of $1.9 billion and the creation of thousands of well-paid jobs. Battery cell and module developer Kore Power announced in March that it had received approval to build a battery manufacturing factory in Buckeye, Arizona. Kore Power will produce batteries for energy storage systems and e-mobility products, including cars, trucks, buses, boats and trains. The company told TechCrunch it intends to support OEMs by manufacturing 30D-compliant batteries, so Kore is working closely with domestic partners to line up critical materials suppliers onshore. South Korea’s LG Energy Solution supplies EV batteries to automakers like Tesla, Lucid Motors, Toyota and Proterra. The battery maker has joint ventures to build battery factories with General Motors, Honda, Hyundai and Stellantis. In early 2023, LG said it would quintuple the capacity of its existing lithium-ion cell plant in Michigan, which was built in 2010, as part of a deal with Toyota LG’s Holland factory makes large polymer battery cells, or pouch type cells, and packs for EVs. The expanded plant will produce new long cell design batteries, which LG says should add more range, better storage, and a more simplified pack structure. The battery maker also said it would quadruple its planned investment in a new factory in Arizona to $5.5 billion, a large portion of which will be dedicated to EV battery production. The complex will have two manufacturing facilities — one dedicated to cylindrical batteries for EVs and another for lithium iron phosphate pouch-type batteries for energy storage systems. In August 2023, LG announced a building spree in North America, with plans to spend up to $17 billion through 2025 on constructing a total of eight factories (two of which are already operational) with more than 300 GWh capacity. LG has not yet shared details on each plant. LG’s parent company, LG Chem, separately broke ground on a Tennessee plant that will produce cathode material in December 2023. LG plans to invest $3.2 billion in that plant with the goal of producing 60,000 tons of cathode material at peak production. GM has signed on as a customer, pledging $19 billion. Northvolt, a Swedish producer of lithium-ion batteries, announced in late September 2023 plans to open its first gigafactory in North America. The company had reportedly been evaluating between North America or Germany for its next gigafactory, and the former won out due to the incentives in the IRA. The project is expected to cost just over $7 billion, with Northvolt bringing in $3.2 billion and local and federal governments contributing around $4.2 billion. The expansion is off the back of a $1.2 billion raise, backed by BlackRock. Northvolt told TechCrunch it has an “offtake agreement with an anchor customer,” meaning a buyer for its cells, but wouldn’t disclose the name of the company. The factory will also feature Revolt, Northvolt’s battery recycling program, which will have a capacity of 15 GWh. Northvolt told TechCrunch it hopes to recycle half of the raw materials needed for cell production by 2030. Battery startup Our Next Energy (ONE) announced plans in October 2022 to build a gigafactory in Michigan devoted to lithium-iron-phosphate cells, AKA LFP batteries. The facility, which is supported by a $200 million grant from the state of Michigan, will include raw material refinement, cathode materials production, and cell and battery manufacturing. To that end, the company in February 2023 raised a $300 million Series B to help get it to production. Panasonic said in July 2022 that it plans to build the world’s largest EV battery plant, a $4 billion factory in Kansas that will manufacture and supply lithium-ion batteries to EV makers. The facility in De Soto will be Panasonic’s second EV battery plant in the U.S., after the Panasonic Energy of North America (PENA) facility in Sparks, Nevada, which operates inside Tesla’s Nevada Gigafactory and supplies the EV maker with batteries. Panasonic said in June 2023 that it plans to expand production at PENA by 10% within three years. Around the same time, the Japanese company said it would build at least two new factories for the production of Tesla 4680 battery cells in North America by 2030. However, in January, Panasonic’s CEO Yuki Kusumi said the battery business will focus on boosting productivity over building another battery factory. South Korean battery manufacturer SK On has created joint ventures to develop batteries with Ford and Hyundai. The company’s U.S. subsidiary, SK Battery America, has its own plans. SK Battery America has invested $2.6 billion into two manufacturing plants in Jackson County, Georgia, and reached mass production in early 2022.

Title: Ireland under-20s make three changes to starting team for Scotland clash

Ireland under-20 head coach Neil Doak has made three changes and two positional switches to the starting team from that which lost 19-3 against England for Saturday night’s game against Scotland at the Hive stadium in Edinburgh (7.45pm, live on RTÉ2). There are a couple of alterations enforced by injuries to rightwing Derry Moloney, who broke a finger but could be back in time for the Wales match, and loosehead prop Alex Usanov; he suffered a leg injury that will see him miss the remainder of the tournament. Secondrow prospect Alan Spicer, who was sorely missed in Cork, has a small stress fracture in his foot but it doesn’t require surgery. His progress will be monitored. Daniel Green, an outhalf by inclination, comes in at fullback with Charlie Molony switching to the rightwing in place of Derry Moloney. Gene O’Leary Kareem swaps a place on the bench for the 13 jersey and will partner Ireland’s outstanding player the last day, Connor Fahy, who moves in one place to inside centre, in the midfield. Cork Constitution’s Eoghan Smyth drops to the replacements. Former Newbridge pupil Billy Bohan, who replaced Usanov after 14 minutes at Musgrave Park, is named in the run-on side with Blackrock College prop Paddy Moore, a son of former Blackrock, Clontarf and a former schools international Dave, promoted to the replacements. There is one other change to the bench with Sale Sharks scrumhalf Will Wootton, younger brother of Alex, fit again following injury. Ireland are looking to atone for a largely poor performance against England that was riddled with mistakes and indiscipline, albeit against a big, physical England side. They take on a Scotland side that lost 22-10 to Italy in the opening round of fixtures at Saturday’s venue. Irish under-20s back coach Ian Keatley explained that while they wanted the defeat to “hurt” a little, it is important that the group don’t become inhibited by the setback. It is a case of learn, move on, and be better. “Obviously, frustration [was the overwhelming feeling in the immediate aftermath of the game] because we felt that the squad of boys were capable of much more. And we know we came up against [an] English team [that] everyone thought that we didn’t stand a chance [of beating]. “But I think the frustrating part was that we created chances. I think we got inside their 22 nine or 10 times, and we didn’t come away with any tries. While they got into our 22 five times and came away with one try. “When you look back, look at the stats and how the game went, we had 17 penalties against us as opposed to their 10. There were a lot of unforced errors, just little mistakes; it’s frustrating that we just didn’t take any of our chances. “In reviewing the game, you have to be very balanced. You do want them to hurt a little bit and that it is okay [to feel that way] but then bounce back in training this week.” Ireland Under-20: D Green (QUB); C Molony (UCD), G O’Leary Kareem (UCC), C Fahy (Clontarf), C Mangan (Blackrock College); S Wisniewski (Old Belvedere), C Logan (QUB); B Bohan (Galway Corinthians), H Walker (QUB), A Mullan (Blackrock College); M Ronan (Old Wesley), B Corrigan (Old Wesley); M Foy (UCC), B Power (Galwegians), É McCarthy (Galwegians, capt). Replacements: C Magee (Banbridge), P Moore (Blackrock College), T McAllister (Ballynahinch), D Walsh (Terenure College), O Minogue (Shannon), W Wootton (Sale Sharks), D Hicks (Garryowen), E Smyth (Cork Constitution).

Title: Ethereum’s Price Still In The Major Uptrend – Analyst Forecast Potential For Further Gains
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-major-uptrend/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T16:00:12Z
Full Content:
With the general crypto market still facing heightened volatility, Ethereum has once again failed to reclaim the pivotal $3,000 price level. Bearish pressure continues to linger in its price action, leading to speculations about its potential in the short term. Although ETH has failed to experience a major surge, analysts believe the altcoin could see a turnaround towards the upside shortly. Ethereum may have seen a notable decline in the last few days, but Ether Naysonal, a market expert and trader is unshaken about the heightened volatility. According to the technical expert, “ETH is still in its major uptrend,” indicating resilience amid broader market volatility. Despite occasional pullbacks, the expert cites that ETH continues to hold key support levels, reinforcing optimistic sentiment among investors. With the altcoin maintaining its uptrend, it could pave the way for a potential breakout toward higher levels in the upcoming weeks. Ether Naysonal highlighted alongside maintaining its major uptrend, ETH has also consistently held the $2,615 support level, which is good for its price action. However, for Ethereum to make a quick recovery, it must at least close above the $2,820 mark for one day. A close above the $2,820 level would likely reignite bullish momentum for the altcoin again. Meanwhile. the much-anticipated pump will be triggered if the candle closes above $2,923. Ethereum has experienced remarkable adoption and interest in spite of occasional price corrections. This growing institutional interest coupled with rising on-activity might serve as key factors bolstering the expected upside move. Ether Naysonal has questioned the actions of individuals presently offloading their ETH holdings despite institutional investors accumulating ETH at a huge scale. Major companies are currently seen acquiring ETH in current market conditions. Financial behemoth and asset manager firm Blackrock has purchased over 100,535 ETH, valued at $284 million. Furthermore, asset management company Fidelity has also acquired about 9,552 ETH, worth around $26.39 million. While the biggest global investment institutions are still purchasing, the analyst asserts it is completely illogical for individual investors to sell after being exposed to misleading waves within a short period. Several bullish structures have emerged on ETH’s chart, suggesting a possible rebound in the short term. With upside momentum building for ETH, the asset may be set for a rally toward a new all-time high. After examining Ethereum’s price action, market expert Jonathan Carter highlighted that the asset is still trading within a Symmetrical Triangle pattern in the weekly time frame. Carter noted that liquidity was collected below support by recent downward wicks before returning to the pattern. Once ETH breaks out of the ascending triangle, Carter anticipates a push towards higher targets such as $3,100, $4,000, $4,850, $6,000, and $7,500 in the long term.

Title: Prime Minister’s global investment summit crucial to Luxon’s year of growth - Matthew Hooton

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and new Economic Growth Minister Nicola Willis need to get their ducks lined up ahead of a global investment summit in five weeks. Photo / Alex Burton THREE KEY FACTS The Prime Minister’s global investment summit is just five weeks away. It is the single most important personal initiative Christopher Luxon will take in his year of economic growth. His reputation – and, more importantly, New Zealand’s credibility as a place to invest money – depends on its success. Large, meaningful investments being contracted at the summit or in the weeks following would signal an endorsement of New Zealand’s economic outlook by the world’s smartest financiers, generating a snowball effect. Their absence would do the opposite, communicating to the world’s investment community that they had taken a good look at New Zealand and found its future wanting. Senior officials, business leaders and ministers have warned Luxon that his summit cannot just be a place for cynical “announceables” or, worse, Jacinda Ardern’s infamous “announcements of announcements”. It must deliver actual investments, which is why Luxon ordered work last year on prospectuses outlining immediately investable propositions. A close prime ministerial eye, drawing on his own business experience, is needed to ensure they are credible. The PM chose the dates for the conference, March 13 and 14, to suit key American investors. It speaks to Luxon’s enormous self-confidence in his persuasive abilities that he has bet Muslim investors he has met in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates will travel to New Zealand almost exactly in the middle of Ramadan. A first measure of the summit’s success will be attracting interest from the world’s largest sovereign wealth and asset-management funds. New Zealand has had a good relationship with the biggest, BlackRock, with its $18.4 trillion under management. After Ardern met BlackRock’s Larry Fink in New York in 2022, her successor Chris Hipkins could announce a $2 billion BlackRock investment in renewable energy shortly before the election, although it isn’t clear what, if anything, it will deliver. Luxon also needs other major private-sector funds like Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, UBS and Deutsche Bank to attend, each managing over $2t of assets. Among sovereign wealth funds, New Zealand has tried unsuccessfully to attract the interest of Norway’s Government Pension Fund, originally established with revenues from its oil industry and now managing over $3t of assets. Luxon’s recent visit to the Middle East has hopefully ensured other trillion-dollar-plus oil-based funds from the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia will show up. Closer to home, Singapore’s Temasek and Australia’s Future Fund will surely be in the room, along with China’s major $2t-plus funds. Given Luxon’s links as a former chief executive and president of Unilever Canada, that country’s federal pension fund and famous Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and CDPQ funds will be high on his list. It’s also important that smaller funds and individuals with existing personal or commercial relationships with New Zealand are included. Most New Zealand investments are much too small for the big funds to have the management resources to bother with. But, famously, the likes of the late Julian Robertson poured hundreds of millions into New Zealand, obviously seeking a decent return but also out of love for the country. In his will, Robertson donated around a quarter-billion dollars of masterpieces to Auckland Art Gallery. Individuals like Robertson can do what they like with their wealth, answering only to their families. Those investing funds on behalf of others have a duty not to be influenced by sentiment. Their assessments of the business environment, the long-term economic outlook and – most of all – the expected rate of return are paramount. Even conservative funds expect around a 7% return to be interested, and others much more. Our own Superannuation Fund, one of the best performing sovereign wealth funds in recent years, would want 10%. Given its purpose, it would be immoral for even it to invest in New Zealand projects if it expected to lose money compared with what it could earn elsewhere. The same is true for everyone else managing other people’s money who Luxon invites to his summit. Rah-rah speeches, corporate videos or other generic marketing material must be and are ignored. The Government’s overseas investment reforms need to be agreed upon among the coalition partners and passed by Parliament in the next five weeks or the summit is probably best cancelled. Likewise, Finance Minister Nicola Willis has finally been given the prime-ministerial nod to talk about company-tax cuts, but the Budget on May 22 is far too late for any cuts to be confirmed, along with necessary compensating tax increases to avoid worsening the fiscal deficit. Willis must deliver on her promise to be bold. Little tax tweaks will make no difference. At 28%, our company rate is well above all the countries on which Luxon says his year of growth is modelled. Ireland’s is 12.5% and Singapore’s 17%. Even the likes of social-democratic Sweden and Denmark tax companies at only 21% and 22% respectively. If Luxon and Willis believe lowering the company tax rate is necessary to attract investment – and even some right-leaning economists dispute that – cutting it by two or three percentage points would achieve nothing. Similarly, as The Economist highlighted to its global readers on its cover this week, the world is going through a period of rapid and radical deregulation, including in Washington, Buenos Aires, Delhi, London and even Brussels. Every day New Zealand procrastinates we fall even further behind. Ideally, Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop will present his bill to fully reform the Resource Management Act before the summit. At the least, he could rush through legislation so that any projects funded at the summit will receive the same fast-track treatment as the 149 identified in his stop-gap legislation last year. More importantly, Regulation Minister David Seymour needs a rev-up from his boss. His Ministry for Regulation already smells like just another Wellington talk shop. So far, it is reviewing just three sectors, the early childhood education market, agricultural and horticultural products like fertilisers and pesticides, and hairdressing. Since its inception over 30 years ago, Act has argued New Zealand is over-regulated. It surely has a list of regulations to deliver to Luxon that could be repealed in the five weeks before the summit. If not, what hope is there that Seymour’s Wellington bureaucrats will find any thereafter? The Prime Minister raised expectations with his State of the Nation speech a fortnight ago. He has managed Waitangi Day well, by staying away from this year’s circus up north and giving an inspiring speech at Ngāi Tahu’s historic Ōnuku Marae. If he can’t or won’t deliver substance behind both before the summit, his year of economic growth risks going the way of Ardern’s 2019 year of delivery. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The ERA ruled the dismissal process was unfair and disproportionate.

Title: ‘We’ve lost 11 days of school ... attendance has collapsed‘: Principals on the enduring effects of Storm Éowyn

Time Published: 2025-02-06T15:47:32Z
Full Content:
Noel Loftus, principal of St Attracta’s National School in Ballaghdereen, Co Roscommon, is still counting the cost of a week without electricity in the aftermath of Storm Éowyn. It was the third enforced closure of the academic year. The school lost two days following Storm Darragh in December, four days due to snow and ice and five days following last week’s power cuts. School attendance at the school – designated as disadvantaged or Deis – has “collapsed”, he says, after making significant progress over recent times. Teachers are also under pressure to catch up with literacy and numeracy targets. The school isn’t alone. By the end of last week some 322 schools had been without power for a week. Numbers fell to 150 early this week – mostly in the Galway, Mayo, Leitrim and Roscommon area. On Thursday of this week a single school in Curry, Co Sligo was without power. A total of about 10,000 homes, meanwhile, have yet to be reconnected. A spokesman for ESB Networks said “full restoration is within our sights”. Many school leaders, however, say they feel they were left adrift by authorities with little contact or evidence that their needs were being prioritised since the storm hit. Some say there is an urgent need to provide emergency access to generators or to ensure schools are at the front of the queue for reconnection in the event of future power outages. “It’s caused consternation,” says one deputy principal of a school in Mayo, who asked not to be named. “Students were facing into mocks and parents were stressed out. We weren’t able to give any guarantees when power would be back.” While power is back, the enduring effects of closures linger. “The school day and year is short, the curriculum is broad and the needs of the children are extensive,” Loftus says. “We’ve been shocked at the impact [of school closures]. When children are not in school, we can’t progress their learning to the targets we have. We have a significant cohort of disadvantaged children – Roma children and others. “Attendance is something we work really hard on. But when you lose that connection with school it takes a long time to build it back up.” To make up for lost tuition time, he says in-school teacher training and sports activities are being postponed to allow for “class contact catch-up time”. There is lingering frustration, meanwhile, among school leaders. Principals say they accept adverse weather conditions will pose challenges, but many feel urgent lessons need to be learned to ensure schools are not left for weeks without power. “There will be other storms and I don’t want to close for a fourth time. If schools can’t get power restored quickly, can there be access to generators?” Loftus says. Minister for Education Helen McEntee said this week she has asked her department to see how authorities can work more quickly to get a better picture of the volume of schools affected and provide speedy access to generators where possible. A spokesman for ESB Networks said it appreciated the frustration of school communities and it had worked closely with the Department of Education to make progress in the face of “unprecedented” circumstances. For now, Loftus says, staff are left asking where schools stand in the eyes of authorities. “We’re an award-winning school in sport and music with a range of highly successful initiatives in literacy and numeracy. It’s for these reasons we feel so strongly about feeling locked out of our school, without any urgency on the part of Government to respond to our plight. “It makes you feel you’re less significant despite the role we play in the lives of children. Rural schools were left to drift. Would this happen in Blackrock in Dublin? I don’t think so.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ondo Finance Launches Tokenized RWA-Focused Layer-1 Blockchain
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/06/ondo-finance-unveils-layer-1-network-for-tokenized-assets
Time Published: 2025-02-06T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
New York, NY — Ondo Finance, the second-largest tokenized Treasuries issuer, said it plans to start its own layer-1 blockchain designed for tokenized real-world assets in a bid to connect traditional capital markets with decentralized finance, the company announced on Thursday at its inaugural Ondo Summit. Ondo Chain was crafted to meet institutional compliance standards while maintaining the transparency and accessibility of public blockchains like Ethereum, the company said. The network will rely on permissioned validators to verify transactions and ensure accurate financial data, such as asset prices and token backing. It will also support staking of tokenized real-world assets and native bridging between blockchains for interoperability. "Financial markets are overdue for an upgrade," CEO Nathan Allman said in a statement. "We’re creating an ecosystem that bridges the best of traditional finance with blockchain technology.” ONDO, the native token of the ecosystem, saw volatile swings following the announcement, dipping 1.5% before rallying 3.5% higher. Soon following the announcement World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance protocol backed by Donald Trump and his family, invested $470,000 in ONDO tokens, blockchain data showed. "We really set out to build something that could combine the best of both traditional finance with its incredible deep liquidity and investor protections with all the benefits of DeFi with its open access and innovation and new primitives," Ian De Bode, chief strategy officer at Ondo, said during a presentation at the Ondo Summit in New York City on Thursday. "However, as we set out on this mission, we realized that the necessary conditions to really bring together really did not exist. The infrastructure to bring these two together really was not present" The announcement comes the day after Ondo unveiled a tokenization platform that helps place stocks, bonds and funds on blockchain rails. Allman said that he believes that with a new administration in place, it could take two to three years to achieve meaningful adoption for tokenized real-world assets. Tokenization, or the creation of digital tokens that represent ownership of traditional assets on a blockchain, is gaining traction globally. Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring the process in pursuit of operational efficiency gains like speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. The tokenized RWA market could grow to trillions of dollars through this decade, reports from McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein have projected. Recently, several influential leaders in the financial world touted tokenized RWAs as the next frontier of financial innovation. Larry Fink, CEO of asset management behemoth BlackRock, said bonds and stocks will be traded on blockchain rails in the future and urged U.S. regulators and policymakers to create rules for security tokens. Vlad Tenev, co-founder and CEO of digital brokerage Robinhood, said tokenization could democratize access to private equity investment, which is currently limited to accredited investors and wealthy individuals, and proposed rule changes to unlock tokenized asset investments for retail investors. Ondo Finance is the second largest issuer of tokenized U.S. Treasuries offerings, according to rwa.xyz data. The protocol's U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY) and Short-Term US Government Bond (OUSG) tokens stand at $385 million and $268 million market capitalization, respectively. UPDATE (Feb. 6, 2025, 15:36 UTC): Adds quotes and ONDO price move. UPDATE (Feb. 6, 2025, 17:50 UTC): Adds World Liberty Financial's ONDO token investment.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Rebound Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ:APOG) stands against the other rebound stocks. The United States economy is in a constant state of flux. In recent weeks, moderated growth, evolving monetary policies, and significant trade developments have impacted the overall outlook for the economy. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) anticipates a deceleration in US economic growth, projecting a decrease from 2.6% in 2024 to 1.6% in 2025. This slowdown is expected to be mitigated by monetary policy easing, with policy interest rates projected to decline by an additional 1.5 percentage points by the end of 2025, aligning rates toward neutral levels. Contrastingly, Goldman Sachs offers a more optimistic outlook, forecasting a 2.5% growth in US GDP for 2025, surpassing the consensus estimate of 1.9%. Chief US Economist David Mericle emphasizes the diminishing recession fears, noting that inflation is trending back toward 2%, and the labor market has rebalanced but remains strong. However, potential policy changes, including increased tariffs and reduced immigration, could influence this trajectory.

President Trump's announcement of 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on Chinese imports, has led to swift retaliatory measures and heightened fears of a global trade war. Major stock indices, including Germany's DAX, France's CAC, and the UK's FTSE 100, experienced declines. In the US, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures indicated drops as well. Analysts express concerns that these tariffs could increase consumer prices, affect corporate profits, and potentially lead to recessions in both Mexico and Canada. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs are revising their economic forecasts, considering potential court injunctions against the tariffs, and evaluating broader economic impacts, including inflation hikes and growth decreases.

Title: 'It's a disaster': Students missing college and carers late for appointments due to ghost buses

Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. BUSES BEING CANCELLED or not showing up as scheduled are causing people in Dublin to be late for work or school, politicians have warned. There have been multiple reports of certain buses on routes operated by Go-Ahead Ireland being cancelled with little notice, as well as so-called ‘ghost buses’ that appear to be en route – based on information on the app or bus stop signs – but never turn up. Issues have been reported with a number of routes including the N6 (Finglas to Kilbarrack via Ballymun), N2 (Clontarf Road to Heuston Station), S6 (Tallaght to Blackrock) and S4 (Liffey Valley to UCD). A number of issues have also been reported with routes which are part of the latest phase of the rollout of BusConnects services, which was launched on 26 January. People Before Profit Councillor Conor Reddy, who represents the Ballymun-Finglas area, told The Journal ghost buses are “a city-wide problem”. Multiple people have contacted him about ghost buses and cancelled services, saying they have been late to work or college as a result. “It’s having a real impact. I had calls yesterday from two carers who are from Ballymun but work in the Coolock and Kilbarrack areas – it meant that they couldn’t make care visits on time. “When you’re on the clock, if you’re home-help, it can have a huge consequence for the person that you’re caring for, as well as a very limited allocation of time given over to them. So, it’s been a disaster.” #Dáil Topical Issue 3: Paul Murphy @paulmurphy_TD - To the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine - To discuss bus services provided by Go Ahead Ireland. #SeeForYourselfhttps://t.co/TvtNmjTv4T pic.twitter.com/aRaX2GsiOF— Houses of the Oireachtas - Tithe an Oireachtais (@OireachtasNews) February 5, 2025 #Dáil Topical Issue 3: Paul Murphy @paulmurphy_TD - To the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine - To discuss bus services provided by Go Ahead Ireland. #SeeForYourselfhttps://t.co/TvtNmjTv4T pic.twitter.com/aRaX2GsiOF People Before Profit TD for Dublin South West Paul Murphy also raised the issue in Dáil last night, saying he had been “inundated with complaints about Go-Ahead buses not showing up”. “Cancellations and ghost busses have been an ongoing issue with these privatised routes, but in the last few weeks it has gotten absolutely ridiculous. “A UCD student contacted me to say he was late for lectures three days in a row because of cancellations, delays, and overloaded S6s that didn’t stop. He says, ‘Many young people like me are considering buying cars because public transport is so unreliable’.” Advertisement Go-Ahead Ireland, which operates several bus routes across the Greater Dublin Area, confirmed it is aware of the issues and apologised to passengers. A spokesperson for the company said the service disruptions are due to staffing issues and illness. “There is currently a shortage of mechanics impacting transport operators nationally. “This issue has been further aggravated by seasonal illnesses which has reduced the current number of active mechanics able to service our fleet at a given time.” Reddy believes some of the recruitment issues are because of “poor pay and conditions”, saying it’s a consequence of privatisation of bus services. The Go-Ahead spokesperson told The Journal the company has been running “a dedicated mechanics recruitment campaign offering a comprehensive and competitive package for candidates”. As well as the recruitment campaign, Go-Ahead is investing in its apprenticeship programme and “exploring alternative candidate pools outside of Ireland to fulfil our rosters as soon as possible”, they added. This is not the first time there have been issues with bus services operated by Go-Ahead. In 2023, the National Transport Authority (NTA) imposed performance-related penalties of €1.1 million on Go-Ahead and just over €3 million in 2022. A spokesperson for the NTA said the organisation “is monitoring the situation closely, and is receiving daily reports from Go Ahead”. “The operator expects this to continue to improve in the coming days. The Authority has requested a remedial plan from the operator to include details of when services are expected to return to full timetable on each route.” Speaking about the ongoing rollout of BusConnects services, Reddy said he is “in principle, fully supportive of the idea” and its goal of improving connectivity across Dublin. However, he said that while some areas are benefitting, others have been left behind. The councillor said older people or people with disabilities in Ballymun are struggling to access services, for example. “There are large parts of Ballymun where people have to walk 15 minutes or more to get to one of the new bus routes. “So there was an opportunity, I think, with BusConnects that was missed – an opportunity to reconnect parts of Ballymun that had a bus service in the past with the new network, and it wasn’t taken unfortunately.” Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: House bill seeks to curb corporate purchases of single-family homes (FL)

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/06/2025 4:35:56 AM PST by Jacquerie A House bill filed on Wednesday would limit corporations and investment firms from buying up single-family homes and converting them into rentals, giving local governments the authority to restrict investor-owned housing. The Strengthening Home Ownership in Florida Act (HB 401), filed by Rep. Berny Jacques, seeks to protect homeownership opportunities by keeping more properties in the hands of individual buyers. The measure allows counties and cities to zone land exclusively for owner-occupied homes, preventing large-scale rental conversions in certain areas. It additionally creates a new classification, “single-family hybrid housing,” which applies to homes primarily used as rentals and owned by corporations, investment groups, or related entities. Under the proposal, an individual or related entity cannot own more than three single-family properties in a county and still qualify for residential zoning. Local governments would have broad authority to enforce these rules through zoning and land-use regulations. Under the bill’s purview, municipalities could prohibit hybrid housing in designated areas while still allowing it elsewhere. The bill also includes exemptions for builders and developers, allowing them to construct and sell new homes without restrictions as long as the properties are unoccupied and intended for sale.

Title: Federal workers have to make their decisions on buyout offers today
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-workers-decision-deadline-buyout-offers-uncertainty-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-06T12:31:08Z

Happy almost Friday! Google's reversal of its promise not to use AI for weapons or surveillance led some employees to run to their meme generators. "Are we the baddies?" In today's big story, it's the last day for federal workers to decide if they want to accept President Donald Trump's buyout offers. What's on deck Markets: Citi shows no signs of joining Wall Street's RTO trend. Tech: Silicon Valley's new favorite buzzy term is "high agency." Business: Some burned-out doctors are ditching the operating room for the board room. But first, are you in or are you out? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's a critical day for one of the most ambitious and unprecedented ways President Donald Trump is shaking up the federal workforce. Today marks the deadline for millions of government workers to accept the new administration's deferred resignation offer. BI's Ayelet Sheffey and Juliana Kaplan spoke to some workers mulling their options and grappling with questions about how the buyouts will actually work. Chief among their concerns are the impact the offer will have on retirement plans, how it will be affected by a potential government shutdown, and why they can't get more time to decide. Trump's buyout offer isn't completely unheard of. In fact, it looks pretty similar to Elon Musk's 2022 takeover of X. The key difference is that the public sector is known for its job stability, which may be why the offer is causing so much drama among its workers. The other elephant in the room is what'll happen if not enough workers resign. The government is aiming for 5-10% of its more than two million workers to take the deal. As of Tuesday, more than 20,000 workers had taken buyouts, but the Office of Personnel Management told BI it expected a large spike in the final runup to the deadline. The Department of Government Efficiency is staying busy in the meantime. The US Agency for International Development is Trump and Musk's latest cost-cutting target. The agency's staff was notified earlier this week that all personnel except for a few essential workers would be placed on administrative leave on Friday. BI's Noah Sheidlower has a breakdown on how the foreign aid agency, which distributed nearly $32.5 billion last year, spends its money. Speaking of money, the group that controls government payments — the Treasury Department — is also in Musk's crosshairs. President Trump gave Musk's DOGE access to the government's payment system, which caused quite the stir. The White House has maintained DOGE is limited to "read-only access" and its work on the Treasury plays into DOGE's overall mission of reducing government waste. But that hasn't eased concerns over the potential impact on a system that manages trillions in payments, including Social Security and tax refunds. It's the latest example of the incredible power the world's richest man appears to hold within the US government. House Speaker Mike Johnson isn't worried, though. He defended DOGE's role and said there is a "gross overreaction in the media" over how Musk is trying to cut spending. Jamie Dimon says he didn't run for president because he knew winning the White House would mean barely seeing his family for four years. 1. Palantir stock is on a hot streak, but Wall Street's not biting. Palantir stock surged 28% after it reported a strong Q4 earnings beat, putting it up almost 35% this year. Even so, few analysts are bullish on it. They're concerned about Palantir's high valuation and skeptical it can grow enough to maintain its current stock price. 2. Working for Citi doesn't mean having to go into the city. Wall Street titans are leading the charge with RTO mandates — except Citigroup. On a quarterly call with executives last month, CEO Jane Fraser emphasized hybrid work and mentioned it could give the bank a competitive edge when it comes to recruitment. Regardless, the company is still shelling out $1.2 billion for its new London office. 3. The advisor behind BlackRock's alternative assets expansion. Bob Steel, vice chair of boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg, has a laundry list of career achievements: two-time bank CEO, Goldman partner, and US Treasury undersecretary. More recently, Steel gave longtime friend Larry Fink some advice on BlackRock breaking into alternative investments. In a chat with BI, Steel explained his process with Fink and shared some wisdom for up-and-coming bankers. 1. Broke: "disruptor." Woke: "high agency." Silicon Valley has a new buzzword to describe the successful, smart, and self-motivated. It's called "high agency," and it's everyone's favorite new label. 2. It's not "RIP Temu and Shein" anymore. The two retailers disrupted the e-commerce industry by avoiding paying duty on shipments through a provision of customs law called Section 321, also known as de minimis. Many thought Trump's recent executive order closing that loophole would be a death knell for the companies. Temu and Shein will suffer a blow — but it might not be as bad as many initially thought. And if you recently placed an order, it should be fine. 3. DeepSeek's low-cost AI revolution isn't here … yet. When it burst onto the scene with its cheaper-to-build and cheaper-to-run models, DeepSeek was expected by some to revolutionize the entire AI startup system. That hasn't happened yet. Cloud providers are having trouble offering customers access to DeepSeek at fast and reliable speeds, slowing down the big switch to low-cost AI that startups had hoped for. 1. Doctors facing burnout may ditch the stethoscope. Tech companies are looking to bolster their credibility, especially with health innovation, and doctors are pitching in. Chief medical officers make $275,000 a year on average in the US — and don't have the crazy hours doctors normally deal with. Some say these corporate roles let them have a bigger impact on an otherwise "broken" health system, even amid a looming physician shortage. 2. Disney's game plan, in Iger's words. The company's sports streaming moves have been a roller coaster ride full of similar-sounding names — Venu and Fubo and Hulu, oh my! The abundance of options makes it difficult for consumers to understand Disney's sports strategy, a point an analyst raised on the company's earnings call. CEO Bob Iger clarified the goal is to make ESPN "as accessible as possible" and gave a little more insight in response. 3. "Moneyball" author Michael Lewis thinks the sports betting boom could become a mess. In 2018, gambling and media companies approached sports betting with caution. Today, gambling apps are met with little resistance, and college-aged men are getting in on the action. BI's Peter Kafka spoke with Lewis about how sports betting went mainstream — and what the fallout could be. 100,000 eggs were stolen from a supplier in Pennsylvania amid rising prices.

Title: US Bitcoin Reserve Will Lead To ‘Pain In Under 2 Years,’ Warns Arthur Hayes
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/us-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-terrible-idea-arthur-hayes/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T11:00:41Z
Full Content:
In his latest essay entitled “The Genie,” crypto entrepreneur and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes denounced calls for a United States Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (BSR), warning that such a program would create “unnecessary pain in under two years” and transform the world’s largest cryptocurrency into a potent political weapon. Hayes also cautioned the industry against pursuing what he deems to be an overcomplicated “Frankenstein crypto regulatory bill,” which, he argues, would primarily benefit large centralized institutions rather than foster true decentralization. Hayes questions both the feasibility and the long-term consequences of establishing a national Bitcoin stockpile. He argues the US government would be motivated by politics rather than sound financial strategy, potentially leading to manipulation of the Bitcoin market. In his view, a BSR risks becoming a mechanism for politicians to raise funds for unrelated agendas: “Let’s assume that Trump is able to create a BSR. The government buys one million Bitcoin, as suggested by US Senator Lummis. Boom! The price goes nuts. Then, the buying concludes, and the up-only trend channel stops.” Hayes envisions a subsequent administration—one hostile to Bitcoin or crypto in general—deciding to liquidate this enormous reserve. “What if [the Democrats] got a veto-proof majority in the House of Representatives? By 2028, what if a Democrat won the election … finding easy piles of cash to spend on goodies for their supporters is the first directive. There are one million Bitcoin just sitting there, ready to be sold… The market would rightly fear when and how these Bitcoin would be sold.” Another of Hayes’ key contentions is that regulation shaped by special interests could inadvertently stifle the very innovation it aims to promote. According to Hayes, large exchanges and financial intermediaries with the resources to influence lawmakers are more likely to drive regulatory outcomes. This, he suggests, will burden smaller innovators and strengthen the position of major centralized players: “The crypto regulatory wishes likely to be granted… will be in the form of overly complicated, prescriptive rules that only large and wealthy centralized companies can afford… Is that what the broader crypto community actually desired from the genie? … Maybe those readers who are shareholders of Coinbase and BlackRock want a Frankenstein crypto bill. But I believe this type of regulation does nothing to alter the status quo.” Rather than a BSR, Hayes proposes a more radical and complex financial arrangement involving the US Treasury, Bitcoin, and “century bonds” (100-year zero-coupon bonds). His idea is for the US to unilaterally devalue its existing Treasury obligations by announcing that Bitcoin will replace sovereign debt as the neutral global reserve asset. The plan, in his own words, would involve a public statement from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, declaring the intention to use Bitcoin as the reserve asset while retaining the US dollar as the invoicing currency. Afterward, the Dollar would undergo a progressive devaluation, with the US Treasury bidding for Bitcoin at increasingly higher prices while issuing century bonds instead of immediate cash payouts. The next step would be extending the maturity of Treasury debt, with the Treasury selling Bitcoin at a profit to buy back and retire shorter-term obligations, ultimately pushing US debt maturity to 100 years. Additionally, global USD adoption would be accelerated through stablecoin transfers on social media platforms like Facebook and X, enabling everyday users to participate in US bond markets—bypassing conventional banking intermediaries. “That’s it for the financial history… The additional new goal is to make Bitcoin the global neutral reserve currency,” Hayes explains. He believes such a strategy could restore US hegemony by transitioning from the traditional “petrodollar” or “Treasury-based” system to one anchored in Bitcoin, all while ensuring large swaths of Bitcoin’s mining operations remain within US borders. In a more cautionary afterword, Hayes highlights that crypto voters played a notable role in returning Donald Trump and the Republican Party to power. Yet he stresses the slow pace of action on crypto issues, contrasting it with the administration’s rapid implementation of tariffs and rollbacks of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates. “When Trump wants to act, he acts… The removal of ESG and DEI policies… came swiftly… That’s a shame because on the margin, the crypto single-issue voter put [the Republicans] in power.” He also reiterates his forecast that Bitcoin could see a sharp correction to a range of $70,000 to $75,000 before rallying higher in the long-term —if there is no immediate, concrete legislation favoring permissionless innovation or further monetary stimulus. For now, Hayes urges those “lining up day after day dressed in a seersucker suit or block heels and a summer dress hoping to ask the orange genie for a wish” to think carefully: “Stacking sats is my game, and I hope yours is too. Therefore, if you find yourself at the genie’s table… please wish for the right things.” At press time, BTC traded at $98,190.

Title: BlackRock plans to launch a Bitcoin ETP in Europe

BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, is gearing up to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe. The step marks another significant step in the firm’s expansion into the cryptocurrency market and is set to be registered in Switzerland. This move follows the resounding success of BlackRock’s $58 billion US Bitcoin ETF, which by early February 2025 had gathered $57.5 billion in net assets. This alone speaks volumes about the investor appetite for such products. CEO Larry Fink’s remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos highlighted Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against currency debasement, suggesting a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as an alternative store of value. This European venture is anticipated to attract both institutional and retail investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. The decision to domicile the ETP in Switzerland was strategic, leveraging the country’s reputation as a hub for digital asset innovation, particularly within its “Crypto Valley” in Zug. Switzerland’s progressive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies has made it an attractive location for BlackRock to extend its Bitcoin investment offerings beyond North American borders. The choice of Switzerland not only aligns with BlackRock’s aim to capitalize on crypto-friendly regulations, but also positions the firm to lead in the European market. Notably, the plans to launch an ETP in Europe comes at a time when the European Union is navigating its own regulatory path through the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which was established in 2023. The MiCA framework aims to ensure consumer protection and market integrity, providing a stable environment for crypto investments. Despite the European crypto market capitalizing at $17.3 billion — far less than the US’s $116.4 billion — BlackRock’s move could significantly boost the sector. BlackRock’s entry into this market underscores the growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, a trend that has been further propelled by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024.

Title: BlackRock Said to be Preparing to Launch Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Product in Europe

Photo Credit: Bloomberg BlackRock's IBIT has grown rapidly, amassing net assets of $57.5 billion as of February 4 BlackRock is gearing up to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe within weeks, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid growing demand for exposure to cryptocurrencies from both money managers and consumers. The product will likely be domiciled in Switzerland, the source added. The Wall Street giant has incorporated a Zurich-based company focused on digital assets - iShares Digital Assets AG - in recent months, according to a regulatory filing seen by Reuters. BlackRock declined to comment. BlackRock was one of the first institutional investors to offer exchange-traded products to track the spot price of bitcoin after the US Securities and Exchange Commission first approved them in January 2024. The SEC's move was a watershed moment for the asset class, boosting hopes in the crypto industry that cryptocurrencies would become more widely integrated in mainstream finance. BlackRock's main bitcoin-linked product IBIT has grown rapidly, amassing net assets of $57.5 billion (roughly Rs. 5,03,523 crore) as of February 4, according to BlackRock's website. However, not all global investors can access the existing US-domiciled products. Bloomberg was first to report on BlackRock's plans in Europe. While the US crypto industry has celebrated Trump's election and his pledge to support the sector, crypto businesses in Europe are facing new, tougher regulation. The European Union's landmark crypto regulatory framework, known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) was introduced in early 2023 and is in the process of being rolled out. © Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Title: Most Promising Altcoins to Buy as First Avalance and Cardano ETPs Appear
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-as-avalance-and-cardano-etps-appear/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T09:16:44Z

Swedish asset manager Virtune launched Avalanche ($AVAX) and Cardano ($ADA) exchange-traded products (ETPs) on the Finnish market. Previously, Virtue rolled out $BTC, $SOL, and XRP ETPs, as well as the Crypto Altcoin Index ETP, which gives exposure to the top 10 cryptos at once. The demand for crypto among European investors is evidently growing, which suggests the bull run is far from over. Virtue’s ETPs could push $AVAX and $ADA to new heights due to accelerated adoption and set a precedent for other fund managers to launch altcoin products. In light of this news, we share the five most promising altcoins to buy now. The market cap of Solana ecosystem tokens grew 120% last month alone. That’s a double-edged sword because Solana isn’t ready to handle such a surge in activity. Solaxy ($SOLX) could help Solana handle this ever-increasing workload by offloading part of transactions to its Layer-2 chain. In fact, this is the first hybrid Layer-2 solution that connected Solana with Ethereum. Solaxy’s goal is to speed up processing, lower fees, and eliminate congestion on the Solana mainnet. This would allow more projects to launch on Solana without compromising user experience. The project’s native token, $SOLX, is now available on presale at $0.001626, but the price will increase in 23 hours. Early adopters have invested $18.2M so far and staked 5B tokens at a 222% APY. Autonomous agents are a new wave of AI evolution. Unlike bots that only follow pre-programmed instructions, AI agents can make decisions, solve problems, and learn independently. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) blends this next-gen technology with the viral appeal of Pepe the Frog. As a self-sovereign agent, MIND of Pepe analyzes data from crypto aggregators and social media to gauge market trends and sentiment. As a result, MIND of Pepe can deliver unbiased, real-time trading insights to its community, engage in discussions with other users, and launch its own tokens. $MIND token holders will gain exclusive access to the agent’s knowledge and governance rights. With one token worth $0.0032662, now is the best time to join the community. Analysts expect $MIND to explode after major exchanges confirm its listings, so the first adopters are up for the highest returns. Best Wallet is the fastest-growing crypto wallet ecosystem currently on the market, rapidly approaching its goal of capturing 40% of the market by 2026. This non-custodial hit wallet lets you store (obviously), buy, sell, swap, and stake assets across several blockchains. But its standout feature is the Token Launchpad, which gives access to all of the best presales from one app. The $BEST token presale hit the ground running recently and already generated $9.2M in funding, most of which will go toward the platform’s improvement. With a price of $0.023875, set to increase in 13 hours, there will be no better time to secure your share of tokens than now. Litecoin ($LTC) struggled to reach its former highs in 2024, but 2025 might be different. The main catalyst for its anticipated growth is new $LTC ETPs in the US and European markets. US asset manager Canary Capital recently filed an application for an $LTC ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fast-tracked it through the first stage of the review process, so it might launch in spring. $LTC is also part of Virtune’s Crypto Altcoin Index ETP because it meets the strict criteria of the Nasdaq Crypto Index Europe index. Uniswap is the world’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX) with an over $2T cumulative trading volume. Its native token, $UNI, is also featured in Virtune’s Crypto Altcoin Index ETP and has a $5.6B market cap. $UNI is now trading -79.24% below its all-time high of $44.97 recorded in 2021. Yet, institutional capital inflows from products like Virtune’s ETP might revive the token and the entire Uniswap ecosystem. While Hyperliquid ($HYPE) recently surpassed $UNI by market cap, the platform’s developments and institutional interest might drive it to new heights. The launch of altcoin ETPs attracts institutional capital into their respective ecosystems and the crypto industry as a whole. In the long term, this should drive innovation and increase crypto’s legitimacy in the eyes of the public. This confidence trickles down to presales like Solaxy and Best Wallet Token, which can attract a wider pool of investors, including those previously hesitant to participate in early-stage projects. However, remember to DYOR before investing in any cryptocurrency. Even projects with strong fundamentals don’t guarantee returns. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Meet Bob Steel, the Perella investment banker and former Treasury undersecretary who is advising Larry Fink on his alternative investment buying spree
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/robert-steel-perella-weinberg-investment-banker-advising-blackrock-fink-alternatives-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-06T09:15:01Z
Full Content:
Robert Steel has had the kind of career most people on Wall Street only dream about. He spent 30 years at powerhouse investment bank Goldman Sachs, where he rose to partner before "retiring" in 2004. In 2006, he became undersecretary of the US Treasury under President George W. Bush and helped prepare the government's response to what became the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. He stepped in as CEO of troubled bank Wachovia during the darkest days of that crisis and later served as Deputy Mayor for economic development of New York City under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Since 2014, Steel has helped lead boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg, first as CEO and now as vice chairman. Last year, he helped the firm score a role as a top advisor to BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, in its expansion into alternative assets. Specifically, Steel worked with longtime friend Larry Fink on two recent acquisitions tied to BlackRock's expansion into investments traditionally reserved for the uberwealthy: Its $12.5 billion purchase of private-equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and its $12 billion purchase of private-credit giant HPS Investment Partners (HPS). Steel said BlackRock's latest acquisitions were driven by its leadership's conviction that time was of the essence. "I think the BlackRock people had what I would describe as a pretty courageous point of view that the opportunity was, for now, significant," he said, adding: "So they'd rather not take the time to build. They'd rather buy and be a strong participant right away." The spate of deals, including a $3.2-billion acquisition of data provider Preqin, has led some on Wall Street to describe Blackrock's ambitions as potentially game-changing. Marc Rowan, the CEO of private-equity giant Apollo Global Management, recently pointed to the deals as evidence of a new investment paradigm that will meld the realms of publicly traded stocks and bonds with so-called private investments. "Our industry grew up where I think people thought private was risky and public was safe," Rowan said on a quarterly earnings call. BlackRock, he added, "has delivered a wakeup call to their entire peer set that private is going to be an important part of client solutions going forward." Business Insider sat down with Steel to talk about his long and storied career, his recent work helping BlackRock expand into alternative assets, his advice to the next generation of bankers, and why retirement is not on his to-do list. Steel and Larry Fink, BlackRock's founder and CEO, have been friends for about 20 years. They first got to know each other around 2006, Steel said, while he was Treasury undersecretary in Washington. They've supported some of the same causes over the years, including as cosigners of a public letter in support of Mayor Adams' public safety and crime reduction efforts in 2022. They're also both on the executive committee of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit that seeks to maintain the city's position as an economic and cultural hub. Steel said he got involved in Blackrock's expansion when Fink invited him and his team to assist with a non-alts project that "didn't come to fruition," without saying what it was. Steel and Perella soon became part of the team Fink relied on for advice about expanding into alternative assets. "When he was thinking about people to help with these transactions and give him advice, he thought of me and our firm," Steel said. Given Steel's long history with Wall Street, he ended up knowing people on both sides of the transactions. HPS was co-founded by Scott Kapnick, Goldman Sachs' former head of investment banking, while GIP's chairman, Adebayo Ogunlesi, was previously a Goldman board member. "This was a case where I knew the people in BlackRock, I knew the people at GIP, and I knew the people at HPS," he told BI. "So I was involved intensely all the way through." In describing his role in the deals, he said: "I wasn't writing documents and arguing with lawyers, but I was basically trying to provide momentum to the transaction and to understand the pros and cons and the challenges. And I think I was pretty central to that." A BlackRock spokesman confirmed Perella's role in the HPS and GIP acquisitions and declined to comment on whether the firm plans to buy more companies in a space that Fink has called "critical" to the firm's growth. "Private market assets are an increasingly vital part of capital markets," Fink said in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January. "And blending both public and private markets will be critical to fully capturing growth opportunities." Steel said he came from "a very middle-class background" in Durham, North Carolina, with no connections to Wall Street. As a student at nearby Duke University, he had little interest in finance. "I steered away from math and science and quantitative things in undergraduate school," said Steel, who majored in history and political science. Eventually, that changed. He started in institutional sales at Goldman Sachs in 1976 (and remedied his quantitative knowledge by enrolling in the University of Chicago's nighttime MBA program a few years later). Ever since, Steel said, the biggest theme of his career has been collaboration and teamwork. He pointed to the late 1980s, when he and his team at Goldman launched an ECM division in Europe, as an example. "The idea of setting strategy for equities and then finding the right people to help lead and execute that was pretty extraordinary," he said. "Goldman Sachs was not very well known in the continent, and we built businesses and built a brand, and I think were pretty successful." Steel was soon made a Goldman partner, and about six years later, he moved back to New York to co-lead the US Equities Division. "I was lucky enough to be in a place where the firm was growing and creating new opportunities where I don't think I had one job for 30 years — I think I had half a dozen jobs for five years," he said. While Goldman taught Steel teamwork, Washington DC taught him about working under fire. "You're doing a lot of things for the first time and you don't really know what's going to work, what's not going to work," he said. "So trying to figure that out so you can hopefully prevent something like a mean-spirited recession is a lot of responsibility, and so that was a pretty challenging time." Moving from the private to the public sector also required adjustments in other ways. He explained that authority in the corporate world is clearly assigned, ending with the CEO. In government, authority is shared due to checks and balances. "When you're solving the same puzzles in the public sector, that success generally comes more slowly and takes more time and often requires a bit of compromise — different than the corporate world," he said. Steel was CEO of Perella between 2014 and 2019, and the firm worked on some notable transactions during that time, including AT&T's $108.7 billion purchase of Time Warner in 2016 and iHeartMedia's $16 billion bankruptcy restructuring in 2019. As vice chairman, Steel is part of Perella's board of directors and helps with the strategic direction of the firm along with Chairman Peter Weinberg, a founding partner, and Andrew Bednar, who took over the CEO role from Weinberg in 2023. Although Steel, 73, has certainly earned the right to retire, he told BI he has zero interest in spending his days on a golf course or lounging at a beach. "I'll take time away over the holidays, but the idea of doing nothing seems pretty uninteresting," he said. "I think the goal is to wear out, not rust out." "I have friends that are really happy at a different rhythm, and I have no judgments," he said. "But it wouldn't be for me." Steel, however, appreciates the flexibility the pandemic has introduced to the corporate world, including banking. Early on in his career, he said, the pressure behind constant face time was, at times, overkill. "I think 'presentism' is maybe a bit overvalued. That doesn't mean you shouldn't be focused, committed, and available, but the idea that every day I had to be in before my boss and stay until after he left," he said, "I think that's moderated a bit, which I think is a good thing." His main advice to young people is to become an integral and irreplaceable part of your company or team. He said you must think beyond the day-to-day tasks to get there. "Thinking about how what you're doing fits into a bigger picture and understanding that perspective is a good tool," he said. Jump to

Title: Ruchii restaurant review: This neighbourhood Indian spot has the potential to become a foodie destination

I love a thali – tiny copper pots gleaming like a miniature banquet, each promising its own little world of flavour. But before I even get to order it at Ruchii, crisp poppadoms land on the table, accompanied by a green apple chutney – light, tart and clean – and a strawberry chutney that tastes unmistakably of the fruit itself. Both are made in-house, arriving as I’m still surveying the menu. Ruchii sits just off George’s Avenue in Blackrock, having relocated from its former perch above Conway’s pub. It’s now in a bigger space with a wilfully expansive menu and just enough gloss to remind you that its owners, Murali and Sateesh Sayana, have a clear vision for elevating Indian cuisine. The menu roams the subcontinent like a train on the Indian Railways: butter chicken and rogan josh from the north, dosas from the south, and the fiery Chettinad spice blends from Tamil Nadu rattling through the lot. This kind of range and variety could spell trouble for the kitchen, but it turns out to be no issue for the team of four Indian chefs, led by chef-patron Sateesh. Growing up in his father’s restaurant in Andhra Pradesh, Sateesh learned to mix idli and dosa batter as a child. Following professional stints in Jaipur and Agra, he moved to Dublin in 2002 to cook in Rasam, and has laid on feasts for everyone from the Indian prime minister to Cher. The soft-shell crab (€13.50) is a tasty starter, lightly battered and fried to a golden crunch. It is accompanied with chutneys and curry leaf mayonnaise, firmly anchoring it in the south Indian coastal tradition. The cocktails, however, are a little less precise. A margarita (€10.95) is overly sweet, missing that all-important sour-salty snap that keeps you coming back for another sip. Drinkable, yes, but not the cocktail you’d want paired with food this vibrant. Stick to beer or wine. The well-considered list focuses on aromatic, full-bodied options with enough weight for the dishes, though I remain unconvinced that wine is the ideal match for Indian food. The fish curry (€22.50) features large, fresh chunks of cod cloaked in ginger, garlic, mustard seed and that floral hit of pathar ke phool, all luxuriating in a creamy coconut sauce. We’ve paired it with pilau rice (€3), fragrant with rosewater and topped with fried onions, alongside wonderful garlic naan – hot from the tandoor, steaming and lavishly slathered in ghee. [ Firebyrd takeaway review: Nashville fried chicken rules the roost at this D6 restaurantOpens in new window ] Then comes the thali (€33), the main event, a copper tray bristling with little pots arranged in perfect order. Inspired by the six primary tastes of Indian culinary tradition – salt, sour, sweet, bitter, astringent and pungent – it’s as much a lesson in balance as it is a meal. Salty richness is found in the dal Makhani. It is made from urad lentils and is less buttery than you may find elsewhere, but is slow-cooked to bring an earthy depth. The creamy tomato sauce in the butter chicken brings a delicate sweetness in a base so velvety you could wear it, while the tender lamb pieces in the rogan josh hum with the pungency of toasted fennel and the warmth of cardamom. The spinach, which is rich and creamy, is cooked with fenugreek to bring a subtle bitterness to the dish; and the prawns, in a coconut-based sauce, get a touch of sourness from tamarind and raw mango. It’s one of those sauces you find yourself finishing long after the prawns are gone, wishing there were more as it lingers on the palate, allowing the spicy heat to build. A brightly coloured beetroot raita is subtly sweet and refreshing. Dessert is a lentil doughnut drowning in jaggery syrup, unapologetically sweet and defiantly sticky. It’s exactly the type of ending you’d expect from an Indian meal – traditional and indulgent. Ruchii’s menu reflects India’s culinary diversity, with its extensive selection offering something for everyone. It’s a mix of the comforting and the challenging, the traditional and the experimental. For a suburban spot, it punches above its weight – a bold attempt to cram the breadth of Indian cuisine into a single menu. It’s also an invitation: to explore, to taste and to learn about the rich histories and traditions that shape each dish.

Title: What 2025 Has in Store For The Future of ESG

Once a corporate imperative, the ESG movement is now facing mounting backlash, forcing companies and investors to rethink their approach. What is the future of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance)? The global craze of companies, countries, investors and regulators wanting to achieve sustainability goals based on environmental, social and governance benchmarks is now facing strong headwinds. Despite clear evidence that the world faces growing threats from climate change, rising social inequality and shaky governance, many of the actors that had been strong advocates for ESG are retreating from their stated aims. Consider these recent developments: First, The US has (once again) withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, leading other major countries such as Indonesia to doubt the credibility of the climate targets set in Paris. Then there is growing pushback from major companies in the EU around the EU ESG Taxonomy, saying it makes them globally uncompetitive and raises their cost of capital. More and more companies are scaling back or abandoning their ESG targets as they realise it is either too unrealistic, too expensive or politically unwise to stay the course. ESG funds, long the darling of investors, have underperformed in investment returns compared to non-ESG funds in recent years and also saw an outflow of funds; Blackrock, the “cheerleader“ for the ESG investing movement, has walked away from a number of its ESG ambitions. DEI programs in rich, mainly Western countries are coming under fire and many such initiatives are being phased out. So, is the ESG movement over? Not really. ESG will continue to evolve in new ways despite these headwinds. In fact, in some ways these current developments could help usher in a newer, better form of ESG: call it ESG 2.0. What would ESG 2.0 look like? Here are some likely scenarios: First, companies will continue to make investments in ESG but will measure tangible financial returns before they make these investments; these returns will include calculating the reduction in cost of funding (especially in developing countries), monetising decarbonisation efforts through carbon credits, achieving lasting operating cost reductions, and so on. Next, regulators will shift the emphasis away from “compliance” based ESG, ie submitting reports, to “enforcement“ based ESG where bad actors will face sanctions in the form of higher taxes, fines or loss of licenses. All investors, regardless of whether they have an explicit ESG focus, will integrate ESG considerations into their investment decisions but will do so by factoring in climate, social and other externalities that directly impact the value of their investment. Then you have new stakeholder alliances involving NGOs, the media, the legal profession, and ordinary citizens will harness the power of AI and the information revolution to mount more targeted campaigns against companies that are bad actors. In many ways, all these scenarios are already playing out. Climate lawsuits led by stakeholders against fossil fuel companies are happening with more frequency than ever in various courtrooms around the world. More and more governments are implementing carbon and other natural resource taxes. More and more “green transition“ funds are available to governments and companies for developing countries under the COP framework that are committed to meeting these goals. Investors are nervous about “climate-related bankruptcies” like Pacific Gas & Electric and are actively investing in tools to quantify such risks. Welcome to the new world of ESG, against a daunting backdrop of a burning world! Let’s hope it succeeds this time!

Title: BlackRock Set To Launch Bitcoin-Linked ETF In Europe Following US Success

In a significant development for the Bitcoin (BTC) market, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is preparing to introduce an exchange-traded Fund (ETF) directly tied to BTC in Europe. This move follows the success of its $58 billion US ETF that tracks the market’s leading cryptocurrency, underscoring BlackRock’s commitment to expanding its footprint in the digital asset space. According to Bloomberg, the new fund is expected to be domiciled in Switzerland. BlackRock could begin marketing the fund as soon as this month, marking a pivotal moment in the firm’s venture into European cryptocurrency products. While ETFs linked to cryptocurrencies have been available on European exchanges for several years, this will be BlackRock’s first crypto-linked ETF outside of North America. As a leader in the issuance of exchange-traded funds, BlackRock manages over $4.4 trillion in assets across various products. The firm has emerged as a prominent supporter of the digital asset class, with CEO Larry Fink recently highlighting Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against currency debasement during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. The launch of several US ETFs tied to Bitcoin last year ignited substantial demand for the asset class, leading to an influx of $116 billion across 12 funds to date, according to Bloomberg data. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (ticker IBIT) has notably set industry records, boasting the highest-performing debut of any Exchange-Traded Fund in history. The cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant rally since the election of US President Donald Trump, with Bitcoin reaching a record high of $109,241 in January. The increasing interest from financial institutions is fueled by Trump’s vocal support for the industry and the promise of forthcoming regulations that could provide clearer guidelines for firms navigating the crypto landscape. New regulations for cryptocurrencies also went into effect in the European Union (EU) in late December 2024, further encouraging institutional participation. Despite the competitive landscape, with over 160 cryptocurrency ETPs currently available in Europe tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens, the overall market size of $17.3 billion remains modest compared to the robust US market. In a recent blog post, BlackRock executives Samara Cohen and Jay Jacobs noted that the combination of gaining Bitcoin exposure through the ETF wrapper has proven to be an appealing option for investors. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has fallen to the $96,770 mark, losing the key $100,000 level after experiencing a 7% price drop over the weekly time frame.

Title: BlackRock To List New Spot Bitcoin ETP in Europe Following Big Success of US Product: Report

Asset management titan BlackRock is reportedly going to list a new spot market Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe, its first digital asset-related venture into the continent. According to a new report from Bloomberg, BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under management – is getting ready to launch a BTC ETP in Europe after its US iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) was a massive success. Anonymous people familiar with the matter say that the ETP will be based out of Switzerland and that BlackRock could start advertising the fund as soon as sometime this month. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and ETPs allow traders to expose themselves to assets – such as precious metals and crypto – without having to actually physically purchase them. BlackRock first launched IBIT in January 2024 after years of having its bid delayed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Previously, Bloomberg found that IBIT had the best debut out of all other US BTC ETFs. At the time, it was found that IBIT held more assets than BlackRock’s Gold ETF despite it being launched nearly two decades earlier in 2005. According to BlackRock’s official website, the net assets of IBIT are $57.4 billion while Bloomberg reports that Europe’s total crypto ETP market is sized at around $17.3 billion. IBIT is trading for $56.09 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day while the top crypto asset by market cap is valued at $98,146.

Or Bitcoin and gold? Investors are weighing where to put their money in times of uncertainty—and no time is more uncertain than now. President Donald Trump’s tariffs—or threats of tariffs—have rocked markets, making “risk-on” assets like crypto less appealing. The price of gold hit a new high Monday, while Bitcoin dropped below $93,000, down about 14% from its all-time high price set on January 20. Bitcoin's correlation to the precious metal is down significantly as investors flock to more traditional safe haven assets, experts told Decrypt. Bitcoin proponents have long claimed that the cryptocurrency’s unique selling point is that it’s a long-term store of value—like gold. And sometimes, they are correlated: The two assets have moved in tandem in the past, when investors have flocked to a strong dollar. But things are up in the air now that President Donald Trump has taken office and issued a flurry of dramatic orders, and Bitcoin’s 90-day correlation with gold has remained close to zero, data provider Kaiko told Decrypt. Case in point: The new commander in chief implemented tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China on Saturday, causing crypto prices to drop sharply. After having a “friendly conversation” with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum two days later, he decided to pause tariffs—leading to a rebound in Bitcoin’s price. Meanwhile, gold soared. Trump later agreed to a similar pause with Canada as the two countries attempt to work out a deal, while tariffs against China ultimately did go into effect. “The trade war could decouple the correlation in the short term as gold is a more established ‘safe haven’ asset, while Bitcoin—although often seen as a safe haven—is currently owned by a large investor base also trading highly speculative risk-asset meme coins and tech stocks,” Amberdata’s director of derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt. The reason for the decoupling is that Bitcoin is still performing less like a safe-haven and more like risk assets, such as tech stocks. The biggest cryptocurrency by market cap over the past seven days alone has swung from $105,893 per coin to as low as $92,876, CoinGecko shows. “While Bitcoin has indisputably drawn investors as a similarly alternative store of value, its higher volatility makes it less reliable in times of economic uncertainty compared to gold,” Michael Petch, co-founder and president of gold investment platform Argo, told Decrypt. Bitcoin as an asset is still finding its feet, say some (including Wall Street titan BlackRock), and even though its long-term gains by far outmatch gold, for now the 5,000-year old physical asset is still the go-to safe haven during times of chaos. “Investors don’t like uncertainty and Donald Trump brings a lot of uncertainty,” RIA Advisors portfolio manager Michael Lebowitz told Decrypt.

The shares of Kyndryl (KD) are advancing 6% after Scotiabank increased its price target on the tech name to $45 from $35. The cloud services company was spun off from IBM (IBM) in 2021. Why Scotiabank Is Bullish on KD The bank raised its price target on KD after it unveiled higher-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings per share and in-line fiscal Q3 sales on Monday. Scotiabank kept an Outperform rating on KD. A data analyst in a lab monitoring a cloud-based software system to detect cardiac disease. Scotiabank believes that Kyndryl's embrace of automation, artificial intelligence, and analytics has helped the firm increase its profit margins and create value for investors. The bank noted that KD's consulting business, driven by the rapid proliferation of AI and cloud security systems, is expanding by double-digit percentage levels. The latter unit's growth, in turn, is creating new opportunities for its Managed Services unit, according to Scotiabank. The bank believes that the company is well-managed, while its services are necessary for its customers, leaving it largely insulated from negative macroeconomic catalysts. More Information About KD Analysts on average expect KD's earnings per share to climb to $1.23 this year from a per-share loss of 11 cents in 2024. In the last month, the shares have gained 13%, while they have soared 77% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of KD, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The largest asset manager in the world is buying the Ethereum dip to custody funds for its ETH-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to BlackRock’s data, the firm picked up 100,535 ETH – worth about $276.2 million at time of writing – for its iShares ETHA product. BlackRock holds a total of 1,352,934 ETH worth roughly $3.71 billion, and the financial giant’s total assets under management were reported to be around $11.5 trillion in October of last year. And according to on-chain data, the President of the United States’ crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is also accumulating Ethereum, with blockchain “de-anonymizing” platform Arkham reporting that WLFI also purchased over $307 million worth of ETH and Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) and sent it to Coinbase Prime for management purposes. In a recent strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe told his 768,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could hit massive new all-time highs if the current bull market extends beyond what many are predicting. The analyst gave a price target of $20,000 for ETH. “I think that there’s a significant chance that this cycle will be longer and go higher than everybody expects. We’ve had the longest bear market on altcoins. Why not have the longest, final bull market on them? Bitcoin to $500,000 and Ethereum to $20,000.

Title: BlackRock to launch new Bitcoin ETP for European market

The fund would be based on Switzerland, and is unlikely to be an IBIT wrapper. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is preparing to introduce an exchange-traded product (ETP) linked to Bitcoin (BTC) in Europe, Bloomberg News reported on Feb. 5. According to sources familiar with the matter, the fund is expected to be domiciled in Switzerland, and BlackRock could begin marketing the product as early as this month. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said BlackRock could potentially launch the new ETP in a similar way it did in Canada. The Canadian ETP is a wrapper for IBIT, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) available in the US. However, Seyffart noted that such a move would have a low chance of success in Europe. Seyffart highlighted that BlackRock Bitcoin ETPs in the US and Canada have fees of 25 basis points and 32 basis points (bps), respectively. Notably, European products already offer exposure to BTC through funds carrying a 25 bps fee. Eric Balchunas also showed interest in seeing the fees charged by BlackRock in Europe. He explained that the US is commonly the best in the rest of the world in terms of cost and liquidity. Balchunas added: “Either way shows commitment from world’s biggest asset manager who has big presence overseas.” The European market for crypto ETPs includes more than 160 products that track Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other digital assets. The market’s cumulative value is $17.3 billion. Balchunas highlighted that the European crypto ETF landscape is “barely on [the] leaderboard,” as the US spot Bitcoin ETFs represent 91% of the global share. He assessed that BlackRock had a chance to succeed by bringing the “US Terrordome” to Europe. Yet, Balchunas noted that European investors, unlike US and Asian investors, have less appetite for riskier investment products. According to Farside Investors data, IBIT recorded $40.7 billion in net inflows as of Feb. 4. Its inflows are over three times larger than Fidelity’s FBTC, the second-largest spot Bitcoin ETF.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Iain Withers LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock is gearing up to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe within weeks, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid growing demand for exposure to cryptocurrencies from both money managers and consumers. The product will likely be domiciled in Switzerland, the source added. The Wall Street giant has incorporated a Zurich-based company focused on digital assets - iShares Digital Assets AG - in recent months, according to a regulatory filing seen by Reuters.

Title: Blackrock Plans to Launch a Bitcoin ETP in Europe: Bloomberg

The world's largest asset management firm with more than $10 trillion in AUM, Blackrock (BLK) plans on listing a bitcoin exchange traded product (ETP) in Europe, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. The fund would be based in Switzerland and BlackRock could start marketing it as soon as this month, according to the report. This would be the giant asset manager's first crypto-linked ETP outside of America. Blackrock's U.S.-based iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has been a wild success, accumulating nearly $60 billion in assets in just more than one year since opening for business. BlackRock's move would be the latest in a string of investment firms looking to dive further into providing crypto-backed securities in Europe. Kraken recently secured a license that will enable it to offer derivatives, joining others like Bitstamp and FTX EU. The company's entry into the European crypto ETP ecosystem could further fuel the competitive response that’s been seen among various providers, which include fee waivers on several products, some expense fees for ETP's have been as high as 2.5%. In the U.S., a similar competitive response came after these funds were launched in Jan. 2024. A lot of question marks still occur around this product, including the fee structure, which would have big implications for the performance of the ETP. “Don't know the fee yet, that will be a big variable," said Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. "U.S. ETFs blow away the rest of the world in cost and liquidity but either way shows commitment from the world's biggest asset manager who has a big presence overseas." U.S.-based bitcoin ETFs currently have 91% of the world market, said Balchunas. Blackrock did not comment before press time. Camomile Shumba is a CoinDesk regulatory reporter based in the UK.

Title: BlackRock plans to launch Bitcoin ETP in Europe as soon as this month after US success

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article BlackRock is poised to expand its crypto product line with the launch of a Bitcoin ETP in Europe, capitalizing on the runaway success of its US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a Wednesday report from Bloomberg, citing sources with knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the plans. Projected to be based in Switzerland, the planned fund would be BlackRock’s first crypto ETP in the European market. The world’s leading asset manager, which previously focused on North America, launched the IBIT fund and subsequently introduced its iShares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Canada. The new ETP may debut as soon as this month, sources said. BlackRock’s IBIT has become one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs since its launch last January, accumulating approximately $58 billion worth of Bitcoin as of February 4. The fund ranks as the 31st largest ETF globally across all categories, including traditional finance products, according to VettaFi. IBIT has led the spot Bitcoin ETF market with a five-day winning streak, attracting nearly $934 million in net inflows since January 30. Yesterday’s inflows alone totaled approximately $249 million, driving most of the spot Bitcoin ETF market’s gains, according to data from Farside Investors. The European crypto ETP market currently features more than 160 products tracking various digital assets, though its size remains smaller than the US market. The expansion comes as Bitcoin has reached new highs this year, amid increased regulatory clarity following the EU’s implementation of new crypto rules. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart initially speculated that BlackRock might consider replicating its Canadian Bitcoin ETF structure in Europe using a “wrapper” approach, where the ETF holds shares of its US-listed IBIT. However, he swiftly confirmed that this strategy is unlikely to be allowed under EU regulations. Sources told him that EU regulators are poised to reject such a workaround, likely requiring BlackRock to launch a standalone European Bitcoin ETF. This necessitates a different approach and puts the spotlight squarely on fees. “I have been informed that this is unlikely to be allowed in EU. So will be interesting to see what they charge assuming they launch a standalone product. In the US the total cost is 25 bps. Canada is 32 bps,” he wrote on X. “There’s already products at 25 bps and lower in Europe including Valour who has a zero expense ratio product.” Beyond regulatory hurdles and pricing pressures, BlackRock faces a more fundamental challenge: market size and investor appetite, Eric Balchunas, Seyffart’s fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst, shared in a comment. The US spot Bitcoin ETF market, despite being just a year old, has exploded in popularity, capturing a staggering 91% of global market share. Europe, by contrast, lags considerably. While European investors are sophisticated, they have historically shown less enthusiasm for the high-octane investment products that have resonated with US investors.

Title: Ondo launches blockchain platform to tokenize US stocks for global investors

Ondo GM will provide exposure to Apple, Tesla, SPDR, and more with stablecoin transactions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ondo Finance has introduced Ondo Global Markets (Ondo GM), a platform designed to bring real-world assets (RWAs) such as stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto the blockchain. According to a Feb. 4 statement, this move provides global access to US securities by enabling investors outside the US to gain exposure through tokenized representations of these assets. It stated: “With Ondo GM, anyone outside the US in eligible geographies can get exposure to thousands of US securities—AAPL, TSLA, SPY, QQQ, etc.—with minimal fees using stablecoins, removing traditional cost and geographic barriers.” The company said that the token issued through Ondo GM maintains a 1:1 backing with its underlying security, ensuring legitimacy and transparency. It noted that these tokens function similarly to stablecoins, facilitating seamless transfers across blockchain networks beyond US borders. Ondo furthered that investors benefit from instant minting and redemption, enhanced liquidity, and built-in access to on-chain financial services, including lending, trading, and yield-generation opportunities. Ondo added: “Ondo GM will propel financial markets into the open economy, returning power to stakeholders to make their own decisions and compete on a level playing field, while addressing challenges like high fees, limited availability, and transfer frictions.” To support broader adoption, Ondo GM provides comprehensive APIs that enable brokers, asset issuers, and fintech platforms to integrate tokenized assets into their systems. Additionally, a legal framework ensures investor protection, safeguarding assets with a structured approach that minimizes risk. Ondo’s move comes as the RWA sector has experienced remarkable growth, reaching an all-time high of $16.88 billion in on-chain value. Data from RWA.xyz reveals a 94% increase over the past year, with nearly $4 billion added in the last three months alone. There are now 83,049 entities holding RWAs, collectively managing assets issued by 112 providers. Private credit leads the market with $11.6 billion in tokenized value, followed by US Treasury debt ($3.5 billion) and commodities ($1.1 billion). Institutional funds represent a smaller portion, valued at around $410 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain for RWAs, hosting 67 asset tokens, while zkSync (28) and Arbitrum (20) follow closely. The surge in RWA adoption aligns with growing interest from traditional financial institutions. Traditional financial institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have deepened their involvement in tokenized finance, signaling a shift toward blockchain-powered investment solutions.

Title: U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge 175% Year-Over-Year
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/05/u-s-spot-bitcoin-etf-inflows-surge-175-year-over-year

U.S.-listed spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a 175% year-over-year increase in almost the first three weeks of trading. In 2025, from Jan. 13 to Feb. 5, net inflows equaled $4.4 billion, while the 2024 net inflows for the first three weeks equaled $1.6 billion. The spot bitcoin ETFs were one of the most successful ETF launches of all time, and have accumulated over $40.6 billion in total net inflows. In the same time, BlackRock iShares Trust (IBIT) has seen a total of $40.7 billion in net inflows. While the total net inflow for all 11 spot BTC ETFs is $40.6 billion, due to Grayscale GBTC witnessing outflows of $21.9 billion. To determine whether these inflows reflect a directional long position or are part of a basis trade—where an investor goes long on the underlying asset in the spot market while simultaneously selling futures contracts when they trade at a premium to spot. Currently, investors can capture a premium of approximately 10%, which will eventually diminish as the spot price converges with the futures contract's expiry. According to Glassnode data, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the primary venue for such trades, has seen a year-to-date decline in open interest from 180,099 BTC to 168,549 BTC, suggesting that these inflows are not primarily driven by basis trading.
