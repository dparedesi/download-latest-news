Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery The proposed inclusion of Chinese shipping giant Cosco in Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison's contentious global ports sale is a potential win for Beijing in a strategic sector, but the deal is far from final and could face resistance from Washington, sources and analysts say. Since the deal was announced on March 4 to sell 43 of CK Hutchison's ports in 23 countries, including two along the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by U.S. firm BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte's family-run shipping company MSC, it has sparked a firestorm of criticism from China. While the U.S. government might oppose the inclusion of state-run Cosco in the consortium over perceived geopolitical risks posed by Chinese influence, bringing in the shipping giant could provide a more level playing field rather than one company being dominant, said a person with knowledge of the deal. The complex deal would require approval from around 50 jurisdictions involved, and it would take at least two years for the process to be completed, sources and analysts said.

Groq raised $640 million at a $2.8 billion valuation in August 2024, making this double the valuation in about a year. Groq previously raised about $1 billion. The new round is led by Austin-based firm Disruptive, Bloomberg reports. The November round was led by BlackRock, with participation from Neuberger Berman, Type One Ventures, Cisco, KDDI, and Samsung Catalyst Fund. Groq was founded by Jonathan Ross, who previously worked at Google developing its Tensor Processing Unit chip. The startup emerged from stealth in 2016. This new raise comes after Groq announced in May an exclusive partnership with Bell Canada to power the telco’s large AI infrastructure project. In April, Groq partnered with Meta to offer AI infrastructure to speed Llama 4 inference.

If the proposal is approved, the world’s largest asset manager would be able to participate in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus model using its ETFs’ funds, while also passing along those rewards to its shareholders, according to a filing published by the SEC. The filing notes that the SEC could make a determination within 45 days of the document’s posting to the Federal Registrar, however, that window can be extended. And the regulator has already acknowledged similar filings from other asset managers in recent months. In May, for example, the SEC gave notice that it was extending its decision deadline for a rule change submitted by NYSE Arca to permit staking for Bitwise’s spot Ethereum ETF. The regulator acknowledged the proposal in the Federal Registrar in early April. Later that month, the SEC delayed its decision on Grayscale’s efforts to support staking for its flagship Ethereum ETF fund. The proposal, which was also submitted by NYSE Arca, was acknowledged by the regulator in February. Under the proposal for the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the asset manager could tap staking providers, and the resulting rewards would be treated as income for the trust. It would prevent the funds from being pooled with Ethereum belonging to other entities as well. Inflows to spot Ethereum ETFs have outpaced those to its Bitcoin counterparts as the asset has climbed recently to a nearly eight-month high. However, the lack of rewards from staking has been viewed as a drawback for the products since their debut a year ago. In April, the SEC approved of a rule change allowing Nasdaq to list options for BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF and three other funds. This year, it has also said that it does not believe staking is subject to securities laws. Spot Ethereum ETFs have generated $9.4 billion in net inflows since their debut, with BlackRock’s ETF contributing $9.5 billion, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. Inflows from seven other products have been outweighed by $4.3 billion in outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum ETF (ETHE). That fund differs from the others because it was a conversion from a trust and carries the highest expense ratio. Ethereum was recently changing hands around $3,800 on Tuesday, a 0.4% decrease over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Over the past month, it’s swelled 54% alongside other altcoins, including XRP and Solana.

Title: NYC gunman Shane Tamura’s former football coach, teammate recall killer as ‘gifted’ athlete who became ‘completely different’ person
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/29/us-news/nyc-gunman-shane-tamuras-former-football-coach-teammate-recall-killer-as-gifted-athlete-who-became-completely-different-person/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T20:37:44Z
Full Content:
Park Avenue ​mass shooter Shane Tamura was “completely different” a decade ago as a star high-school athlete​ — before he ​began express​ing suicidal thoughts ​in recent years and gambling to excess while working nights as a security guard at a Las Vegas casino. ​The Midtown killer’s descent into homicidal madness stunned those who knew him growing up. “Nine years ago, he was a completely different Shane,” a 28-year-old former teammate told The Post on Tuesday — the day after Tamura shot up a Manhattan skyscraper in a failed attempt to target NFL headquarters, which he blamed for alleged brain injuries despite never playing in the league. “Compared to what’s on the news, I don’t think any one of us, none of my teammates, sensed anything like this from Shane,” said the man, who asked not to be publicized. “He was very devoted to football, he was a very good player, but off the field he was very like, nice, positive. He never really had conflict with anyone,” the man said. Tamura was a standout running back at Granada Hills Charter and Golden Valley high schools in Los Angeles County, garnering numerous accolades including being named player of the game five times during his junior year in 2015. “He was very quiet. He led by his actions more than his word. He was athletically gifted. One of the best running backs that I coached,” said Walter Roby, 60, who coached Tamura during his senior year at Granada Hills, to The Post. “He was coachable, meaning when you can ask him to do something he would do it. He was quiet, humble. He knew his athletic ability but he wasn’t boastful about that.” Roby said he was “heartbroken” at the news his former player had perpetrated the heinous mass shooting. “It’s just shocking. It took me a while to come to grips with it. that was tough,” the coach said. Granada Hills Charter issued a statement Tuesday saying Tamura withdrew from the school after attending the 2015 fall semester and has had no connection with the academy since. “We are horrified by the violence in New York. It is heartbreaking, and we extend our deepest sympathies to the victims, their families, and affected communities,” the school wrote​. Tamura took his own life after his shooting spree, in which he killed three office workers and an NYPD officer as he stormed 345 Park Ave. in Midtown with an AR-style rifle Monday evening, apparently targeting the NFL, Mayor Eric Adams said. Police found a rambling three-page note stashed in Tamura’s wallet in which he blamed football for his alleged struggle with CTE — the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy — and begged for his brain to be studied after his death. The note also included an apology to someone named Rick, who sources identified as the owner of the crucial part of the gun that Tamura used. Rick was Tamura’s supervisor at the Horseshoe Las Vegas Casino, sources said. Detectives have located the gun’s owner and are currently questioning him, as well as the seller of the weapon’s lower receiver, which an NYPD spokesman described as “what makes the rifle fire.” Investigators are still working to determine Tamura’s exact motive, but sources said he is believed to have suffered at least two mental health incidents in 2022 and 2024. He received his gun permit in 2022, and a short time later notified police he was having suicidal ideations — which are not grounds for having a permit revoked, a source told The Post. In 2024, Tamura had a second mental health contact. Both mental-health struggled ended up with him being held for 72 hours of observation, sources said. He also had two arrests on his record, including a 2012 trespassing charge in California and a charge in Nevada in 2023 for throwing a substance at a vehicle with intent to cause great bodily harm. In 2021, Tamura had a pair of high-value cash transactions at Nevada casinos, sources said, including spending $16,615 at the Coast Hotel and Casino and months later winning $12,860 at a casino affiliated with Hotspur Resorts Nevada Inc. Sources told The Post police found the prescription medication Sumatriptan, used for relieving migraine symptoms, in Tamura’s BMW, which he had double-parked outside 345 Park Ave. before waltzing into the building with his assault rifle. The gunman’s former high school teammate told The Post he never saw any indication Tamura was struggling with mental illness. He conceded, however, that people sometimes change over time. “You might know someone 9, 10, 12 years ago in general life and time can change a lot of things. I don’t know what happened. It could have been some sort of mental illness, some kind of stress, something could have happened, I really have no idea.” As for whether Tamura ever got banged up enough on the field to wind up with a CTE diagnosis — as has afflicted a number of high-profile NFL players — Roby said he couldn’t recall anything but an ankle injury that sidelined him for a single game. Asked whether he was good enough to have a chance to get drafted into the NFL one day, Roby said it was tough to say. “Did he have the ability to play at the college level? Definitely had that athletic ability. As far as the NFL, I don’t know. Being in the NFL, you’re talking about the 1% of the 1%. I don’t know if he had that type of skill set.” Additional reporting by Tina Moore Advertisement

The new feature will allow clients to buy and sell stocks around the clock—24 hours, seven days a week—in the form of ECR-20 tokens. eToro said that 24/5 trading of 100 of the most popular U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs will come first. "We are part of the largest transfer of wealth in human history, from older generations to younger generations—with the rise of retail investors," eToro CEO Yoni Assia said in a webinar announcing the new product. "[Younger, retail investors] are finding out about capital markets," he said, adding that a big part of the transfer of wealth will be via new technologies and a paradigm shift in financial systems. The announcement comes as eToro and other financial services firms have expanded their crypto-related services and amid growing interest in tokenization. The Israel-based firm has long been involved in tokenizing assets for its customers, introducing tokenized gold and silver after buying Danish token startup Firmo in 2019. In March, BlackRock, the world’s biggest fund manager, announced its first tokenized fund. Its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund runs on Ethereum, the blockchain behind the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, ETH. BlackRock CEO and one-time crypto skeptic Larry Fink has come around to the idea. Real-world assets have notched a combined $12.19 billion in total-value locked on decentralized platforms as digitizing traditional financial instruments becomes increasingly popular in Web3. Analysts are forecasting further gains in the market as investors flock to tokenized RWA products. Global investment firm VanEck has predicted RWAs will surpass $50 billion in market capitalization by the end of 2025. Ethereum is the dominant platform for tokenization. eToro was among the earliest firms to explore Bitcoin, acquiring its first BTC when the largest cryptocurrency by market value was selling for $5 (it subsequently sold these early holdings), and allowed trading of the asset in 2013. It added the same service for a range of other tokens. eToro was down more than 4% in Tuesday trading and is off nearly 10% year-to-date, according to Yahoo Finance. Ethereum was trading at $3,775, down the better part of a percentage point over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

Title: JPMorgan Chase Says ‘Significant Leap Forward’ Underway for Tokenized Money Market Funds Amid Goldman and BNY Partnership: Report

Analysts at the financial giant JPMorgan Chase think Goldman Sachs’ new partnership with BNY is a “significant leap forward” for tokenized money market funds, according to a new Bloomberg report. Goldman and BNY recently announced a joint venture to launch tokenized money market fund services using a blockchain developed by Goldman. BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management all plan to participate in the launch of the new service. Teresa Ho, a managing director at JPMorgan, tells Bloomberg the partnership could expand the use cases for money market funds. “The true takeaway from this is beyond the typical way we see money funds being used as a cash management asset class — they can now use it as collateral. Instead of posting cash, or posting Treasuries, you can post money-market shares and not lose interest along the way. It speaks to the versatility of money funds.” Ho also notes that numerous other financial firms see the potential benefit of tokenization amid blossoming regulatory clarity. “This is true across banks, asset managers, and payment processors. We wouldn’t be surprised to continue to see more developments with respect to stablecoins being more integrated with the traditional financial system, as well as more tokenization of real-world assets.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

In a letter to Duke President Vincent Price, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Adam Silver and School of Medicine Dean Mary Klotman, Secretaries Robert F.

"The United States invests in medical care and research because of the sacredness of human life and value of human health," the letter read. "There is arguably no other area of our educational system where the rejection of merit is more dangerous than in medicine, where the competence of doctors means the difference between life and death for patients, and where scientific discovery is the difference between life-saving cures and the ravages of disease."…READ MORE.

Title: Authorities say shooter in New York City blamed NFL for brain injuries
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/29/authorities-say-shooter-in-new-york-city-blamed-nfl-for-brain-injuries
Time Published: 2025-07-29T19:03:06Z

The US football league has previously faced legal challenges over its failure to address players’ concussions. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has said that a gunman who killed five people, including himself, sought out the headquarters of the National Football League (NFL), which he blamed for the brain injuries he suffered from. Adams said on Tuesday that a note carried by the shooter, identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura, suggests his target was the NFL. “The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE [chronic traumatic encephalopathy], a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports,” Adams told CBS News. “He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury.” But Tamura appears to have arrived at the wrong floor of a New York City office tower and instead opened fire in the offices of a real estate firm, on top of shooting people in the ground-floor lobby. The NFL has previously faced litigation relating to concussions suffered by football players. The organisation, which oversees professional US football, has denied any link between conditions like CTE and its sport, but it has nevertheless paid out more than $1bn to settle concussion-related lawsuits. Monday’s shooting has also renewed debate about mass shootings and access to firearms in the US. Tamura reportedly entered the building with an AR-15-style rifle. The NFL’s headquarters are located in a skyscraper that it shares with other firms. Tamara is believed to have started shooting as he entered the lobby of the skyscraper. Then, police believe he took the wrong elevator, arriving at the 33rd floor, which contained the offices of Rudin Management, a real estate firm. There, he opened fire once more and then took his own life. Among those killed in the shooting was a 36-year-old police officer named Didarul Islam, who had come to the US from Bangladesh and had been on the force for three years. Other victims include security guard Aland Etienne, Julia Hyman of Rudin Management, and an executive at the BlackRock investment firm, Wesley LePatner. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell stated in a memo that there would be an “increased security presence” at the organisation’s offices over the coming weeks. Tamura is a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada, with a history of mental health issues. He never played in the NFL, but he did play football in high school. The news outlet Bloomberg reported that Tamura’s note alleges that his football career was cut short by a brain injury. The note also called for his brain to be studied. CTE can only be diagnosed through an autopsy. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: SEC filing starts countdown on BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF staking proposal

The SEC acknowledged a Nasdaq filing from July 16, prompting a 45-day period for response, extendable up to 90 days. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged on July 29 a Nasdaq proposal to amend BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) so the fund may stake the ETH it holds. Nasdaq’s filing would delete a prior representation that neither BlackRock nor the custodian would use any ETH held by the exchange-traded fund (ETF) to validate Ethereum’s proof‑of‑stake chain or earn income. The proposal would add a new “staking” section authorizing the stake some or all ETHA’s Ethereum directly or through one or more trusted staking providers, with any staking rewards payable to the ETF and potentially treated as income. Nasdaq filed on July 16 to add staking to BlackRock’s ETHA, seeking to add a detailed section that permits the staking directly or via trusted providers, treat rewards as income, and operate under the Corp Fin statement while securing tax clarity before launch. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart called the Nasdaq submission “about time,” noting the first final deadline for earlier filings arrives in October, while Nasdaq’s BlackRock filing carries an early‑April, 2026, deadline. Yet, he expects a decision sooner. In the competitive queue, Cboe has sought authority for Fidelity’s FETH, Franklin Templeton’s EZET, Invesco Galaxy’s QETH, and 21Shares’ CETH. At the same time, NYSE Arca is pursuing the same authorization for Bitwise’s ETHW, and Grayscale’s ETHE and its mini trust. The rush for authorization to allow staking in spot ETFs picked up the pace after the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance stated on May 29 that participants in standard protocol staking activities do not need to register those activities as securities transactions. The regulator statement includes self‑staking, delegated staking, custodial staking, and non‑custodial staking. Additionally, service features such as early withdrawals, slashing protection, or asset aggregation do not convert staking into a securities offering under federal law by themselves. Nasdaq argues that permitting ETHA to stake would better align the product with Ether‑holding returns, improve creation and redemption efficiency, and benefit end investors. The filing also describes staking’s role in supporting Ethereum’s validation process and compensating validators via block rewards. After publication in the Federal Register, the Commission has 45 days, extendable up to 90 days, to approve, disapprove, or institute proceedings on the proposal. The SEC has also invited public comments on the matter. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: Slog AM: Debora Juarez Back On Council,  Ann Davison Stabs Denny Blaine In The Back(side), Manhattan Gunman Likely Targeted NFL

I’m back from vacation: It was nice (thanks for asking). I’ve returned to better weather. Today, it’ll be sunny with a balmy high of 81. Temperatures will drop to the high 50s tonight before heating back up tomorrow. Expect a slight chance of rain Thursday into Thursday night. Friday should be a pleasant, partly cloudy day in the low- to mid-70s. Dead Heat: Katie Wilson and Bruce Harrell are statistically tied in the mayor’s race a week before the primary election. It’s a limited sample (651) with a 4.1 percent margin of error, but still, this race is not a cakewalk for Harrell. He’ll have to fight to break the curse of the one-term mayor. His campaign seems to be betting on making Wilson, a quite normal woman, out to be a society-restructuring radical (after all, Stalin also said Seattle pizza was too expensive). Those awkward TikToks might come in handy. Welcome Back? Debora Juarez is back in her old City Council seat for the next 16 months, replacing Cathy Moore after her resignation earlier this month. For recent transplants and the generally forgetful, Juarez used to be council president. Mexican American and a member of the Blackfeet Nation, Juarez was the first Indigenous person in that role. In a press release, Chief Seattle Club, Seattle Indian Health Board, Seattle Indian Services Commission, and United Indians of All Tribes Foundation celebrated her appointment. “Debora Juarez has long embodied the power, resilience, and vision of Indigenous leadership,” the release read. While charmingly foul-mouthed, Juarez is a conservative who fits right into the current brat pack. She’s also known for being somewhat unpredictable. It’s interesting that she applied for the vacancy—she made clear that she was tired of the job when she decided not to run for reelection in 2023—but since throwing her hat into the ring, her appointment has been expected. Juarez received 7 votes. Alexis Mercedes Rinck voted for Nilu Jenks, a former candidate for District 5. Ferg Down: Washington voters think Governor Bob Ferguson sucks. A Monday Cascade PBS/Elway poll found his approval rating at the sixth month mark is the lowest for a Washington Governor since 1993. Of the 403 registered voters surveyed, 32 percent consider Ferguson to be doing a “good” or “excellent” job. That’s eight points lower than Gov. Inslee, 11 points below Christine Gregoire, and 20 points below Gary Locke at the same point in their first terms. Almost the same percentage of people (31 percent) think he’s doing a “poor” job; 22 percent rated his job performance as “fair.” Damn, dude. According to Cascade, people are angry that Ferguson is signing off on new taxes, that he’s cut spending, that he’s too focused on President Donald Trump’s administration, that he’s not focused enough on Trump, that he’s too in line with Democrats, and that he’s too moderate. You can’t please everyone all of the time, but Ferguson’s middling centerism seems to please nobody. Now to HMW for the latest on Denny Blaine. Thanks For Nothing: The City submitted its “abatement plan” for Denny Blaine Park on Monday evening. No one is thrilled about its idea to divide the already small beach into a nude area (closest to the water) and a clothed area (the vast majority of the park). “Zoning” Denny Blaine isn’t a new idea. Last year, the Parks Department proposed a nudity DMZ at the parking lot—much further back than the current abatement plan. When it was submitted for public comment, beach goers roundly rejected it because they felt it made a concession to neighbors they didn’t have to make. (This is where we remind you, dear reader, for the hundredth time, that nudity is legal in Seattle.) The city is also planning to increase the presence of park rangers and signage to the park. Sophie Amity Debs, who co-runs the park stewardship group Friends of Denny Blaine, told The Stranger that by cutting the space down to a tiny sliver of the park, the city is “not setting themselves up for success with having people respect and take these guidelines seriously.” This proposal isn’t the worst case scenario. “We are glad that it doesn't just outright ban nudity, because that was one of our big fears … and we are also glad that the enforcement mechanisms are via park rangers and not by SPD.” Back to me :)! Firefighters Saving a Rainforest: The human-caused Bear Gulch fire (first reported July 6, wonder how that started?) is creeping toward the Staircase area of Olympic National Park. The 1,100 acre fire is only 10 percent contained, the Seattle Times reports. Two hundred people, including firefighters, are assigned to this fire. Big Beautiful Electric Bills? Lawmakers say the cuts to renewable energy in President Donald Trump's Beautiful Bill will raise the price of electricity in Washington. As it turns out, massive public infrastructure projects are not optional or spontaneous. They’re important and planned decades in advance. Cities are growing, transmission lines are aging, and AI data centers are siphoning off our excess power to animate photos of dead grandparents at a time heatwaves are more likely to hit California and Washington simultaneously. We can’t just pause this work, cross our fingers and hope the power stays on. We’ll still have to pay for repairs, new energy projects, and extra power with our money. Seattle City Light CEO Dawn Lindell says people “can expect to see significant rate increases for probably the next 10 to 12 years.” The US Department of Energy did not respond to KUOW’s request for comment. Suspect Arrested For Shooting Lummi Nation Officer: Authorities arrested the 26-year-old suspect and Whatcom county resident for investigation of attempted murder yesterday afternoon. Early Monday morning, the officer responded to a call for a vehicle in a ditch in Lummi Nation west of Bellingham. The driver shot the officer and fled on foot. It’s unclear where and how the suspect was apprehended, but multiple law enforcement agencies were involved in the search. The officer was rushed into surgery. As of Monday afternoon, the officer was alive and receiving medical care. Northgate Shooter: Police say they're still searching for two suspects they say shot a man in the back of the head outside the Northgate Transit Center on Monday morning. The victim, 48, was in critical condition as of Monday afternoon. Over 60,000 Killed in Gaza Since October 7: Gaza’s ministry of health puts the total at 60,034. At least 62 have been killed since dawn, reports Al Jazeera, 19 of them aid seekers. Yesterday, two of the most-known Israeli rights groups (B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights —Israel) called the genocide a genocide for the first time. This morning, the UK announced that it would recognize a Palestinian state if Israel doesn't reach a ceasefire with Hamas by September. Shooter Killed Four in Midtown Manhattan: After much unverified online speculation that gunman Shane Tamura had targeted the investment company Blackstone, police say the three-page note found in his wallet indicates Tamura had likely targeted NFL headquarters. Police say Tamura claimed he suffered from CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, from playing football and accused the NFL of concealing the danger to players. Tamura shot himself in the chest. “Study my brain please,” police say he wrote. “I’m sorry.” CTE is a serious condition that increases the risk of suicide. It can only be diagnosed in an autopsy. One study of 2,000 former NFL players published in JAMA Neurology found 1 in 3 believed they had CTE. FIGHT! Paul Dans, a chief architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, is challenging Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican party’s most eligible bachelor. Dans, who looks like something bad happened to Mark Cuban (the Portrait of Mark Cuban?), is expected to formally announce his campaign in Charleston this Wednesday. Chris LaCivita, advisor to Sen. Graham’s campaign and co-manager of Trump’s presidential bid, ominously told the AP that Dans’ campaign would “end prematurely.” Thanks, Chris. Strange and threatening! Not Even Capitalism Safe From ICE Raids: The New York Times reports that work has slowed to a crawl at one Omaha, Nebraska meatpacking plant. Three weeks after ICE came to Glenn Valley Foods with a battering ram and a warrant for 107 workers, production is down by 70%. Half of the maintenance crew is being deported. About 50 workers are in ICE detention. Owner Gary Rohwer told the Times it was a “wipeout.” We don’t need the lens of capitalism to grasp the injustice of ICE abductions, but the bottom line is often the only thing that reaches Americans. *SCREECH*: Two whistleblowers have accused Emil Bove, former defense attorney for President Donald Trump, current top official at the Justice Department, and nominee for the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, of directing Justice Department staff to ignore federal court orders in the way of Trump’s mass deportation plans. A third says he lied to Senators during his confirmation hearing last month. The Senate is expected to vote on his appointment this week. A Tune for You: Thanks, MJ Lenderman. I love to do dishes to your music. Editor's Note: A previous version of this article said that people had speculated that the shooter in Manhattan had targeted Blackrock in the Midtown building. The building is home to the Blackstone offices. Vivian McCall is a staff writer for The Stranger covering queer culture and politics in Seattle and beyond.

Title: This Week In Bitcoin: 4 Things To Keep An Eye On That Could Impact Price
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/this-week-in-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T16:30:07Z
Full Content:
As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade in a volatile yet increasingly bullish market, a crypto analyst points to key developments that could drive a breakout past $130,000. From macroeconomic shifts to major technical breakouts and unexpected geopolitical tailwinds, the analyst outlines four critical factors to watch this week that could significantly impact BTC’s price action. On July 27, crypto analyst Doctor Profit posted a detailed macro report on X social media, highlighting Bitcoin and certain bullish events unfolding around it. Before addressing the latest US trade developments, the market expert noted that Bitcoin recently pulled off a major technical move that went largely unnoticed by the market. After facing four consecutive months of rejection from November 2024 to February 2025, BTC finally broke through a long-term diagonal resistance tied to its 2021 all-time high. It then retested the level as support and followed through with a strong bullish move. On the macro front, Doctor Pillows suggested that a significant shift in the global trade policy could fuel Bitcoin’s continued upward momentum. He highlighted President Donald Trump’s announcement of a landmark trade agreement between the US and European Union, easing fears of a potential tariff war. The analyst described this deal as one of the most bullish trade agreements since 2016, noting that markets are likely to respond positively to the reduced geopolitical risks. With stocks set to open higher and economic friction easing between two of the world’s largest economies, Bitcoin also stands to benefit from the improved macro environment. Earlier this week, Bitcoin saw a brief drop to $114,500 after wallet activity from Galaxy Digital sparked concerns of a potential selloff. However, according to Doctor Profit, those fears quickly faded as spot ETF inflows continued to outpace Bitcoin’s daily issuance. Institutions like BlackRock are also steadily absorbing supply, reinforcing strong underlying demand. Most importantly, the analyst highlighted that many long-term whale wallets remain inactive, indicating that the broader accumulation trend is still intact. Rather than signaling weakness, Doctor Profit suggests that the recent price dip appeared to have been a temporary shakeout that highlights the strength of the ongoing bull market. In his report, Doctor Profit stated that Bitcoin’s real macro engine is emerging from M2 Money Supply growth. Despite ongoing narratives around quantitative tightening, the analyst highlights that M2 has risen by 2.3% in 2025 so far, including a sharp 0.63% spike between May and June— the largest monthly increase this year. Historically, Bitcoin has closely followed M2 expansion, as seen during the 2020 liquidity surge that fueled an 800% rally. While exact outcomes vary, Doctor Profit suggests that the current pace of growth points to a potential 15-17.5% BTC rally to above $130,000 in the coming weeks, based on the cryptocurrency’s typical 60-90 day lag in reacting to monetary expansion. As his final bullish point, Doctor Profit mentioned the next FOMC meeting on Wednesday. While the official stance remains “hawkish,” with only a 5% chance of a rate cut, the analyst noted that the Federal Reserve (FED) has been quietly expanding liquidity and printing. This growing disconnect between Chair Jerome Powell’s rhetoric and the FED’s actual monetary actions is noteworthy. It suggests that the FED may already be laying the groundwork for the next round of quantitative easing. Given Bitcoin’s historical sensitivity to monetary policy shifts, the cryptocurrency may be well-positioned to rally significantly once the pivot becomes more apparent.

The Minnesota-based Ethereum treasury firm, which began the month holding 198,200 ETH, now controls 438,200 ETH, an 121% increase in four weeks, according to a press release. Based on recent prices, that stockpile was worth $1.4 billion on Tuesday, the second largest among corporate Ethereum treasuries. SharpLink aims to increase shareholder value by boosting the amount of Ethereum it owns per fully diluted share. The company consistently issued common stock as a way to fund purchases in July, in addition to raising cash through a private placement last month. Last week, SharpLink said it purchased 77,200 Ethereum, “maintaining its aggressive acquisition pace.” In July, SharpLink gained $852 million from issuing nearly 45 million common shares, capturing a premium that its stock trades at relative to its crypto holdings, mirroring elements of Strategy’s Bitcoin-buying playbook. SharpLink said that the Ethereum it holds per 1,000 assumed diluted shares issued and outstanding, a metric dubbed “ETH Concentration,” increased to 3.4, as of Sunday, from 2.29 three weeks prior. Leveraging Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus model, the company said that it has generated 722 Ethereum worth $2.8 million since it pivoted away from sports gambling marketing. Nearly all the Ethereum SharpLink owns has been devoted to staking protocols, allowing the company to earn rewards by helping validate Ethereum transactions. Ethereum’s price rose above $3,900 on Monday before retreating, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Although the asset’s price has increased 60% over the past month, momentum has cooled over the past week, with the asset around 21% away from its pandemic-era high of $4,900. SharpLink shares have tumbled 31% over the past week to $18.82 as Ethereum’s price has lost momentum; however, the stock is still up 100% over the past month, according to Yahoo Finance. In May, SharpLink’s stock price soared to $124 before plummeting on profit-taking among investors that participated in the company’s private placement. Ethereum software giant Consensys, known for its MetaMask digital wallet, said on Monday that SharpLink would be among firms stewarding the token for its Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Linea. The group, called the Linea Consortium, will help oversee 75% of its eventual supply. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) That means SharpLink, which is chaired by Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, will help distribute tokens to grow the layer-2 network, alongside other members. SharpLink gaming is the second largest holder of Ethereum to join the Strategic Ethereum Reserve, a group of Ethereum-aligned entities. BitMine Immersion, which has pivoted its focus from Bitcoin mining, owns around 625,000 Ethereum, a sum worth roughly $2.4 billion. In July, SharpLink made other notable acquisitions, besides massive amounts of Ethereum. That included a former digital assets executive at BlackRock, Joseph Chalom, who was appointed co-CEO of SharpLink last week.

Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks says the 'honest work' learned through trade schools could be the key out of poverty for many struggling in today's job market wanting to 'improve their lives.' The crime of post-60s liberalism is that it created permanent Black underclasses all over America, including on the South Side of Chicago where I live. The schools here are poor. Opportunities have been replaced by government handouts. Violence robs far too many families of their loved ones. Yet, there is much untapped potential in these underclasses. I thought about them as I listened to Mike Rowe of "Dirty Jobs" detail the need for hundreds of thousands of tradesmen and women recently at the Pennsylvania Energy & Innovation Summit. He began by saying, "We’ve been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code." I, too, have been told to pursue that as a means of opportunity for my youth. But I always believed in the power of the trades. Rowe pointed out how the advent of AI has decimated many coding jobs but has not come after "the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipefitters, the HVAC, or the electricians." AI cannot do manual labor. MIKE ROWE REVEALS WHICH AMERICAN JOBS WILL REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY THE COMING AI REVOLUTION For the last 20 or so, our nation has emphasized the college degree above everything, including vocational training. In my opinion, this has been disastrous. In my community, there are still those who look down at the prospect of working with their hands. They believe the college degree is their ticket. Maybe it is, but my point here is that work done by our hands should not be looked down upon in our culture. It’s honest work. Rowe said that he heard Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, say in Aspen that "we need 500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." My non-profit has provided training in the electrician field to many individuals, including a Chicago Police officer who eventually left the force to work full time in her new field. He said the over 80,000 collision repair technicians would be needed. Over 140,000 tradespeople are needed to help companies build and deliver nuclear-powered submarines to the Navy. And for the energy field, 300,000 to 500,000 people will be needed. AI can’t do any of this work. But I know people from the South Side and similar neighborhoods across America who can. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION We need to train these people and put them to work. They may be living in poverty and they may not have received the best education. But many of them are hungry to improve their lives. That is why our nation must reverse the decline of post-60s liberalism by giving these people direct pathways to opportunity. If one should fail or act detrimentally, then dismiss that person and let him or her be an example to others of what happens when one doesn’t fully commit.

Title: China Stake in CK Hutchison Port Sale Could Ease Beijing Pressure but US Geopolitical Risks Remain

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun HONG KONG/NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) – The proposed inclusion of Chinese shipping giant COSCO in Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison’s contentious global ports sale is a potential win for Beijing in a strategic sector, but the deal is far from final and could face resistance from Washington, sources and analysts say. Since the deal was announced on March 4 to sell 43 of CK Hutchison’s ports in 23 countries, including two along the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by U.S. firm BlackRock, BLK.N and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run shipping company MSC, it has sparked a firestorm of criticism from China. While the U.S. government might oppose the inclusion of state-run COSCO over perceived geopolitical risks posed by Chinese influence, bringing in the shipping giant could provide a more level playing field rather than one company being dominant, said a person with knowledge of the deal. The complex deal would require approval from around 50 jurisdictions involved, and it would take at least two years for the process to be completed, sources and analysts said. There was no immediate response from the White House, COSCO and CK Hutchison to Reuters’ requests for comment. At a time of festering global trade tensions between China and the U.S., the deal showcases the growing rivalry between both sides for maritime influence in the strategic commercial shipping sector that has been dominated by China in recent decades. U.S. President Donald Trump had earlier called for the removal of Chinese ownership in the Panama Canal – now used for more than 40% of U.S. container traffic valued at $270 billion annually. Following months of pressure from Beijing, including Chinese state media lambasting the move as a betrayal, and various Chinese government departments saying they would conduct a legal review, CK Hutchison announced on July 28 that a Chinese investor was being courted. It also said changes to the composition of the consortium and structure of the transaction would be necessary to secure regulatory approval. Two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the investor was COSCO 1199.HK – a shipping and ports conglomerate that is now one of the world’s dominant, vertically integrated marine transportation firms. While any stake by COSCO is not yet clear, a triparty agreement with BlackRock and MSC would alleviate China’s national security concerns and have its blessing, the sources said. “The potential acquisition of Hutchison Ports is driven by the strategic need to secure key port resources amid global competition and U.S.-China tensions,” JPMorgan wrote in a research report. The report also noted that while the inclusion of COSCO would “relieve some concerns by the Chinese government, thus boosting the likelihood of a green-light scenario”, not all ports in the original agreement might be included. COSCO is requesting a bigger stake while the other parties in the consortium are keen to keep it a minority, the sources said. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters on Monday in response to a question on the deal that Beijing “will conduct lawful regulation, firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and uphold justice and fairness in the market.” ‘STRIP CHINESE CONTROL’ A deal involving COSCO would be a “loud reaffirmation of China’s geopolitical influence across the global maritime trade and transport sector, and of its effective leverage in trade negotiations with the U.S.,” Isaac Kardon, Senior Fellow for China Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Reuters. “Beijing’s disapproval clearly forced Hutchison to back off and change tack — and not merely in the optics of the transaction, but in its basic structure and national ownership.” Should the deal proceed, it would be a crucial off-ramp for CK Hutchison, with the Americans wary of COSCO’s growing maritime heft that could undermine U.S. national security. There could also be further blowback amid ongoing and complex bilateral trade talks. Some analysts say the Panama ports, in particular, will be a focus for the Trump administration, and could be taken out of the transaction to meet U.S. strategic interests. “The inclusion of this behemoth Chinese central state-owned enterprise as an owner seems like it should be a non-starter for the Trump administration seeking to strip Chinese control and restore some kind of American suzerainty over the Canal Zone,” added Kardon. The CK Hutchison assets up for sale span the globe, including ports in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Barcelona in Spain, Felixstowe in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Poland and the Bahamas – enlarging Beijing’s global shipping networks and options at a time of great trade and tariff uncertainties. “At the moment they (Beijing) are in a place generally where they want to assert themselves and say, hey, don’t mess with us,” said Andrew Cainey, a senior associate fellow with the defence and security thinktank RUSI (Royal United Services Institute) in London. “If the U.S. were to come back and object to it, China could try to block the deal or demand more (from CK Hutchison).” (Reporting by James Pomfret, Clare Jim and Anne Marie Roantree in Hong Kong, Davide Barbuscia in New York, Ryan Woo in Beijing; Editing by Saad Sayeed) Sign up for gCaptain’s newsletter and never miss an update Essential maritime and offshore news, insights, and updates delivered daily straight to your inbox Dive into a sea of curated content with our weekly ‘Dispatch’ email.

Title: China may gain greater control of Panama Canal after BlackRock deal misses deadline

Fox News contributor Michael Pillsbury joins 'Fox & Friends First' to weigh in on President Donald Trump's trade negotiations with China as they continue to threaten their invasion of Taiwan. China may soon gain greater influence over the Panama Canal following the collapse of a proposed deal between U.S.-based BlackRock and Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison, which had initially sparked tensions with Beijing. The original agreement would have transferred control of dozens of international ports — including two in Panama — to a consortium involving BlackRock. The deal was reportedly welcomed by former President Donald Trump, who voiced support for reducing Chinese influence over the canal and even floated the idea of the U.S. "taking back" the strategic waterway. However, Beijing pushed back. China advocated for state-owned shipping giant Cosco to be included in the transaction, signaling its desire for a direct stake, not just an indirect one through the Hong Kong-based Hutchison, in the canal’s operations. Amid mounting pressure from China and the threat of an anti-monopoly investigation, CK Hutchison announced Monday that the exclusive negotiation window with BlackRock had expired. However, the company also signaled its openness to reconfiguring the deal. CHINA, HONG KONG THREATEN TO THWART SALE OF PANAMA CANAL PORTS TO AMERICA'S BLACKROCK It said it would "remain open to discussions with a view to inviting a major strategic investor from the [People’s Republic of China] to join as a significant member of the consortium." According to the company, changes in deal structure and participant makeup are necessary to gain approval from "all relevant authorities." An aerial view shows cargo vessels docked at Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, on the Panama Canal in Panama City on Feb. 1, 2025. (REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo) The original $23 billion deal involved transferring ownership of 43 ports across 23 countries — including the two critical Panamanian ports located at either end of the canal in Balboa and Cristobal. CK Hutchison has operated both since 1997. The firm is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s wealthiest man, Li Ka-shing. China’s growing footprint in Latin American infrastructure has long raised bipartisan alarms in Washington. However, Trump stands out as the first modern U.S. president to suggest reclaiming the Panama Canal, which the U.S. completed in 1914 and handed over to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 during the Carter administration. CHINA’S BILLION-DOLLAR FOOTPRINT NEAR FLORIDA COAST POSES US NATIONAL SECURITY RISK, EXPERT WARNS "China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn’t give it to China — we gave it to Panama — and we’re taking it back," Trump recently declared. One analyst believes China may ultimately be excluded from the Panama port holdings while gaining control of most other assets in the larger deal. "China will insist this be the quid pro quo: that the other global ports have Cosco participation. And obviously, Cosco is already a major global port holder," said Dane Chamorro, head of Global Risk Analysis at consulting firm Control Risks, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix, File) The family of Hong Kong billionaire tycoon Li Ka-shing owns CK Hutchison. (REUTERS/Bobby Yip) "From a U.S. perspective, they might say, ‘Okay, great—we got Hutchison, or China (since they tend to refer to them interchangeably), out of the two Panama ports.’ But in the long run, that may result in even more ports globally ending up in the hands of a Chinese state-owned entity." If that happens, Cosco — through this broader consolidation — would become "far and away the dominant port owner and operator globally," Chamorro said. "That aligns with the fact that China is the world’s largest trading economy, the largest manufacturing economy, and the largest shipbuilder." Chamorro also noted that U.S. companies do not operate on the same global scale in the port industry as Chinese, Hong Kong or Singaporean firms. The failed Hutchison-BlackRock deal underscores the precarious position of Hong Kong businesses under growing pressure from Beijing to prioritize national loyalty — even when it threatens ties with Western partners.

Title: Man in 70s sent forward for trial accused of historical sex offences

Time Published: 2025-07-29T11:25:34Z
Full Content:
A man in his 70s accused of historical sex abuse offences has been served with a book of evidence and sent forward for trial to the Central Criminal Court. The man, who cannot be named due to the nature of the charges, faces 79 allegations relating to the sexual abuse of four girls in Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s. Judge Michele Finan at Dublin District Court granted a return for trial order at the request of State solicitor Rory Staines. He told the court that the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) consented to being sent forward on indictment on the 79 charges in the book of evidence served by Garda Sergeant Amy Kelly. They include 78 counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted rape. The offences allegedly occurred at various locations in Co Dublin, including Dún Laoghaire, Killiney, and Blackrock, between 1971 and 1981. At the time, the girls were minors aged between eight and 15. Judge Finan notified the man that he must inform the prosecution within 14 days if he intends to use an alibi in his trial. She also ordered investigating gardaí to provide copies of interview videos to the defence and told the accused that his lawyer would explain it to him later. The man, who has not yet entered a plea, was remanded in continuing custody pending trial with no bail application made. Legal aid has been granted, with the defence stating that he is not working and has no assets. The judge noted that there was no Garda objection, and she agreed to a request by his solicitor, Tracy Horan, that it would include senior and junior counsel representation. The date for his next hearing before the Central Criminal Court has yet to be set but will be held the next legal term, commencing in October. Dressed in a grey tracksuit and black runners, the man sat silently in a wheelchair and spoke only to consult his solicitor, who asked that he get dental attention in custody because he still had no dentures and “is not able to eat solid foods”. He was arrested at Terminal 2, Dublin Airport on the morning of July 22nd. Gardaí charged him at the instruction of the DPP. He faces 41 counts of indecent assault and one for attempted rape of one of the complainants, 34 counts of indecent assault of another female, two counts of indecent assault of another complainant, and one charge of indecent assault of the fourth. The offences are contrary to Common Law. At his first hearing, a few hours after his arrest, the defence solicitor had informed the judge that her client required medical assistance in custody because he had no dentures or hearing aid. The judge had noted this information and agreed to add that he should urgently get dentures and a hearing aid in custody. When the proceedings resumed on Tuesday, she heard that the man still had no dentures and recommended that he get the appropriate treatment.

Title: 21 states warn JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, BlackRock’s Larry Fink to scrap ‘woke’ environmental goals

Nearly two dozen states on Tuesday warned CEOs of the nation’s largest financial firms – including BlackRock’s Larry Fink and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon – to scrap “woke investing” programs focused on environmental goals if they want to continue doing business in their states. Letters signed by 26 state financial officers hit the desks of top bosses at BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Investments, State Street and Vanguard. State officials ordered these firms to take five concrete actions to demonstrate their “commitment to a fiduciary model grounded in financial integrity, not political advocacy.” Among these steps is a commitment to abstain from “international political agendas” like net-zero climate mandates or the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Directive, which requires companies to regularly publish reports on the environmental and social risks they face. In the letters, leaders of red states slammed the erosion of “traditional fiduciary duty” in favor of ESG investing, or the environmental, social and governance goals of financial firms. “While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” officials said in a copy of the letter obtained by The Post. “Our responsibility is to ensure public assets are managed in the best financial interest of beneficiaries and taxpayers. We expect detailed evidence that your firm’s investment practices, proxy voting and corporate engagement behavior…align with traditional fiduciary standards.” Officials from 21 states – including Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Utah – demanded that CEOs respond to the letter’s demands by September 1. Some states have more than one official represented on the letters. The letters come after Texas last month removed BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, from its blacklist. For nearly three years, BlackRock was banned from doing business with Texas state pension and investment funds, which hold an estimated $50 billion in assets, over its climate policies. BlackRock earlier this year rolled back some of its environmental goals, exiting the Climate Action 100+ investor group and withdrawing from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The company, however, is still engaging in some practices that seek to restrict fossil fuel output, according to a report from the American Energy Institute and Consumers’ Research, a conservative nonprofit. While Texas may have let up the pressure on BlackRock, these 21 states are doubling down on calls for financial firms to eradicate ESG goals. “Requiring America’s financial giants to prove their independence from woke ideology with concrete steps before doing business with a state’s dollars is fully necessary and just makes sense,” OJ Oleka, CEO of State Financial Officers Foundation, said in a statement. “For too long, firms like BlackRock have followed the ESG gospel to the legal breaking point of violating their traditional fiduciary duty and putting Americans’ retirement savings at risk.” Advertisement

July 29, 2025 07:00 ET | Source: Abaxx Technologies Inc. Abaxx Technologies Inc. TORONTO, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abaxx Technologies Inc. (CBOE:ABXX)(OTCQX:ABXXF) (“Abaxx” or the “Company”), a financial software and market infrastructure company, majority shareholder of Abaxx Singapore Pte Ltd., the owner of Abaxx Commodity Exchange and Clearinghouse (individually, “Abaxx Exchange” and “Abaxx Clearing”), and producer of the SmarterMarkets™ Podcast, today announces the completion of a pre-feasibility study on the use of tokenized money market funds (MMFs) as financial collateral using Abaxx’s proprietary ID++ and Private Digital Title technologies. Building on its Q4 2025 gold-backed collateral pilot, the Company is now advancing discussions with institutional partners to conduct a second pilot transaction in Q4 2025. This next phase will test how tokenized MMF shares — when paired with Abaxx’s legal and identity infrastructure — can serve as legally enforceable, real-time collateral in regulated markets. The results will inform a full feasibility study and lay the foundation for the Abaxx USD Trust Network, as further detailed below. Key Features of the Second Pilot “The race to tokenize MMFs and the growth of stablecoins have rightly focused on efficiency gains, but they often sidestep the most critical challenge: the legal certainty required by regulated holders,” said Josh Crumb, Founder and CEO of Abaxx. “The ability to reduce settlement risk in atomic Delivery-Versus-Payment (“DvP”) transactions and unlock capital trapped in legacy T+1 cycles is transformative, but those benefits are an illusion without a trusted identity layer and enforceable title. The Abaxx Private Digital Title framework is architected to solve this by embedding identity and legal clarity directly into the asset — creating a truly native digital instrument with the integrity required to serve as high-quality collateral in institutional markets. This pilot is the next step in our mission to build smarter markets.” A New Framework for Digital Collateral Abaxx’s vision is to re-engineer the relationship between financial assets and risk management in global markets. To support this transformation, the Company has developed multi-layered market infrastructure designed to connect tokenized and traditional assets to collateral workflows — anchored by Abaxx’s regulated market infrastructure and proprietary ID++ Technology and suite of console applications, including Verifier+, Abaxx Messenger, Abaxx Sign, and Abaxx Drive. This integrated infrastructure addresses two persistent barriers to real-time finance: limited collateral mobility and the high cost of managing counterparty and legal risk across borders — the default condition when transacting in global commodity markets. Abaxx’s Private Digital Title system embeds legal ownership and verifiable identity directly into the asset through digitally-issued documents of title, offering an enforceable alternative to tokenization models that rely on centralized issuance, new legal constructs, or shared ledgers treated only as mirrors of off-chain records. These architectural decisions are designed to reduce legal and operational friction, shorten onboarding timelines, and support more flexible use of real-world assets as collateral, without compromising regulatory compliance or transaction confidentiality. This approach directly addresses the challenges highlighted by the Futures Industry Association (“FIA”) which notes the cleared derivatives industry is at an “inflection point” in adopting tokenization to accelerate collateral mobility. As the FIA’s recent whitepaper underscores, achieving real impact requires solutions that solve for legal finality and regulatory interoperability², goals that the Abaxx USD Trust Network is designed to meet through a privacy-preserving, real-time cryptographic legal agreement registry. “BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently called the tokenization of stocks and bonds the future of markets³ — and he’s right. But that future depends on solving two core challenges: identity authenticity and legal certainty,” said Ian Forester, Head of Product at Abaxx. “Trends in digital assets tend to focus on building the next ledger, but the core challenge of tokenization isn’t ledger integrity, it’s liquidity. By perfecting legal claims within the asset itself, our Private Title framework allows for the creation of a composable ‘real time USD’ asset secured by tamper-proof, identity-based signatures that are agnostic to the underlying ledger. This approach not only preserves the rights of parties to transact in private, it builds liquidity through trust that is backed by the rule of law.” About the Pilot and Feasibility Study The planned Q4 2025 pilot for the Abaxx USD Trust Network will test the full lifecycle of a tokenized MMF share, with the objective of demonstrating atomic settlement and establishing unequivocal legal finality. The pilot will exclusively use MMFs that are compliant with SEC Rule 2a-7, target a stable $1.00 value per unit, and invest in high-quality assets like U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. Findings of the pilot will inform a full feasibility study and may deliver a comprehensive legal and operational package for regulators and asset management partners, subject to regulatory approvals and compliance requirements. ¹ “Collateral supply, demand and mobility,” Securities Finance Times, June 5, 2024.² “Accelerating the velocity of collateral: The potential for tokenisation in cleared derivatives markets,” Futures Industry Association, June 2025.³ “Tokenization of the market, from stocks to bonds to real estate is coming, says BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, if we can solve one problem,” CNBC, April 12, 2025.

Title: Inside Robinhood’s Crypto-Fueled Plan For World Domination

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Crypto financiers might seem unlikely guests at the Château de la Croix des Gardes, a 25-acre Belle Époque villa commanding the Bay of Cannes from its hillside perch. Yet on a sun-drenched June afternoon, Robinhood commandeered the storied estate, famous for its star turn in Alfred Hitchcock’s To Catch a Thief, for “To Catch a Token”—a crypto field day conceived by longtime Côte d’Azur resident Johann Kerbrat, the firm’s head of crypto. The spectacle opened with a cinematic flourish: a video of Robinhood cofounder and CEO Vlad Tenev driving a midnight-blue 1962 Jaguar E-Type convertible along the corniche, an homage to Cary Grant’s entrance in Hitchcock’s film. When the reel faded, Tenev stepped out in real time—decked out in a pinstriped white Tom Ford suit, black-and-white ascot, green attaché case in hand—to greet an invitation-only crowd of more than 300 that included Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and top brass from financial heavyweights JPMorgan, Mastercard and Stripe. The theatrics are warranted. Robinhood’s stock is trading at $111 a share, an all-time high 384% above last year’s levels, vaulting the brokerage firm’s market cap to nearly $98 billion and into the ranks of the world’s 250 most valuable companies. In 2024, it generated $1.4 billion in profit on nearly $3 billion in revenue and now holds $255 billion in assets, expanding at a 44% net deposit growth rate over the past year. In terms of active or funded accounts, Robinhood, with 26 million, is rapidly gaining share on Schwab, with 37 million, is three times larger than Morgan Stanley’s E-Trade and six times larger than Merrill Lynch. Tenev’s personal fortune has jumped sixfold in a year to $6.1 billion. The 38-year-old chief executive operates in perpetual motion. In late May, he is in Las Vegas, preaching to 35,000 bitcoiners about how crypto will further disrupt global finance through tokenization—the process of converting assets like stocks, bonds and real estate into digital tokens that can be traded 24/7 on blockchain networks. From there, he bounces to Tampa for a conference for registered investment advisors, and a few weeks later he’s in Robinhood’s posh Manhattan offices for its annual shareholder address. “It’s New York this week, then France, then the U.K.,” he rattles off before listing more than a dozen Robinhood offices across America, Europe and Asia. “I have to visit each one at least once a year, and they just keep multiplying.” Despite his boyish looks, including a hair bob and goatee reminiscent of Errol Flynn’s 1938 Robin Hood, Tenev these days sounds very much like the seasoned chief executive of a giant financial conglomerate. The upstart brokerage that blossomed from the ashes of the global financial crisis and Occupy Wall Street movement has grown up. It wants to be a one-stop financial firm for tech-native generations who prefer transacting digitally. Within the next 20 years, accor­ding to Cerulli Associates, they are expected to receive some $124 trillion in assets, mostly from their Boomer parents. The get-together at the Château marks Robinhood’s first-ever international and crypto-focused event, dense with announcements. Starting in July, Robinhood is allowing European users to trade blockchain-based “stock tokens,” nonvoting derivatives that track hundreds of U.S. stocks and ETFs, including privately owned tech juggernauts SpaceX and OpenAI. The trading will be commission-free, 24 hours a day, five days a week. For U.S. customers, crypto staking—the practice of locking digital assets to blockchain networks like Ethereum or Solana to earn income—will finally be permitted. Robinhood’s June acquisition of Luxembourg-based crypto exchange Bitstamp for $200 million will unlock perpetual futures with no expiration on bitcoin and ether for continental customers. To underpin it all, Robinhood is building its own blockchain. “We as an industry find ourselves at an important preci­pice,” Tenev told the VIPs fanning away the Riviera heat. “We have a chance to prove to the world what we’ve believed all along, that crypto is much more than a speculative asset. It has the potential to become the backbone of the global financial system. We are hoping to turn that from a possibility to an inevitability.” To understand the coup Tenev is planning, it helps to revisit Robinhood’s turbulent past. In 2013, Tenev and his cofounder, Baiju Bhatt, two Stanford physics and math grads, saw a world ripe for disruption. After college, the two developed software for giant hedge funds whose high-frequency trading dominated Wall Street. It was a front row seat to these funds’ nearly insatiable appetite for trading volume, which they were willing to pay for. Retail investors who were accustomed to paying commissions of, say, $10 or $25 per trade at brokerage firms like Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Merrill Lynch could be a great source of this volume. Tenev and Bhatt built a fun and easy-to-use mobile trading app for novice tra­ders that eliminated account mini­mums and commissions because they knew hedge funds would pay them to execute their customers’ trades. They then marketed their zero-commission platform under the slogan of democratizing investing and rolled it out with the fanfare of a new blockbuster video game. Before Robinhood even launched, its Apple app store waitlist swelled to nearly 1 million people. By September 2019, the incumbents—Charles Schwab, E-Trade, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade (acquired by Schwab in 2020) —eliminated their fees, cementing the upstart’s approach as the new industry standard. The triumph, however, didn’t last long. In early 2021, after trading on the app exploded thanks in part to pandemic lockdowns and millions of stimulus checks, Robin­hood became the focus of a regulatory firestorm during the GameStop meme-stock trading frenzy. Spurred by the Reddit community WallStreetBets, GameStop’s stock price soared dramatically—seemingly without regard to the dismal underlying financials. This unprecedented volatility triggered a massive collateral demand from Robinhood’s clearinghouse, forcing Tenev to halt purchases of the stock on the platform. Cue user fury, Main Street vilification and congressional grillings, including questions over the suicide of a young Robinhood options trader. But rather than retreat, the GameStop trading debacle—which exposed how outdated, opaque and slow U.S. stock trading is—crystallized an idea Tenev had been mulling. “Could we actually put stocks on blockchains?” he says. “My belief was that the value would be in taking stocks 24/7.” Robinhood first tried to modernize legacy systems by partnering with alternative trading platforms like West Palm Beach–based Blue Ocean to extend trading hours. However, these efforts hit a wall. “I didn’t realize how difficult it would be to change these core infrastructure elements because so many things depend on them. Maybe that was a little bit naive,” Tenev admits. Meanwhile, his crypto chief, Kerbrat, was exploring other ways to execute his idea. With U.S. regulators taking a cautious stance on digital assets under the Biden administration, the team took the experiment to Europe, where a rulebook was already in place. “Sometimes it’s easier to start with new infrastructure and build it from the ground up. We believe the technology can scale to any jurisdiction, and over time we’ll be able to figure out how to make it available everywhere in the world,” Tenev says, knowing his lucrative trading volume machine could grow exponentially as millions of investors worldwide start trading U.S. stocks like memecoins. While Kerbrat worked on tokenization in Europe, Robin­hood was reinventing itself elsewhere. In March 2024, Bhatt, now worth $6.7 billion, exited the company (he stepped aside as co-CEO in 2020) to pursue a new venture in space-based solar energy. Despite lingering customer litigation from GameStop, Tenev was busy introducing a wave of new products—IRAs, high-yield savings accounts, a credit card offering 3% cash back (with 3 million people on the waitlist), a private banking service for cash delivery on demand and sophisticated options tools previously reserved for institutional investors—turning Robinhood into “a mousetrap to trade anything,” in the words of Brett Knob­lauch, managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald. The whirlwind of launches matches its architect’s own cadence. In a moment of reflection, the Bulgaria-born Tenev lifts his palms in a what‑can‑you‑do shrug. “I just wake up, work, eat, work out, go to sleep. My wife doesn’t love it when I say this, but I actually prefer to integrate work into personal life as much as possible.” What Tenev says he didn’t fully anticipate during Robinhood’s explosive growth was how deeply accessible trading resonates with the entrepreneurial spirit. At a private event in Miami last year, the company’s top users included not just self-taught day traders but small-business owners and startup founders—people who approach markets with the same DIY mindset that built their companies. This fiercely independent impulse, he believes, is Robinhood’s real protective moat: “Entrepreneurs don’t trust other experts to do their stuff for them. They like to figure things out for themselves.” Robinhood is engineered for them—a control panel for those who want to manage their own money without gatekeepers. Tenev plans to dominate next-generation investors in three phases he calls “arcs.” First, win the active trader market, where the ROI is immediate, as evidenced by Robinhood’s current strong results. Medium-term, around five years, he wants to serve the entirety of his customers’ wallets, from credit cards to crypto, mortgages and IRAs. Third arc: Build the number one global financial ecosystem, presumably with Robinhood’s blockchain as its backbone. Says Tenev, prepping for the next day’s shareholder meeting, “This will be much larger than the first two arcs. The opportunities start slowly but compound over time.” Tokenization may be Robinhood’s long-term ambition, but its core crypto business is already a juggernaut. In 2024, its crypto revenue reached $626 million, up from $135 million a year earlier, accounting for more than one-third of total transaction-based revenue. In the first quarter of 2025, crypto revenue has already reached $252 million. “They’re eating Coinbase’s lunch in the U.S. right now,” says Rob Hadick, general partner at crypto VC firm Dragonfly. In May 2025, Robinhood’s crypto volume spiked 36% month-over-month while Coinbase’s dipped, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Knoblauch notes. Coinbase still owns the institutional market, he concedes (“their offering is much broader and custodial”), but Robinhood’s takeover of Bitstamp, finalized in June, handed it 5,000 institutional accounts and additional licenses in Europe and Asia. Tenev and Kerbrat insist Robinhood’s approach is fundamentally different from that of crypto exchanges like Coinbase. “In this industry people talk to you about the advantage of this [blockchain] layer versus this layer and just forget at the end of the day about the end user. We don’t want to build a technology just to talk about the technology. We want to build something that people can use on the day-to-day and actually see the advantage compared to the alternative financial system,” Kerbrat says. Micky Malka, founder of Ribbit Capital and an early backer of Robinhood, Coinbase and their European competitor Revolut, says focusing on the Coinbase-Robinhood rivalry is shortsighted. “To me, the question for the next ten years is how much market share they take from the incumbents. It’s not a fight amongst them,” he says. Knoblauch estimates Robinhood’s $255 billion in assets under custody will rival Interactive Brokers’, which has $665 billion in client assets, within seven years. Next up, Charles Schwab, which the analyst calculates Robinhood has gained share on for 14 straight months. Tenev is also serious about diversifying. The old Robinhood was criticized for being a payment for order flow (PFOF) junkie, dependent on heavy trading volume and the most aggressive Wall Street hedge funds. Transactions still account for 56% of its revenue (down from 77% in 2021), but today Robinhood has ten business lines on track to each generate over $100 million in revenue within two years, according to John Todaro, managing director at Needham & Company. Take Robinhood Gold. What began as a simple $5 per month or $50 per year premium service, offering margin access, professional research and a little extra yield on balan­ces, has evolved into the centerpiece of Tenev’s powerful subscription model. Among its current perks: 4% yields on brokerage cash, interest-free margin loans up to $1,000 and a 3% match on IRA contributions. The newly released Robinhood Gold credit card, which offers 3% cash back on all purchases, was just sent to the first 200,000 customers. “If they get to 15 million users on Gold, you’re looking at close to a billion dollars of subscription revenue. It’s taking a business that used to be very cyclical to having recurring revenue, then diversifying the overall revenue base,” Knoblauch says. Then there’s Robinhood Strategies, Tenev’s new hybrid robo-human advisory product gunning for old-school stalwarts like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch in the $60 trillion U.S. wealth management business. For a 0.25% annual management fee, capped at a flat $250 for Robinhood Gold members, customers get tailored portfolios of stocks and ETFs, algorithmically managed and rebalanced with human oversight. Since launching in March, this disruptive new platform has already brought in $350 million. Tenev describes his company’s approach to new products as scientific, empowering small teams inside Robinhood to test hypotheses with customers who provide immediate feedback to its initiatives on social networks. “A lot of companies will just look at what’s happening in the outside world and copy it, sort of a competitive benchmarking. When we launch products or new features, we do it because we like to figure stuff out,” Tenev says. Robinhood’s recent launch of home mortgages—currently at 6.1% for 30-year fixed plus $500 toward closing costs—is the result of a stealth online pilot it ran starting in June. “It went all over social media. Then I acknowledged we were running the pilot in a tweet. It was probably one of my most viral tweets of the year.” Tenev’s tokenization push is a bit of a moonshot, and Europe, which has already adopted many of the crypto road rules still being deba­ted in Congress, is Robinhood’s lab. “The experiment that we’re running in Europe is, What would Robinhood look like if it was rebuilt from the ground up entirely on crypto rails? Then we’ll see what the pros and cons are and bring the best of that EU app to the U.S. and the rest of the world,” he says. So far the tokenization of stocks is minuscule. xStocks, a new but already leading platform from Switzerland’s Backed Finance, has tokenized more than 60 listed equities, inclu­ding household names such as Apple and Amazon, and made them available on large crypto exchanges like Kraken and Bybit. xStocks has less than $10 million in daily volume. Structural issues abound: These tokens are derivatives backed by assets held off-chain, which means routine corporate actions like dividends, stock splits or other things that might occur over a weekend, when markets are closed, could scramble collateral calculations and risk unintended liquidations. “Some market maker has to take that risk, and how will they hedge that risk when there is no market open? If they’re going to take that risk, they need to blow their spreads and charge people a lot of money,” says Dragonfly’s Hadick. “The infrastructure is not there at the moment on the off-chain side, and the on-chain product is not there yet. . . . I’m worried these initial products are going to be essentially duds.” This hasn’t stopped others from jumping in. In June, the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini launched tokenized trading with MicroStrategy shares for its EU customers. Coinbase is reportedly seeking SEC approval to offer tokenized stocks, and even Larry Fink, CEO of $12.5 trillion (assets under management) BlackRock, is urging the SEC to approve tokenization of stocks and bonds. Robinhood is going further. Besides public stocks, it’s tokenizing private companies and has already announced tokenized shares of Open­AI and SpaceX, each valued at more than $300 billion today. Open­AI has already publicly disavowed Robinhood’s product, emphasizing the tokens are not authorized or recognized by the company. “Nobody, no founder, wants their equity floating around on-chain with holders they don’t know,” Hadick warns. Tenev is a weathered veteran when it comes to facing naysayers. “It’s still a little crufty,” he admits, using pejorative coder slang for unnecessarily complex software. “I don’t think the brokers want to make it easy for us to pull their stocks out. But what happens when it becomes self-custody? When you can tokenize and self-custody, you can be independent of the brokerage infrastructure—the same way you can load a crypto wallet on MetaMask, Robinhood or Coinbase, you’ll be able to seamlessly use any interface to hold your stocks and trade them in pretty much all instances.” This is precisely why Tenev is obsessed with making Robinhood his young customers’ sole tool for all things related to money. When it comes to retail financial services, inertia is second in power only to compound interest. Customers are inherently sticky, but Tenev knows that the old giants of the financial world, including Fidelity, Schwab and Merrill Lynch, are vulnerable as trillions in Boomer assets are bequeathed to their digital-native offspring. In fact, he thinks his biggest competition will come not from firms like Coinbase or Fidelity but from the Anthropics and OpenAIs of the world: “They’re the ones moving the fastest and doing the most interesting stuff. Though I would say it’s too early to proclaim the financial industry being disrupted by ChatGPT.” Early Robinhood investor Malka, whom Tenev calls his mentor and whose firm has already profited on its stake by more than $5 billion by Forbes’ estimates, is an unabashed Tenev fanboy. “Robinhood has a leader who’s not even 40, who is extremely AI-native, understands where AI goes, understands tokenization, and he’s leveraging those two strategies like very few can,” he says. “We’re just starting to get the right setup to bring the ‘internet moment’ of money, where anybody in the world can save in the same product. Loans are going to get cheaper because credit underwriting is going to get better. All those things.” Tenev believes Robinhood will ultimately employ AI agents to replicate and improve on the services of high-net-worth family offices, putting a “family office in your pocket.” AI is so central to Tenev’s vision that the former math Ph.D. candidate couldn’t resist recently cofounding and becoming chairman of AI startup Harmonic, which he leads with computer scientist Tudor Achim, who previously led autonomous driving startup Helm.ai. In July, Harmonic raised $100 million in Series B funding from Kleiner Perkins, Para­digm and Sequoia, valuing it at $875 million. The “mathematical superintelligence” lab is building an advanced reasoning engine, one that “guarantees accuracy and eliminates hallucinations.” No doubt a useful feature in the coming age of AI and money. “It would be pretty amazing to solve the Riemann hypothesis, or one of the other big Millennium problems, on a mobile app,” muses Tenev, referring to the most profound unanswered mathematical questions. “Rather than obser­ving that, I hope to be actively participating.” Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink and Ken Griffin, take note.

The Heritage Foundation's Michael Pillsbury unpacks trade talks with China amid market volatility on 'America's Newsroom.' As data centers multiply across the United States, energy demand is increasing at a rapid pace. This has not escaped the notice of large investment firms from Wall Street. The likes of BlackRock and Blackstone are trying their very best to acquire utility companies in hopes of capitalizing on lucrative grid upgrades. On the other side of things, consumer advocates and regulators are raising alarms, worried that these moves prioritize profits over public service. For your information, BlackRock and Blackstone are two of the biggest investment management firms in the world. They have trillions of dollars' worth of global assets and have become the go-to option for companies that need money. They have enormous influence across various industries and make money by investing in many different types of businesses.

(Wikipedia) In a bold move last year, BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners, along with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, proposed acquiring Minnesota Power, a utility serving 150,000 customers. The acquisition, which could support tech companies with energy access for new data centers, received initial support from state agencies after negotiation. Even the Minnesota Department of Commerce dropped its opposition after reaching an agreement. However, Administrative Law Judge Megan J. McKenzie delivered a surprising recommendation on July 15th, urging regulators to deny the deal. She cited troubling signs that profit was the driving force behind the acquisition. "The nonpublic evidence reveals the partners’ intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control," Judge McKenzie wrote. "The partners themselves have carefully committed to do very little." It's important to note that the judge's recommendation is not final; state regulators will make the ultimate decision on whether the acquisition goes through. Power lines. (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) Opposition is mounting from climate advocates and watchdogs. Nichole Heil from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project voiced concerns over financial burdens and rate hikes: "No one in northern Minnesota wants higher utility bills solely to line the pockets of Wall Street-based private equity firms." Electricity bills are already climbing nationwide. According to the Energy Information Administration, the average monthly household bill rose nearly 4% in April to $175 a month. This is the average for a single household using 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. To address these concerns, the Minnesota Department of Commerce brokered a deal that includes key protections. These measures prohibit passing acquisition costs onto customers and preserve programs for low-income households. "These commitments include a substantial array of additional public interest benefits, risk-mitigation tools and customer protections beyond those originally proposed," the agency noted. A lightbulb with arms and legs plugging itself into a wall outlet. (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) If Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Blackstone acquire your local utility, rates could increase as they strive to maximize returns for their shareholders. Sure, they might improve the infrastructure and service, but history shows that when these types of companies come in, customers often end up paying more. They need to be kept in check to balance infrastructure investment while making energy affordable for regular Americans. The rapid increase in demand for tech has made utility ownership a battleground between profit-driven investors and consumer advocates. While firms like BlackRock and Blackstone argue that their resources can modernize aging grids, critics warn of a future where reliability and affordability take a backseat. With regulators now at a crossroads, the outcome in Minnesota may set the tone for utility ownership nationwide. Do you think companies like BlackRock and Blackstone owning utilities is a good thing?

Title: SharpLink stakes big on Ethereum: Are institutions moving away from BTC?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/sharplink-stakes-big-on-ethereum-are-institutions-moving-away-from-btc/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T05:00:50Z

What could this mean for supply, staking, and Ethereum’s price ceiling? SharpLink Gaming has ramped up to over 438,000 ETH, signaling deep institutional interest and long-term conviction. Analysts warn of a possible short-term dip before the next breakout. While the spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin [BTC] amid growing institutional accumulation, a quiet but significant shift is unfolding in the Ethereum [ETH] space. SharpLink Gaming, a prominent player in gaming and data analytics, has deepened its Ethereum commitment by purchasing an additional 77,210 ETH over the weekend, worth approximately $295 million, per Arkham. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain also confirmed the purchase, which has pushed SharpLink’s total Ethereum holdings to 438,017 ETH, now worth approximately $1.69 billion. Source: Lookonchain/X A large portion of this stash is staked via platforms such as Figment and Hoppers DApp, signaling a long-term approach rather than speculative accumulation. In fact, SharpLink itself emphasized Ethereum’s 24/7 availability compared to traditional banking hours, pointing to the agility and scalability that make ETH an attractive reserve asset for modern firms. They further added, Source: SharpLink/X Echoing the growing confidence in Ethereum, crypto analyst Crypt Rover posted on X that such large-scale accumulation is a strong signal of deepening institutional inflows. He even predicted that ETH could be on track to hit $10,000, as demand surges and long-term holdings tighten supply. This shows that with Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin serving as chairman and former BlackRock strategist Joseph Chalom as co-CEO, SharpLink is positioning itself at the intersection of traditional finance and Web3. If it fulfills its acquisition goal, the company would hold over 1 million ETH, or approximately 1% of the total supply. According to ETH Strategic Reserve data, SharpLink is now the second-largest holder of ETH, trailing only Bitmine Immersion Tech, which holds 566,000 ETH. This coincided with ETH trading at $3,871.72, up 1.12% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Technical indicators like the RSI also support a bullish case for Ethereum, showing that buyers currently have the upper hand. Source: Trading View The community also seems to have appreciated this move by SharpLink, as noted by one X user, who said, “$ETH will Moon!” Echoing similar sentiments, another page — WISE, added, “Oufff so bullish” Thus, with both sentiment and fundamentals lining up, Ethereum’s current trajectory could be signaling a larger trend in crypto capital allocation. However, Alphractal’s Liquidation Heatmap indicates a cluster of open long positions, hinting that a short-term dip may precede Ethereum’s next breakout as reported by AMBCrypto.

Title: Web 3.0 Founders Must Learn From AI Industry Success
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/28/web-3-0-founders-must-learn-from-ai-industry-success/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T03:40:35Z
Full Content:
Discords and X threads aren’t fooling investors anymore. Web 3.0 founders must look towards AI to survive. Web 3.0 founders have to pivot. The AI (artificial intelligence) industry has demonstrated itself to be far more apt at innovating than Web 3.0, which as an industry must accept defeat in a way and reorganize. It would behoove AI founders to take a page out of the book of big AI companies, which have impacted lives and scooped up a big market share in short order – leaving crypto very much in the dust when it comes to the mindshare of crypto in the global consciousness versus AI. Web 3.0 founders must ask themselves, ‘What can we learn?’ As AI becomes more powerful, and it will do so quickly, Web 3.0 will quickly become a subservient industry, dependent upon the whims of the almighty big technology corporations in control of AI technology. Web 3.0 will likely only become lucrative and impactful by partnering with AI companies. Web 3.0’s decentralization, which has resulted in thousands of projects promising all sorts of decentralized versions of apps that already exist, has led to the general public – including investors – not understanding which projects are for real. Investors simply don’t know which projects can achieve results or are even offering a solution to a real problem. DAOs, DeFi protocols and metaverse land rushes are largely a cacophony of Discord servers, Telegram groups and X threads. For many Western investors, these business models are completely foreign. The business models of AI companies, including startups, are far more familiar. In addition, Web 3.0 has gained a bit of a reputation for being associated with hype and scams. The AI industry, on the other hand, has forged a clearer path towards deals that make a difference. AI companies aren’t shilling tokens based on future promises, writing convoluted whitepapers and posting endlessly online. They’re building groundbreaking technology from the ground up. In the AI industry, the cream has risen quickly to the top. The world knows that it is companies like xAI, OpenAI, Google and others that dominate the marketplace. Investors know that real innovation doesn’t come from a 10,000 NFT (non-fungible token) collection. BlackRock will tokenize bonds, not NFTs. Partners want to make deals with the AI behemoths building out the world-changing infrastructure, such as cloud providers, chipmakers or platforms like xAI’s Grok, which has revolutionized the way in which humanity seeks out information. Unfortunately for those of us in the Web 3.0 space – for now at least – these companies are building the future, not Web 3.0 startups. Centralization is winning the day over decentralization. The fragmentation in Web 3.0 – the fierce competition over so little – is not nearly as appetizing to investors and strategic partners as AI monopolies. Web 3.0 companies should start looking to partner with those companies sitting on a vast GPU supply or a proprietary data organization. These are the companies – the ones that control algorithms – getting inventor funds. A new way forward for crypto Web 3.0 founders are left with no other option than to pivot. The industry has to face it and move towards a new strategy. Big money has found it difficult to navigate the decentralized web of Web 3.0 companies. Instead, centralized powerhouses are the ones building the future, and they could step into the crypto arena at any time and potentially outcompete crypto native incumbents. It’s time for crypto to move on from its messaging chat and X strategy, as well as the promises of decentralization, and start working the phones to get into the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies touching technology. It’s high time to deliver. The idealism of Web 3.0 is proving not to mesh with reality. The quest for decentralization, ownership and democratized value creation has stalled. In the future, Web 3.0 might further fragment. The biggest blockchains, such as Ethereum and Solana, will begin to pin their fates on centralized solutions, increasingly looking like the tech gatekeepers they once billed themselves as disrupting. The blockchains of tomorrow will exist as integrations into the traditional financial and technology giants, which are looking for supply chain tracking and similar solutions. For the blockchain world, these solutions are the quickest way to real-world utility and a monopoly. The more lofty solutions, such as decentralized data storage, are not making much progress when it comes to market share. Memecoins, redundant DeFi protocols and incomplete metaverses are already suffering under the strain of zero sum competition between one another. There is no crypto community. The incestuous strategic partnerships of crypto projects with each other have resulted in limited innovation. It’s time for Web 3.0 founders to make a change. Billion-dollar partnerships are made via access to C-Suites of the world’s biggest companies – not in the world of hashtags or virtual land. The Web 3.0 companies that don’t adapt to the fact that Web 3.0 has fallen far behind the AI industry in terms of innovation won’t be around for long.

The New York Post is identifying the Manhattan shooter who allegedly opened fire in the office building housing Blackstone and NFL headquarters as a 27-year-old Las Vegas man named Shane Tamura. Tamura allegedly walked into the building and opened fire around 6:30 p.m. and was found dead shortly thereafter. FOX 5 New York noted that Tamura had a “concealed carry permit from Las Vegas” on his person. Breitbart News initially reported the number of shooting victims as three, consisting of one police officer and two civilians. However, numbers were later updated to show at least six were shot, including another police officer who lost his life. At 9:17 p.m. FOX New York noted that at least three of the shooting victims had died. No motive for the shooting has been reported.

Update: FOX News is reporting the number of shooting victims in Monday’s Manhattan attack now sits at six, two police officers among them. Earlier reports indicated two civilians and one officer were shot. Those same early reports indicated the police officer would survive, but FOX News is reporting one of the two wounded officers is deceased. *****Original story below***** At least three people were shot, including a police officer, in the lobby of a midtown Manhattan office that houses Blackstone and the NFL headquarters. The shooting allegedly occurred around 6:30 p.m. The New York Post reported that the gunman is dead — that he “turned the gun on himself” after shooting individuals. NBC New York pointed out that the attacker was armed with an “assault” style rifle. Ironically, Mike-Bloomberg affiliated Everytown for Gun Safety ranks New York as No. 4 in the country for stringent gun control in part because the state bans “assault weapons.” New York also has heightened background check requirements, a red flag law, a ban on “high capacity” magazines and bump stocks, and many other gun controls.

Title: BlackRock’s ETHA becomes 4th-largest ETF by 30‑day inflows as Ethereum funds aim for $10B

Spot Ethereum ETFs register 16 consecutive days of inflows, driven by institutional whales and corporate treasury firms' appetite for ETH. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are close to breaking the $10 billion mark in inflows this month, as BlackRock’s ETHA makes its way to the spot of fourth-largest ETF by inflows in the last 30 days. According to Farside Investors’ data, spot Ethereum ETFs accumulated $9.3 billion in inflows as of July 25. This represents a 120% increase from the $4.2 billion registered on July 1, marking 16 consecutive days of inflows. The average daily inflow is $233 million, which would total over $930 million in the four trading days left in July. Even if the average doesn’t repeat itself, the ETFs require $162.5 million daily to reach $10 billion, and 13 out of 16 trading days with inflows have surpassed this amount. ETHA leads the inflows by a large margin, accounting for $9.34 billion in total flows, nearly four times the $2.35 billion in inflows of Fidelity’s FETH. In July, the BlackRock fund represented 91% of the total. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that ETFs took $97.6 billion in inflows in the past 30 days. ETHA took the spot as the fourth-largest ETF, showing nearly $3.9 billion in inflows, roughly 4% of the total. Moreover, Balchunas noted that ETHA registered the 17th-largest trading volume among ETFs as of July 28, 11:25 am ET. He added: “$ETHA 17th most traded ETF today Top 0.4% of all ETFs, first time I recall seeing it in there. Given it is up 5% today and still pretty new a lot of this volume is gonna convert to inflows.” As of press time, ETHA’s daily trading volume stands at $1.35 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Shawn Young, chief analyst at MEXC Research, assessed that the rising inflows are driven by both institutional whales and corporate treasury firms’ appetite for ETH. In a note, he said this growth reflects the increased conviction in Ethereum’s utility, sustainability, and long-term staying power, particularly due to its use in tokenization, stablecoins, and on-chain settlement. He concluded: “The rise of Ether ETF AUM to over $20 billion, which represents almost 5% of Ether’s total market cap, speaks to this growing strategic asset role it’s now occupying in institutional portfolios.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Ethereum (ETH) is once again at the center of investor attention, pulling in a staggering $1.59 billion in inflows over the past week. This marks the second-largest weekly inflow in Ethereum’s history, amid growing optimism that U.S. regulators will soon approve a spot Ethereum ETF. Overall, digital asset investment products attracted $1.9 billion, marking 15 consecutive weeks of positive flows. This surge in capital has pushed Ethereum’s price up 62% this month to $3,900, positioning it just below the critical $4,000 breakout level. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETPs faced $175 million in outflows, signaling a capital rotation from BTC to ETH and other altcoins. Analysts point to the passage of the Genius and Clarity Acts in the U.S. as key drivers of this trend, enhancing regulatory clarity for altcoin investment vehicles. Institutional investors are doubling down. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) surged past $10 billion in AUM, becoming the third-fastest-growing ETF globally, while the firm raised its ETH holdings to $10.47 billion, with 100% of its crypto exposure now allocated to Ethereum. Simultaneously, Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming purchased 77,210 ETH worth approximately $295 million, raising its total ETH treasury to over 438,000 ETH. This single purchase surpassed the network’s entire 30-day ETH issuance, underscoring the aggressive accumulation trend among institutions. Ethereum’s rally is further supported by bullish technical signals. A “golden cross” pattern emerged, and the MACD shows strong upward momentum, despite an overbought RSI reading of 82.07, a level often associated with potential price pullbacks. Solana and XRP also saw inflows of $311 million and $189 million, respectively, while Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash experienced minor outflows. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s on-chain activity surged 288%, reinforcing confidence in the network’s role as the leading smart contract and DeFi platform. As regulatory momentum builds and ETF approval appears within reach, Ethereum’s dominance in institutional portfolios signals a pivotal moment for altcoin adoption—though short-term volatility remains a factor to watch.

Title: BNY Mellon Wealth CIO Shares One Quiet Power Behind Smart Investing

ByGemma Allen ByGemma Allen, Contributor. Sinead Colton Grant - Chief Investment Officer BNY Wealth poses in NYC - 2024 As a child growing up in 1980’s Ireland, Sinead Colton Grant didn’t dream of a career in finance. Instead, her journey to the top ranks of Wall Street started with an unexpected monetary gain. She was a college student headed to Italy on a summer trip when she noticed a pleasant surprise in her finances. The devaluation of the currency just before she left, meant she had a little more Italian lira than she expected. For Colton Grant, this little holiday windfall sparked a lifelong fascination with global finance and smart investing, that would see her rise from FX sales on a London trading floor to become the first female Chief Investment Officer in BNY Wealth history. Her role oversees key decisions at one of the world’s largest private banks. But she shares, that for her, the numbers and portfolios have only ever been part of the story. “Investment isn’t just about returns,” she says. “It’s about trust. Without trust, even the best strategies fall flat.” While she crafts strategies for some of the world’s wealthiest people and foundations, she’s equally attuned to the changing face of wealth, who’s wielding it and how that changing client profile makes trust more important than ever before. I sat down with Colton Grant to discuss her rise through the ranks of an industry where she has often been the only woman in the room, her take on the current investment landscape and how she is witnessing and championing a historic shift in who holds financial power. Colton Grant’s career path has followed the broad arc of globalization and financial markets. After beginning in FX trading and currency management, she pivoted into asset allocation and multi-asset portfolios, before joining Barclays Global Investors and then BlackRock. She views those early years as formative, not just in building technical knowledge but in realizing that at the heart of strong investment strategies is the necessity of clear, human communication. “You can have an amazing investment process, but if you can’t articulate it in a way people understand, no one is going to invest with you,” she shares. That skill, which in practice means translating complex systems into human stories, became a cornerstone of her leadership style and one that would see her move between locations and offices before landing in Mellon Capital. There, she helped develop one of the ten largest liquid alternatives mutual funds in the U.S., before joining BNY Wealth as Deputy CIO and stepping into the CIO seat in 2020 at the height of a global pandemic. Sinead Coltan Grant presenting to BNY clients in Boston with guest, Dan Clifton from Eurasia Group, ... More 2025 Colton Grant shares that while on reflection the pandemic era feels like a fever dream, it marked a unique moment in the investment ecosystem, when the personal, political, and economic suddenly converged. For a leader like Colton Grant, who had built her career on human connection and trust, her appointment as CIO couldn’t have come at a more defining moment. "Managing wealth, is above all, a human business with trust at the center,” she shares, “Our clients aren’t just investing for themselves. They’re thinking about the financial legacy of their families, often over generations.” Increasingly, she notes, those conversations are being driven by a new generation, and a new type of investment profile - women. It’s a shift Colton Grant sees first hand, with a front-row seat to a growing wealth transfer, marked by a significant increase in female participation in angel investing, venture capital, and broader financial decision-making. She shares that this represents more than just a demographic shift. “I meet with more women thinking about the financial legacy of their families, often over generations. It's a mindset shift, and one that’s starting to show up in how capital moves and who’s deciding where it goes. We are now at a time when most of the wealth from the Silent Generation and Baby Boomers is moving into the hands of women,” she continues. “That means more women will be making, or solely responsible for major financial decisions, many for the first time.” Catherine Keating Former CEO BNY Wealth and colleagues Ring bell at NYSE 2022 For Colton Grant, this means that representation isn’t merely a moral imperative, it’s a strategic advantage. "Our clients want to see themselves reflected in the people managing their money. Diverse leadership teams make better decisions. It’s that simple." That also means that helping more women step into investing has become both a personal mission and an economic imperative. “Money means freedom," she says. "Our financial markets have built tremendous wealth over time, and it’s important that more women participate in that wealth creation by investing. I understand why it makes people nervous, but it doesn't have to be complicated. You can start small, with methods like a low-cost S&P index exposure which can generate strong returns over time." What she wants women to realize is that the ripple effects of investing extend far beyond individual portfolios. Women's increased participation creates a flywheel that benefits the broader macroeconomy. "The data shows that more female investors also lead to more female founders receiving seed capital for their businesses. This is vital given that only 2% of overall venture capital dollars go to female-founded start-ups." Asked about her advice to women with the resources to invest but not sure how or where to start? Her reply echoes the age old investment mantra: there will never be a perfect moment. "Time in the market beats timing the market. So just get started," she says. As for this moment we are in right now, marked by an unprecedented level of workplace and market uncertainty, Colton Grant remains bullish on U.S. markets, citing strong underlying fundamentals, backed by innovation capacity, productivity growth, and healthy earning margins. Her investment philosophy doesn't listen to political noise. "You don't invest with your politics," she says, "You focus on the fundamentals." Sinead Colton Grant, Chief Investment Officer, was featured on Fox Business ‘Making Money with ... More Charles Payne’ discussing her market outlook and the future of US exceptionalism. July 1, 2025 When asked where she thinks the opportunity lies, she shares that there are some clear emerging trends reshaping the industry. Private markets, which have long been the exclusive domain of institutional investors, are now more accessible through evergreen investment vehicles. Digital assets are gaining traction, particularly among younger generations, and, of course, artificial intelligence is a key factor. "2025 will be a 'show me' year," she predicts. "It's not just about tech companies, it's about how AI-driven productivity starts to ripple through sectors like healthcare, energy, and beyond." When asked what advice she’d offer women entering finance, Colton Grant boils it downto three things: Speak up, advocate for yourself- don’t assume people will notice your work. Go before you’re ready- don’t wait to tick every box. Know the difference between mentors and sponsors - mentors offer guidance, but sponsors open doors. Above all, however, Colton Grant shares that her trajectory - from a curious college student intrigued by currency shifts, to a leader at the forefront of finance’s biggest transformation - boils down to one undeniable truth: success and smart investing hinges on trust. As she puts it, “people buy people. Trust is everything.” For Sinead Colton Grant, aligning trust is more than virtue, it’s a movement led increasingly by women like her who are reshaping finance from every role: client, leader, founder, and investor.

Title: Ethereum Is Becoming TradFi’s Settlement Layer — Here’s Why

Time Published: 2025-07-28T19:00:49Z

Ethereum is quietly transforming from a hub of speculative activity into the foundational settlement layer for traditional finance (TradFi). With its secure infrastructure, growing regulatory alignment, and network effects, ETH is proving it can securely and efficiently handle large-scale institutional settlements. In an X post, crypto trader MoonKing recently highlighted a significant trend in the financial world, stating that Ethereum is becoming the settlement layer for traditional finance (TradFi). Since January, the tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on Ethereum have surged 20-fold, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down. The capital flows that were once confined to testnets and pilots are now moving decisively into production-level deployments on the ETH mainnet. This transition is supported by real yield and a growing regulatory traction, which together are driving greater institutional confidence. The leading institutions, like BlackRock, Plume, Ondo Finance, Superstate, and Franklin Templeton, are building with a clear intent to reshape financial infrastructure by leveraging blockchain. Their focus is not just on speculative crypto trading but on bringing US treasuries, credit products, and other yield-bearing assets directly into on-chain. This strategic movement signals a paradigm shift, as traditional finance is integrating with decentralized platforms to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. With ETF momentum building, stablecoin adoption is surging, and now a wave of real-world asset (RWA) inflows is accelerating, ETH is rapidly cementing its role as core financial infrastructure, which has become harder to ignore. This convergence of on-chain finance and legacy systems marks a critical inflection point where ETH is evolving into a foundational layer for global capital markets. BlackRock’s appetite for Ethereum keeps growing. According to Ucan_Coin revealed on X, the asset management giant has continued its accumulation through the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). BlackRock now holds 2.8 million ETH, worth around $10.5 billion. In the past week, BlackRock added another $440 million to its ETH holdings, which marks one of the largest single-week institutional inflows to date. ETH has experienced a brief pullback earlier in the week but has impressively reclaimed the $3,700 to $3,800 range, which has served as a key battleground for momentum over recent weeks. The altcoin market cap continues to hold firmly above the $1.25 trillion mark, a critical psychological and technical threshold that is reinforcing bullish sentiment across the broader crypto space. The institutional inflow led by giants like BlackRock has continued to fuel confidence, and the crypto market is gaining a firmer foothold in mainstream finance.

Title: BlackRock CIO Warns US Must Issue ‘A Lot of Debt,’ Names One Factor That Could Trigger Stock Market Correction
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/28/blackrock-cio-warns-us-must-issue-a-lot-of-debt-names-one-factor-that-could-trigger-stock-market-correction/

A top BlackRock insider says that the stock market could face a correction in the near future if inflation takes off. In a new interview on Bloomberg, Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, says that the US government’s fiscal situation requires it to issue “a lot” more debt. Rieder says large debt issuance makes it harder to allow longer-term yields to go up, making it more difficult to invest in T-Bills with durations longer than 10 years. And if inflation picks up, Rieder says long bonds could get hit even harder along with equities. “We’re going to issue a lot of debt. The long end is a hard place to invest. It used to be that the long end protected you against the equity market. If inflation ends up being higher, which I don’t necessarily anticipate, then what’ll happen is equities and the long end will get hit. So the long end of the yield curve today, given that you can get so much yield – if you’re an investor on the front end – the long end doesn’t become that attractive.” Looking forward, Rieder says that the US can only maintain its debt burden if it somehow manages to spur a higher GDP than the amount of debt it takes on, perhaps with the productivity expected to come from the growth of artificial intelligence (AI). “There’s only one way to de-lever the economy. You’ve got to outrun the debt, you’ve got to outgrow it. So there is a plausible outcome where you get nominal GDP running at 4.5-5% if you get that interest rate down to 3%. Gosh, now you can start to de-lever but it takes a really long period of time. Listen, I think the one engine today, since we are going to have a bigger debt burden, and not only are we going to have a bigger debt burden, you have to fund it domestically, because internationalism doesn’t buy as much. As long as we grow, then you can work through it.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

REUTERS/Enea Lebrun (Bloomberg) — CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. said it may invite a “major strategic investor” from China to join a group seeking to buy its global ports, as the Hong Kong-based company works toward a solution that pleases all in the geopolitically-sensitive deal. The unnamed investor would join as a significant member of the consortium, the company said in a stock exchange filing Monday, hours after the expiry of a 145-day exclusive talks window with the group backed by American asset manager BlackRock Inc. “Changes to the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction will be needed for the transaction to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities,” CK Hutchison said, adding that it “intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions.” State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. was negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the consortium, Bloomberg News reported last week. Shares of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s firm oscillated between gains and losses after the announcement. The stock closed 0.84% lower in Hong Kong on Monday. Cosco Shipping Holdings Co., the listed unit of China Cosco, was down 2.9%. Monday’s confirmation about a Chinese investor will likely help remove the obstacles that have been holding back the deal. Beijing has so far viewed the sale of CK Hutchison’s 43 ports as a threat to its interests because it includes transfer of two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal to the group backed by BlackRock — which China considers a proxy for American influence. Chinese authorities separately warned the parties involved not to bypass antitrust reviews, so as to prevent them from rushing into a deal. CK Hutchison reiterated its position Monday that it “will not proceed with any transaction that does not have the approval of all relevant authorities.” CK Hutchison’s shares, which shot up 37% in the days following the sale announcement on March 4, saw political pressure wipe out all the gains in the space of a month. The stock started rallying again last month as investors flocked back after China Cosco came into play. While it may initially sound like positive news, restricting the group to a few potentially strategic buyers means limited competition in the price discovery process for the asset, according to Ke Yan, head of research at DZT Research in Singapore. “Hence, the deal may not fetch the best price that the company hopes for,” he said. Investors have in recent weeks flocked back to CK Hutchison amid optimism that the 96-year-old Li will seal the deal of his lifetime. If it goes through, the sale will net the group more than $19 billion in cash. The renewed optimism is largely due to China Cosco’s interest in playing a role in the buying consortium, alongside BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd. “Ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal’s viability,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong. Initially hailed as a smart move by Li to exit a business caught up in global trade tensions, the deal quickly drew the ire of Beijing. It didn’t help that President Donald Trump billed the transaction as the return of Panama Canal back to American influence. Challenges remain even as Cosco enters the discussions, David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors, wrote on financial analysis platform SmartKarma. That could reverse the current rhetoric and upset Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, he said. CK Hutchison’s share price could also be under pressure should talks on the sale drag on, he added. Even with an extended timeline, revised terms or a partial agreement, uncertainty around the deal’s value and timing would increase, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Wong. The delay may also fuel concerns about regulatory and policy challenges, she said. Investors will be watching out for more answers to questions surrounding the deal, including what role the Chinese side will play in the consortium, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis. The controversial deal has also weighed on Li and his family’s other businesses. Younger son Richard’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The original structure of the buyer consortium was designed to give the Aponte family-controlled Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Leading trainer Edward O’Grady dies aged 75

Edward O’Grady, one of Ireland’s leading racehorse trainers over the last 50 years, has died aged 75. Based in Ballynotty, Co Tipperary, O’Grady trained his first Cheltenham Festival winner in 1974 and went on to enjoy 18 victories in all at National Hunt racing’s ultimate meeting. Most prominent among them was Golden Cygnet, a spectacular winner of the Supreme Novices Hurdle in 1978, who looked to have the racing world at his feet only to sustain fatal injuries in a fall just weeks later. O’Grady started training in 1972 and saddled his first winner, Vibrax, at Gowran Park in January of that year. He took over the license from his father Willie, who had just died. It meant O’Grady, who attended school at Blackrock College in Dublin, had to leave university without finishing a veterinary degree. He was in the spotlight due to the famous Gay Future controversy in 1974 when the horse of that name was at the centre of a gambling coup by an Irish betting syndicate. O’Grady was later played by Pierse Brosnan in the film ‘Murphy’s Stroke’ based on the matter. He was also instrumental in introducing the then bookmaker and gambler JP McManus to racehorse ownership. In 1982 the pair combined to win at Cheltenham with Mister Donovan. McManus backed the horse and later admitted: “He was needed!” O’Grady was champion National Hunt trainer in Ireland for four years between 1977 and 1980. He flirted with switching his attentions to the flat but returned to the jumps to some effect with star names such as Nick Dundee, Back In Front and Sound Man. A statement issued by his family through Horse Racing Ireland on Monday said: “It is with profound sadness that we announce the death of Edward O’Grady, who passed away peacefully yesterday evening at St James’s Hospital, surrounded by his family. “Edward was a cherished husband, father and grandfather and also one of the most respected and successful racehorse trainers of his generation. “Over the course of an extraordinary career that spanned more than five decades, Edward trained just shy of 1,700 winners under rules. His name became synonymous with Irish National Hunt racing, and he was a formidable force at Cheltenham and across the racing world. “Beyond the winners and the headlines, Edward was a man of deep intelligence, sharp wit, and remarkable warmth. He had friends on every continent, a story for every occasion, and a lifelong passion for the sport, the hunting field and everything equestrian.” O’Grady’s second wife, Maria, died in a fall while out hunting in 2017. He is survived by their daughters, Mimi and Rosie Mae, as well as his older children, Jonathan, Amber and Lucy.

Title: ‘Strap In’—$4 Trillion Bitcoin And Crypto Braced For A Price Game-Changer

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has bounced back from a sell-off last week, climbing after a $9 billion earthquake. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price dropped to around $115,000 per bitcoin last week but has rebounded to touch $120,000, propelling the combined crypto market to back over $4 trillion and helped by U.S. president Donald Trump issuing a huge crypto prediction. Now, as Elon Musk’s SpaceX sets bitcoin alarm bells ringing, analysts are predicting the wild bitcoin price swings that have rocked the market in recent years could be over. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “The days of parabolic bull markets and devastating bear markets are over,” Mitchell Askew, a bitcoin analyst with the bitcoin miner Blockware, posted to X, echoing CryptoQuant chief executive Ki Young Ju who believes the bitcoin four-year cycle theory “is dead.” However, Askew also predicted that the bitcoin price will soar to $1 million over the next 10 years as it switches between “pump” and “consolidate" phases, adding: “It will bore everyone to death along the way and shake the tourists out of their positions. Strap in.” Historically, the bitcoin price has climbed to all-time highs in the years following a bitcoin halving that sees the number of new bitcoin issued to miners in exchange for maintaining the network cut by half. Bitcoin saw significant price surges in the second halves of 2017 and 2021, following halvings that occurred in 2016 and 2020. Bitcoin’s last halving, cutting the bitcoin block reward to 3.125 bitcoins per block, happened in April 2024. Others have also said they believe the so-called four-year bitcoin price cycle is over, pointing to the huge accumulation of bitcoin over the last few years by first Michael Saylor’s Strategy then by bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers led by BlackRock Strategy now controls 600,000 bitcoin worth $72 billion, sparking a flood of copy cat companies who are buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, while the combined bitcoin ETF issuers now hold 1.5 million bitcoin worth $175 billion. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious "The four-year cycle is dead and adoption killed it," Kyle Chassé, a bitcoin and crypto commentator, posted to X alongside a video he appeared in with Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. "The long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic "four-year cycle" forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year," Hougan said in the clip. “I think it’s more ‘sustained steady boom’ than super-cycle,” Hougan added. “I could be wrong, and I’m certain there will be significant volatility." Other analysts have though pointed to the possibility of unexpected events as either boosting or crashing the bitcoin price—something they warn could happen at any time. “This fifth bitcoin bull market has been characterized by bursts of momentum and sudden pauses, rather than a steady, high sharpe ratio climb,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of bitcoin price and crypto analysis company 10x Research, said in an emailed note. “Each move has hinged on a clear catalyst: Fed rate expectations, Trump’s political traction, ETF breakthroughs, or regulatory interventions, such as the dismantling of crypto-friendly banks. That’s why staying laser-focused on macro triggers and reacting quickly to breakouts remains critical. In crypto, momentum is sparked by events, not driven by the calendar.”
