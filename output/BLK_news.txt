Title: Who Owns the World? The Boom-Bust Bailout Process that Placed Nations in Debt

There are systemic aspects about the banking, monetary, and economic system that are not taught in the schools and universities of the world and are rarely discussed on corporate owned news and media networks. Knowledge of these aspects is absolutely essential for everyone in the world that wishes to understand how the economic world ‘actually’ works and how worldwide society has been brought to the brink of financial ruin (currently almost all governments of the world are in vast debt) while the vast resources of human productivity and of nature are continually exploited by a small group of people that control these systems. See also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. This article explores: Without GDP growth the (privately owned) debt-money banking system fails. The real reason governments prioritise GDP growth is so that sufficient tax monies can be collected so that interest can be paid to the international banking system. Governments often maintain that the ultimate purpose of economic GDP growth is in fact to improve wellbeing. This is not in fact so. John Jopling (RIP) of the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability wrote in 2003: “The real reason why governments regard growth as desirable is that, with a debt-based money system, if the economy does not grow, it collapses. This is something all politicians are naturally and rightly extremely keen to avoid. Growth is an absolute imperative imposed on governments by the nature of the current money system. Thus, it is in the nature of the money system, not the choice of government, that growth must be maintained.”[1] Governments are buried under the lie, they do not admit or have the awareness that the need for GDP growth is imposed by the debt-money system controlled by private banks nor that the creation of debt money by private banks is unnecessary and is against the public interest (because governments could create and issue debt-free money themselves as has been done in the past). It is rarely acknowledged by politicians that the main reason for the constant drive for GDP growth is to pay interest to the banking system. The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability has stated: “The way in which the global economic system is designed automatically ensures that the economy operates in such a way that: a. inequality is bound to increase, b. the economy is unstable and c. the economy is blind to the limits of natural resources and the need for humanity to live in symbiosis with the rest of the natural world.” – The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainabilit[2] GDP growth is prioritised by governments and debt-money is the basis of the banking system – yet both are significant drivers of environmental degradation, resource depletion, and social inequity. A government prioritises growth, yet whether it is ‘good’ growth or ‘bad’ growth is not the focus (good growth would not impact on environmental and social resilience.) The pseudo-science of neo-classical economics (that all governments adhere to) proposes that increased GDP growth can reduce pollution in what is called the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). This EKC argument is false. The EKC posits that pollution increases with economic growth in the early stages of development and that beyond a certain level of development the trend reverses, and economic growth improves environmental conditions by creating the resources to do so. However, the EKC has never been validated. Vastly excessive consumerism has been required to keep the system from derailing. The debt-money system increases and reduces the availability credit at will often creating ‘boom, bust and bailout’ cycles – this means that the economic system is unstable by nature. If sufficient loans are not repaid to a commercial bank it will become insolvent. This has happened in many countries, for example in various countries in Europe during the banking crisis of 2008. . The collapse of Lehman Brothers (headquarters pictured), the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, on September 15, 2008, is often considered the climax of the 2008 financial crisis. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . [Aside: Bear in mind that these private banks never held the original monies in the first place, and, the cruel bait and switch is that it is actually the people that are the grantors of credit when they sign a mortgage or loan (a promise to pay), however, the bank typically never pays back the grantor of the credit. Including interest one typically pays the bank about twice the amount of the loan or mortgage. Yet, the bank does not pay equity for that promissory note, and presumes that we have abandoned our securities]. Typically a national government then intervenes to bail out those commercial banks, being under pressure to do so from the international banking system. Furthermore, by controlling the availability of credit the private banking cartel created boom-bust-bailout cycles, at will, which placed nations in further debt. For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) exerted pressure on the Irish government to bail out private banks and unsecured bondholders in 2010. In 2012 RTE, Ireland’s National Television Service reported that the ECB informed an Irish Government Minister that “a bomb will go off in Dublin” if Anglo bondholders are not paid. “He [Minister for Transport and Tourism, Leo Varadkar] said that the Troika told the Government that “we don’t want you to default on these payments, it is your decision ultimately but a bomb will go off; and the bomb will go off in Dublin and not in Frankfurt.” – RTE reporting Minister Varadkar’s comments 22nd January 2012. [Note: The Troika is a term used to describe the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).] Furthermore, a letter was sent by the ECB to pressure the Irish Government to accept a bailout. In that letter then ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet told Ireland in November 2010 that it would not extend further emergency funding to the country’s banks if Dublin did not sign up to a bailout, according to the letter which was finally released after years of lobbying. The so-called global banking crises of 2008 represented an opportunity for a re-evaluation of the values that our banking system and economic system are based on. Moreover, it represented an ideal opportunity for transition toward a more sustainable, resilient, just, and, perhaps even, a more ethical society. Alas, this opportunity was spurned, and almost all governments bailed out the banks. This results in increased taxes, national austerity measures and/or the privatisation of national assets due to conditionalities on credit. For example, in Ireland the government must pay around €6 billion to €10 billion per annum in interest on the national debt of €235 billon[3] – a significant portion of this debt (€85 billion) was incurred due to bailing out private commercial banks in Ireland in 2008[4]. To understand the magnitude of this debt if you convert into U.S. dollars and lay $1 bills on top of each other they would make a pile 28,581 km, or 17,760 miles high. These debts will never be fully repaid and the annual interest payments alone are, in effect, a never-ending shackle of debt servitude and a form of slavery for the Irish people. Similar bailout situations have occurred in many other countries worldwide. “There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt.” – U.S. President John Adams The banking system can and does control the availability of credit (i.e., debt-money loans). It can expand or contract the availability of credit in a nation or worldwide. Over the past decades the more credit that is available the more an economy is likely to grow (there are also other factors including the availability of a cheap energy source, such as oil). When the availability of credit is contracted/reduced by the banking system the money supply shrinks, the availability of money to repay loans plus interest is reduced, foreclosures begin to occur and the economy may start to shrink rather than grow. This expansion and contraction of credit is known as the business cycle. “The fact that the necessary growth can be achieved only by increasing the total level of debt makes the economy heavily dependent on confidence… The economy therefore constantly moves between boom and bust; it is systemically unstable.” – John Joplin and Roy Madron, authors of ‘Gaian Democracies’[5] “The bankrupt country must borrow from international banks and the IMF, which impose a condition of debt relief that the national government may not issue its own money. If the government tries to protect its resources or its banks by nationalizing them for the benefit of its own citizens, it is branded communist, socialist or terrorist and is replaced by one that is friendlier to free enterprise.” – E.H. Brown, Author of the book ‘The Web of Debt’ Author Bob Djurdjevic associates these cycles, which have been experienced by many countries, to what he calls the Wall Street dominated New World Order terrorists: “The Wall Street dominated New World Order (NWO) Empire is being built by colonizing other countries with foreign loans or investments. When the fish is firmly on the hook, the NWO financial terrorists pull the plug, leaving the unsuspecting victim high and dry. And begging to be rescued. In comes the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Its bailout recipes – privatisation, trade, liberalization and other austerity reforms – amount to seizing the target countries’ natural resources, and turning them over to the NWO elites – just as surely as the British Empire did by using cruder methods.” – Bob Djurdjevic, Chronicles Journal[6] The boom-bust-bailout process can be summarised, as follows: Many people’s perceptions are that social programs are targeted to assist poorer people lower down the socio-economic scale. However, the 2008 banking crisis in Europe and the U.S. was a clear example of socialism for the banks and extremely wealthy bondholders. The failing banks that were reckless with their lending and investment practices still got “rewarded” with vast quantities of government bailout monies because they were regarded as “too big to fail”. The attempted justification for such bailouts is that it is in the people’s interests that the banks are kept alive. However, in reality it is the working-class and middle-class tax-payers that are typically forced to shoulder the disproportionate brunt of the bailout, which is in effect a huge transfer of people’s labour and money to the already mega-wealthy bondholders and private owners of the banks. In summary, a private-banking cartel has been able to create booms and busts and drive nations into bankruptcy and bailout using the Problem, Reaction, Solution approach or the Hegelian Dialectic. The reality of this flawed monetary system became apparent to many millions of people in 2008 when the so-called banking crises hit in the U.S. and in Europe. As usual, it was the people that were forced to pay for the debts of privately owned banks. In Ireland, the debts of the private banks were the controversially guaranteed by the Irish government, thereby placing the debt burdens onto the Irish citizens. According to a poll by the Irish Independent in 2010 a substantial majority of the Irish people wanted the State to default on debts to bondholders (See endnote 38). Furthermore, as I noted in a blog in 2010 [7] the people of Ireland did not agree to the use of billions of their monies being used to bail out privately owned banks. There was no national referendum on the issue. The bailout of the private banks by the Irish government prompted much public anger, yet, the mainstream media in Ireland appeared to be generally aligned with the government narrative. A number of commentators and bloggers had criticised the government’s bailout plans to no avail. For example, the following is an extract from an article titled “We must face down the jackals who control the international banking system to save our nation and protect our children’s future” by Robert Pye, a former Irish Department of Finance Analyst: “THERE IS considerable truth in the view that Ireland is no longer a sovereign state but an impoverished suburb of Brussels. Four million people are mired deep in a collective debt that is not of their own making… They call us PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) because that is what you do with a pig: tie him upside down, slit his throat and drain him dry. Well, I for one reject this disgusting epithet. I also reject utterly the despicable arrogance with which this country is being treated, and the servile ineptitude of those who pose as our leaders. Unless we take a stand and defend our sovereignty, our integrity and our children, we will be destroyed as a nation.”[8] Richard Douthwaite (1942 – 2011) an economist and writer, wrote a relevant article in relation to the planned bailout in Ireland titled “Bailout talks: four truths Ireland can’t ignore”[9]. The following is an extract: “Ireland’s negotiations with the ECB and the IMF are perhaps the most important talks that this country has engaged in… If Ireland has to pay interest on the loans being negotiated at a rate which exceeds the rate at which the economy grows over the next few years, it will make the country’s situation worse, not better… The ECB bears a large share of the responsibility for the regulatory failure which led to the property bubble… There is a Plan B. Ireland doesn’t have to take anything that is offered. It can leave the euro quickly and easily… If the deal offered by the ECB/IMF negotiators is unsatisfactory, the Irish government can simply announce… a new currency… and all wages, rents, debts and other payments are to be paid in harp with immediate effect… After the announcement the government would issue itself with the new currency on a debt-free basis so that it no longer needed to borrow to cover its budget deficit… Ireland has no alternative but to renege on the guarantees and to build itself a future within the EU but outside the eurozone.” An article on broadsheet.ie in 2010 titled “The Senior Bondholders: An Analysis”[10] provided an analysis of who the bondholders actually were that were benefitting from the Irish tax-payer funded government bailout of privately owned insolvent banks. Many of the bondholders were privately held banks “mostly” owned by extremely wealthy individuals. An extract from the article is as follow: “SO…. on one side we have Ireland whose bond holders, its people, have between them a total GDP wealth of 0.207 trillion euros. Who are being FORCED, against their will, to pay Anglo Irish bank’s debts to its bond holders, who between them hold 20.8 Trillion euros. The people of Ireland are paying to, and protecting the wealth and power of, people who have 100 times more wealth!… So who are they? Well many of the bond holders are privately held banks, which list their activities as asset management for off-shore, non-resident and high value individuals.” The following is also a relevant excerpt from an article[11] written by author and blogger Charles Hugh Smith in November 2010 that summarises the situation and the opportunity Ireland had to dis-empower “the vampire banks” which had the world by the throat: “When a nation such as Ireland is running a State deficit equal to 32% of GDP, austerity cannot generate the stupendous surpluses needed to make good the vast sums which are already lost… Ireland, and indeed the world, will survive if all the vampire banks are liquidated. That is the end-state, and “buying time” just increases the misery of the citizens who have been yoked to save their “betters.” Ireland, please drive a stake through the heart of the vampire banks which have the world by the throat. By defaulting, you would be doing the world (and your own nation) an immense favor.” The following extract from a wiki project[12] describes the different responses to the debts of private banks in Iceland and Ireland. Iceland is an interesting example of how a country can stand up against the IMF. “The “Icelandic Solution” involved repudiation. Private banks were allowed to fail and social security measures for the poor and indebted were increased… The UK went so far as to trigger anti-terrorism legislation against Icelandic banks in a bid to pressure Iceland to pay out claims against its private banks… Self-interested bankers are therefore often desperate to avoid government debt default, and generally much prefer an economy to be strangled by debt rather than be freed of it… The Irish government on the other hand, guaranteed private bank debt and in doing so subjected the taxpayers of that country to decades of payments for debts that were not incurred on their behalf or for their benefit. This could be interpreted as theft through the taxing of future generations tomorrow to pay off creditors of private bankers today. Many commentators have observed that in 2010. Iceland recovered much faster than other countries such as Ireland.” When you get a mortgage, loan, or a credit card, the debt money is created out of thin air when you sign on the dotted line of the contract, yet you will have to work (maybe for years) to generate the money to pay back to the bank plus interest – in essence, this is a form of slavery as the bank never had the money in the first place. Income tax monies collected by governments from the people is one of the methods used to service the debt governments owe to the international finance system, money that was originally created entirely from nothing by privately-owned mega-banks. “Federal income tax was instituted specifically to coerce taxpayers to pay the interest due to the banks on the federal debt. If the money supply had been created by the government rather than borrowed from the banks that created it, the income tax would have been unnecessary. … There is a way out of this morass. The early American colonists found it and so did Abraham Lincoln and some other national leaders: the government can take back the money-issuing power from the banks. “ – Ellen Brown, Author of the book ‘The Web of Debt’ “Between usury and taxes the consumer is really played for a sucker. God’s law permits no property tax for it is discriminatory… It discourages stability and brings about a shifting, irresponsible citizenry with no ties to the land. Under our present system, accident, sickness, or old age easily dispossesses a man of his home but in no way reduces his expense….” – Dr. Franklin Snook, Author of America Needs the Divine Law Over decades the power to create debt-money has resulted in the power to own, control and manipulate the assets of the material world, as well media and politics. Those that control the money creation process wield the power to control the corporate media and own the material world, regardless of which political party is elected, or which system is utilised (capitalism, socialism, communism, etc). This mean that many aspects of our lives are in reality controlled from a moneyed source not from a democratic source. This power grab was achieved not by creating more value, but by fully controlling the source of money and the world of finance. A pyramid of control has existed. The higher up you go the closer you get to the source of money creation. At the bottom level we are all going about our daily lives. At the next level up are governments. These are people who are given a monopoly on force and use it to tax and control the population whether or not we agree. The election of new government leaders via representative democracy is an illusion of people power. The vast regulatory systems of government in essence never change. But who controls the governments? It is not the people of the nations that control governments, this is evidenced by the banking bailouts in Europe after 2008. There was no referendum on the subject, the governments simply complied with the wishes of international private banking corporations. At the next level up are the mega corporations and at the next level beyond the corporations is the privately owned worldwide banking cartel. Over decades the mega-corporations have acquired the world’s resources and controlled the markets. To do so they needed access to cheap money. The mega corporations got their loans at special rates from the mega banks. We can conclude that those who control the mega banks ultimately control the mega corporations. “Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.. when you realise that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.“ – James Garfield (20th President of the U.S. – assassinated 1881). “The … bankers rule the world through debt, which is money they create out of nothing. They need world government to ensure no country defaults or tries to overthrow them. As long as private bankers, instead of governments, create money the human race is doomed. These bankers and their allies have bought everything and everyone.” – Henry Makow, Author Also note the comments of Congressman Charles McFadden, Chairman, House Banking and Currency Committee, June 10, 1932: “Some people think the Federal Reserve Banks are U.S. governments institutions. They are not… they are private credit monopolies which prey upon the people of the U.S. for the benefit of themselves and their foreign and domestic swindlers, and rich and predatory money lenders… These twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully foisted upon this Country by the bankers who came here from Europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our American Institutions… The sack of the United States by the FED is the greatest crime in history. Every effort has been made by the FED to conceal its powers, but the truth is the FED has usurped the government. It controls everything here and it controls all foreign relations. It makes and breaks governments at will.” – Congressman Charles McFadden. The major shareholders in the commercial banks are other banks and asset management companies and trusts. For example, asset management company Blackrock has large shareholdings in mega-banks Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase and other banks[13], yet those same banks have major shareholdings in Blackrock. The list of shareholders is diversified amongst various privately owned financial and asset management corporations. In essence, all these various financial entities are interlocked and own each other – the current dominant worldwide privately owned financial orthodoxy is one large self-reinforcing entity under the tentacles of many financial corporations. A study[14] was conducted at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, on the relationships between 37 million companies and investors worldwide, and there is a ‘super-entity’ of just 147 tightly knit mega-corporations that controls 40 percent of the entire global economy. and all of their ownership was held by other members of the super-entity. According to James B. Glattfelder, one of the authors of the study: “In effect, less than 1 per cent of the companies were able to control 40 per cent of the entire network,” Most were financial institutions and included Barclays Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and The Goldman Sachs Group. The dominant players appear to be the banking families that have been operating private banking for generations. The involvement of certain banking families in private banking for generations is mentioned in books including ‘The Web of Debt’ by Ellen Brown, chair of the U.S. Public Banking Institute. Families that are often mentioned in relation to the banking industry include the Rothschild banking dynasty[15] (associated with US Trust owned by Bank of America), The Rockefeller world business empire (associated with Citigroup), the Schiff’s, the Morgan’s[16] (associated with Morgan Stanley, etc.), and the Warburg’s. Author Dean Henderson writes in an article[17]: “The Four Horsemen of Banking (Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo)… According to company 10K filings to the SEC, the Four Horsemen of Banking are among the top ten stock holders of virtually every Fortune 500 corporation… One important repository for the wealth of the global oligarchy that owns these bank holding companies is US Trust Corporation – founded in 1853 and now owned by Bank of America. A recent US Trust Corporate Director and Honorary Trustee was Walter Rothschild… [18]” Furthermore, according to Ellen Brown, chairperson of the Public Banking Institute in the U.S. asset management companies, such as Blackrock, literally own much of the U.S. and the world. She states: “BlackRock has a controlling interest in all the major corporations in the S&P 500, it professes not to “own” the funds. It just acts as a kind of “custodian” for its investors — or so it claims. But BlackRock and the other Big 3 ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) vote the corporations’ shares; so from the point of view of management, they are the owners. And as observed in a 2017 article from the University of Amsterdam titled “These Three Firms Own Corporate America” they vote 90% of the time in favor of management.”[19] In a 2018 review titled “Blackrock – The Company That Owns the World’[20], a multinational research group called Investigate Europe concluded that BlackRock “undermines competition through owning shares in competing companies”. The major shareholders of Blackrock are all mega-banks and financial corporations, such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citi Group, Wells Fargo and Company, Morgan Stanley, and other various other banks[21]. So, privately owned commercial banks own Blackrock and the other major asset management companies that own most of the world. Author Karen Hudes, who worked in the legal department of the World Bank for more than 20 years, has cited the above Swiss study during an interview with the New American[22] pointing, out that a small group of entities, mostly financial institutions and especially central banks, exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. According to Hudes “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” and that “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. According to Hudes, the power grabbers also dominate the organizations that control the creation and flow of money worldwide and control the finances of virtually every nation in the world. These organizations include The World Bank, the IMF and central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, all of which are unelected and unaccountable. Author E.H. Brown states that: “Secrecy has been maintained because the robber barons have been able to use their monopoly over money to buy up major media, educational institutions, and other outlets of public information. While Rockefeller was buying up universities, medical schools, and the Encyclopedia Britannica, Morgan bought up newspapers… By 1983,.. fifty corporations owned half or more of the media business. By 2000, that number was down to six corporations, with directorates interlocked with each other and with major commercial banks.[23]” For more information see also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) - Air-taxi maker Archer Aviation said on Tuesday it has raised $300 million in a funding round that consisted of institutional investors including accounts managed by BlackRock. Archer expects the capital raise to help it accelerate the development of its hybrid aircraft platform and further reinforce its balance sheet. "We are raising additional capital to help us invest in critical capabilities like composites and batteries to help enable us to capture this opportunity and more," CEO Adam Goldstein said. The additional capital brings Archer's total liquidity to about $1 billion currently, the company said on Tuesday. The company's statement did not disclose the valuation at which the new capital was raised. The latest fundraising comes amid a cash crunch in the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) industry, driven by technological and regulatory challenges. However, analysts believe Archer is well positioned to endure these difficulties and achieve certification. The company previously raised $430 million in December through an equity offering that had defense technology company Anduril and existing investors such as United Airlines and Stellantis, as well as new backers such as Wellington Management and Abu Dhabi investment holding company 2PointZero, participate in the fundraising. Santa Clara, California-based Archer said in its preliminary fourth-quarter results that its adjusted operating expenses were in line with its forecast range of $95 million to $110 million. It also said it does not expect its total adjusted operating expenses for the first quarter of 2025 to materially increase above its Q4 guided range.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Escalating geopolitical tensions and a new administration with a hawkish defense agenda have led many startups to embrace dual-use strategies to secure revenue through military applications. It’s a trend that is already heating up in aerospace. Take Archer Aviation, a California-based startup building eVTOLs (electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles). Until very recently, Archer’s go-to-market strategy was an air taxi network across several cities in the U.S. and abroad. Archer’s focus is now more acutely on defense, and it has attracted fresh capital to further that mission. The company, which went public in September 2021 via a special purpose acquisition merger (SPAC), on Tuesday announced a $300 million equity raise from institutional investors like BlackRock and Wellington. The raise brings Archer’s total funding to around $3.36 billion. This fresh capital comes off the back of a $430 million round in December to fund its new Archer Defense program. As part of that program, Archer signed an exclusive deal with weapons manufacturer Anduril to jointly develop a hybrid gas-and-electric-powered VTOL aircraft for critical defense applications. Together, the two are targeting a program of record from the Department of Defense, which is a budgeted acquisition program with guaranteed funding over a set period. “As we dug into the work we were doing on the defense front, we realized that the market was a lot larger than we initially expected, both in terms of scope as well as timing,” Nikhil Goel, Archer’s chief commercial officer, told TechCrunch. “We’re the only company in the space that I think is targeting a sizable defense program of record,” Goel continued. “So we really want to be strategic with the investments we’re making and go full steam ahead on this.” Rivals in the space like Joby Aviation and Beta Technologies also have military contracts to test their aircraft for surveillance, logistics, and reconnaissance missions. Archer has such contracts with the military, but what it’s chasing now via the program of record is guaranteed funding, a path to scale, and a serious competitive moat. Goel confirmed that the $300 million from investors will mainly be used to accelerate the work Archer is doing with Anduril to build a hybrid craft (VTOL), though he didn’t share any updates on the company’s bid with the DOD. Archer’s decision comes at a moment of industry momentum. The Trump administration has vowed to “rapidly field emerging technologies” like AI, drones, and counter-drone systems to modernize the military. The very qualities that make eVTOLs perfect for urban and regional flight are also attractive for defense use cases. Cruising at 300 feet, Archer Aviation’s electric aircraft, Midnight, makes less noise than a passing car on the highway. In an urban environment, it blends into other transportation sounds in a way that helicopters cannot. “The sound profile is why we are so well positioned to [build aircraft] for defense,” Goel said. “If you look at the traditional helicopters that the defense industry uses, they’re very loud and have very noticeable heat signatures. And so that makes helicopters not a great fit for more discreet missions.” Archer’s Midnight is built with 12 sets of engines and propellers – six in the front, six in the back. That distributed propulsion among smaller rotors that spin slightly slower — rather than a single large main rotor and tail rotor that operate at high speeds — creates much less noise. VTOLs are also designed to transition from a vertical lift to a winged horizontal flight like an airplane. When in forward flight, the Midnight generates all the lift from the wing, rather than from downward thrust, which also reduces overall rotor noise, Archer’s CEO and founder Adam Goldstein told TechCrunch during a recent flight demonstration. While Archer is gunning to supply the defense industry with aircraft, the company still intends to launch its first limited commercial air taxi network in late 2025 in the United Arab Emirates. In 2026, Archer says it will expand air taxi services to several other cities and countries, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, South Korea, and India. The company has partnered with major airlines to facilitate air taxi networks like United, Southwest, and IndiGo. In November 2024, a joint venture from Japan Airlines and Sumitomo conditionally agreed to purchase up to $500 million worth of electric aircraft from Archer. But 2026 isn’t that far away, and Archer has pushed out its timelines before. That’s partly because Archer is still working toward validating the safety of its eVTOLs and securing the necessary certification from the Federal Aviation Administration. In the U.S., eVTOL companies need to secure type certification to approve the design of an aircraft, production certification to prove they can mass-produce a vehicle that meets its approved design, and airworthiness certification to ensure an aircraft is safe for flying. Goel says Archer is far along in the process for those certifications but has yet to receive any of them. Nor has Archer flown with a pilot in its aircraft yet, which is a necessary step toward testing the aircraft with passengers. He adds that Archer will put a pilot in one of its Midnights “imminently.” The process of certifying aircraft and scaling production is an expensive one. Construction on Archer’s Georgia factory, built with its strategic investor, Stellantis, is nearly complete, with production expected to begin this quarter. Archer hopes to build 650 aircraft annually by 2030. For this year, though, Archer’s goal is to produce eight to 10 aircraft between the Georgia facility and its prototype facility in California. Goldstein told TechCrunch back in October that most of the capital expenditures to get the factory up and running have already been spent, so the focus is on scaling Midnight eVTOLs while also developing the hybrid defense aircraft. Today’s raise brings Archer’s total liquidity to well over $1 billion, extending its runway for “multiple years” through commercialization and the initial phases of defense work, according to Goel. Archer has yet to share its 2024 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings, but the company’s total operating expenses hit $385 million in the first three quarters of the year, or $281 million on an adjusted basis. Archer anticipated adjusted operating expenses for Q4 to be between $95 million and $110 million. It’s not yet clear how much Archer’s development of a hybrid aircraft for warfare will increase the company’s expenses.

Title: Archer Aviation raises $300M from Blackrock to expand defense sector focus

UPDATED 08:30 EST / FEBRUARY 11 2025 by Duncan Riley Electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. announced today that it has raised $300 million in new funding via an equity capital raise. The $300 million in funding, raised through a securities purchase agreement, came from Blackrock Inc. and other leading institutional investors. The funding will be used to strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow the company to accelerate the development of its hybrid aircraft platform, particularly for defense applications. While perhaps better known for its attempts to bring a flying taxi to market — which it is still pursuing — Archer has more recently shifted much of its focus to the defense sector. The company announced that it had signed a partnership with Anduril Industries Inc., a startup active in the defense sector, in December, alongside an announcement that it had raised $430 million to develop military aircraft. Archer’s main offering, be it one still under development, is an electric flying taxi dubbed Midnight. The aircraft offers vertical takeoff and landing and is powered by propellers that can cover up to 100 miles per trip at a top speed of 150 miles per hour. Notably, Archer signed a $142 million contract to deliver six Midnights to the U.S. Air Force in July 2023. The aircraft, which can carry approximately 1,000-pound payloads, offers the U.S. military a rapid response aircraft with effectiveness across a wide range of mission profiles, from personnel transport and logistics support to rescue operations and more. As part of its shift into defense, Archer also launched a dedicated unit, Archer Defense, to develop next-generation aircraft for defense applications. The first product from the division is planned to be a hybrid-propulsion vertical-take-off-and landing aircraft. The proceeds from the equity raise today are planned to be used for the development of next-generation aircraft manufacturing capabilities related to the new aircraft, including batteries and composites, with the remainder of the funding going for general corporate purposes. “The opportunity for advanced vertical lift aircraft across defense appears to be substantially larger than I originally expected,” said Archer founder and Chief Executive Adam Goldstein. “As a result, we are raising additional capital to help us invest in critical capabilities like composites and batteries to capture this opportunity and more.” THANK YOU Archer Aviation raises $300M from Blackrock to expand defense sector focus F5 targets AI-era IT challenges with ADC 3.0 reference architectures Cisco embeds security services in new line of programmable switches Amplitude integrates in-app surveys into its behavioral analysis platform Consortium led by Elon Musk makes $97.4B offer for OpenAI NXP buys Kinara for $307M to power AI workloads at the network edge Archer Aviation raises $300M from Blackrock to expand defense sector focus EMERGING TECH - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 1 MIN AGO F5 targets AI-era IT challenges with ADC 3.0 reference architectures AI - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 2 HOURS AGO Cisco embeds security services in new line of programmable switches INFRA - BY PAUL GILLIN . 5 HOURS AGO Amplitude integrates in-app surveys into its behavioral analysis platform AI - BY PAUL GILLIN . 8 HOURS AGO Consortium led by Elon Musk makes $97.4B offer for OpenAI AI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 14 HOURS AGO NXP buys Kinara for $307M to power AI workloads at the network edge AI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 14 HOURS AGO

Pushing for an end to the nearly three-year war with Russia, Trump discussed the conflict in an interview with broadcaster Fox News that aired yesterday. "They may make a deal, they may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,” he said. Trump also emphasised reaping a return on investment with US aid to Ukraine, suggesting a trade for Kyiv’s natural resources, such as rare minerals. (Excerpt) Read more at malaymail.com ...

Why do they have better math and science education systems and challenge the world with better products and production capabilities -- while we spend massive sums on worldwide military bases and invasions around the world they're not burdened with? Hell, we're $35 trillion in debt and growing, which can lead to all kinds of very unpleasant and dangerous outcomes -- including collapse. We attempt to save the world at the cost of our own country.

Title: Forbes Daily: Why Elon Musk And Tesla Could Have A Perception Problem
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2025/02/11/forbes-daily-why-elon-musk-and-tesla-could-have-a-perception-problem/

Full Content:
Today’s Forbes Daily newsletter covers El Segundo’s defense tech movement, Trump’s funding violation, Eric Adams update, Tesla’s negative perception, Musk’s bid to buy OpenAI and more. A key line item in Meta’s plan to invest $65 billion in AI this year is 2,250 acres of flat farmland in northeast Louisiana. There, the tech giant has begun work on a $10 billion data center in Richland Parish, the grandest of Meta’s 20 data centers worldwide. The center will need 2.23 gigawatts of 24/7 electricity, enough to power more than 2 million homes. That seems like a lot, but even if AI efficiency significantly improves, the energy-hogging technology will still need those server farms and some, thanks to a dynamic known as Jevons Paradox, which predicts that increased efficiency causes increased demand. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump Administration violated his order calling for a stop on spending freezes for a broad range of federal funds—the latest in a slew of legal actions against the president and cost-cutting czar Elon Musk. The judge ordered the Trump Administration to “immediately restore frozen funding” that Congress approved. A top Justice Department official asked federal prosecutors to drop their case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, multiple outlets reported Monday. Adams faces charges based on allegations that he received illegal donations from the Turkish government for his 2021 mayoral campaign. But in recent weeks, Adams has gotten publicly closer to President Donald Trump, meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago and attending the inauguration last month. Charlie Javice JPMorgan bought fintech startup Frank in 2021, but just a year later claimed its founder Charlie Javice invented millions of customers to close the deal. Now, the Forbes 30 Under 30 alum will stand trial in a New York federal court, and prosecutors have said the case will serve as a cautionary tale for early-stage CEOs and aspiring tech founders everywhere. As Tesla CEO Elon Musk grows further embedded in the White House, his electric vehicle company’s public perception is weighing on shares, according to polling by investment research firm Stifel. “The negative downturn in consumers’ perception of Elon Musk … potentially results in a headwind to sales,” a Stifel analyst wrote as the firm lowered its price target for the stock. Gold hit another record high Monday, extending a yearslong rally as President Donald Trump’s tariffs upend global trade policy and investors search for a safe haven. Gold is up 44% over the last year, by far the best-performer across a basket of 12 leading global asset classes over the period, according to the BlackRock Investment Institute. Abu Dhabi-based startup AppliedAI has raised one of the region’s largest early-stage venture funding rounds. Founder and CEO Arya Bolurfrushan’s pitch is that his AI, and human reviewers, can process complex medical billing records or insurance claims faster and more accurately than traditional outsourcing companies. Elon Musk and other investors made a $97.4 billion unsolicited bid to buy the nonprofit group that controls OpenAI, escalating a longstanding feud between Musk and OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman. Altman quickly rejected the offer, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, and mocked Musk on X. Elon Musk Democrats and student loan borrowers have raised concerns about reports suggesting billionaire Elon Musk and his DOGE associates may have access to sensitive student loan information at the Department of Education. Students at University of California schools filed a federal lawsuit against the Education Department arguing DOGE’s access to that data violates federal laws that maintain strict privacy regulations around sensitive financial aid information. But despite some posts circulating on TikTok, borrowers are unlikely to receive any financial relief if Musk’s access is ruled unlawful. Last week, Musk attacked a Wall Street Journal reporter on X after she revealed that a 25-year-old DOGE staffer had a history of racist and pro-eugenics online posts. But he confused the journalist with another from Politico, illustrating again how misinformation has run rampant on X under his ownership. Fox drew 126 million viewers for its broadcast of Super Bowl LIX on Sunday across platforms, according to multiple outlets, marking the most-watched matchup in Super Bowl history. The record-breaking viewership included audiences who tuned into Fox’s free streaming platform Tubi, which generated 13.6 million viewers. Photographs of some of those taken hostage by Hamas during the October 2023 attack. Hamas said it will delay the next planned release of Israeli hostages and accused Israel of not following the terms of its ceasefire agreement, a move that could potentially disrupt the ceasefire that paused the 15-month war in Gaza. Since the ceasefire went into effect on January 19, both Hamas and Israel have accused the other of violating its terms. After President Donald Trump signed an order placing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from all countries on Monday, the president of the European Commission issued a statement expressing regret at the decision. Ursula von der Leyen said the tariffs were “bad for business, worse for consumers,” and warned that the “unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered—they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures.” Two storms this week are expected to dump snow across the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, and major airlines are allowing some travelers to rebook their flights without a fee. Winter Storm Harlow will bring heavy snow over the Central Plains and Ohio Valley into the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service, followed by Winter Storm Iliana, which will develop Tuesday night in the Plains before spreading eastward. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday announced Fort Liberty in North Carolina will be renamed once again to Fort Bragg—the base’s previous name, which was changed in 2023 as a part of a Pentagon effort to rescind special honors given to officials linked to the Confederacy. However, Hegseth said the new name does not honor the Confederate general Braxton Bragg, but that it pays tribute to Private First Class Roland L. Bragg, a World War II veteran who was awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart for “exceptional courage during the Battle of the Bulge.” ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; PHOTOS BY ANDY RYAN, TAEK-SANG JEONG/GETTY IMAGES TOPLINE A new generation of startups in El Segundo, California, which has become the center of Silicon Valley’s defense tech movement, are leaning into a MAGA-fied, pro-Christian, mostly male-led vision of Silicon Valley. El Segundo’s founders, or self-identified ‘Gundo bros,’ are commanding the attention of some of the biggest venture capital outfits around. Lux Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Point72 Ventures are among those who have backed more than half a dozen founders from Discipulus Ventures’ first cohort alone. They’re pouring money into seed-stage companies Durin, which is developing autonomous drilling equipment for the mining industry; Rune Technologies, which is building software for military units to manage supply chains; and Vanguard Defense, which is building a data product for electronic warfare. Now, Discipulus has launched its own fund to back the second cohort of entrepreneurs that it plans to host for a weeklong event in coming months, raising $6 million from investors. It’s a small fund, but one with big Y Combinator-style ambitions that align with the Trump Administration’s priorities. For Augustus Doricko, one of several very online Gundo bros, this second Discipulus cohort is further evidence of a shift away from an era of investment in consumer apps and B2B solutions toward a new one that favors America’s national security interests and military prowess. WHY IT MATTERS It’s a so-called “vibe shift” that has inspired a MAGA-fied, pro-Christian vision of Silicon Valley tightly aligned with Elon Musk and the Trump Administration’s goals. The billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, for example, has backed a venture firm called New Founding, which is building a Christian real estate enclave, and hopes to be part of an effort to “forge new models and institutions that can shape the direction of Western civilization.” MORE The Tech Bros Powering Silicon Valley’s Military Fever Dream With Energy Drinks, God And Nicotine Early data from the IRS shows this tax season is off to a sluggish start, though the average tax refund is up. There’s been confusion among taxpayers amid recent changes at the IRS, including a hiring freeze: 13,177,000: The number of individual income tax returns the IRS has received in 2025, a 14% drop from early 2024 34.8%: The decline in web visits to IRS.gov from last year $1,928: The average refund per taxpayer as of January 31, an increase of 38% compared to this time last year Women’s fatigue is often underestimated due to gender bias, but unrecognized fatigue can lead to burnout, decreased productivity and long-term health issues. It’s critical that managers lead by example and prioritize incorporating short, regular breaks, and normalize taking mental health days. When companies prioritize rest, they can cultivate a culture that supports employee well-being and promotes productivity.

Title: Bitcoin’s MVRV score nears danger zone – Are short-term holders at risk?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoins-mvrv-score-nears-danger-zone-are-short-term-holders-at-risk/
Time Published: 2025-02-11T12:30:44Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s short-term MVRV shows investors are still in profit but a drop cannot be ruled out. The Short-Term Holder (STH) MVRV score for Bitcoin [BTC] recently dropped to 1.05. This crucial threshold indicated investors were just above the break-even point. The drop in the MVRV score suggested a potential cooling-off in buying enthusiasm among short-term holders. Despite this decline, the score remaining above 1 implied that the selling pressure may not be as intense yet. This could potentially prevent another drop. Source: Bitcoin Magazine PRO The STH’s approximate cost basis of around $92,000 serves as a critical support level for the market. BTC could drop to $92K, but if it maintains above this cost basis, it could indicate continued confidence among short-term investors, supporting stable prices or an uptrend. Conversely, if the MVRV score falls below 1, it could signify that most STHs are at a loss. This could lead to increased selling pressure as investors attempt to minimize losses. This scenario would put the $92,000 support level at risk of breaking down, possibly triggering a sharper decline in Bitcoin’s price. Further analysis shows that Bitcoin continued with its pattern of interacting frequently with liquidity zones. This pattern persisted, with BTC initially maintaining levels just above the long clusters before inevitably dipping to sweep the liquidity at $95,000. However, the recurrent tests of these liquidity pools suggested a bearish undertone as the price failed to sustain higher levels, especially near the $100,100 short liquidity zone. Source: Hyblock Capital This consistent pull towards lower liquidity zones, now below $94K, signals a potential setup for further drops, potentially down to the $92,000 level, crucial for short-term holders (STHs). If Bitcoin continues this pattern, the $92K level could soon play a pivotal role. Breaking below this level could lead to a shift in market sentiment, possibly causing short-term holders to capitulate, adding downward pressure on the price. Conversely, a successful defense of this level might reinforce confidence, possibly stabilizing or driving up prices as accumulation occurs at these lower levels. Lastly, this drop is supported by the fact that the prices declined despite significant purchases by Michael Saylor’s, MicroStrategy, and BlackRock, alongside the movement of 14,000 dormant Bitcoins. These large transactions might have signaled a potential increase in supply, even if not immediately sold, causing uncertainty and thus a price drop. Source: CryptoQuant Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 If these Bitcoins are seen as long-term holds, not sell-offs, it might suggest less selling pressure. This could potentially stabilize or boost the price. Future price moves hinge on whether these Bitcoins stay off exchanges. This could indicate a bullish outlook if viewed as a store of value.

Title: XYZVerse, Ondo, Solana & More — Best Crypto Buys in the February 2025 Dip
URL: https://zycrypto.com/xyzverse-ondo-solana-more-best-crypto-buys-in-the-february-2025-dip/

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Digital currencies experienced an unanticipated decline in February 2025, yet there are hidden prospects. As many pull back, smart eyes focus on a few cryptocurrencies that exhibit potential and resilience. This article reveals top choices like XYZVerse, Ondo, and Solana. Find out how these tokens could produce remarkable gains amid the market decline and defy the trend. XYZ is your unique VIP pass to a revolution driven by memes and sports. Consider it the XYZVerse ecosystem’s MVP, where cryptocurrency aficionados can profit greatly from the rising demand for meme currencies. However, every revolution requires a hero—someone prepared to overcome all obstacles and elevate the $XYZ token to the top. That hero is XYZepe, the masked warrior, the steadfast $XYZ holding, the genuine believer, whose goal is to propel XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap. The goal is to demonstrate that underdogs can achieve greatness. The XYZVerse ecosystem is expected to grow as millions more sports lovers prepare to play, and your rewards will be incredible! Here is an example of a highlight reel moment: XYZVerse has been named the Best NEW Meme Project, highlighting its enormous potential in the meme coin space. The indisputable leaders in the cryptocurrency space are meme coins, and XYZ is poised to overtake them. With a current price of $0.002, $XYZ is still a cheap cryptocurrency gem that could increase to $0.1 during the last presale phase. Victory, however, requires commitment, strategy, and a fighter prepared to battle to the end. XYZepe is taking $XYZ to a legendary level with the community’s support, even if he knows the challenge ahead. Thanks to its fully vetted workforce, rock-solid protection in the form of audited smart contracts, and impending listings on key CEX and DEX platforms, XYZ is already ahead of the game. Here, the first mover advantage is crucial; if you enter the market before the crowds do, you stand to gain far larger profits! In the realm of cryptocurrencies, Cardano is attracting attention. This blockchain infrastructure is adaptable and long-lasting, designed for smart contracts. This implies it contributes to developing new cryptocurrency tokens, games, and defi apps. ADA, its native coin, is a formidable rival to Ethereum’s ETH. Users can stake their ADA on the network, store value, and make payments. Cardano’s green approach is what sets it apart. It uses Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake mechanism far more energy-efficient than other people’s conventional proof-of-work models. Cardano’s technology is cutting-edge. It is divided into two layers: one for smart contracts and one for transactions. It can process up to a million transactions per second because of this split. Cardano launched native tokens in March 2021, enabling safe and inexpensive smart contract interactions. This establishes Cardano as a pioneer in scalability and efficiency. ADA is appealing in the present market cycle, particularly for consumers seeking sustainable solutions. Despite the established status of coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Cardano may have an advantage in the ever-changing cryptocurrency market due to its emphasis on sustainability and scalability. Solana is turning heads in the blockchain arena, focusing on speed and scalability. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana offers a foundation for stand-out decentralized applications. Its unique architecture delivers faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. SOL isn’t just a token; it powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. The potential of SOL is tied to the impressive capabilities of the Solana platform. Solana doesn’t rely on sharding or second-layer solutions to scale, unlike some networks. This design choice attracts developers seeking a high-capacity network that can handle bustling products and services. SOL looks increasingly attractive in the current market cycle, where scalability and transaction speed are crucial. While the crypto market is crowded, SOL’s strong technology and ambitious approach make it a standout option among digital currencies. Avalanche is a brand-new, quick, and environmentally friendly blockchain technology. It can complete transactions in less than two seconds and process up to 4,500 transactions per second. This implies that money can be sent and received almost instantly. Additionally, users can design their own subnets—customizable networks—with Avalanche. It employs a unique approach to transaction agreement, combining traditional and modern techniques for increased speed and security. The platform’s three primary components—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—cooperate to handle smart contracts and transactions. The token that drives Avalanche is called AVAX. It facilitates the operation of subnets, pays for transactions, and stakes the network to keep it secure. Speed and minimal fees are crucial in the current market, and Avalanche satisfies these requirements. AVAX enables quick, affordable, and environmentally friendly transactions compared to other cryptocurrencies—a significant factor as more people become concerned about the environment. Developers and companies seeking adaptable solutions may be drawn to Avalanche’s bespoke token and blockchain creation capabilities. Platforms like Avalanche that prioritize speed, scalability, and sustainability may become increasingly significant as the cryptocurrency market develops. Ondo Finance is making waves by blending the reliability of tradfi with the efficiency of blockchain technology. It does this by tokenizing stable, income-generating assets like US Treasuries. This means more people can access high-quality products that were once out of reach. Ondo has two main parts: an asset management arm that creates these tokenized products and a technology arm that builds DeFi protocols to make them work better and reach more people. In a market where trust and security are significant concerns, Ondo stands out by partnering with well-known firms like BlackRock and using Coinbase for custody. It sets high standards for transparency and closely follows legal rules. One of its notable products, USDY, offers stablecoin accessibility with the added yield benefit from US Treasuries and bank deposits. This approach could appeal to those looking for regulated and transparent options in the crypto space. As the market evolves, Ondo’s focus on real-world assets and compliance might make it an interesting player compared to other more volatile coins. ADA, SOL, AVAX, and ONDO are solid choices, but XYZVerse stands out. As the first all-sport meme coin, it aims for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans in crypto. You can find more information about XYZVerse (XYZ) here: https://xyzverse.io/ Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article, and views in it do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, ZyCrypto.

Title: Michelin-starred restaurants in Ireland, 2025: The complete guide
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/restaurants/2025/02/11/michelin-starred-restaurants-in-ireland-2025-the-complete-guide/
Time Published: 2025-02-11T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
The Michelin Guide says: “Mickael Viljanen’s basement restaurant is a stylish, elegant spot decorated with eye-catching art. Superb service complements cooking that focuses on prime luxury ingredients – like Donegal lobster or Limousin sweetbreads – and sees classic French techniques combined with subtle modern touches. Mickael’s creativity and personality shine through in perfectly balanced, immaculately executed dishes with sublime natural flavours and beautiful presentation. The Irish Coffee is made in the diningroom and is, like everything else, an experience to remember.” chapteronerestaurant.com The Michelin Guide says: “Chef Ahmet Dede’s warm, inviting restaurant in this West Cork coastal village is a masterful marriage between his Irish surroundings and his Turkish heritage. Superb local produce is the bedrock of the cooking, enhanced by skilful, judicious spicing which delivers multiple layers of authentic Turkish flavours while never overpowering the core ingredients – as with a refined take on street food ‘îçli köfte’. The charismatic Ahmet and his mostly Turkish brigade deliver their dishes with pride, while co-owner Maria runs the service with a friendly charm.” customshousebaltimore.com The Michelin Guide says: “There’s a slightly magical feel to this stylish, cosy restaurant. With just a handful of tables, it makes for a personal dining experience, with Damien Grey and his small team offering a genuinely warm welcome and explaining the dishes personally. The surprise tasting menu showcases bold, original dishes centred around the five tastes – salty, savoury, sweet, bitter and sour – which come together in perfect harmony. First-class ingredients are present throughout, treated with precision and strong modern technique by the chefs. Excellent wine pairings further enhance the experience.” liathrestaurant.com The Michelin Guide says: “This iconic restaurant has been thriving since 1981, thanks to both the eponymous chef and the exceptional team he has around him. It sits hidden away within a Georgian town house and oozes sumptuousness and sophistication thanks to features such as a gilt barrel ceiling and handcrafted marquetry. The accomplished cooking isn’t to be upstaged, however: it is French at heart yet has a restrained modernity and showcases some bold yet superbly balanced flavours. The Irish ingredients are certainly luxurious and the baba flambé with your choice of rum provides an inviting, classical way to finish.” restaurantpatrickguilbaud.ie The Michelin Guide says: “In the Manor House of this breathtaking resort, you’ll be warmly welcomed by the kitchen team before enjoying a procession of original and elaborate snacks which more than hint at the quality of the surprise menu in store. The striking and sophisticated dishes showcase the best of the local larder alongside more international flavours which highlight the chef’s time and travels in Asia; the sauces are superlative. Dishes are often finished off at your table in the elegant diningroom. This is an experience to remember.” terre.ie [ Terre restaurant review: One of the best – and most expensive – meals I’ve ever eatenOpens in new window ] The Michelin Guide says: “It takes some doing for a restaurant to stand out when it’s in a hotel as beautiful as this. Ballyfin Demesne is a spectacular, lovingly restored Regency-era manor house that screams luxury at every turn. The opulence continues into the diningroom, where the chefs serve fittingly impressive dishes. Broths, purées and sauces are a real highlight and underline the technical skill of the kitchen team, be it a rich, glossy reduction or a roasted onion consommé with bags of flavour. Charming and attentive service completes the rather special picture.” ballyfin.com The Michelin Guide says: “Lignum is Latin for ‘wood’ and, as such, it’s the ancient method of cooking over an open flame which takes centre stage at this immensely likeable restaurant. It’s housed in a modern barn conversion which has a distinctly Scandic vibe, from the large windows and minimalist furnishings to the roaring fire and throws on the chairs. The wood-fired cooking lends a delicious smoky dimension to the creative dishes, which – informed by the chef’s heritage – blend ingredients from Ireland (such as sweet lobster tail) and Italy (Amalfi lemon). It all comes in the form of a surprise tasting menu.” lignum.ie The Michelin Guide says: “We all need a little luxury in our lives and this beautiful restaurant in the heart of the impressive Carton House mansion ticks all the boxes. The breathtaking room features a high curved ceiling, Greek Corinthian columns, ornate plaster cornicing and sweeping banquettes, while the menu matches it for opulence with an abundance of first-rate produce, be it Union Hall crab or Achill lamb. The cooking is rooted in the chefs’ strong classical technique, but some wildcard flavour combinations work wonders thanks to their fine judgment.” cartonhouse.com The Michelin Guide says: “The high ceilings and original plasterwork of this restored landmark building contribute to the appeal of the contemporary restaurant within. The well-travelled, Australian-born chef prepares a surprise menu and, while there are multiple global techniques and influences at play, the focus of the dishes remains firmly on the top-notch main ingredients. There are seats at the counter for those wanting to see how the beautifully composed dishes are created, and the wine pairings are a great way to go.” dolierstreetrestaurant.com [ D’Olier Street review: This new restaurant has a great team. They should stop being cautious, let rip and enjoy the rideOpens in new window ] The Michelin Guide says: “A vaulted ceiling and flagstone floors combine with sumptuous, colourful furnishings at this striking restaurant that provides a fair amount of both character and luxury. It helps, of course, that it’s located in the cellars of Cashel Palace, a magnificent Palladian manor house which was once home to the Archbishops of Cashel. Desserts are a highlight among cooking that keeps a focus on each central ingredient, which is then skilfully enhanced with complementary flavours. Service comes from an impeccable team, who work with the utmost pride.” cashelpalacehotel.ie Michelin Guide says: “A charming 200-year-old cottage houses this rural restaurant that counts the Atlantic Ocean as its neighbour. The lovely terrace allows you to enjoy a spectacular sunset over drinks, before moving inside to the characterful interior with stone floors, cookery books and rustic wooden tables. Wonderful Irish produce – such as superbly fresh, beautifully roasted Aran monkfish – is used in equally impressive dishes that are clean and modern, with no unnecessary frills.” homesteadcottagedoolin.com [ Homestead Cottage review: An incredibly beautiful new restaurant from a talented chefOpens in new window ] The Michelin Guide says: “Aniar means ‘from the west’ and indeed the local area is a key inspiration for both the ‘back-to-nature’ cooking and the chic, moody décor here. The micro-seasonal menus are finalised based on the day’s locally sourced produce, which is showcased in pure, delicate and well-balanced dishes such as exceptional raw beef dressed with top-notch nasturtium oil. The cooking cleverly blends traditional and modern techniques, while contrasts in texture, temperature and acidity are also a feature. Many courses are served by the chefs themselves, some with accompanying poems.” aniarrestaurant.ie The Michelin Guide says: “This vibrant little restaurant with a lively spirit boasts an open kitchen, from which you’ll find the chefs engaging with guests and delivering some of the dishes themselves. The modern set menu features top class Irish produce at the height of season and each main ingredient is given the space to shine. Dishes are stripped-back, flavours are bold and servings are generous: this is cooking that comes from the heart. Start with an aperitif while you enjoy the delicate snacks.” bastible.com [ Bastible review: Want to try a Michelin star restaurant in Ireland? This is the place to startOpens in new window ] The Michelin Guide says: “Set in the very centre of town, Bastion is a contemporary restaurant owned and run by a talented couple: Paul McDonald cooks, while his wife Helen looks after the service. A large bar splits the room in two and twinkling candles add a welcoming touch. Paul is Scottish born but his cooking has a strong Irish base. Natural flavours are kept to the fore and local seafood is a highlight. The skilfully prepared, exacting dishes take on a modern style and often exhibit a playful, innovative element, while at the same time showing depth in their flavours and textures.” bastionkinsale.com The Michelin Guide says: “This long-standing restaurant is owned and run by experienced chef Garrett Byrne – who really knows his craft – along with his partner, Brid Hannon, who provides relaxed, friendly service. The modern interior is sleek, with curved banquettes, spot-lit dark wood tables and striking local artwork hanging on the walls. Top quality Irish ingredients are showcased in richly flavoured, classic dishes: you won’t find foams or smears on your plate here – just confidently cooked, skilfully balanced dishes, with exemplary plating, saucing and seasoning.” campagne.ie The Michelin Guide says: “There’s a laid-back feel to this sweet, intimate restaurant where the shelves are laden with wine, mead and all manner of jars full of produce marinating, curing or fermenting. Skeaghanore duck is among the County Cork produce championed on the constantly evolving tasting menu, where skilfully prepared dishes show a great understanding of textures and tastes, and are pleasingly understated in their pure, natural flavours. Smaller growers are present in the wine pairings, while they make their own juices and cordials for the non-alcoholic option.” restaurantchestnutwestcork.ie The Michelin Guide says: “Set in a prime spot on the second floor of The Fitzwilliam Hotel, overlooking St Stephen’s Green, is this chic, elegant restaurant with subtle 1930s overtones. Pink and green hues and pretty flower arrangements bring a certain softness to the surroundings; in contrast, Andy McFadden’s cooking is characterised by boldness – both in its flavours and textures – and his experience shines through in creative, modern dishes which are skilfully prepared and artfully presented.” gloversalley.com The Michelin Guide says: “Located in the Cliff House Hotel – a modern, glass-fronted building which, unsurprisingly, hugs the cliffside – this restaurant benefits from a stunning view across Ardmore Bay. Fortunately, the cooking is a match for its surroundings, taking exceptional Irish produce and building on it using skilled technique and a smattering of global influences. Terrific lobster caught in Ardmore Bay, for example, might come with rogan josh sauce and garlic naan for a distinctly Indian touch. Throughout the cooking, the dishes are attractively presented without being showy.” cliffhousehotel.ie The Michelin Guide says: “The 1,500-acre Mount Juliet Estate, now housing an impressive country house hotel, is one of the best examples of Georgian architecture in Ireland; it still boasts its original stuccowork and hand-carved marble fireplaces, and its luxurious, high-ceilinged restaurant comes with all the comfort and elegance one would expect. John Kelly’s boldly flavoured, visually impressive dishes are skilfully prepared, underpinned by ingredients from the estate, the county and the coast. The excellent desserts – such as a beautiful hazelnut and chocolate confection – provide a memorable finish.” mountjuliet.ie The Michelin Guide says: “Hidden away in the Cathedral Quarter is this urban, industrial-style restaurant named after a 200-year-old secret society. It’s a simply furnished place, run with palpable enthusiasm by a young team. Chef Gareth McCaughey’s philosophy is to source top ingredients, prepare them well and not overcomplicate things, as proven by the surprise tasting menu spotlighting superb Irish produce like Kilkeel scallops and Wicklow venison. The wine list offers an interesting selection of low-intervention, natural, organic and biodynamic wines, all available by the glass.” themuddlersclubbelfast.com The Michelin Guide says: “This restaurant inside the impressive Adare Manor has all the grandeur you would expect, with wood-panelled walls, lavish chandeliers and a glass-enclosed terrace with views over the 850 acre grounds. The assured, refreshingly understated cooking champions top Irish ingredients, with dishes comprising just 3 or 4 components and allowing each one the room to make an impression. Combinations are refined and well-balanced, and great attention is given to the finer details. The wine list is a labour of love and offers a superb range by the glass.” adaremanor.com The Michelin Guide says: “From the terrific buzz in the air to each element of the carefully constructed tasting menu, dining at this understated restaurant is such a pleasant experience. The starting point for the cooking is always the ingredients, with only the very best selected – and in some cases grown – by the kitchen team. This top-notch produce is elevated by the refined, expertly balanced accompaniments – an approach which is clear in dishes like superb Orkney scallop paired with a curry oil that is beautifully judged in both aroma and flavour.” oxbelfast.com The Michelin Guide says: “You’ll find charming chef-owner Keelan Higgs working calmly in the open kitchen of this tiny restaurant. The long, narrow room has a funky style and the relaxed atmosphere is helped along by brother Aaron and the laid-back service team. Highly original yet unfussy dishes burst with freshness and flavour, and many are cooked over the open fire; Keelan loves this concept, as no two dishes will ever be exactly the same. The 6 course ‘Chef’s Choice’ menu is divided into Snacks, Cold, Warm, Pasta, Mains and Finish, and the monthly changing, mostly organic wine list is passionately compiled.” varietyjones.ie © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Climate reporting presents brands with an opportunity – if it’s done right
URL: https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2025/02/11/climate-reporting-presents-brands-with-opportunity-if-it-s-done-right
Time Published: 2025-02-11T07:00:00Z

Advertisement The Drum Network article This content is produced by The Drum Network, a paid-for membership club for CEOs and their agencies who want to share their expertise and grow their business. February 11, 2025 | 8 min read Listen to article 4 min Climate Transition Plans will become crucial for comms teams thanks to the EU’s directive on ESG, says Olly Lawder at Revolt. See these plans as an opportunity to align company values and let the world – and your investors – know about the great work you do. Climate Transition Plans (CTPs) allow companies to creatively communicate their roadmap to net zero, says Lawder / Explore with Joshua via Unsplash The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) has raised the bar on Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting. It’s estimated that 50,000 companies with a presence in the EU will have to comply with the directive, which requires companies to share information on their monitoring of many ESG issues. The directive is purposefully technical, and this complexity can create a hurdle for communication and engagement. But an opportunity does exist in the shape of the Climate Transition Plan (CTP). The CTP is a mandatory part of the reporting and offers companies an opportunity to creatively communicate their roadmap to net zero. And while marketers may not be creating CTPs, they will certainly be communicating them. The CTP translates sometimes intangible and distant net zero goals into a credible, granular, and powerful business strategy to show to stakeholders. As a mandatory part of CSRD, businesses shouldn’t view the CTP as simply a compliance exercise but as an opportunity to stand out and deliver. Knowing that businesses will be heavily focused on CTPs this year with CSRD coming into force, Revolt conducted quantitative research with over 400 marketing and PR leaders in the US who work at companies with offices in the EU. The aim was to find out just how much marketers know about the directive and whether they will embrace the creative opportunities that CTPs present in their marketing and communications. Reassuringly, we found that nearly 96% of marketeers are aware of CTPs. Given the importance and ramifications of CSRD, we were not surprised by this. However, 30% report that they are either unaware if their company has a CTP or that their company is not developing one. This is a worryingly high percentage, and clearly more needs to be done to ensure that all companies are aware of their climate transition responsibilities. The good news is that all respondents agree – either strongly or somewhat – that CTPs represent good comms opportunities. But when asked about the extent of communications planning around CTPs for the next 12 months, only a third of respondents said they have a specific plan for communicating transition plans. Additionally, 65% reported that CTP communication was not in the broader communications plan, and 71% said they hadn’t budgeted for CTP communications. So, while there is a good understanding of the marketing opportunity with CTPs, there is a real gap in terms of actually making it happen. When we addressed this with respondents, we found a variety of reasons for the slow or lacking movement in communicating CTPs. Concern about accidentally greenwashing is the number one barrier to creatively engaging on climate transition plans. This was followed by a perceived difficulty in engaging audiences in what some consider a ‘depressing topic,’ as well as audiences lacking interest in the subject matter. Other reasons included the complexity of the issues and marketers feeling out of their comfort zone with the topic. However, these barriers can and should be overcome. I believe that there are three things marketers and corporate affairs teams should keep in mind to ensure effective communication of transition plans. Advertisement Climate change isn’t a future concern; it’s already upon us – and investors are looking to invest in businesses that build resilience to climate risks and are ready to take on climate opportunities. Almost 99% of leading global insurance companies have now set a low-carbon transition objective within their investment portfolios, according to Blackrock. While CTPs existed before CSRD, they lacked granularity. The new directive will create a groundswell of information that investors will look at, including the disclosure of climate-related risks, transition-related opportunities, investment plans for low-carbon technologies, impacts on staff, scenario-planning, and financial allocation for activity. The CTP is an opportunity to translate your net-zero strategy into a powerful investment story – a story of resilience, adaptability, and competitive advantage that only your business can offer investors. It forms part of an ongoing dialogue and is a way to update investors on your transition progress. Advertisement Every stakeholder plays a role in delivering on your CTP, but none is as important as your employees. Employees are potential champions and crucial implementers of your transition strategies. Employees play a role across all three principles of the CTP – Ambition, Action, and Accountability – and they act as change agents who can ensure the CTP does not just live in a document. Showcasing how individual roles directly contribute to broader goals creates a compelling narrative that will help retain talent who see sustainability as a personal mission rather than a corporate imperative. To transition successfully, businesses will need people with the right skill sets and CTP comms that hero employees – and show that measurable impact can help to attract future talent who value sustainability. Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team. Stay up to date with a curated digest of the most important marketing stories and expert insights from our global team. Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum. For effective transition planning, businesses must engage their value chain because, in most cases, Scope 3 emissions (all indirect emissions relating to business activity, excluding utilities) represent the largest portion of a business’s carbon footprint. So, while CTPs are individual to each business, they can only be achieved with systemic change across suppliers and geographies. It’s important that CTPs deliver and communicate a detailed and quantifiable picture of the value chain, including its most opaque areas. View the CTP not as a supplier compliance checklist but rather a communication device to highlight a shared purpose between your business and your value chain. Move toward storytelling that demonstrates genuine partnership and success stories, collaborative decarbonization efforts, and, in turn, acts as a confidence-builder for other stakeholders too, including investors. CTPs will become a critical element of the comms suite around reporting going forward, and with the first CSRD disclosures being made in 2025, the time to engage is now. Plans will be scrutinized, so get ready to be vocal and to defend and uphold them, but do not see your comms solely as a form of defense. Instead, engaging and ambitious comms are your opportunity to inspire stakeholders, catalyze investment and innovation, and ensure your plans progress into reality. Revolt The world is on fire. There’s no time to watch from the sidelines. The most successful brands of tomorrow will be the ones that take a stand today. It’s time...

Title: Why is the United States economy so much stronger than Europe’s?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/02/11/why-is-the-united-states-economy-so-much-stronger-than-europes/
Time Published: 2025-02-11T06:00:23Z

Forget about Donald Trump for a moment and consider why the US economy is so much stronger than Europe’s. Most agencies earmark growth of 2.5-3 per cent for the US economy this year against 1 per cent in Europe. And that 1 per cent looks shaky. It may also be revised down if US tariffs against the EU materialise. [ Trump tariffs threaten Ireland’s service economy too ] Without a significant boost in investment – particularly in infrastructure and green technologies – Europe risks falling further behind the US and the global economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is warning. There are several reasons for Europe’s flagging performance and the US’s better-than-expected one. Europe has been more impacted by the energy crisis for one (higher energy costs have dented manufacturing output in Europe’s largest economy Germany, which has also been impacted by weaker Chinese demand). The prospect of tax cuts and less regulation in the US appears to be having an equal and opposite effect on the other side of Atlantic. But these potentially short-term trends aside, there is an endemic productivity gap between the US and Europe. Productivity is one of those glaze-over economic phenomena, but it underpins performance and explains better than any other the reason why the US leads much of the world when it comes to technology. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, gave perhaps the most cogent explanation for the productivity gap between the US and Europe. “The US is marching ahead with high productivity because capital markets allocate money to dynamic firms ... because technology turns into business investment and grows into companies fast and because the US has an abundance of cheap energy,” she said. Her point was echoed by Larry Fink, chief executive of investment giant BlackRock. “Any entrepreneur, any small company, any large company can find capital and that foundation of capital – raising allows much more entrepreneurialism, much more creativity,” he said. The strength of the US’s capital markets allows the US to modify, rebuild itself, change direction faster than any other economy, he said.

Title: Bitcoin And Politics Merge: Florida Moves Toward State Crypto Investment

The American state of Florida could be one of the pioneering local governments that allows a percentage of its state funds for cryptocurrency investments, particularly Bitcoin. Florida Senator Joe Gruters has filed a bill that would permit the US state to use 10% of its funds to buy Bitcoin. This political backing could entice other American states to build their own cryptocurrency investments. My state of Florida introduces a Bitcoin investment bill! 💪 If passed Florida’s CFO may allocate up to 10% of public funds to invest in $BTC or other digital assets. Thank you Senator Joe Gruters 🫡 pic.twitter.com/nF0SoTbT96 — Lucidvein (@Lucidvein) February 8, 2025 Gruters introduced a legislative measure that would allow Florida to invest in Bitcoin using state funds to combat inflation. The senator said that Senate Bill 550 proposed to permit Florida’s chief financial officer to use up to 10% of its funds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The bill aims to incorporate Bitcoin into state financial planning in the US, a legislative action that could reshape state authorities’ investment funds strategy and lead to other states adopting crypto. Gruters eyes that the proposed bill would help financial planners of Florida to hedge against inflation. “Inflation has eroded the purchasing power of assets held in state funds managed by the Chief Financial Officer, and this erosion diminishes the value of the state’s reserves, affecting the financial stability and economic security of this state, its taxpayers, and its residents,” Gruters said. The senator explained in the bill that inflation has “eroded the purchasing power of assets” managed by the state’s chief financial officer, adding that the state is responsible for safeguarding “Florida’s financial resources” against inflation and economic uncertainties. Hence, the American senator explained that Florida should have access to tools like Bitcoin to protect state funds from inflation. Once Gruter’s proposed legislation was enacted, it would be beneficial to the state in several ways. Analysts said that investing in Bitcoin would diversify Florida’s state assets, adding that the state would incorporate in its portfolio an asset that historically provides high returns but with significant volatility. Market observers added that this crypto legislation would help turn Florida into a blockchain hub that promotes cryptocurrency innovation, further establishing Florida as a crypto-friendly state. Florida might become the model state for adopting Bitcoin in state financial planning, making BTC adoption in government finance a reality. Crypto analysts also see that Florida’s success could encourage other states to follow its lead and start incorporating digital assets into their financial systems.

Title: A Trump executive order reportedly has ended a racial discrimination probe at Tesla

BREAKING: Tulsi Gabbard confirmed as director of national intelligence, overcoming concerns about her foreign policy views Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows By Ja'han Jones Policy proposals from the new administration — and the seemingly unmatched power granted to Elon Musk and his allies — sure do suggest that Donald Trump is trying to serve his megarich benefactor more than nearly anyone else. Whether it’s punishing South Africa for attempting to stem the impact of apartheid racism or giving bigoted white men unfettered access to the upper echelon of the U.S. government, it seems Trump and his allies are ensuring that Musk gets ample returns on the multimillion-dollar investment he made in Trump’s campaign. And the apparent benefits to Musk could also include the suspension of a federal probe into allegations of racial discrimination at his company Tesla. An executive order Trump signed Jan. 21 as part of his crusade against diversity required the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which is part of the Department of Labor and investigates discrimination allegations, to immediately halt “[p]romoting ‘diversity’” and “[h]olding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for taking ‘affirmative action.’” According to The San Francisco Standard, the order essentially required the compliance office to stop an audit of Tesla over allegations of discrimination at one of its automobile factories. The Standard reported: The Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs enforced equal employment laws for federal contractors. The office’s employees now have little to do besides notifying companies that they will no longer be audited for potential discrimination — and, in some cases, that they won’t have to pay outstanding fines. The Standard reported that Tesla was recently notified that the discrimination probe had been halted. Other large corporations were made aware of dropped investigations into their workplaces, too: The OFCCP sent Tesla a letter last week stating that its review had stopped. “We had to mail the companies we audit to tell them they no longer have to comply with our rules or regulations,” said Aliyah Levin, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2391, which represents 1,200 federal workers in San Francisco and eight Western states. Tesla’s letter was one among dozens in California alone, according to Levin. OFCCP investigators were set to review the practices of more than 2,000 U.S. companies this year, including 211 in California, according to federal data that is no longer online. Investigations have been canceled at the San Francisco offices of Google, Meta, Blackrock, Sony, and PG&E, among others. According to The Standard, a federal lawsuit against Tesla from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is ongoing. When the lawsuit was announced in 2023, the EEOC said: “Black employees regularly encountered graffiti, including variations of the N-word, swastikas, threats, and nooses, on desks and other equipment, in bathroom stalls, within elevators, and even on new vehicles rolling off the production line.” The EEOC also said that “those who raised objections to racial hostility suffered various forms of retaliation, including terminations, changes in job duties, transfers, and other adverse employment actions.” Tesla has called the allegations “a false narrative that ignores Tesla’s track record of equal employment opportunity.” It’s unclear how the lawsuit progresses from here. Trump’s acting EEOC chair, Andrea Lucas, has already gotten to work pursuing his priorities of rolling back protections for transgender and nonbinary people. How she’ll approach a discrimination suit against one of Trump’s closest allies remains an open question. Ja’han Jones is The ReidOut Blog writer.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against other best widow and orphan stocks to invest in. Investing in the stock market can be a prudent strategy for widows and orphans seeking financial stability and growth. Widow-and-orphan stocks are typically associated with established companies in sectors like utilities and consumer staples. These companies often provide consistent dividend payments, offering a reliable income stream. This stability is particularly valuable during economic downturns, as these stocks tend to exhibit lower volatility compared to high-growth equities. Investing in stable, dividend-paying stocks can aid in preserving and growing wealth over time. The combination of regular dividend income and potential capital appreciation makes these stocks suitable for individuals aiming for sustainable financial growth without excessive risk exposure.

A study published in July 2024 highlights the critical role of financial literacy in investment decisions and stock market participation. The research indicates that increased financial knowledge enhances investment confidence and decision-making, underscoring the importance of targeted financial education programs to empower individuals to participate effectively in the stock market. Recent trends show that women, particularly baby boomers, are increasingly controlling significant amounts of wealth. As of January 2025, women over 60 control $8 trillion of liquid wealth assets. This shift underscores the importance of financial literacy and proactive investment strategies among women to ensure long-term financial security.

As per the fourth quarter of 2024 result, the company reported earnings of $3.2 billion ($1.84 per share – diluted) compared with $2.3 billion ($1.22 per share – diluted) in the fourth quarter of the previous year. In January, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) announced that its 50% owned affiliate, Tengizchevroil, has started oil production at its Future Growth Project (FGP) located at the Tengiz oil field in Kazakhstan. FGP is the third processing plant in operation at the Tengiz oil field, which expands sour gas injection capability and is expected to ramp up output to one million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Overall, CVX ranks 6th on our list of best widow and orphan stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than CVX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Gold Hits New Record: Trump's Tariffs, Inflation Fears Drive Safe Haven Surge
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/02/10/gold-hits-new-record-trumps-tariffs-inflation-fears-drive-safe-haven-surge/

Gold prices rose to yet another record high Monday, extending a yearslong rally for the precious metal accelerated in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s tariffs upend global trade policy, and investors and central banks search for safety in the evolving global economy. Gold is on a remarkable hot streak. Spot gold rose to as high as $2,938 per troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rising as much as 1.7%. Monday’s rally tied to Trump’s imposition of a blanket 25% tariff on all aluminum and tariff imports, the latest in a scorching stretch for gold. Up 44% over the last year, gold has been by far the best-performer across a basket of 12 leading global asset classes over the period, according to the BlackRock Investment Institute, most notably trouncing the 22% return for the S&P 500 over the last year, including reinvested dividends. And Wall Street largely believes the gains will continue: JPMorgan Chase maintains a $2.950 end-of-2025 price target for gold, Goldman Sachs holds a $3,000 target by the middle of 2026 and Citigroup has a $3,000 target by the end of this year. Gold breaking $3,000, which would only require a less than 3% rally from Monday’s prices, would be the latest milestone for a roaring 2020s for gold, which only crossed $1,000 for the first time during 2008’s great financial crisis and $2,000 for the first time during 2020’s COVID-19 pandemic. It’s rare for gold to have such a strong performance during a time of economic strength globally, especially in the U.S., which has many of the hallmarks of an economy far from recession with a resilient labor market, stock market highs and relatively stable inflation. Though long-held concerns about inflation and geopolitical tensions such as the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and diminished interest rate cut prospects weigh on the minds of gold investors, experts mostly tie the recent gold rally to Trump’s tariffs. Gold “clearly would benefit from universal tariffs,” according to JPMorgan’s head of cross asset strategy Fabio Bassi, while Goldman commodities strategist Lina Thomas wrote of gold’s “potentially persistent boost from elevated US policy uncertainty.” And there’s a continued undercurrent of historic gold purchasing from central banks globally, as those institutions bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold in 2024, the third consecutive year of at least 1,000 tonnes in central bank purchases after never crossing that mark prior to 2022, according to the World Gold Council. The People's Bank of China is the most notable buyer, accounting for 43% of all central bank gold purchases in November, according to Goldman. Central banks typically buy gold to safeguard against inflation or other deterioration of their home currencies. Gold has unexpectedly become one of the hottest financial assets on the market despite being one of the oldest investments in human history. Gold and other commodities do not offer the same potential for dividends or other returned shareholder value like stocks or guaranteed annual interest payments like bonds, making the metal’s rise more stark. Gold and bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency thought by some to be a new-school hedge against economic uncertainty, have gone on divergent paths since Trump announced the 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods and a 10% additional tariffs on Chinese imports (the Canadian and Mexican levies were later delayed). Gold prices are up 2% since Trump signed the tariff executive order Feb. 1, while bitcoin is down 6%. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Industry Expert Sees A ‘Cyclical Valhalla’ Sending Bitcoin’s Price To $700,000 While Solana Targets $1,800

Bill Barhydt, the CEO of crypto investment firm Abra Global, recently took to the X social media platform (aka Twitter) to stir the BTC community with a bold Bitcoin price prediction. Barhydt proposed that the price of Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto by market cap, could climb all the way to $700,000 per coin during this market cycle due to an incoming gigantic liquidity injection. He foresees a “cyclical Valhalla” to begin in Q1. Abra founder Bill Barhydt believes that BTC price at a whopping $350,000 is now the “base case” scenario. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading hands at $97,466, representing a 1.2% gain in the last 24 hours. Despite having lost 2.8% of its value over the last seven days, Barhydt thinks the only way is up for the world’s flagship cryptocurrency. Besides predicting that Bitcoin is on pace to hit $700K, the BTC veteran also shared ambitious targets for Ethereum and Solana’s SOL. Specifically, he argues that ETH and SOL could reach $8,000 and $900, respectively, in a base case. “High end of the range is ~2x these values,” Barhydt added. The rationale for Abra CEO’s bullish forecast is the new U.S. government under pro-crypto president Donald Trump. “My model is simple. This administration wants interest rates much lower, and they’ll do whatever they have to achieve that,” he explained. “They also need to refinance over $7T in debt. Tax cuts are coming. All of this equates to a massive liquidity injection whether via QE or some other means.” Barhydt was referring to quantitative easing (QE) — increasing the money supply — which has historically led to a drastic increase in the price of equities and crypto. Trump admin’s proposed tax cuts could boost this liquidity surge, aligning with what he terms the “cyclical Valhalla” — a period where daring investors could earn handsomely from the market’s evolving dynamics. “Cyclical Valhalla is coming. Those with brass balls will be rewarded accordingly,” the Bitcoin OG posited, before highlighting Q1 as the possible deadline for such liquidity injections to start. Barhydt is not the only one who is bullish on Bitcoin’s chances of hitting $700,000. Last month, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested that BTC could hit this lofty price point if it experienced much broader institutional adoption. Fink revealed that many people, including the operators of a sovereign wealth fund he met in Switzerland, are debating whether to have a 2% or 5% allocation to Bitcoin.

Title: ANSON FRERICKS: Let’s All Lift A Glass And Wish For This Famous Beer Company To Become American Again

Anheuser-Busch’s CEO wants to market its beer as “American made,” rather than “domestic”—the term that typically differentiates U.S. beer from “imports.” However, Anheuser-Busch isn’t really an American company. But maybe it’s time to make it one again. Anheuser-Busch hasn’t been American owned since 2008. That’s the year the 156-year-old American brewer was purchased by its Belgium-based, European rival, Inbev. The company was renamed Anheuser-Busch Inbev, and is now the largest beer company in the world, selling one in four beers globally. This globalization might have sounded good on paper, but it was a disaster for Anheuser Busch. In 2008, Anheuser-Busch produced over 100 million barrels of beer in the US and employed over 21,000 people. Today, it produces 60 million barrels and has shed thousands of jobs. The errors compounded over time. Following the takeover, Inbev imported executives from Belgium and Brazil to run sales and marketing in the US. It didn’t work. Marketing execs canceled partnerships with country music festivals and the Ultimate Fighting Championship and replaced them with techno concerts more common in Europe. Then came the forced plunge into Stakeholder Capitalism, ESG and DEI. In the U.S., companies historically operated to serve shareholders—i.e., to generate profits. The European model is different. It compels companies to serve all stakeholders, including activists, governments, the environment and non-profits. Around 2018, that started to change. Wall Street firms like BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, began foisting the stakeholder model on U.S. companies. Given its European roots, Anheuser-Busch Inbev quickly went all in. As the head of U.S. sales and distribution, I felt the changes immediately. Longstanding principles like merit disappeared. Commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion replaced them. A LGBTQ+ advocacy group called The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) monitored progress. By 2022, HRC required companies to make at least three “public commitments to the LGBTQ+ community,” including lobbying, donating to LGBTQ+ charities and favoring LGBTQ+ suppliers. If companies disobeyed, they lost their perfect HRC scores. Brands felt compelled to act. But as Bud Light soon learned, there was much more than an HRC score at stake. On April 1, 2023, the most popular beer in America, Bud Light, entered into a disastrous social media partnership with the transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney. They sent Dylan a commemorative Bud Light can to celebrate Dylan’s 365-day journey of transitioning from a biological male to a female. The reaction was explosive. Customers boycotted. Celebrities chimed in. Kid Rock was among the first to do so, posting a video of himself shooting Bud Lights with an AR-15 rifle. Anheuser-Busch’s CEO, Brendan Whitworth, fumbled the response. He neither apologized to loyal consumers for the controversial ad nor stood by Dylan Mulvaney as more progressive customers demanded. Bud Light was supposed to be “easy to drink, easy to enjoy.” It was the number one-rated beer brand because it was remarkably apolitical. Enjoyed by Democrats and Republicans alike. No more. Millions of customers ditched Bud Light. The stock price nose-dived. Forty-billion dollars of shareholder value was erased. The company still hasn’t recovered. Bud Light sales are down 40% since the controversy and it is now the number three-ranked beer brand in America. But it’s not too late for a comeback—if Bud Light returns to its roots. That means returning Bud Light to American owners. It wouldn’t be an unprecedented move. TikTok is being forced to sell in the US for similar reasons: It is owned by a foreign firm with values antithetical to the US. Is Anheuser-Busch Inbev capturing data of US citizens like TikTok? No. But has it harmed US culture and created job losses? Yes. And in this case, there’s no need for government intervention, since a sale would be in Inbev’s best interests too. Inbev clearly doesn’t know what it’s doing; a sale would allow it to recoup its losses while entrusting Anheuser-Busch’s future to someone who understands the American market. New owners could revive the American icon. A group like Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway or a consortium of private equity firms led by Stephen Schwartzman’s BlackStone could buy the US business for $30 billion to $40 billion. They could hire an American management team dedicated to making Anheuser-Busch the greatest American comeback story in corporate history. Start with a media blitz. Apologize for the failures of past management. Sell a future where beer is fun and apolitical again. Launch or acquire some healthier, non-alcohol brands to become a total beverage company. Hire brilliant marketers. Drive sales growth. Label products “American made” on menus across the country. All Americans can cheers to that.

Title: Conservatives Urge Congress to Confirm 'Strong' Antitrust Advocate Mark Meador for FTC

Conservative leaders on Monday wrote to Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Cruz (R-TX), urging Congress to confirm Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner nominee Mark Meador, who will be a strong advocate for “strong, yet targeted” antitrust and consumer protection enforcement. The conservative coalition contended that President Donald Trump’s landslide election gave him a “clear mission,” which is to “take our country back from the elites, liberal mobs, and deep state directing our country towards certain disaster.” The conservatives wrote that confirming Meador, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation who served as Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) deputy chief counsel for antitrust and competition policy, is essential to realizing Trump’s goal of removing the malign influence of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as well as environment, social, and governance (ESG) corporate policies from unduly influencing America’s children. Read letter here: Meador Conservative Letter by jmanship on Scribd They noted Cruz “rightly said” that “every parent with a young child or a teenager either worries about, or knows first-hand, the real harms and dangers of addicted and anxiety-inducing social media.” The coalition noted other issues the FTC urgently needs to address, including: “If we want to make any headway on any of these important issues, we need a strong FTC; these AGs [attorneys general] cannot do it alone,” the conservatives contended. The leaders include: They continued: Mr. Meador has been a long-time advocate for strong, yet targeted antitrust and consumer protection enforcement. He is a well-regarded and influential antitrust scholar. He also has the resume to back it up spanning across both antitrust agencies and as a staffer on Capitol Hill. President Trump could have not chosen a better champion to assist in him ushering in America’s golden age. “Thus, we respectfully request that the Senate Commerce Committee expedite Mr. Meador’s confirmation, so that we can get back on track,” the conservatives wrote to Cruz and the Commerce Committee.

Title: Michelin star awards 2025: Which Irish restaurants will be recognised?

Gah! Found another newly awarded Bib Gourmand lurking. In our defense it was hiding in the UK listings, whereas we consider our restaurants (and their accolades) on an all island basis. mrDeanes in Belfast is the casual dining option opened by Michael Deane in Belfast last year. Here’s what the inspectors said: “Its full name, ‘mrDeanes Bistro, Bar and Social’, paints a perfect picture of this spacious addition to Michael Deane’s ever-evolving Belfast empire. Grab a cocktail at the bar before taking your seat in a restaurant that’s bursting with vitality. The eminently appealing menu offers well-executed takes on dishes from all over the world, be it Gaeng Phed red curry or ‘entrecôte au poivre’. There’s a palpable generosity to the place too, with the food and wine both offering great value for money.” Well done mrDeanes! Ok, that’s a wrap for another year. Hungry work indeed. I’m off to check out bookings. All current holders of Michelin stars (15 one-stars and 5 two-stars) in Ireland retained their stars. Here’s the updated at-a-glance list. For details go to guide.michelin.com/en/ Two stars One star OK, we’ve ferreted out who the new Bib Gourmands (“good food at moderate prices”) in Ireland went to: Owner Zsolt Lukács was awarded the UK & Ireland Sommelier award, and with it a Bib Gourmand. They inspectors said of Daróg: “There’s a huge amount of passion channelled into this welcoming little wine bar. Hungarian-born Zsolt Lukács has an infectious enthusiasm for wine, which comes across in his carefully curated list that gravitates towards small artisan producers using organic and biodynamic methods. Accompanying the wine is a selection of sharing plates – like kingfish crudo – that are exactingly executed, deliver on flavour and provide brilliant value for money. The regularly changing artwork from local artists is on sale and is curated by co-owner Edel." Owned by chef Ahmet Dede, holder of two stars for his Dede restaurant in Baltimore, this is the more informal baby sister. Here the inspectors said: “With a name meaning ‘Baby Dede’, this second Baltimore venture from Chef Ahmet Dede is an ode to his family and comes with all the homespun charm you’d expect. Located mere feet away from his acclaimed flagship restaurant, this is a more relaxed affair but the great value sharing plates retain the older sibling’s ethos of Turkish flavours married with Irish produce. Each dish – from a unique take on oyster chowder to Ahmet’s signature ‘içli köfte’ – is bright, fresh and wholly satisfying." Well that’s good luck and good night from the Michelin Ceremony in Glasgow. How did Ireland fare? One star: Adam Nevin at the Morrison Rooms in Carton House, Maynooth, Co Kildare. Richard Picard-Edwards, Ballyfin Demesne, Mountrath Co Laois. Danny Africano, Lignum Restaurant, Loughrea, Co Galway. Sommelier of the Year: Zsolt Lukács of Daróg Wine Bar, Galway City. Awwwwwww.... that’s it. Just the one news three star which went to Moor Hall. Another year and Ireland misses out on that elusive third star. Now, the NEW THREE STARS Moor Hall, under Mark Birchall, in Aughton, England (Aughton there be one for Chapter One??? c’mon Ireland!!!) ehhhh ... that should read 40 years the Waterside Inn on the go at three stars (reasons I’m not an accountant) Waterside got its third star in 1985 – so that’s 30 years operating at that level. Alain Ducasse quite emotional. OK the biggest of the biggies now – the 3-star awards. Those retaining three stars: Fat Duck; Waterside Inn; Alain Ducasse at Dorchester, Core by Claire Smyth; Sketch, the Lecture Room and Library; Restaurant Gordon Ramsay; The Ledbury; Hélène Darroze at the Connaught. (might have missed one there, but hopefully not) Last two star to Angelo Sato to the pretty coolly named Humble Chicken in London. Verry young looking guy, of few words, except to say he didn’t have a great start in life, so this means a great deal. John looks like everybody’s lovely uncle. “I’ve waited 50 years for this. I thought we were forgotten. we carried on cooking to the best of our ability, but the experience comes with the service.” OK, now it’s the two-star awards. Will we feature? First up Hide and Fox in Kent – Susan says it’s the perrrrrfect country restaurant. I bet it is! The Ritz, London – John Williams MBE is the chef, and he’s getting a standing ovation. Green stars now. Those restaurants that can minimise their environmental footprint – sustainable gastronomy. Kai in Galway is the only holder of this award in Ireland. Quite the achievement when I don’t think they even have a kitchen garden feeding their restaurant. OK, no new gongs for Ireland in this category. Must try harder ... Interesting segment here about women chefs, first-person stories for a wide selection of women of what it’s like operating in a professional kitchen. How they have to break stereotypes re being serious about a cooking career. Head chef women are expected to do everything in their kitchens, men are usually allowed to “just cook”. Imposter syndrome is rife. The media defer to men for opinions all the time. More women need to enter competitions. general experience is that every man believes they are the best (generally when not), women have to be persuaded. And that’s it for the one-star awards – 22 new winners in total. And a glorious, delicious, well-deserved three for Ireland: Adam Nevin, Carton House; Richard Picard-Edwards, Ballyfin Demesne; Danny Africano, Lignum, Co Galway. And don’t forget Best Sommelier UK and Ireland, Zsolt Lukács of Daróg, Galway. Whoop! Whoop! It’s raining Irish stars(ish)! Great news for Ballyfin. The rumour mill had been rife, and went into overdrive when Ballyfin was awarded three Michelin Keys last year – its new award category for top quality hotels. Chef Richard Picard-Edwards joined Ballyfin in April 2023 from the Mandarin Oriental Bittescombe Lodge in the UK. Since arriving the bar has been set at Michelin-star level, served up in a stunning eight-course menu (€145). The restaurant is now open to non-residents too, so at least you don’t have to remortgage the house for an overnight with dinner. Corinna Hardgrave visited last October, when she described the Jerusalem artichoke cream as “downright dazzling”. Three years ago our restaurant critic Corinna Hardgrave said in her Lignum Review she would be “astonished” if Lignum didn’t land a star in the following year. Well dear reader, she, and many others have been disappointed every year since. Located a bit off the well-trod Michelin track in Loughrea, Co Galway, since opening in 2017 chef/proprietor Danny Africano and wife Molly Keane have been firmly in the sights of the Michelin star judges. With a focus on wood-fired cooking it offers a €145, 10-course tasting menu, showcasing seasonal Irish and Italian ingredients. Well worth a detour – in the truest Michelin sense! Danny Africano of Lignum in Loughrea, Co Galway. They’ve been at it since 2017 – recognition at last! Star for Tom Barnes of Skof in Manchester.This was hotly anticipated Star for Lyla in Edinburgh. Scotland doing verrrryyyy well. Can’t wait for them to host the ceremony in Ireland!!! Cardiff gets its first Michelin Star! Going to Tom Waters of Gorse Gary Foulkes at Cornus in London picks up a star. Adam Nevin is formerly of The Grill at The Dorchester, The Hand and Flowers and The Westbury in London. A Maynooth native he only took up the position at Carton House in September 2023. I was lucky enough to dine here a couple of months ago, and what an experience. The dining room, with Lafranchini brothers stuccowork is sensational and steeped in history, but the food is the real star of the show. The tasting menu is about €135, or you can opt for the €110 chef’s five course menu. Recently Mickael Viljanen of Chapter One sang the praises of Nevin’s informal Sunday lunch menu – high praise indeed. Read Corinna Hardgrave’s review from February 2024 here Waheyyyy!!! First Michelin star for Adam Nevin of the Morrison Rooms at Carton House. This guy is only 30, and playing a stormer!!! The people behind Daróg in Galway are husband-and-wife team Zsolt Lukács and Edel McMahon. Lukács was the sommelier at Aniar for a long time, and McMahon is a sister of JP McMahon, well known chef owner of Aniar, prolific food writer and all round food genius. Fantastic! Sommelier award goes to Zsolt Lukacs of Daróg (we knew Daróg was in there somewhere). Great win for a lovely little Irish operation - well deserved!! Service award goes to Jasmine Sherry of Fish Shop a tiny operation in Ballater in the Scottish Highlands. Mentor chef awards goes to Adam Byatt, Trinity restaurant in Clapham, London. Young chef award going to Ash Venezuela-Heeger from River Rabbit restaurant in Birmingham. 36 new bibs in total across UK and Ireland. Two for Ireland, but we don’t find out until they update the guide after the ceremony. Jeez. Not a very fun teaser - especially if you’re a hopeful chef. It’s possible Daróg is in there, but that’s speculation. More as we can confirm it... Susan is back and reminding us that the guide isn’t just about stars. This year 145 new restaurants have been added to the 3000+ in the guide. Now for the Bib Gourmands - quality food at affordable prices. Glasgow has added two new Bibs. Great. What about the Irish ones? Keep you posted. Ok, we’ve just had Mairi Gougeon, cabinet secretary fo rural affairs, land reform and islands. She makes the important point how there would be no awards without the fabulous fresh produce from our land and seas. Followed by lovely pics of Scotland. Aye, aye here comes Gwendal Poullennec international director of the Michelin Guide, getting to the meat and potatoes now. It’s the 125th anniversary of the Michelin guide, so a landmark year for the principles of culinary excellence. Next up we have councillor Susan Aitken, leader of Glasgow City Council. Delighted she is for she and the city to be hosting. Gotta say there’s a distracting and ominous background music that feels like we’ve all suddenly entered the twighlight zone. Our host is Amanda Stretton, UK motorsports racing driver and broadcaster, who tells us this is the first time the ceremony has taken place outside of England. Well this is lovely. A very atmospheric bagpipe and organ introduction - a nice reminder of our surrounds at the beautiful looking Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum in Glasgow, Scotland. Talk about all sound, no picture. We’re all on tenterhooks waiting for the ceremony to begin.... oh hang, on! here we go!!! Speculation has been mounting all day as to who the lucky new recipients of stars might be. Smart money at this point is on The Morrison Room at Carton House, Maynooth; Ballyfin Demesne in Laois; Library Street, Dublin 2; Lignum, Co Galway. Meanwhile there’s the eternal will we/won’t we ever attain that third Michelin Star in Ireland. In with a shout would have to be Chapter One, and then there’s always Terre at Castlemartyr, or Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud. All will soon be revealed... We may be just 5 minutes away from the awards starting and if you were ever in any doubt as to how closely Michelin holds its cards to its chest, we can tell you, pretty damn close. We don’t know who is hosting, or how the ceremony will play out, ie when will the Bib Gourmands be announced? at the beginning? at the end? Anyone’s guess. Want to know what the Michelin inspectors think of our current Michelin star restaurants, here’s what they said about each in the 2024 edition of the guide Michelin-starred restaurants in Ireland, 2024: The complete guide: As our countdown to 6pm continues, it’s worth noting that the ceremony only awards NEW stars and Bibs. If a current holder of a Michelin-star or Bib Gourmand is unlucky enough to lose its star, this will only become apparent after the ceremony when Michelin updates its listing to add new winners, and omit those who have failed to retain their award. While tonight is all about looking ahead, it’s good to remember too those that blazed the trail. Back in 1974, Declan Ryan won Ireland’s first Michelin star at the Arbutus Lodge restaurant in Cork. This week he spoke to Barry Roche about what it was like to win such an accolade back then, while Alan Betson shot some lovely video of Declan in West Cork cooking up a salmon and foraged sorrel classic. What’s all the fuss about Michelin stars anyway? The awards have a very interesting back story. They were the brainchild in 1900 of the tyre manufacturing brothers André and Edouard Michelin. There are now more than 3,000 Michelin-starred restaurants in close to 40 countries. The inspectors, who book anonymously and pay their bill in full, have been active in Ireland since 1974. There are degrees of recognition within the guide, the highest being Michelin star level. The impact and pressure of achieving and retaining a star is considerable. This article from 2023 give a nice insight to just what’s involved: Michelin stars: The power to make or break careers, businesses – and lives Put simply there are levels of inclusion in the Michelin guide which operate as follows: At the lowest level, a restaurant can simply be listed in the Guide. That’s an achievement in itself. Bib Gourmand: This is awarded for good food at moderate prices. Last year Ireland added five new Bib Gourmands, bringing its tally here to 18. Usually these are announced a week or two before the Michelin stars, but this year they will announce them tonight along with the stars. These are always of interest because realistically they are the restaurants most ordinary diners can hope to afford, and they can be very good without being too formal. Then, the stars: Good evening and welcome to the most exciting night on the fine dining restaurant calendar. Chefs, proprietors, kitchen teams, gourmets and judges are gathering in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum in Glasgow, Scotland for the annual Britain & Ireland Michelin Guide ceremony where this year’s winners of the highly coveted Michelin stars for culinary excellence will be announced. Starting at 6pm the ceremony (whose organisers swear the winners in attendance to secrecy in advance) will reveal those restaurants that have been successful in attaining (or adding) a star following visits and assessments from the judges in the last 12 months.

Business FILE PHOTO: Close up of the GroqNode product by Silicon Valley AI chip startup Groq, in Mountain View, California, U.S., July, 2022. Groq Inc./Mark Heaps/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Semiconductor startup Groq said on Monday it has secured a $1.5 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to expand the delivery of its advanced AI chips to the country. Groq, founded by a former Alphabet engineer, is known for producing AI inference chips that optimize speed and execute commands of pre-trained models. The startup has an existing agreement with Aramco Digital, the technology subsidiary of oil major Aramco, through which the companies built a critical AI hub in the region in December. The commitment, which lacked specific details on the timeline or location of the investment, was announced at Saudi's global technology event, LEAP 2025. At this event, the country secured $14.9 billion in fresh AI investments. In August, Groq clinched a valuation of $2.8 billion after raising $640 million in a funding round led by Cisco Investments, Samsung Catalyst Fund and BlackRock Private Equity Partners.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best widow and orphan stocks to invest in. Investing in the stock market can be a prudent strategy for widows and orphans seeking financial stability and growth. Widow-and-orphan stocks are typically associated with established companies in sectors like utilities and consumer staples. These companies often provide consistent dividend payments, offering a reliable income stream. This stability is particularly valuable during economic downturns, as these stocks tend to exhibit lower volatility compared to high-growth equities. Investing in stable, dividend-paying stocks can aid in preserving and growing wealth over time. The combination of regular dividend income and potential capital appreciation makes these stocks suitable for individuals aiming for sustainable financial growth without excessive risk exposure.

A study published in July 2024 highlights the critical role of financial literacy in investment decisions and stock market participation. The research indicates that increased financial knowledge enhances investment confidence and decision-making, underscoring the importance of targeted financial education programs to empower individuals to participate effectively in the stock market. Recent trends show that women, particularly baby boomers, are increasingly controlling significant amounts of wealth. As of January 2025, women over 60 control $8 trillion of liquid wealth assets. This shift underscores the importance of financial literacy and proactive investment strategies among women to ensure long-term financial security.

(ABC Kimberley: Mya Kordic) Residents in Western Australia's north are "battening down the hatches" amid the risk of a cyclone forming in the next two days. Emergency services are conducting flood modelling and some residents and businesses are gearing up to evacuate properties if required. The Bureau of Meteorology says there is a high chance of tropical low 18U intensifying and that it could cross the Pilbara coast later this week. Residents, authorities and pastoralists in Western Australia's north are preparing for a potential cyclone to form in the next two days as a tropical low heads towards "cyclone alley". As of 9am on Monday, tropical low U18 is 320 kilometres north of Broome and travelling south-west off the Kimberley coast. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said there was a high chance of it forming into a cyclone by Tuesday night and emergency services warned the community to prepare. The bureau's tracking maps indicate that the system could intensify into at least a category two cyclone and cross the Pilbara coast later in the week. A BOM map of the potential cyclone's projected path released on Monday afternoon. (Supplied: Bureau of Meteorology) Pastoralist David Stoate said preparations were underway at Anna Plains Station 250 kilometres south of Broome in "cyclone alley". "We're just battening down the hatches, tying down the buildings and making sure there's no debris or anything that can blow around the homestead," he said. "It's certainly a feature of living in this part of the world. "We do get cyclones at this time of the year … we know the drills, so we'll hopefully follow that." David Stoate is the owner of Anna Plains Station and said preparations were well underway in "cyclone alley". (ABC Kimberley: Alys Marshall) Mr Stoate said everyone in the region would be preparing in a similar fashion. "You get a little bit nervous — I mean, they can be very destructive as as we know," he said. "But the flip side is we could do with a bit of rain here. "So they do have an upside as well, but yeah, at times like this you're sweating on the updates from [the] bureau." The weather system is expected to bring heavy rainfall to Broome. (ABC Kimberley: Mya Kordic) Department of Fire and Emergency Services Superintendent Phil Brandrett said flood modelling was being conducted north of Port Hedland in the Pilbara communities of Strelley and Warralong. Reducing the impact of a cyclone on your family, your home and your animals means making a plan well before the bad weather arrives. "We're looking at what resources we'll have on hand to actually put in place and be out in those particular communities, even in Marble Bar, for example," he said. "We've had some people doing flood modelling as well as worst-case scenarios. The Hedland State Emergency Services unit opened on Sunday afternoon for public sandbag collection. Blackrock Tourist Park manager Marie Carter said there were about 140 people staying in units and 50 permanent residents at the South Hedland site, where storm preparations were underway. The Hedland SES provided sandbags to residents on Sunday afternoon. (Supplied: Department of Fire and Emergency Services) "We personally go around and speak to everyone — we've got such a diverse group of people, from single mums with babies to workers and retirees," she said. "Some stay, some leave, but caravans get strapped down and they go into one of our cyclone-rated units. "We're such a large park, we start work three days before to make sure everything is covered." The Pardoo Roadhouse in the Pilbara was flattened by Cyclone Ilsa. (ABC News: Cason Ho) Pardoo Roadhouse, which was destroyed after Cyclone Ilsa made landfall in 2023, is again preparing for the potential of extreme weather. Owner Will Batth said lessons had been taken from previous experience. "No amount of preparation is ever enough — we know that now," he said. "We are prepared to evacuate if needed. Meteorologist Jonathan How said the tropical low would strengthen over the next two to three days and could develop into a category three system. "There is a little bit of uncertainty as to what the cyclone may do," he said. "Some of the model guidance is suggesting a land crossing around De Grey area and towards Wallal Downs as soon as Wednesday or Thursday. "Other computer guidance is also suggesting that the system actually remains offshore all the way to the weekend and crosses the coast closer to western parts of the Pilbara, as a category four or five system, around Karratha and down towards Onslow."

Title: AIL round-up: Terenure take down neighbours St Mary’s to go second

Terenure avenged November’s loss away to neighbours St Mary’s with a deserved 27-24 win at a jam-packed Lakelands Park on Saturday in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League. The bonus-point victory elevates them above their rivals into second place behind new leaders Cork Con, who beat Terenure in last season’s final. That followed Terenure’s third successive home semi-final and Saturday’s derby has been described as a semi-final on steroids. In front of a crowd of almost 4,000, Terenure were generally on top and had some standout performances in Will Hickey, Jordan Coghlan and Caspar Gabriel, Leinster’s Austrian academy outhalf, who graced the game with some eye-catching moments, including a couple of brilliant high takes. A quick-fire double toward the end of the first period by hooker Max Russell, from a lineout maul, and Coghlan put Terenure 20-14 ahead at the break. Prolific fullback Conor Hayes kept St Mary’s in touch before Coghlan’s second try effectively sealed the win. A questionable Hayes try did earn the visitors a losing bonus point. A slightly weakened Clontarf were knocked off the top following a 27-14 loss away to Young Munster. The Cookies were 12-0 up inside 10 minutes through tries by winger Ihechi Oji and Ruadhán Quinn, who returned along with fellow Munster players Evan O’Connell, Shay McCarthy and Jake O’Riordan. Quinn’s second try had the home side 19-7 up at the break and a try by Hubert Gilvarry sealed the bonus point. Con lead the table on 47 points, ahead of Terenure on 45, followed by Clontarf and St Mary’s. Clontarf, who have a game in hand, host Con next week. Lansdowne had a vital win in Ballynahinch, who led 14-5 after the first quarter before Lansdowne imposed themselves with tries by Liam Molony and a brace by South African lock Juan Beukes. Kyle Gill’s 56th-minute try put Hinch back in front but Lansdowne’s outside centre Andy Marks capped another fine performance with the match-winning, bonus-point try – his 10th of the season – 10 minutes from time. Ballynahinch are on 37 points, with Lansdowne and Young Munster, who meet next week on the Aviva back pitch, both on 36 points. Cork Con went top with a bonus-point 31-19 victory over City of Armagh, who lost both influential fullback Kyle Faloon and try scorer Matthew Hooks to potentially season-ending injuries. Con outhalf James Taylor converted tries by Rob Jermyn, Joe O’Leary, Daniel Hurley and Jack Kelleher, and landed a penalty. UCD thus moved to within two points of City of Armagh with a hugely significant 26-15 bonus-point win over Garryowen, whose 12th successive defeat leaves them 10 points adrift in 10th place. The students’ hooker Bobby Sheehan maintained the familial liking for the try line with a hat-trick. Old Belvedere took a big step toward automatic promotion from Division 1B with a 30-10 win in Highfield to move eight points clear of second-placed Nenagh after their 24-14 defeat to Queen’s. Old Wesley moved to within four points of Nenagh after sharing 14 tries in an astonishing 44-41 win at home to UCC, for whom replacement hooker Luke McAuliffe scored four second-half tries.

Title: Investors await new inflation data amid tariff concerns: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks ended the first week of February little changed as investors digested corporate earnings from Big Tech companies, a hotter-than-expected January jobs report, and continuing updates on President Donald Trump's tariff policies. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was roughly flat, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.4%. In the week ahead, inflation will take center stage, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set for release on Wednesday morning. Updates on wholesale inflation and retail sales will also be closely tracked. But investors will also be keeping a close eye on Trump's planned announcement of new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, as well as for more details on reciprocal duties across the board. On the corporate front, 78 S&P 500 companies, including McDonald's (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), and Airbnb (ABNB), are set to report earnings. The January jobs report released on Friday showed continued signs of resilience in the labor market as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell, wages grew more than expected, and December's monthly job gains were revised higher to show the US labor market exited 2024 on an even better footing than previously reported. This prompted economists to argue the Fed likely won't be cutting interest rates anytime soon. And if anything, it puts more pressure on inflation data to show cooling before the central bank brings down borrowing costs. "The more recent data are indicative of a labor market that has regained its footing," Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a note on Friday. "This suggests that the tail risk of a sharp deterioration in the labor market has diminished, and as a result the FOMC can wait to see how the Q1 inflation data and economic policymaking play out before taking further action on the federal funds rate." Stocks rebounded after dropping initially on Monday as President Trump's 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were delayed at least a month. But what exactly happens with tariffs remains an overhang on markets as investors debate the potential impact on inflation and, subsequently, monetary policy. On Sunday, Trump said he will introduce a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imported into the US from all countries. He told reporters on Air Force One that he will announce the new metals duties on Monday, but didn't say when they would be implemented. The move puts Canada and Mexico, both top US suppliers of steel and aluminum, back in the hot seat on tariffs. Also stepping up the trade pressure, Trump said on Friday he would announce a plan on reciprocal tariffs on American imports. The comments were made during a meeting with Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Trump said tariffs on Japan were an option. In a research note on Friday, BlackRock Global Fixed Income chief investment officer Rick Rieder said it would likely take two weak jobs reports to prompt discussion about the Fed resuming its interest rate cutting cycle. But he added that the risks surrounding Trump's policies, including tariffs and an immigration crackdown, muddle the outlook. "While we and the Fed are keeping our eyes focused on these payroll (and inflation) reports, we also have to closely watch the news flow, and then the reverberations around these events, to get a sense for when the Fed and market makers can feel confident in rates coming down closer to a long-run neutral level," Rieder wrote. With investors' focus now squarely back on inflation data for hints of interest rate cuts, a fresh update on the pace of price increases is slated for release on Wednesday. Wall Street economists expect January's CPI to show headline inflation of 2.9% in January, flat from the month prior. Prices are anticipated to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, below the 0.4% increase seen in December. On a "core" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.1% over last year in January, below the 3.2% seen in December. Monthly core price increases are anticipated to clock in at 0.3%, above the 0.2% seen the month prior. The first monthly retail sales report of 2025 is set for release on Friday. Economists estimate retail sales were flat over the prior month during January. But the control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.4%, down from the 0.7% increase seen in December. With more than 62% of S&P 500 companies done reporting earnings, the year-over-year growth rate for the index keeps moving higher. As of Friday, the S&P 500 was pacing for earnings growth of 16.4% compared to the year prior. This would mark the fastest pace of growth in three years and is well above the 11.8% earnings growth analysts had expected at the start of January. While earnings have been beating expectations, macro factors have continued to create stop-and-go market action as stocks have failed to find clear direction. On Friday, stocks slipped lower after the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showed respondents' one-year inflation expectations hit their highest level since November 2023. One-year inflation expectations jumped to 4.3% in February from 3.3% last month, marking the the fifth time in 14 years that the survey reported a rise of 1 percentage point or more in year-ahead inflation expectations. The release noted that the jump in inflation expectations was "in part due to a perception that it may be too late to avoid the negative impact of tariff policy." Stocks reversed course on the news, with all three major averages flipping from green to red. And while that constitutes just a small sampling of the market action, it's a reminder that what tariffs mean for inflation is squarely in focus for markets ahead of a week that's expected to provide updates on both fronts.

Title: Ireland U20’s make light work of Scotland to take opening Six Nations win
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/02/08/ireland-u20s-make-light-work-of-scotland-to-take-opening-six-nations-win/
Time Published: 2025-02-08T22:31:16Z

Following the disappointment of losing out to defending champions England in the opening round, Ireland captain Eanna McCarthy believes a more clinical attacking edge was the catalyst behind his side’s victory over Scotland in the Under-20 Six Nations at the Hive Stadium on Saturday. After the hurt that was left from their 19-3 reversal at the hands of the English on home soil, Ireland were determined to get their first win of the Championship in the Edinburgh venue. Thanks to a hat-trick of first-half tries from Charlie Molony – in addition to fine finishes over the whitewash by Billy Corrigan and Oisin Minogue in either half - Neil Doak’s visitors emerged from this round two clash in the Scottish capital with a maximum tally of five points. “There was a big week’s training and a few fix-ups from last week. We had nine entries [against England] and we only converted one, whereas this week we had 15 and converted a lot more. I’m very proud of the lads, but it was a fierce physical battle with Scotland. They’re always a good team, so you never want to take them for granted,” McCarthy remarked after Saturday’s game. “We know we’re a good side. We created so many opportunities against England and we just missed out [because of] last ball here, dropped ball there. There wasn’t much getting into it. There was a bit of hurt left from it, but there wasn’t much to say to the lads. They were fairly well motivated themselves.” After spectacularly touching down with just over 90 seconds gone on the clock, Molony got on the end of a delicate crossfield kick by Sam Wisniewski for his second try of the action on 13 minutes. The hard-working Corrigan added his name to the scoresheet by rounding off an enterprising attack just shy of the first-quarter mark, before Molony wrapped up his hat-trick and an Ireland bonus point in ruthless fashion on 22 minutes. Scotland finally opened their account with a five-pointer from Fergus Watson just four minutes later and even though Ireland established a comfortable 26-5 interval lead, there were some nervous moments after Joe Roberts added a second Scottish try on the restart. Yet the introduction of Munster hopeful Minogue (nephew of the late Anthony Foley and son of former Ireland women’s international Rosie Foley) proved to be a masterstroke by Irish head coach Doak as he dived over off an intricate lineout move mere seconds after his introduction as a 59th minute replacement. A resolute Scotland dotted down once again via scrumhalf Hector Patterson inside the final quarter but while Ireland came up short in their quest for a sixth try in the closing moments, they had already done more than enough to earn an emphatic victory. After kick-starting the tournament with two games in the space of nine days, Ireland will now be able to enjoy an extended build-up to their third round encounter with Wales at Rodney Parade in Newport on February 21st. Now that they have some points on the board, McCarthy is hopeful they are in a good position to push on for the remainder of the Six Nations – albeit there will be some tough challenges ahead for the Irish. “A bonus point win is hard to get wherever you go. Five points on the table now, we just work on from here. There’s a lot of things to work on for next week now. We’ll go back and train hard next week, and the week after it we’re into Wales away then. Which will be another tough game,” McCarthy added.

Title: It’s easy to conclude the era of DEI is over — but it’s not

It’s easy to conclude that the era of diversity, equity and inclusion — the practice of using race and so-called intersectionality like gender preferences in hiring — is dead. But it’s not. In fact, DEI is likely headed for the Supreme Court, where it might get an odd reprieve from the bench’s conservative majority. It’s the reason why there are still plenty of companies — including Microsoft, Apple, Costco, JPMorgan and BlackRock — hanging on to this progressive shibboleth even if it’s destroying what’s left of a functioning meritocracy in the workplace. I know all this runs counter to the prevailing narrative that companies that go woke, will go broke. I wrote a whole book on the subject. Companies are now making headlines announcing no more DEI in hiring. The Trump administration has ended DEI in government and federal contracting. SCOTUS in 2023 ruled that racial preferences in college admissions are illegal. Major brands that went woke — like Bud Light when it ran an ad featuring a trans activist sipping the beer, half-naked in a bubble bath — still haven’t recovered from the consumer backlash. They’re now changing course. And yet, DEI is muddling along, and at some companies, it remains as strong as ever. One reason: Corporate managers remain significantly woke. Another: Lawyers are telling them there is a strong legal rationale for keeping DEI as a corporate mandate, my reporting shows All of this is why DEI’s defenestration often reflects a change in semantics. Many companies are simply dropping the “E” in DEI because equity can be construed with hard-and-fast quotas, which are legally dubious. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, made headlines when he announced he ditched DEI; he even got rid of tampons in the company’s men’s room. Yet with a simple Google search I found a “diversity and inclusion” section on the company website. A Meta spokeswoman tells The Post when alerted about the discrepancy that it will be removed, adding “in no ambiguous terms — we’ve ended our DEI program.” Meanwhile, there are some big companies where DEI remains as strong as ever. One JPMorgan official told me, Jamie Dimon, the voluble CEO of the nation’s largest bank, believes DEI is a corporate necessity because it’s good for society and good for business, thus totally legal. Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University, explained this legal rationale for keeping DEI comes down to some vagaries in the interpretation of the civil rights laws. SCOTUS — even with a conservative majority, he noted — could be hard-pressed to end it completely when it hears several upcoming reverse-discrimination employment cases. It just might agree with Dimon that there is a business rationale to maintain DEI after listening to arguments that preferences in hiring aren’t quotas. Rather, they help companies sell stuff to different minority groups, and don’t really violate the color-blind interpretation of the civil rights laws that led to SCOTUS’ canceling affirmative action in college admissions. “On one level, it is not clear why educational institutions cannot use race in admissions, but corporations can use race criteria in hiring and promotions,” Turley said. “Some corporations are likely to argue that racial diversity has a direct market value with customers.” Again, a fair reading of the civil rights act would suggest race cannot be used even for a market benefit.

Never miss a story. As one corporate lawyer advising clients on how to deal with DEI told me, the SCOTUS affirmative action precedent plus past rulings upholding affirmative action suggested a high bar for upholding preferences. “The only time the courts have favored race being used is to address past racial discrimination and if that past discrimination can be remedied only in that way. It’s very narrow, and it’s hard to see how that applies to people working at big companies,” the legal expert said. But who knows how the Roberts Court, led by chief Justice (and Bush II appointee) John Roberts, considers a fair reading. Yes, it is regarded as among the most conservative SCOTUS’ ever with a seemingly impenetrable 6-3 conservative majority. A closer look at the personalities involved shows it can make some left turns. Roberts himself voted against striking down ObamaCare, and has rendered opinions that have angered conservatives. Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, often votes with Roberts on controversial issues. Neil Gorsuch, another Trump appointee has disappointed conservatives on various rulings, as has Trump appointed Amy Coney Barrett. Judicial restraint — a legal philosophy that looks askance at overturning precedent — is key to understanding the Roberts Court despite its rulings on affirmative action and overturning Roe v. Wade, legal experts tell me. Let’s just say this is a crew that doesn’t want to keep upsetting the old apple cart; it might view tearing down the final vestiges of DEI in the corporate ecosystem as overreach after it nixed college affirmative action. That’s the betting at least at those companies keeping the DEI faith. It’s also the rationale at many large companies that are merely ditching the term DEI, cleverly disguising the hiring and firing policies that continue to employ intersectional preferences.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/08/2025 9:57:03 AM PST by DallasBiff Staffers and allies of Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service have fanned out across Washington in recent days, seeking access to sensitive data and disrupting operations in at least 14 government agencies in pursuit of a dramatically smaller federal government. DOGE, which stands for the Department of Government Efficiency, has not disclosed the names of its staff. But The Washington Post has identified more than 30 people working for or closely with it by examining the internal directories of multiple agencies and interviewing numerous federal workers, virtually all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Title: Mutual funds eye a chunk of ₹50,000 crore tax incentive showered in Budget

Iyengar Comments READ LATER Buoyed by growing investor interest, the mutual fund industry is gearing up to attract most of the ₹50,000 crore tax sops extended by the government to the middle-class in the Budget by promoting systematic investment plans and selling the India growth story. The Budget has exempted tax on salary income of up to ₹12.75 lakh per annum through a rebate and standard deduction of ₹75,000. Sundeep Sikka, ED and CEO, Nippon India Mutual Fund, said SIP is a convenient tool for small savers over the long run and the fund house believes the potential tax savings can be channelised through this route. “Our focus has always been to be a wealth creator to every Indian and the fact that one in a third mutual fund investor invests with us is a testimony to it,” he added. It is not just the investors, about six new fund houses are expected to jump into MF business this year. Among them, Angel One and Unifi Capital have filed papers with SEBI to launch their new products even while Jio BlackRock, Capitalmind, Choice International and Cosmea Financial Holdings are waiting in the wings. Akhil Chaturvedi, ED & CBO, Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company, said the fund house’s key focus is to expand the share in SIPs even while offering unique alternative investment products. Equity investors have matured, and despite market volatility, mutual fund investments continue to gain momentum as investors seek to capitalise on the recent market downturn for long-term gains, he added. Capital market regulator SEBI has recently laid norms to halve minimum SIP limit to ₹250 a month. About 225 million investors currently invest SIP but a majority are from big cities. Introducing SIPs in sachet size would help take financial investments to smaller towns. As an added advantage, SEBI is considering to allow MFs to offer insurance cover for SIP investors. For FY25, SIPs have more than quadrupled to ₹2.10 lakh crore so far from 2016-2017, per Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) data. Aashish Somaiyaa, CEO, WhiteOak Capital AMC, said the ‘Mutual Fund Sahi Hai’ is a household adage in today’s world with both investors and MF distributors are meritocratic. The recent market volatility has amply demonstrated relative safety and outperformance of mutual funds against the benchmark indices and more so MF performance against the direct equity holdings of retail investors, he added.

Title: Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Best Stock to Invest In for Grandchildren?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks To Invest In For Grandchildren. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks. In an era where financial literacy is increasingly recognized as a crucial life skill, teaching children about stock market investing can provide them with a significant advantage. Studies show that early financial education leads to better money management, long-term wealth accumulation, and greater financial security in adulthood. By introducing children to investing at a young age, they can develop a mindset of patience, risk assessment, and the power of compounding—principles that can shape their financial future. A 2023 study by the National Financial Educators Council (NFEC) found that a lack of financial literacy costs the average American $1,819 per year. Teaching children about investing early can help reduce this financial gap and equip them with the necessary skills to navigate economic challenges. Introducing children to stocks helps them understand concepts like risk and reward, diversification, and market fluctuations. Learning how companies operate and grow their revenue also fosters a deeper understanding of the economy. This knowledge can prevent common financial mistakes such as emotional investing, excessive debt, and poor money management. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. One of the most compelling reasons to teach children about investing is the power of compound interest. If a child begins investing at age 10 instead of waiting until age 30, they could amass significantly more wealth by retirement, simply by starting early. Teaching children about stocks encourages critical thinking and discipline in financial decisions. Instead of seeing money as something to be spent impulsively, they learn the value of investing for the future. A study by Fidelity Investments found that 82% of parents who teach their children about finances believe it leads to greater financial independence. Additionally, teaching investment concepts through real-life experiences, such as monitoring a stock portfolio, fosters engagement and practical learning. With advancements in AI, automation, and digital finance, future generations will need financial acumen to navigate an evolving economy. Experts suggest that children who understand investing will be better prepared for retirement, homeownership, and entrepreneurship.

For this article, we scoured investing forums, analyst reports, and advice from money managers and billionaires and compiled a list of stock options that are deemed the best for a child in the modern world. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

In January, the company launched its innovative Emulex Secure Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapters (HBA), setting a new industry standard. It is a cost-effective, easy-to-manage solution that encrypts all data as it moves between servers and storage. Jeff Hoogenboom, vice president and general manager of the Emulex Connectivity Division at Broadcom, stated that the Emulex Secure Host Bus Adapter would meet the needs by providing an elegantly simple solution that, once installed, encrypts all data across all applications. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company achieved record semiconductor revenue of $30.1 billion, with $12.2 billion coming from AI. The 220% surge in AI revenue year-on-year was fueled by the company’s advanced AI XPUs and Ethernet networking solutions. Overall AVGO ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to invest in for grandchildren. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Has Friedrich Merz, the man who would be chancellor of Germany, really opened the ‘doors to hell’?

No one closes rank quite like Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Two weeks before 59 million Germans choose a new parliament – and, most likely, start a power transfer back to the CDU – the centre-right party is anxious to send a signal of unity. Standing ovations with slow, rhythmic applause are the order of the day at each campaign appearance of CDU leader Friedrich Merz. The lanky, bespectacled lawyer will turn 70 in November. After a 36-year wait, he has never been closer to power. A fortnight from the election, however, many think Merz’s influence has more to do with polarisation than politics. Last week the CDU leader performed a taboo-breaking rightward pivot on migration and asylum in the Bundestag, relying on votes from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Though the CDU migration proposals were of no concrete consequence, they were highly symbolic. [ The Irish Times view on the German election: a worrying rightward shiftOpens in new window ] Bundestag rivals accused him of “opening the doors to hell” in the vote, with echoes of conservative pacts with the Nazis that ended prewar German democracy. On Sunday 160,000 outraged protesters braved the cold to gather outside Berlin’s CDU headquarters. One sign captured the mood: “It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas 1933”. Even former CDU chancellor Angela Merkel broke her self-imposed political silence to call the AfD-backed Merz migration motion “wrong”. A decade ago her open-border politics and “we can manage this” refugee mantra drew popular support – and attracted global praise. But Germany is in a very different place a decade later. Even back then, resistance to her strategy was palpable. The eastern state of Saxony, for instance, saw marches organised by the “patriotic” civil rights group Pegida. The Saxon AfD was the first to tap migration as a more sustainable political calling card than EU bailouts. This week the Merz campaign tour stopped in Saxony, now an AfD heartland, where the far-right captured 30.7 per cent in last September’s state election – just one point behind the CDU. Growing migration fatigue – anger at criminal asylum seekers and a fumbled state response – has shifted Germany’s political centre. Less multicultural Berlin and more conservative Saxony: Merz is hoping to catch that wave, reshaping the CDU as centre-right party with a stronger conservative, law-and-order profile. In Dresden, the Saxon capital, Merz conceded that the AfD’s rise is a reflection of others’ political shortcomings. “Me and my party carry a big part of the responsibility,” he said. Amid growing applause, he urged Saxon voters not to “waste” their vote this time around on the AfD. “I want to make sure that the politics of my party is corrected to a point where the so-called Alternative for Germany is no longer needed,” he said, to whoops and cheers. In Dresden, and other campaign appearances, he promised new rules to “limit” migration – but remains vague on whether this correction will include turning back asylum seekers at the border. [ Bundestag MPs reject migration bill by Christian Democratic Union and backed by far-right Alternative for GermanyOpens in new window ] That was a demand in last week’s nonbinding proposals backed by the AfD, which triggered a wave of protest. In Dresden, some 3,000 demonstrated near the Merz event, many carrying signs that simply read: “Disgrace.” “Many people were very unsettled by that vote, particularly those who would have voted for the CDU under the assumption they wouldn’t ally themselves with the AfD,” said Albrecht Pallas, a Saxon MP for the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), which leads Germany’s ruling coalition. “People out here today are worried about the future of our democracy.” Saxon CDU voters – traditionally on the conservative end of the political spectrum – worry about democracy, but for different reasons. “It’s important that democracy survives against growing anti-democratic tendencies,” said Tilo Höhne, a 56-year-old Dresden CDU supporter. “On the other hand, you cannot exclude a quarter of voters from democratic processes indefinitely, or else they will reject democracy itself – which only survives with broad public support.” The party’s current support is steady, but not stellar, nearly three points behind Merkel’s worst election result. Last week’s rebellion of 12 CDU MPs against the migration motion, analysts suggest, reflects wider dissent. “He doesn’t have his party completely behind him,” says Prof Klaus Schubert, political scientist at the University of Münster. “The irony of all this is how Merz, a self-anointed economic expert, has trapped himself with the migration topic when the economy should be the biggest election issue.” Aware of that, Merz is working to shift attention in the last fortnight of the campaign. With Germany heading for a third year of flat growth – a postwar first – the CDU is promising a nine-point action plan for its first 100 days. It wants lower income tax and corporate tax, simplified bureaucracy and a push for higher investment in research and infrastructure – potentially with a reformed debt brake to allow greater borrowing. Critics say the plans are unfunded and lacking detail, unlike the CDU’s detailed plans to undo welfare reforms of the Olaf Scholz coalition. Merz says Germany must be “ready to take on leadership responsibility” in Europe by renewing frayed ties to Paris and Warsaw – in particular to provide a coherent EU response to the Trump administration. On the campaign trail, he has toned down his previous robust rhetoric on arms deliveries to Ukraine. Merz was born in 1955 into a Catholic family in the western Sauerland district. He battled tuberculosis aged 10, went on to study law and was a 33-year-old district court judge in 1989 when he won a seat for the CDU in the third directly elected European Parliament. After one term in Strasbourg he returned to Bonn as one of many young disciples around Helmut Kohl. When Angela Merkel snatched the CDU leadership in 2000 she appointed Merz as her deputy. Sensing his ambition, she dropped him after two years. The animosity was so great that, when she stepped out as leader in 2018, she tried to thwart – twice – his ambition to be CDU leader. [ Angela Merkel thwarted Friedrich Merz’s ambition to succeed her. Now they have buried the hatchetOpens in new window ] He succeeded on the third attempt, to ongoing despair of Merkelist CDU centrists. While Merz hopes his conservative stripes are back in fashion, rivals inside and outside his party never tire of skewering him as an ageing Tory Boy. After he was ousted by Merkel, Merz became a millionaire corporate lawyer who advised the BlackRock investment fund. He described himself as “upper middle class” in an interview, yet flies his own private jet. In the cockpit of his €1 million Austrian-built Diamond DA 62, his call name – in line with aviation rules – is “Foxtrot Mike”. Merz allies insist the rightward shift of the CDU didn’t start last week. Nor, they say, is he turning back the clock entirely. Its new party programme from last May is open to “diverse families” and multiculturalism, but has declared as unwelcome “an Islam that doesn’t share our families and rejects our free society”. The Merz campaign is high-risk and fluid: a centre-right cocktail that is being remixed on a daily basis, with no certainty it will appeal to voter tastes. German political analysts disagree on whether his migration shift was an act of madness – alienating centrist voters and complicating coalition talks – or a master stroke to pull in one third of German voters who are still undecided. For now, fears that Merz damaged the CDU with its Bundestag migration motions appear unfounded. A week on, a Thursday poll showed the CDU had gained one point to 31 per cent in polls – but so, too, had the AfD. It remains in second place on 21 per cent. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Michelin Guide 2025: Will Ireland finally get its first three-star restaurant?

The Michelin Guide Great Britain & Ireland 2025 will be revealed on Monday, February 10th, at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum in Glasgow, an event that can make or break reputations overnight. While British restaurants have long secured three-star status, Ireland remains on the outside looking in. With speculation building, will this finally be the year an Irish restaurant claims the ultimate accolade? Understanding the Michelin system requires some decoding. Not every restaurant listed in the guide holds an award – many are simply included as part of Michelin’s curated selection, a recognition in itself but without the same prestige. Beyond a listing, Michelin has three key distinctions: the Bib Gourmand, the Michelin Star, and the Green Star. The Bib Gourmand, introduced in 1997, is awarded to restaurants that offer particularly good food at moderate prices. It can, on occasion be a stepping stone to a Michelin star, as was the case with Bastible in Dublin, which was awarded a Bib in 2017 and went on to secure a Michelin star in 2022, but that is the exception rather than the rule. [ Ireland’s first Michelin star: ‘It made the front page of the London Times, but only got a mention in the Examiner’Opens in new window ] Michelin stars are awarded in three tiers based solely on food. A single star denotes high-quality cooking “worth a stop”; two stars indicate excellent cooking “worth a detour”; and three stars, the most coveted award, are reserved for “exceptional cuisine worth a special journey.” These broad descriptions leave room for interpretation. Awards ignore service, decor and ambience – a food shack is as eligible as a fine-dining restaurant. The final distinction, the Green Star, introduced in 2020, highlights restaurants leading the way in sustainability. In Ireland, only Kai in Galway holds one. Michelin inspectors, working anonymously across 39 destinations, log more than 250 meals a year, documenting each in detail. They book under aliases and pay their own bills to maintain impartiality. With at least a decade of industry experience, they must possess a refined palate, assess cuisine objectively, and have deep knowledge of global culinary traditions. Restaurants are assessed based on five criteria: ingredient quality, culinary technique, flavour harmony, the chef’s personality in the dishes, and consistency across visits. Decisions are made collectively by the inspection team, ensuring uniform standards globally. Michelin stars are awarded unanimously, with additional visits conducted if opinions differ. [ Michelin-starred restaurants in Ireland, 2024: The complete guideOpens in new window ] Each year there are notable absences due to restaurant closures or significant changes. Wild Honey Inn in Co Clare, long regarded as one of Ireland’s best gastropubs, has now shut its doors and will no longer feature. Eipic in Belfast, which previously held a Michelin star, has also closed. Another possible loss is the Cliff House in Ardmore, Co Waterford, which would have required a further inspection following the departure of chef Tony Parkin, and the time frame to do this may have been too tight. Michelin is known for re-evaluating restaurants following key personnel changes, and if they find standards have slipped, the star could be removed. Lignum in Bullaun, east Galway, has been drawing increasing attention from the Michelin Guide this year, particularly for its focus on wood-fired cooking. Built around a fire-driven approach using embers from kiln-dried birch, ash, and oak, it offers a €145, 10-course tasting menu showcasing seasonal Irish and Italian ingredients. Since opening in 2017, it has been widely tipped for a Michelin star. Lignum is led by Danny Africano in the kitchen and his wife, Molly Keane, running front of house. It pairs its ambitious cooking with a beautifully designed diningroom. With Enda McEvoy’s Loam now closed, JP McMahon’s Aniar is Galway’s only remaining Michelin-starred restaurant. Galway is primed for a second one, and this could well be the year that Lignum claims the accolade. There is considerable speculation about who else might secure a Michelin star, particularly restaurants that have had a change of chef. Ballyfin received three Michelin Keys, a new award that places it among the world’s top hotels. Chef Richard Picard-Edwards, who has extensive Michelin starred experience, joined Ballyfin as executive head chef in April 2023 from the Mandarin Oriental Bittescombe Lodge, and is serving benchmark Michelin-level food on a €145, eight-course menu. When I visited, the Jerusalem artichoke cream was a standout dish, with precisely cut pickled artichoke, caviar, gold leaf, micro herbs, and croutons sitting on top of a silky cream, with umami-rich chicken jelly. [ Two Irish hotels awarded highest honours in new Michelin key awardsOpens in new window ] The listing on the Michelin website describes Ballyfin as offering an exceptional dining experience that matches its luxurious setting, highlighting the kitchen’s technical precision and consistently high standards. With polished, attentive service completing the picture, things are looking very positive for them. Another stunning restaurant and strong contender is the Morrison Room at Carton House, where Adam Nevin (ex The Grill at The Dorchester, The Hand and Flowers and The Westbury in London) delivers a textbook Michelin experience. You’ll find plenty of luxury ingredients on his €110, eight-course tasting menu. The barbecued lobster tail was a highlight when I visited. Jonathan Farrell, formerly of Bastible in Dublin, spent time at top Copenhagen restaurants – including Amass and Relæ – before working at Simon Rogan’s three-star L’Enclume in England’s Lake District. Since taking over as head chef at Gregans Castle last year, he has been firmly on Michelin’s radar. With The Wild Honey Inn now closed, there’s one star fewer in Co Clare, which could well be heading his way. However, there has been little talk of it on the guide’s social media, so maybe it won’t be this year. [ 100 great restaurants, cafes and places to eat in Ireland 2024Opens in new window ] Meanwhile, Alex Greene and Bronagh McCormick, formerly head chef and general manager of the defunct Eipic, have taken the helm at The Buck’s Head Inn in Dundrum, Co Down. With their combined expertise, they are elevating the offering, pairing Greene’s skill with top-quality local produce on an a la carte menu that reflects his talent. This is one to watch. There are a few restaurants that have been receiving increased attention from Michelin inspectors. Mae in Dublin has had multiple visits, which has speculation going, and not surprisingly, Alta, known for its focus on wood-fired cooking, has also been added to the Michelin listings. Landline at Park Hotel in Kenmare is another possibility. It was recently added to the guide. One of the biggest questions leading into this year’s announcement is whether Chapter One by Mickael Viljanen can achieve three-star status. London’s Ledbury, which had long been seen as one of the city’s best restaurants, finally secured three stars last year. Chapter One is in a similar position – highly respected, extensively visited by Michelin inspectors, and widely praised by top chefs. However, Michelin has yet to award three stars to any Irish restaurant, and whether this will be the year they break that pattern is uncertain. Last year, Michelin’s chief inspector revealed little but confirmed that Chapter One remains under close scrutiny, with inspectors closely monitoring its evolution. He hinted that once everything aligns, it will join the ranks of three-star restaurants. “To become a three-star restaurant is to basically say that this is one of the best restaurants in the world. It’s a restaurant that is going to provide an incredible experience. Not only just the sophistication and originality and personality of the cuisine, but there’s also everything else that goes with it,” he said. “So when we make these decisions – and the inspectors absolutely love seeing a new restaurant join the family of three-star restaurants – we have to be very, very sure of our decision.” [ Forget TripAdvisor and Google reviews: How leading Irish chefs find the best restaurants when travelling abroadOpens in new window ] Terre in Castlemartyr, which was awarded two stars last year, may also have its sights set on the highest accolade. Given the difficulty of making the leap from two stars to three, it may take another few years of sustained excellence before it reaches that level. Similarly, Liath and Dede, both currently at two stars, are undoubtedly aiming for the ultimate accolade. However, the bar for three stars is extraordinarily high, and securing the award requires consistently superlative cooking. While some restaurants are widely expected to receive a Michelin star, others seem to be repeatedly overlooked. Library St, Dax, Uno Mas and Forest Avenue are four of the most talked-about omissions. Many in the industry argue that if these restaurants were in London, they would already have a star. Michelin’s choices often spark debate, and if these names remain absent again this year, it will only add to the perception that certain deserving restaurants are being ignored. While the focus tends to be on new one-star recipients and potential three-star elevations, the step from one to two stars is also a significant achievement. Adare Manor and Mount Juliet are two establishments that may be in contention for a second star, though they remain outside bets. Michelin’s decisions in this category are often difficult to predict, as the criteria for moving from one to two stars involve an extra level of finesse and consistency. [ Ten restaurants around Ireland worth travelling to for a unique experienceOpens in new window ] Despite its critics, the Michelin Guide remains a powerful influence in the restaurant industry. A star, or even a listing, can drive bookings, raise a restaurant’s profile, and draw international attention. While some dismiss it as outdated, its influence is undeniable. Even those who claim indifference feel its impact – whether through a surge in reservations after an award or the frustration of being overlooked. Michelin is famously secretive about its process, and surprises are always possible. However, one thing is certain – on February 10th, the future of Irish fine dining will take another step forward, and the country’s top chefs will be watching closely to see who is in, who is out, and who has finally reached the pinnacle of culinary recognition. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Per a report by news agency Reuters, US President Trump has delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico by one month, fueling wild swings in currency, bond and share markets. Despite the turmoil, stock-picking hedge funds that take bets based on company fundamentals recorded an average 2.6% return, their best month since February 2024, given a broader market rally, the report claimed.
