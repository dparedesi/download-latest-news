Middle East Forum Executive Director Gregg Roman described President Donald Trump’s foreign policy approach as one that makes those who harm American interests "pay." One hundred days into his new administration, President Donald Trump has reset negotiations with allies and foes across the globe, and experts say one is certain: it is all transactional. Gone are the days when the U.S. could be drawn to throw its force around the world solely in the name of defending or spreading democracy. Global leaders are learning to speak a new language with U.S. leadership, one that is less about ideology and more about how their interests benefit U.S. interests. "There is a lot more transactional engagement rather than I think we're ideological-based, policy decisions that were sort of the hallmark of the Biden administration," said Gregg Roman, executive director of the Middle East Forum. Here is a round-up of how Trump has changed U.S. foreign policy since taking office: FOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, left, and President Donald Trump are working on a nuclear deal. (West Asia News Agency, Reuters | SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) Former President Joe Biden toyed with reviving a nuclear deal with Iran and criticized Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but his administration made little progress toward serious negotiations. Trump has now expressed interest in a new nuclear deal. He told Israel the U.S. would not come to their aid in attacking Iran until diplomatic negotiations played out. As Trump’s team met with Iranian counterparts in Oman this weekend for a second round of nuclear talks, he issued another threat: if negotiations whither away, the U.S. would not be dragged by Israel into war with Iran but will be "leading the pack." An offensive campaign against Yemen’s Houthi terrorists launched six weeks ago has struck more than 800 targets and cost nearly $1 billion – a sharp departure from the tit-for-tat retaliatory strikes seen under the Biden administration, when Houthis attacked U.S. naval ships and Western commercial vessels. "Biden pursued a policy of retaliatory strikes: If you hit us, we'll hit you," said Roman. "What Trump is trying to do is what I call a salting the earth strategy. If you dare challenge American military supremacy or the ability for us to conduct free trade to the bottom of or through the Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Yemen, Red Sea, Suez … We will attempt to end your ability to wage war on the United States in its interests."

(AP Images/Getty Images) While Biden had promised the U.S. would stand by Ukraine "as long as it takes" in the war against Russia, Trump expressed a desire to see the war come to an end, promising that he could end the war on "day one" of his presidency. One hundred days in, the war is not over. Negotiations are ongoing, and Trump has jumped between sounding off in frustration with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Putin continues to strike even civilian regions of Ukraine, Trump questioned on Saturday whether the Russian leader truly wants peace or is "tapping me along." He again questioned whether he would need to slap "secondary sanctions" on nations that do business with Russia to starve its war coffers. On Monday, Russia offered a three-day ceasefire from May 8-10, but the White House was not satisfied. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump wants a "permanent ceasefire." Trump met face-to-face with Zelenskyy in Rome on Saturday, the first time since their infamous Oval Office spat in February, after slamming Zelenskyy’s latest rejection of his peace proposal, one that would have formally ceded Crimea to the Russians.

(Vatican and Ukraine Ambassador to Holy See) The Monroe Doctrine is back, analysts say, and Trump wants both Greenland and the Panama Canal under U.S. control. The proposals drew shock across the world, but at least in Panama, Trump’s bold words prompted a proposal to offer the U.S. "first and free" passage for its warships, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said earlier this month. It also spurred the proposed sale of two ports of entry from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to U.S.-based BlackRock, though that deal has been delayed by Chinese regulatory and political scrutiny. Efforts to attain Greenland have proved less successful. Tough talk against Denmark and its ownership of Greenland has ratcheted up tensions with the NATO ally and Greenland’s leadership has expressed little interest in becoming a part of the U.S. However, Trump has called out the threat of Russia and China’s increasing arctic military capabilities – the shortest range for a missile to travel from Russia to the U.S. would be over the icy island’s territory. Trump is also interested in the rare earth mining potential of the massive swath of land. President Donald Trump wants the U.S. to control the Panama Canal. (REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo) Trump’s threats to pull out of the NATO alliance – or refuse to come to the defense of allies that do not contribute enough military spending – has left nations across the world planning for the contingency that they may have to defend themselves without U.S. aid. The European Union announced a plan for its nations to spend $840 billion to "re-arm Europe" after Trump halted all aid to Ukraine in March. Countries like Spain, Belgium and Sweden have all announced plans this year to increase defense spending to meet NATO’s 2% target, while eastern European states near Russia’s border, including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Poland, have announced plans to increase defense spending to around 5%. Concern over China’s hegemonic ambitions bridges the partisan divide, but the Biden White House never considered such drastic measures as 145% tariffs. Trump has said the goal of the tariffs is to both bring back US manufacturing after decades of offshore production and punish China for intellectual property theft, a massive trade imbalance, and fentanyl flowing from China to the U.S. A free trade push in the early 2000s had wrongly assumed liberal trade policies would bring democratic values and free markets into Chinese borders, his supporters argue. Trump has insisted that President Xi Jinping wants to cut a deal to lower the soaring tariffs, even as China has rejected the prospect of talks. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It is unclear what sort of realistic concessions the U.S. could get out of a deal, perhaps promises to buy more American-made agricultural products, fuel or other specialty goods. For now, steep tariffs remain, and China is choking off U.S. supply of critical minerals, which could spell deep trouble for everyday electronics, electric vehicles and defense equipment.

By Jem Aswad Executive Editor, Music DJ Khaled and Influence Media Partners have announced the launch of two new joint ventures: The Grammy-winning recording artist, producer and entrepreneur is teaming up with Influence to develop and produce original content across film and television, as well as secure legacy-defining commercial ventures; and Influence will also expand commercial opportunities for Khaled with name, image and likeness (NIL) rights in certain exclusive categories. Influence also has invested in the rights to Khaled’s music catalog, including recorded-music and publishing, which will grow to 14 studio albums with the release of his next project. Related Stories VIP+ What Warner Bros. Can Learn From Netflix About Video Game Strategy Nikki Glaser Cut Caitlyn Jenner Joke From Comedy Central Roast After She Threatened to Pull Out of Event: 'I Just Needed to Hear It From Her' Sources tell Variety the deal is in the low nine-figure range. Popular on Variety Khaled’s long list of musical collaborators includes Jay-Z, Beyonce, Justin Bieber, Drake, Quavo, Chance the Rapper, Lil Wayne and many others. Terms of the deal were not disclosed further; several film projects are currently in various stages of development as a result of the alliance, according to the announcement. Founded in 2019, Influence Media’s investment strategy is built on “modern evergreens,” songs, and diverse artists with a strong potential for long-term impact on pop culture. The latest round of capital also follows the launch of Influence’s independent record label, music publishing and distribution company, Slang, which signed Will Smith last year. Backed by BlackRock and Warner Music Group, Influence’s latest fund has secured more than 30 music-rights investments, also including Enrique Iglesias, Blake Shelton, Jessie Reyez, songwriter-producer Julia Michaels, and others; in January it secured $360 million in debt financing. Khaled said, “I’m proud that my legacy will continue to resonate and connect with audiences around the world with this partnership through Influence Media. These iconic recordings I’ve created will continue to be curated in the most optimum manner to impact culture with nearly two decades of music. In addition, I’m excited for the world to see and experience the film and television projects Influence and We The Best are developing and producing together. This next phase of my career will be filled with ground-breaking cultural impact, and I look forward to being at the forefront in all categories.” “Influence Media was founded on the principle that music can move culture, and few entertainers embody this more than DJ Khaled,” said Lylette Pizarro, Influence Media Founder and Co-Managing Partner. “Our joint venture NIL deal, and extended catalog partnership is an alliance that will create boundless opportunities for this creative genius, and will also further establish that DJ Khaled is a rare talent whose abilities extend far beyond the traditional confines of music. His enormous creativity, heart, and drive are matched only by his savvy business instincts and that is why the possibilities of what we can build together in this collaboration are immeasurable.” “DJ Khaled has had so many iconic eras in his career to date, and we couldn’t be more excited to build ‘another one’ through this first-of-its-kind partnership,” says Rene McLean, Influence Media Partner and CEO of Slang. “Much in the same way that all the top artists consider a DJ Khaled collab a major career milestone, we think of this as a huge step forward for Slang.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Best Crypto to Buy Now as Crypto Market Shifts Bullish. Could Altcoins Rally?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After a two-month-long downfall, which saw the total market cap of the top meme coins fall from $116.6B to just $40B, the meme coin market is up and running again. It has gained a staggering 45% in market cap in around three weeks. Moreover, last week, Bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest inflows ($3B) since December. Plus, according to a recent forecast by financial services company Standard Chartered, we could see $BTC touching $120K by Q2 2025. Seeing as it’s only the beginning of what could be a long rally, now’s the best time to beef up your crypto portfolio with some trendy altcoins. To help you out, we’ve handpicked the best crypto to buy now. There’s really no denying that Donald Trump has taken crypto to new heights. For instance, the massive rally in November was on the back of the promises he made in his presidential campaign to make the US more crypto-friendly. Trump indeed delivered on his promises, as we’re now seeing an unprecedented increase in government-level Bitcoin reserves worldwide. Large institutions like Strategy and BlackRock are also buying $BTC left, right, and center. So, it’s only fair that Donald Trump’s very own meme coin, $TRUMP, is strongly placed in the list of the top trending cryptos. $TRUMP has jumped over 50% in the last seven days, and more than 32% in the last month or so. It’s worth noting, however, that $TRUMP is still nowhere close to its full potential. Remember, it reached around $72 when it launched in late January. Another reason to be optimistic about $TRUMP’s future is the president’s direct interest in the project’s prosperity. For instance, he recently announced that the top 220 $TRUMP holders will be invited to dinner with him. It’s worth remembering that an enthusiastic meme coin market is often the result of the king cryptocurrency, i.e., Bitcoin, soaring to new heights. If you want to make the most of Bitcoin’s rise specifically, consider investing in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL), the best Bitcoin-themed crypto on the market right now. While other coins offer more of their own tokens for free as part of their airdrops, $BTCBULL stands out by offering free (and real) $BTC in its airdrops. This is also how it has tied itself to Bitcoin’s success story. BTC Bull Token’s airdrops will take place every time $BTC crosses a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Keep in mind that you’ll only be eligible for your share of free Bitcoins if you store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. What’s more, the developers have also planned to follow a steady burn mechanism, which involves reducing the token’s total supply bit by bit at regular intervals. This is done to boost the token’s demand, trading volume, and ultimately its price. You can join the ‘Bull Army’ by joining the $BTCBULL presale for just $0.002485 per token. The project has raised over $5.1M so far. Want in? Here’s a full guide on how to buy $BTCBULL. Jelly-My-Jelly is a meme coin on the Solana network created by Iqram Magdon-Ismail, the co-founder of Venmo, and Sam Lessin, a crypto investor. On paper, $JEELYJELLY has been touted as the crypto that grants holders early-bird access to the upcoming Jelly Jelly video-sharing app. The app will reportedly offer the fastest way to post bite-sized clips, known as ‘Jellies,’ from a video chat. However, the token’s current bull run is driven by community backing rather than anything else. Jelly-My-Jelly’s recent performance has been just as delicious as its name. It has rocketed 200% in the last seven days – from around $0.012 to $0.033. It’s currently flirting with its major resistance level of $0.40, the break of which could see it shoot to new highs and result in even more mind-boggling gains. Solaxy ($SOLX) is unlike most other meme coins mentioned on this list. That’s because it’s a token with real utility and real-world application. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on Solana, which has been plagued with congestion and scalability issues ever since the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on it. Meme coin developers prefer Solana because of its high speed and low fees. However, because the network is now experiencing an overload of meme coin traders and investors, it’s no longer as smooth a blockchain as it once was. Solaxy will solve this by processing a bunch of Solana’s transactions on a sidechain. By redirecting transaction requests away from the network’s mainnet, Solaxy will reduce the burden on Solana and restore its speed of executing transactions. Additionally, Solaxy will club several transaction requests and process them together, thereby reducing transaction costs and improving Solana’s affordability. For more info, check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy. ai16z is the first-ever decentralized venture capital firm to use the inputs of AI agents for its decision-making. This unique AI-powered trading fund is based on the Solana blockchain. Unlike traditional venture capital firms that need a lot of time and manpower for research before investing, ai16z will bank on cutting-edge AI agents to collect and analyze data, including market sentiments. $AI16Z is already up 97% in the last seven days, but it has only just broken out of a descending resistance line. This means that there could be more gains in store, including a potential run to the $0.60 level, which would result in a nearly 200% upmove from its current price of $0.3021. Even though the current sentiment among crypto investors is positive, it’s worth remembering that crypto is one market where things, especially future outlooks, can change quickly. With that in mind, you must always invest cautiously, which includes only throwing in an amount you’re comfortable losing. Finally, kindly do your own research before investing.

Title: The Quiet Revolution In Asset Markets And Tokenization
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/29/the-quiet-revolution-in-asset-markets-and-tokenization/

BySean Lee BySean Lee, Contributor. Tokenization and the Financial System Forum during the World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings at the ... More International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters in Washington, Wednesday, April 23, 2025. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) When Mantra’s $OM token crashed in the start of April, crypto skeptics had their moment. Another real-world assets (RWAs) blockchain project bites the dust, they said. Traditional finance would surely retreat from tokenization experiments. The crash wiped out millions in value overnight, adding to the long list of crypto’s cautionary tales. Then, something strange happened. The money kept flowing in, but not to speculative tokens. Instead, it flowed to RWAs on the blockchain. BlackRock continued building. Franklin Templeton doubled down. By April, total value locked (TVL) in tokenized assets crossed the $20 billion mark. While experts speculated the Mantra collapse would scare institutions away, it showed them exactly what not to do. Asset managers discovered something valuable in blockchain’s infrastructure. They began moving Treasury bills, rental income, and private credit onto chains. Global markets used to run on these fundamental assets. And now they run faster. Institutional adoption brings new demands for blockchain infrastructure. Zero Hash exemplifies this shift, processing over $2 billion in tokenized fund flows across 22 blockchains in just four months. Their rails now support seven different stablecoins, powering settlements for giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Regulatory compliance drives innovation, too. Chintai secured licenses from Singapore’s MAS for compliant issuance and trading. Their Nexus platform now handles $675 million in tokenized value, with ambitious plans to reach $10 billion this year. The focus on regulation attracts serious institutional capital — their recent partnerships with RealNOI bringing $570 million in rental income on-chain and Kin Capital’s tokenized $100M real estate debt fund are just a few examples. It’s these infrastructure providers that lay the groundwork for specialized innovation. Money market funds move trillions of dollars daily through global markets. These funds form the backbone of institutional cash management, yet they still settle through systems designed decades ago. Franklin Templeton saw an opportunity to change this. Jiritsu’s $JUSD stablecoin launch on BNB Chain started modestly — just $1 million in TVL — but brought something new to market. Their MintBurn system provides real-time proof of reserves, letting users verify their backing at any moment. The stablecoin draws its stability from Franklin Templeton’s BENJI U.S. Money Market Fund, creating a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain efficiency. Traditional stablecoins rely on monthly attestations, while Jiritsu’s system updates these proofs continuously. Users see exactly what backs their assets and when those assets move. No more waiting for monthly reports or trusting third-party auditors. The project’s second phase aims beyond simple scaling. Its permissionless framework could allow any regulated fund to bring assets on-chain using the same infrastructure. For instance, money market funds represent a $7 trillion market globally. Just moving even a fraction of that onto blockchain infrastructure could reshape institutional cash management. While it’s true that tokenized assets require lots of infrastructure, they also need liquidity. Major market makers spotted this opportunity early. Jane Street began providing liquidity for BlackRock’s tokenized funds in February. Citadel Securities launched a dedicated digital asset desk focusing exclusively on regulated, tokenized securities. That means traditional finance wants to shape how these assets trade. And the performance data backs their interest. RWA tokens weathered recent market volatility better than their purely crypto counterparts. CHEX, powering Chintai’s regulated platform, maintained stability during the March downturn. The token’s value reflects growing institutional confidence in regulated tokenization platforms. Innovation spreads beyond conventional financial instruments. RealNOI and Kin Capital’s partnerships with Chintai demonstrates the potential for alternative income streams. Their platform tokenizes rental income from 1,900 apartments, offering investors exposure to real estate cash flows without the burden of property management. Projected annual returns above 5% attracted both crypto natives and traditional real estate investors. Other experiments push boundaries further. Republic’s private credit platform brought traditionally illiquid loans on-chain. Zero Hash expanded beyond simple settlement, building specialized rails for dividend distributions and corporate actions. Each successful implementation creates a template for other institutions to follow. The Mantra collapse shook market confidence in March. Excessive leverage had amplified volatility, triggering a wave of liquidations across the platform. Beyond immediate losses, the incident forced hard questions about risk management in RWA protocols. Market data reveals broader sector resilience. Through April, Maple Finance saw institutional deposits climb steadily. Their focus remained simple: conservative lending backed by verified assets. Circle’s USDC expanded into settlement layers for tokenized securities. Even BlackRock pushed forward with their BUIDL initiative, treating Mantra’s troubles as an isolated case. This resilience stems from fundamental differences in RWA tokens. Real assets generate actual cash flows. Treasury yields arrive on schedule. Rental income flows monthly. These are productive assets made more efficient through tokenization, and that’s why big institutions continue to back them. Regulatory frameworks for tokenized assets evolve unevenly across markets. Singapore’s MAS cleared the path with precise guidelines. Hong Kong welcomed tokenized funds with open arms. The U.S. SEC moves cautiously but steadily, evaluating each regulated tokenization proposal. Technical innovation has evolved hand-in-hand with regulatory progress, transforming compliance processes into automated systems. Verification systems deliver transparency without compromising security. These advances streamline institutional participation while maintaining regulatory standards. The impact of these changes becomes clearer each month. Traditional finance and blockchain efficiency draw closer each month. Banks reimagine settlement through tokenization. Asset managers experiment with programmable securities. Trading desks adapt to handle digital assets. Every step forward cements RWAs as crucial components of tomorrow’s financial infrastructure.

Title: Full Speed Ahead: It’s Been a Fast-Paced Year for Nonbanks

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy While the rise of alternative lenders and debt funds has created buzz around a relatively new side of finance, the industry of private credit really came into its own over the last 12 months. And its activities can be seen all over the Power Finance list. As billions of dollars of commercial real estate assets struggled to be refinanced at maturity, and dozens of construction projects cried out for bridge and senior financing to either get off the ground or sprint across the finish line, private credit emerged in 2024 as a flexible, and dependable, source of capital. “It’s been an incredible positive for the industry, and the amount of liquidity that’s come in, on the credit side, is staggering, and it’s clearly coming from the debt funds,” said Tom Traynor, vice chairman and co-head of large loans at CBRE (CBRE). The numbers don’t lie. Between 2013 and 2023, U.S. private credit — corporate and real estate loans originated by private, nonbank lenders — grew from $141 billion to $853 billion, according to the financial data provider Preqin. The number now stands at $1.7 trillion, and BlackRock predicts that the global private credit market will double over the next five years and reach $3.5 trillion by 2030. Private credit used to be limited to a few, select opportunity funds financing mezzanine pieces, but today this industry finances the full spectrum of commercial real estate assets and deals in highly complex loan packages. Moreover, alternative lenders believe they can offer their borrowers services that banks either can’t do or won’t provide, particularly speed of execution and the ability to take over stalled projects and foreclosures due to their vertically integrated structure. “There’s a whole slew of borrowers for whom bank financing just doesn’t make sense. There’s not enough proceeds, and they can’t go high enough in leverage,” explained Marcello Cricco-Lizza, principal of global commercial real estate at Balbec Capital. “Whereas, we can add higher leverage on our loans, and have the sophistication to take over those properties and work them out that banks don’t have.” And, while commercial banks still dominate the global credit space, many traditional lenders have decided it’s wiser to join up with the debt funds rather than to simply fight them for clients. This has created an entire industry of “lender financing,” where banks lend to debt funds to get their hands on the biggest CRE deals out there. Through warehouse-type facilities and repurchase structures (repos) — which include note-on-note finances, joint venture uni-trench loans, and single-asset repos — the banks have been able to originate safer CRE loans that receive better capital treatment and that place balance sheet risk in the hands of safer sponsors. Scott Rechler, chairman of RXR, argued that banks like to be lenders to nonbanks due to the favorable credit treatment and the better collateral, as well as the fact that whole loans provided to the funds are often broken up to disentangle risk — which is also easier for borrowers to live with. “What we’re finding is an interesting simpatico, where everyone is finding their home and it works for all pieces,” said Rechler.

Title: Three Zones Of Safety For Investors In Uncertain Times

ByRob Kaplan ByRob Kaplan, Contributor. Demonstrators hold a banner reading "Climate Justice" during a mass climate march to demand urgent ... More action on the climate crisis from world leaders attending the COP25 summit, in Madrid, on December 6, 2019. - The main march takes place in Madrid on the sidelines of the UN climate conference, with a simultaneous rally in the Chilean capital, which had been due to host the 12-day gathering but was forced to pull out due to deadly anti-government protests. (Photo by GABRIEL BOUYS / AFP) (Photo by GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP via Getty Images) Could now be a moment of opportunity for investors looking to make money and a positive impact? That idea may sound nutty amid unprecedented uncertainty and a dramatic rise in anti-environment rhetoric and actions in the macro environment. If you’re spooked by the headlines, you’re not alone. But once you cut through the noise, opportunities reveal themselves and the reality starts to look a bit different. While the language around climate commitments may be shifting, many of the most influential players, from institutional investors to global corporates, are continuing undeterred. The commitments remain. The capital is still flowing. And for investors willing to look beyond the political theater, there is absolutely a way forward — possibly an even more lucrative one. Yes, uncertainty is in the air. But here are three zones of safety I believe can weather the pushback and continue to deliver strong returns in the sustainability space. 1. Sustainability agendas are global and will continue to drive investment opportunities. Asia is a case in point. It’s not all about the United States. While climate and DEI are being leveraged for political points in the West, the demand for solutions to our greatest social and environmental challenges continues to grow. And here, the rest of the world has an opportunity to step up and fill in the gap. Asia is a case in point. As we look forward, GDP in Asia is outpacing the rest of the world. Vietnam (6%), Indonesia (5.2%), and India (7%) are projected to be among the world’s fastest-growing economies in 2025, according to the IMF. Unlike stagnating developed markets, the region provides a clearer long-term growth trajectory, supported by rising consumer demand, a burgeoning middle class, and sustained infrastructure investment. This growth has drawn increasing attention from global investors. In January 2025, responsAbility Investments secured over $350 million for its Asia Climate Strategy, with more than half coming from private sector investors. Just earlier this month, ABC Impact, a Singapore-based private equity firm focused on Asia, closed its second fund at over $600 million, with clean energy and climate resilience among its core focus areas. Climate-focused funds in the region are gaining traction, underscoring the appetite for both impact and market-rate returns. At the same time, many investors are starting to question preconceived notions about the risks of emerging markets. In today’s environment, the traditional view that developed markets are inherently “safer” no longer holds. Achieving strong returns in the U.S. and Europe increasingly means navigating high corporate debt levels, currently around 80% of GDP in the U.S., slower economic growth, and policy uncertainty. By contrast, high-growth markets in Asia offer not only stronger fundamentals, but also greater resilience. That’s why more investors are turning to the Asian market: not just for upside potential, but as part of a more balanced and forward-looking risk management strategy. A recent study by the GIIN on the state of impact investing in Asia found that there is a growing opportunity for impact investors to use private capital to support these economies. To be clear, these are market-rate investments that should be of particular interest to Asia-focused investors, 76% of whom are focused on risk-adjusted, market-return investments. Look at companies like Renew Power in India, which has grown from a small startup into one of the country’s largest renewable energy companies with over 12 GW of operational capacity and backing from global investors like Goldman Sachs. Or consider Indonesia’s GoTo, which is rapidly transitioning its massive ride-hailing fleet to electric vehicles while building the charging infrastructure to support it. Thailand’s Energy Absolute has evolved from a biodiesel producer into a vertically integrated clean energy powerhouse spanning solar farms, EV manufacturing, and battery production. These aren't charity cases — they're market-driven opportunities that happen to be solving critical sustainability challenges. 2. The climate transition can’t be rolled back, but the reputational calculus has changed Climate investing is here to stay. Yes, U.S.-based asset managers (hello, BlackRock) may be getting cold feet, and even in Europe, there are signs they may consider watering down some of their sustainability requirements for corporations working in the Eurozone. But everyone should take a deep breath. The pushback is already getting pushback. The FT has already reported that large U.K.-based pension funds are sticking to their climate commitments and challenging asset managers who are walking back their climate commitments. That’s significant. These pensions are ultimately accountable to their constituents, and funds like Brunel Pension and Nest are making it clear: climate alignment still matters, and they expect their managers to course-correct. Similarly, TPG’s Tim Coulter recently went on record that his firm is bullish on impact and expected them to ramp up their fundraising for climate-related strategies. When one of private equity's most successful investors sees opportunity in climate, it's worth paying attention. Perhaps more importantly, while public equity sustainability strategies faced outflows in the first quarter, the private markets are telling a different story. Capital is coming back into key areas of the sustainability space, especially through venture and private equity. PitchBook data shows that VC and PE firms poured more than $5 billion into climate-tech startups across the US in the first quarter, up 65% from the previous year. As for multinational corporates, many are discovering that aspirational climate talk no longer earns reputational points, not if it’s not backed up by meaningful action. The reputational value of saying the right thing has flipped; the cost of failing to deliver is now higher than the benefit of making bold but unsubstantiated promises. Just look at BlackRock: Larry Fink’s climate positioning earned the firm goodwill, until it became clear that those values weren’t fully embedded in strategy. That made it all too easy to walk them back when the political winds shifted. When it comes to multinational corporates, they have global commitments that are going to be hard to pare back. They do, after all, need to factor in climate risk to their business strategies. In fact, leaders coming out of Davos in January expressed conviction that many global corporates are sticking to their knitting when it comes to their net-zero and other climate commitments. What we’ll see next isn’t more big climate pledges. It’s deeper integration of climate strategies into business models, and a stronger focus on tangible results. That’s where capital will go, and where value will be created. 3. Opportunities to invest in the circular economy and materials transition will continue to ramp up. The transition toward circular economy business models represents one of the most undervalued investment opportunities in the sustainability space, particularly in emerging markets where growth equity can capture outsized returns. Why? Because future growth rates for critical materials are expected to significantly outpace historical patterns across all demand scenarios, especially in absolute terms. This demand is fueled by an increasingly complex global trade picture, thanks to trade wars and tariffs, pushing domestic and local / regional trade to the fore. There’s a massive gap between corporate commitments and the actual availability of circular solutions across multiple material streams. This disconnect is global but especially pronounced in high-growth markets where recycling value chains remain highly fragmented — a perfect opportunity for investors who understand both sustainability and supply chain dynamics. Take packaging as just one example. Demand for plastic packaging continues climbing steadily, driven partly by a preference for plastics' short use-cycle and pervasive nature. This demand is fueling the need for more sustainable packaging solutions as efforts to increase circular plastic systems and develop effective recycling systems continue to grow. But similar opportunities exist across textiles, construction materials, e-waste, and other consumer goods. With circular business models still in their infancy across most sectors, investors have a singular opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Companies that can establish early leadership in creating high-quality recycled materials at scale will likely become acquisition targets for major packaging companies desperate to drive resiliency in their supply chains. Political winds will always shift, but the fundamental drivers of sustainability investments — resource scarcity, climate risk, consumer demand, and corporate commitments — aren't going away. Smart investors are looking beyond the headlines to identify opportunities where these forces create market inefficiencies they can capitalize on. The three zones I’ve outlined — global sustainability investments (particularly in Asia), climate transition commitments from institutional investors and corporates, and the materials transition — represent areas where capital can find both impact and returns regardless of political rhetoric. For investors willing to take a slightly contrarian stance in today’s environment, these zones of safety might not just offer protection — they could provide some of the most compelling risk-adjusted returns of the decade. Sometimes the best investments are made when others are running scared.

Title: A Vanishing $212M Bitcoin Order Caused Chaos for Traders. Is Spoofing Back in Crypto?
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/04/29/a-vanishing-usd212m-bitcoin-order-caused-chaos-for-traders-is-spoofing-back-in-crypto
Time Published: 2025-04-29T13:06:04Z
Full Content:
On April 14, someone put in a sell order for 2,500 bitcoin, worth roughly $212 million, on the Binance order book at $85,600, around 2-3% above the spot prices trading at the time. Seeing such a large order, the bitcoin price started to gravitate to this level at around 17:00 UTC. Suddenly, the order was gone, as seen using Coin Glass data, which caused a brief moment of market apathy as bulls and bears tussled to fill a void in liquidity. The bitcoin price at the time, however, was already on shaky ground due to geopolitical concerns. Subsequently, it went lower after the vanishing order caused chaos for the traders. So what happened? One answer could be an illegal technique that involves placing a large limit order to rile trading activity and then removing the order once the price comes close to filling it. This is called "order spoofing," defined by the 2010 U.S. Dodd-Frank Act as "the illegal practice of bidding or offering with the intent to cancel before execution." As seen in the liquidity heatmap in the image above, on the surface, the order with a price of $85,600 seemed like a key area of resistance, which is why market prices started to gravitate towards it. However, in reality, that order and liquidity were likely spoofed, giving traders the illusion of a stronger market. Liquidity heatmaps visualize an order book on an exchange and show how much of an asset rests on the book at each price point. Traders will use a heatmap to identify areas of support and resistance or even to target and squeeze under-pressure positions. In this particular case, the trader seemed to have placed a possible spoof order when the U.S. equity market was closed, usually a time period of low liquidity for the 24/7 bitcoin market. The order was then removed when the U.S. market opened as the price moved towards filling it. This could still have had the desired effect, as, for instance, a large order on one exchange might spur traders or algorithms on another exchange to remove their order, creating a void in liquidity and subsequent volatility. Another reason could be that the trader placing a $212 million sell order on Binance wanted to create short-term sell pressure to get filled on limit buys, and then they removed that order once those buys were filled. Both options are plausible, albeit still illegal. Former ECB analyst and current managing director of Oak Security, Dr. Jan Philipp, told CoinDesk that manipulative trading behavior is a "systemic vulnerability, especially in thin, unregulated markets." "These tactics give sophisticated actors a consistent edge over retail traders. And unlike TradFi, where spoofing is explicitly illegal and monitored, crypto exists in a gray zone." He added that "spoofing needs to be taken seriously as a threat as it helped trigger the 2010 Flash Crash in traditional markets, which erased almost $1 trillion in market value." Binance, meanwhile, insists that it is playing its part in preventing market manipulation. "Maintaining a fair and orderly trading environment is our top priority and we invest in internal and external surveillance tools that continuously monitor trading in real-time, flagging inconsistencies or patterns that deviate from normal market behavior," a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk, without directly addressing the case of the vanishing $212 million order. The spokesperson added that if anyone is found manipulating markets, it will freeze accounts, report suspicious activity to regulators, or remove bad actors from its platform. Spoofing, or a strategy that mimics a fake order, is illegal, but for a young industry such as crypto, history is rife with such examples. During 2014, when there was little to no regulatory oversight, the majority of trading volume took place on bitcoin-only exchanges from retail traders and cypherpunks, opening the industry to such practices. During 2017's ICO phase, when trading volume skyrocketed, tactics such as spoofing were also expected, as institutions were still skeptical about the asset class. In 2017 and 2018, traders regularly placed nine-figure positions that they had no intention of filling, only to pull the order shortly after. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes said in a 2017 blog post that he "found it incredible" that spoofing was illegal. He argued that if a smart trader wanted to buy $1 billion of BTC, they would bluff a $1 billion sell order to get it filled. However, since the 2021 bull market, the crypto market has experienced waves of institutional adoption, such as Coinbase (COIN) going public, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) going all-in on bitcoin, and BlackRock launching exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the time of writing, there are no such large orders that indicate further spoofing attempts, and spoofing attempts have seemed to have become less blatant. However, even with billions traded by TradFi firms, examples of such a strategy still exist across many crypto exchanges, particularly on low-liquidity altcoins. For example, last month, cryptocurrency exchange MEXC announced that it had reined in a rise in market manipulation. An internal investigation found a 60% increase in market manipulation attempts from Q4 of 2024 to this first quarter of this year. In February, a trader manipulated the HyperLiquid JELLY market by tricking a pricing oracle, and HyperLiquid's response to the activity was met with skepticism and a subsequent outflow of capital. The burden ultimately lies with the exchanges and regulators. "Regulators should set the baseline," Dr. Jan Philipp told CoinDesk." [Regulators] should define what counts as manipulation, specify penalties and outline how platforms must respond." The regulators have certainly tried to clamp down on such schemes. In 2020, rogue trader Avi Eisenberg was found guilty of manipulating decentralized exchange Mango Markets in 2022, but the cases have been few and far between. However, crypto exchanges must also "step up their surveillance systems" and use circuit breakers while employing stricter listing requirements to clamp down on market manipulation, Philipp said. "Retail users won't stick around if they keep getting front-run, spoofed and dumped on. If crypto wants to outgrow its casino phase, we need infrastructure that rewards fair participation, not insider games," Philipp concluded.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/29/2025 5:25:56 AM PDT by Red Badger The attempts on President Trump’s life were one of the most disturbing and suspicious events in modern political history, especially the one in Butler, Pa. And yet, barely anyone in the media seems interested in asking real questions. They’re not the least bit curious about what happened, and it’s starting to feel like they want us to forget it ever happened. But that’s not going to happen… Thanks to people like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, the curtain is still being yanked back, and what’s behind it should send chills down every American’s spine. From a house scrubbed cleaner than Hillary Clinton’s email server to a shooter with no internet footprint to a random live CNN feed of a rally in the middle of nowhere, the details surrounding the Butler assassination attempt are filled with questions, and at this point, it’s starting to feel like a scandal. Most people don’t believe the “lone wolf” story the media tried to sell us. Many conclude that this was something much darker, and the more you hear about it, the harder it is to ignore that fact. In this powerful chat, Joe and Elon break down just how bizarre and disturbing this entire story really is. They go through the strange facts one by one, from the assassin’s spotless house and missing online life to the shady ties to BlackRock, mind-blowing Secret Service failures, and the suspicious lack of transparency from federal officials. These questions are very serious, yet nobody in power seems willing to answer them. Wall Street Apes: Never stop talking about this Joe Rogan and Elon Musk point out the INSANE details surrounding the Butler, Pennsylvania Donald Trump assassination attempt shooter – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no ... sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. It’s absolutely mind-boggling that a former and now current president could survive two assassination attempts, and the national media hasn’t delved into it. Where are the big New York Times and WAPO investigations that would usually follow such a monumental story? This type of cover-up is what happens when you don’t have a real press. Because when the media stops being honest, corruption festers, propaganda takes over, and the American people are force-fed a diet of lies while the real bad guys stay hidden in the shadows, totally free to plot their next move. And because of this, we can’t stop demanding the truth.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Thanks to people like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, the curtain is still being yanked back, and what’s behind it should send chills down every American’s spine. From a house scrubbed cleaner than Hillary Clinton’s email server to a shooter with no internet footprint to a random live CNN feed of a rally in the middle of nowhere, the details surrounding the Butler assassination attempt are filled with questions, and at this point, it’s starting to feel like a scandal. Most people don’t believe the “lone wolf” story the media tried to sell us. Many conclude that this was something much darker, and the more you hear about it, the harder it is to ignore that fact. In this powerful chat, Joe and Elon break down just how bizarre and disturbing this entire story really is. They go through the strange facts one by one, from the assassin’s spotless house and missing online life to the shady ties to BlackRock, mind-blowing Secret Service failures, and the suspicious lack of transparency from federal officials. These questions are very serious, yet nobody in power seems willing to answer them. Wall Street Apes: Never stop talking about this Joe Rogan and Elon Musk point out the INSANE details surrounding the Butler, Pennsylvania Donald Trump assassination attempt shooter – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no ... sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. It’s absolutely mind-boggling that a former and now current president could survive two assassination attempts, and the national media hasn’t delved into it. Where are the big New York Times and WAPO investigations that would usually follow such a monumental story? This type of cover-up is what happens when you don’t have a real press. Because when the media stops being honest, corruption festers, propaganda takes over, and the American people are force-fed a diet of lies while the real bad guys stay hidden in the shadows, totally free to plot their next move. And because of this, we can’t stop demanding the truth.

Because when the media stops being honest, corruption festers, propaganda takes over, and the American people are force-fed a diet of lies while the real bad guys stay hidden in the shadows, totally free to plot their next move. And because of this, we can’t stop demanding the truth.

Title: Forbes Daily: How Palantir Has Bucked The Stock Market’s Downward Trend

Nearly 15 years ago, Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett teamed up to start the Giving Pledge, which encouraged the super wealthy to donate at least half their fortunes to charity. Since then, it’s gone from 40 members to 245. The group now includes members from 30 countries, though they represent just 8% of the world’s 3,028 billionaires. Ahead of its anniversary, Forbes spoke with five members about why they joined, what they’ve learned and what more they’d like to see happen. “Sooner rather than later I realized that wealth comes with both responsibility and opportunity,” says Rohini Nilekani, who is married to Infosys billionaire Nandan Nilekani. Still, fewer pledgers have joined in recent years, and there’s no way to know how many have actually fulfilled their promise. AFP via Getty Images The stock market has stumbled during President Donald Trump’s first 100 days, but one controversial company is bucking the trend: AI giant and government contractor Palantir, chaired by longtime Trump backer Peter Thiel. The company’s stock has jumped 54% since January 17, the strongest return of any company listed on the S&P 500, though the firm has faced criticism over a $30 million contract with ICE on a program to assist the agency in deportations. The Trump Administration signaled a plan that will indirectly lower tariffs on foreign-made auto parts needed to manufacture cars in the U.S., the Wall Street Journal reported, prompting automaker shares to inch up in premarket trading. While automakers will need to pay 25% tariffs on foreign-made components beginning May 3, a reported tweak to the rule will allow them to seek partial reimbursement for those levies. President Donald Trump said revenue from tariffs may “completely” eliminate income taxes for many people in the U.S., but one economic study said it would be “mathematically impossible.” The Department of Homeland Security has collected $15.86 billion in customs and excise taxes so far in April, an increase of about $6 billion from March, though the White House is still negotiating with other countries, so it’s unclear how much the tariffs will ultimately bring to U.S. coffers. Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images In an interview with The Atlantic, President Donald Trump boasted that he runs “the world” and is “having a lot of fun,” after the publication called his cellphone and he answered. Though Trump has previously criticized the magazine, he touched on several issues, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of the Signal chat app, the alleged deportations of Americans and Silicon Valley’s warming to him. MORE: Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) introduced seven articles of impeachment against Trump on Monday afternoon, saying the president has “ignored the very checks and balances that keep our democracy intact.” The articles are the first formal impeachment effort of Trump's second term, though they are almost certain to fail in Congress. Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the decision to deport three children from Louisiana who were U.S. citizens, saying it was their mothers who were deported and chose to take their children with them. “You guys just make it sound like I say, ‘Just kick down the door and grab the 2-year-old’ and threw them on an airplane. That’s misleading, that’s just not true,” Rubio said. Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney has secured a full term in power, and his Liberal Party was projected to win the Canadian national elections Monday. Carney, who won his seat with a comfortable 30-point margin, addressed the tension between Canada and the U.S. in his victory speech, telling supporters that “Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never happen.” Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine from May 8 to 10 while Russia celebrates the end of World War II, as peace talks between the U.S., Ukraine and Russia have dragged on. President Donald Trump has indicated he is losing patience with Putin, and Secretary Rubio signaled recently the U.S. would walk away from the discussions if progress was not made soon. President Donald Trump has long battled with the media, but he’s increasingly using government resources to attack it. As polls published in the last week from outlets like the New York Times, ABC News, the Washington Post and Fox News show him with net negative approval ratings, Trump has called the pollsters “negative criminals.” His administration has elevated right-wing voices in the White House press corps and sought to effectively shut down federally funded media outlets, and new FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr has launched investigations into several outlets. ILLUSTRATION BY CECILIA RUNXI ZHANG FOR FORBES; IMAGES BY GOOGLE GEMINI AI There’s good news for savers in fairly high tax brackets: Yields on municipal bonds are good, comfortably ahead of what you can clear from Treasury bonds. But the bad news is it is easy to be gouged buying either individual bonds or high-fee funds. Municipal bonds are worth considering for any fixed-income money you have in taxable accounts. Patrick Haskell, who oversees a $182 billion pile of them at BlackRock, says: “We haven’t had the opportunity to invest at these levels of real and nominal yields since the financial crisis.” The numbers he has in mind: For bonds due in 10 years, tax-exempt yields are 80% of U.S. Treasury yields, not bad for anyone destined to pay a tax of 20% or more on interest. At the 30-year mark the percentage is close to 100%. There is a catch with the long munis, having to do with the risk they will be called in early, but they remain very attractive even after allowance for this risk. Are you interested in collecting 4% interest federally tax-free? There are too many choices. Fidelity has on its sale counter 138,000 individual tax-exempt bonds. You could get a fund, but even so there is a selection process. YCharts counts 3,700, including all the share classes. On individual bonds our advice is simple: Don’t buy them. As for funds: Forbes narrowed the roster of those worth looking at to 40. WHY IT MATTERS “The U.S. equity market has been volatile and discouraging this year—so investors are looking at making their portfolios more conservative,” says Forbes senior contributor William Baldwin. “Inside an IRA or 401(k) they’d select a taxable bond fund.

Title: Economy Likely Grew At Weakest Rate In Nearly 3 Years, Experts Say

As recession fears reverberate from Washington to Wall Street, Wednesday brought the most comprehensive yardstick yet of the health of the U.S. economy yet as the government released the first estimate of the country’s gross domestic product over the first three months of 2025. Some measures tracking U.S. economic activity predict the U.S. economy actually shrank during the ... More first three months of 2025. Pictured is the Port of Long Beach. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew -0.3% on a quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annual rate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That is the weakest economic growth for the U.S. since 2022’s first quarter. Consensus economist forecasts pegged last quarter’s real GDP growth at 0.4%, according to Dow Jones data, a stark decrease from the prior period’s 2.4% expansion. Data from sources following underlying measures of economic activity suggested Wednesday’s GDP reading could be even worse than that; the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model called for -0.4% GDP during Q1 when excluding gold imports and exports, while Goldman Sachs’ tracker indicates a 0.2% contraction. The BEA said the negative GDP reading “primarily reflected” an increase in imports, which surged as businesses aimed to front run tariffs, and a decrease in government spending. Futures tied to all three major indexes slid Wednesday morning following the GDP report. Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated a 380-point, or 0.9%, drop for the index, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures declined 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively. Negative GDP growth is rare for the U.S., occurring just three times over the last decade: 2020’s first two quarters as the COVID-19 pandemic ground the global economy to a halt, including a record 28% GDP contraction during the second quarter, and Q1 2022, when the Fed enacted its first interest rate hike in more than three years as inflation soared to a multidecade high. The U.S. will be one step closer to entering a recession, at least by one definition. A technical recession occurs when economic output contracts over consecutive quarters, meaning a negative reading during the second quarter would indicate such a downturn. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” meaning consecutive quarters of slightly negative GDP growth may not officially trigger a recession. Some trusted observers of the economy believe the U.S. could already be on the cusp of a recession, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, while major banks largely view it as a tossup whether or not the U.S. enters such a downturn, including the U.S.’ largest bank JPMorgan Chase, whose economists forecast a 60% chance of a recession this year. The GDP reading comes as economists debate the growing disconnect between “hard” and “soft” economic metrics. Hard data such as job growth and retail sales indicate a steady economy while survey-based measures reveal Americans’ faith in the economy has dropped precipitously, as the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment poll revealed the weakest sentiment since July 2022. The disconnect comes as Trump has pursued the most aggressive tariffs since before World War I during the early stages of his second term. The ever-changing nature of Trump’s trade stances have also complicated analysis of the regularly scheduled updates on the U.S. economy. For example, this week’s GDP reading includes data through March 31 – two days before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement which triggered historic stock market losses, and nine days before Trump backpedaled on many of his most aggressive country-by-country import taxes. “Tariffs function like a tax hike, tighten financial conditions, and increase uncertainty for businesses,” Goldman economists led by David Mericle wrote in a Sunday note to clients, explaining how the levies weigh on GDP growth.

Title: Americans fear an imminent recession. That may be enough to put us in one | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: A powerful force is dominating the Trump economy: fear. About two-thirds (66%) of adults say they are pessimistic or afraid about the economy, according to new findings from a CNN/SSRS poll released Monday. Just 34% say they feel enthusiastic or optimistic. The overwhelming majority – 69% – consider an economic recession in the next year to be at least somewhat likely, including 32% who say it’s very likely. This sense of dread in the first 100 days of the second Trump presidency isn’t just a political problem for the White House. It’s also a psychological problem for an economy that requires consumer spending to stay afloat. This raises the risk of a recession becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Fear of a recession causes Americans to shop less and save more. Vacations aren’t booked. Cars aren’t purchased. Restaurants aren’t full. CEOs, worried about consumers hunkering down, do the same. They hire fewer and fire more. And that causes consumers to pull back even further, prompting even more layoffs. It can become a negative feedback loop that is hard to break. The economy and financial markets are a confidence game – one that has been shaken by President Donald Trump’s trade war and sweeping April 2 tariff announcement, attacks on Federal Reserve independence and chaotic policymaking. “April 2nd was a turning point. It’s been four weeks of chaos, and the chaos has been disruptive. We are beginning to pay the price for it,” said David Kotok, co-founder of ﻿investment management firm Cumberland Advisors. It’s clear that consumer sentiment has been dropping. The CNN poll found that seven in 10 of those under the age of 45 express pessimism or fear about the economy. So do 76% of Americans of color. And it’s true that Democrats are more pessimistic than Republicans about the state of affairs. But the CNN poll found bipartisan economic concerns, with 39% of those who voted for Trump in 2024 saying a recession is very or somewhat likely in the next year. Still, it’s far too early to know if the turbulence in financial markets will short-circuit the economic expansion that began after the Covid-19 pandemic crash. It’s entirely possible that weak consumer confidence does not cause a drop in consumer spending. That’s exactly what happened in 2022, a time when many consumers and economists were similarly sounding the recession alarm – only to be proven wrong. The US economy has proven very resilient. It shook off multiple Covid variants, the supply chain mess, the inflation crisis and the regional bank failures of 2023. And so far this year, there isn’t much evidence that Americans have stopped spending. Retail sales jumped and car sales surged in March as consumers tried to beat the clock on tariffs. Restaurant reservations on OpenTable are higher than a year ago. And it’s possible that the massive rebound in US stocks after Trump delayed country-specific tariffs for 90 days could improve the mood on main street as it did on Wall Street. Weak confidence among consumers could interrupt the business cycle. “A lot of businesses are getting nervous. They could pause spending or cut back on travel and hiring. And that’s what could make this a self-fulfilling prophecy,” David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNN in a phone interview. Consider that 81% of small toy companies and 87% of mid-sized toy companies are delaying orders due to tariffs, according to an April survey by the Toy Association, a trade group. That same survey found that almost half of all small- and mid-sized toy makers say they will go out of business within weeks or months. “We are starting to see the first signs of the supply chain breakdown from tariffs. My expectation is that it will worsen,” said Kotok, who pointed to a surge of container ships sitting offshore and canceled sailings. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently said many business leaders fear the US economy is already in a recession, and JPMorgan’s Kelly said he is most concerned about how CEOs will respond to economic worries. Just last week, Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan highlighted most severe drop in domestic leisure travel outside of the pandemic, telling Bloomberg News: “I don’t care if you call it a recession or not, in this industry, that’s a recession.” Kelly said it may be a “shallow” recession but “the odds still favor us slipping into recession unless we see a sharp about-face on tariffs.” Torsten Slok, chief economist at investment firm Apollo Global Management, goes a step further, saying there is a 90% chance of a “voluntary trade reset recession.” “Expect ships to sit offshore, orders to be canceled, and well-run generational retailers to file for bankruptcy,” Slok wrote earlier this month in a report. Jared Bernstein, a top economist for President Joe Biden during the last recession scare in 2022, cautioned against assuming a recession is inevitable. “We’ve gone through years of bad vibes and good data. We have to be careful not to over-torque on this,” Bernstein told CNN in a phone interview. Still, Bernstein sees a roughly 50/50 chance of a US recession because of the stagflationary shock from tariffs, which are expected to simultaneously slow the economy and increase prices. The policy whiplash is also a problem. “Even if we believe (Trump) will dial back the trade war,” Bernstein said, “how confident can we be that he won’t dial back his dial-back the next day?” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Chokepoint Crazy: The U.S. Bombs Both Sides of Gulf of Aden and Considers Setting Up Shop in Somaliland

The bombing of Yemen is hogging most of the attention, but the US is also dramatically upping its airstrikes across the Gulf of Aden in Somalia as Washington struggles to fulfill goals of dominating key shipping chokepoints. We’ve seen the Trump administration lean on Greenland, Panama, and Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings to sell its dozens of global ports to a consortium that includes BlackRock. And then there’s the intensification of bombings in Somalia and Yemen. That’s not going so well, as the US Navy losing an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to Houthi fire on Sunday demonstrates. Yet, the US is likely to continue doubling down in the region as it has been doing. According to the neocon Foundation for Defense of Democracies, “in just the first three months of President Donald Trump’s second term, his administration has already launched at least 16 manned aircraft or drone strikes inside Somalia, according to numbers compiled by FDD’s Long War Journal. For comparison, the Biden administration only launched 10 such strikes in 2024.” The number of Trump strikes might also be an undercount, since the US military’s Africa Command no longer provides specific details of such operations after the White House greenlit a more liberal policy allowing American commanders to authorize airstrikes and special operation raids outside conventional battlefields, broadening the range of people who can be targeted for death. During his first overseas trip in February, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed the directive easing policy constraints and executive oversight in a meeting with senior U.S. military leaders from AFRICOM in Germany. As the collapsed Horn of Africa country is the recipient of increased violence from the “America First” administration, we’re getting scary stories that “The Islamic State has regrouped in Somalia — and has global ambitions.” As always, the result of US counterterrorism strategy is that terrorism continues to magically spread like wildfire and that the US must bomb Somalia to smithereens in order to prevent ISIS from continuing to spread. It also conveniently coincides with the US’ desire to increase its presence in the Horn of Africa with an eye towards a battle over Red Sea shipping. Samar Al-Bulushi and Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim writing at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft believe this is the case: It is a clear indication of the growing geopolitical significance of the Horn of Africa, and comes at a time of mounting concerns (mostly attempts by Yemen’s Houthis to disrupt global shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza) about securing the flow of international commerce via the Red Sea. And American international commerce should be favored, according to Trump who on Sunday demanded free transit for US ships crossing the Panama and Suez canals. Okay then. What Would Somaliland Provide? There were recently rumors that the US and Israel were considering “relocating” Gazans to Somaliland among other locations, but this ignores the fact that Palestinians do not want to be driven out of their homeland and many would rather die than do so. While it wouldn’t stop Israel or the US, it’s worth mentioning that forced deportation of populations is also a crime against humanity and could be considered genocide under Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. There also haven’t been any serious talks with Somaliland about such a scheme yet with the region’s foreign minister saying that Somalialnd must be on the road to recognition for any such conversations to proceed. Nevertheless, Somaliland is attempting to position itself as a strong US partner by appealing to Washington’s desire to counter Chinese influence. Somalia is countering by upping its offers to the US. Both highlight how the US is desperate to make moves in the region in a bid to control vital shipping lanes and gain an upper hand in what Washington views as a global battle against China. In a March 16 letter, Somalia’s President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud offers the US “strategically positioned assets” to “bolster American engagement in the region, ensuring uninterrupted military and logistical access while preventing external competitors from establishing a presence in this critical corridor.” The “assets” are the Berbera port and airbase in Somaliland and the Bosaso port and airbase in Puntland, both of which could be used to monitor and counter Houthi attacks on genocide-friendly commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The problem is that these areas are not under the control of Somalia, which has been blown to bits by multiple warring factions engaged in permanent civil war. Puntland severed ties with Mogadishu last March following years of political disputes.The Islamic State allegedly has a heavy presence in Puntland, and is one of the primary targets of the more frequent US airstrikes, and Bosaso is being transformed into a mega base for the breakaway region’s defense forces attacks against IS. In Somaliland, which occupies approximately 20 percent of Somalia’s territory and is home to about a third of the population, the situation is comparatively peaceful, and the standard of living is much higher. [1] Source: @Dani6CBP Somaliland has been seeking recognition as an independent state for more than three decades, and in 2022 the government there already offered the US access to the Berbera port in exchange for recognition. The Trump administration might jump at the offer in an attempt to combat China. Djibouti and China There is also the issue of China’s military base in Djibouti. The US, Germany, Japan, and Italy all had military presences in Djibouti, but it became a problem when China opened its first foreign military base there in 2017. Beijing’s stated interest — like the others — is to protect its shipping. And according to Responsible Statecraft, “Djibouti is also important for China’s Belt and Road Initiative as a key maritime stop and a new railway line to Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa that connects the countries. China is the largest investor in Djibouti, with a total of $14.4 billion in infrastructure being built, a huge sum for an economy that is only worth $4.67 billion.” For the US, however, it is unacceptable, and Washington became more determined to do something about it when Djibouti denied the US request to use its territory for attacks against the Houthis targeting ships trading with Israel. The US blamed China for Djibouti’s decision. Under Trump, the desperation to counter China is leading to a renewed focus on Somalia and Somaliland: Rather than accept Djibouti’s position, foreign policy experts have sought to escalate tensions, blaming Djibouti for being pro-Houthi and pro-China. Hoping to find a more reliable partner, many propose that the United States recognize and work with Somaliland instead. Somaliland is an unrecognized state that asserted its independence from Somalia in 1991. Close to Yemen and next Somalia, it seems Somaliland offers everything Djibouti has with no strings attached. Project 2025 recommends “the recognition of Somaliland statehood as a hedge against the U.S.’s deteriorating position in Djibouti.” As Semafor first reported in December, members of the US president’s new team have expressed interest in recognizing Somaliland: The move could enable US intelligence to set up long term operations to monitor the movement of weapons in a volatile region as well as keep an eye on Chinese activity. And in January an influential US-China subcommittee in the US House of Representatives called for the State Department to open a representative office in Somaliland. The increase of US airstrikes in Somalia is likely to only destabilize the situation further, leading to increased calls for Somaliland recognition. Again, the Trump administration is just ramping up existing US policy with a twist. Collective Biden formally upheld Somalia’s territorial integrity, but the Pentagon showed interest in a presence in Berbera, with several visits by Africom officials. Last year, the US signed a deal with the government of Somalia to construct up to five military bases for the Somali National Army in the name of bolstering the army’s capabilities in the ongoing fight against militant groups. The bases are intended for the Danab (“Lightning”) Brigade, a U.S.-sponsored Special Ops Force that was established in 2014. The US at first funded Danab from the State Department, which contracted with private security firm Bancroft Global. More recently, funding comes from the Pentagon’s proxy war fund called the 127e program, which bypasses congressional oversight by allowing US special operations forces to use foreign military units as surrogates in counterterrorism missions. Despite the fact that Somalia receives US aid to pay government salaries, it launched a mega lobbying campaign following Trump’s victory, hiring big time firms like BGR . According to Africa Report, the Somali president is also attempting to win over Elon Musk by giving him a Starlink license to operate in the country. Mogadishu is also going on a Washington lobbyist hiring spree. The US Doesn’t Do Nation Building As Team Trump considers Somaliland recognition, the foreign policy team green lighting strikes in Somalia reportedly believes that state-building there is futile. They’re not necessarily wrong, but what they get right is for the wrong reasons. From Geeska: We are now witnessing the clear unveiling of what remains of the fig leaf that the international community had wrapped itself in when dealing with Somali affairs. This same community had previously imposed a coercive state-building model in Somalia through military interventions and, in 2013, granted sovereign recognition to the Mogadishu government as the legitimate successor of the post-independence Somali Republic. This project later evolved into a system resembling a cottage industry run by a narrow group of experts and opportunistic politicians shuttling between Mogadishu and Nairobi under the guise of constructing a federal governance model, backed by regional forces that are periodically rotated every few years. At its core, however, this process was nothing more than a fragile arrangement to reconcile former warlords, jihadist movement leaders, and local clan politicians. As this model has gradually collapsed over time due to both internal and external factors, the international community now implicitly acknowledges that the Somali Republic no longer exists in practice. What remains is a fragile entity dependent on international donors, African peacekeeping forces and Turkish largesse, which barely exercises control beyond the capital. The Trump administration’s policies serve as a new kind of threat, as it attempts to formalise its engagement with the de facto authorities, sidelining the de jure situation that operates on the assumption that Somalia is a sovereign state, rather than a space where international powers manage threats to their interests. And so the US, having helped destabilize Somalia, might now place its bets on Somaliland. Should it do so, it would be somewhat reminiscent of another state the US blessed with the aim of a military presence and a geoeconomic win. Following the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 Washington helped bring about the creation of Kosovo. While a lot of people in the US profited handsomely from all the death and destruction, Kosovo remains to this day a state on life support. Politico did a piece on the US failure last year and the author was astounded to witness Washington’s failures despite Kosovo’s small size and GDP of just $10 billion — “less than one-quarter the size of Vermont’s, the smallest US state in terms of economic activity.” It’s surprising that the author is surprised. The US can’t even do nation building in the US. What makes anyone think they have any interest in Kosovo or Somaliland aside from the plunder and moves on the Great Game board? Politico does admit that “Washington’s priorities were informed more by short-term American business interests, than providing the country what it really needed to develop.” The US did, however, open Camp Bondsteel. It’s the biggest (almost 1,000 acres) and most expensive US military base built in Europe in 50-plus years. It now sits mostly empty and has earned the nickname the “Forgotten Battalion.” Maybe they can be relocated to Somaliland. Notes [1] Part of the reason the situation is relatively calm in Somaliland might include the local government’s ruthlessness in cracking down on dissent. As Kit Klarenberg recalls: In late 2022, mass protests broke out in the contested Somalian city of Las Anod. Somaliland security forces crushed the upheaval using lethal force, leaving dozens dead. Unrest only intensified thereafter, leading to Somaliland’s military savagely shelling the city the next year. An April 2023Amnesty International report branded the assault “indiscriminate” in the extreme, with civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and mosques struck, hundreds killed and injured, and hundreds of thousands displaced. The Empire of Evil is an understatement. I am sad to say. Thank you, Conor. Blighty, even with 5m children living in poverty, has sent HMS Prince of Wales and its carrier group, mainly non-UK vessels, to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The group will sail via Suez, the second such deployment since the Queen Elizabeth deployed “east of Suez” in 2022, “a Brexit benefit” according to Johnson. Starmer spent the night before the fleet left aboard the Prince of Wales. One wonders if, en route to the South China Sea, the EU’s back yard according to von der Leyen, the carrier group will engage Ansarallah or what were called “fuzzy wuzzies” when Blighty was winning at Fashoda, Khartoum and Omdurman. Dad served with the RAF in Aden, so we are looking forward to the next iteration and how forces have recalibrated since the mid-1960s. Perhaps, a ship or two will make a detour for Crimea, like in 2022, and, again quoting Johnson, “poke the bear”. Are there any easy wars left to fight? BTW, I don’t think there’s any truth to the rumour that an Indian dock, or that beach where ships go to die, has been booked in case the Prince of Wales breaks down. Johnson, Starmer and Trump have some things in common, but I don’t know if Trump has children out of wedlock, the result of playing away from home. Thanks Colonel, In the meantime, Sweden is doing its best to become a third world nation by shovelling even more money to Ukraine https://thetransnational.substack.com/p/swedens-19th-aid-package-for-ukraine The CIA sure knew what they were doing when they organised the assassination of Palme with the connivance/looked the other way, of the Swedish security forces. Thank you, John. I don’t know about Sweden, but often see the benefits of the “aid” in the form of high end vehicles and fine dining in London, the south of England, Paris, Paris sur Mer / 21eme arrondissement and the Cote d’Azur. Private school fees are paid by local authorities, so a different pot to the above. Thank you, Colonel. If I remember correctly, when the British left Aden didn’t they have to virtually shoot their way out of that place instead of a quite hand-over ceremony like in most other places? Aden always was a tough place. Thank you, Rev. It was a bit. Think of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Good times, especially when people like my johnny foreigner dad fought for God, Queen and Country, as opposed to Zionist chicken hawks now. “Perhaps, a ship or two will make a detour for Crimea, like in 2022, and, again quoting Johnson, “poke the bear”.” They have to poke first the New Ottomans, to get permission to enter the Black Sea… Fortunately for the US before they head off into Somaliland, they will be able to draw from many experts that have knowledge of the culture and religion and the people in this region, know who the different factions are, know who the real players are behind the scenes, know the history of this area which particular emphasis on recent history, what cultural taboos they need to be careful of, which countries are supplying military expertise and equipment to the different factions, how the US can go in and have the locals see them as a reliable partner worth trusting, what the short and long term budgetary requirements will be needed to make full use of limited resources and so forth. Psych! Thank you, Rev. Why? A PPE from Oxford is more than enough and shouting at johnny foreigners in a plummy accent, perhaps wearing a pith helmet. And that is precisely what they won’t do. It is not the American way. I believe that what Trump’s referencing when he says the US ‘should be favored’ is that we have guaranteed unimpeded transit to a bunch of countries as per some previous accord, sometimes–the US military felt–to the neglect of US shipping, as our ability to spread the umbrella for all became more and more limited under Biden.

The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin (BTC) Trust ETF (IBIT) saw $970.9 million in inflows, marking its second-largest net inflow since launching in January 2024, according to Farside data. Monday accounted for $591.2 million in new capital, which saw heavy outflows from competitors: Fidelity’s FBTC lost $86.9 million, Bitwise’s BITB dropped $21.1 million, and ARK’s ARKB saw $226.3 million in outflows. The rise comes alongside a 7.2% rise in BTC over the past seven days with it now trading at $94,900. Since April 22, IBIT has amassed over $4.5 billion in net inflows, bucking the market trend. Industry experts have taken note. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, remarked: Eric Balchunas, Senior Bloomberg ETF Analyst, added: Meanwhile, in derivatives markets, open interest (OI) on CME Bitcoin Futures continues to fall, now sitting at 132,750 BTC after four consecutive days of decline, according to CME data. The recent decline in open interest could be coming to an end, as the annualized basis yield has climbed from around 5% to 9% in April, according to Velo data. This resurgence in basis trade profitability could prompt renewed activity and a short-term rebound in open interest. Why it matters: In a typical basis trade, investors buy spot bitcoin and short bitcoin futures to lock in the price gap. When the yield is high, demand for futures rises, boosting OI. As the yield shrinks, fewer traders engage in the strategy, leading to declining open interest and signaling reduced leverage in the market.

Title: Gerry Thornley: all four Irish provinces beaten on same weekend for first time since March 2015

All seems even less hunky dory underneath the surface after that weekend. For the first time since March 2015 all four Irish sides lost on the same weekend, on top of which the Ireland women’s team suffered their most sobering reality check of the campaign. That said, for those in Clontarf, Nenagh, Trinity, Dungannon, Skerries and Thomond it was the best weekend of the season. The last time all four Irish provinces lost on the same weekend was in the old Pro 12, when the quartet each suffered defeats to Welsh opposition. As then Leinster lost away to the Scarlets, while Munster, beaten in Cardiff on Friday night, lost to the Ospreys a decade ago. Connacht had a fall off in performance after their brave effort in defeat to the Stormers when losing to the Lions last Saturday, while Ulster were worn down by the Sharks’ superior physicality and depth on Saturday night. Leinster, of course, could afford just a second defeat of the season, especially as Glasgow were outmuscled at home by the Stormers on Friday night, so maintaining the eight-point gap at the top the table ahead of next Saturday’s Champions Cup showdown against a dangerous Northampton. Victory at home to Zebre a week later would ensure top seeding in the BKT URC playoffs ahead of their final game at home to Glasgow; additionally helpful if they have reached a fourth successive Champions Cup final a week later. By contrast Munster, Ulster and Connacht have all fallen outside the top eight, and there is a distinct likelihood that Ireland will only have two sides in next season’s Champions Cup for the first time ever, with the possibility that this may even be one side. That would be quite a fall. Munster and Ulster meet at Thomond Park next Friday week in what is now a dog-eat-dog scrap for playoff and Champions Cup qualification between two provinces who have been ever-presents in the 30 years of the latter competition. While Munster now sit ninth behind Benetton, with both on 41 points, by dint of winning less matches they have their destiny in their own hands as they also host the Italian outfit at Musgrave Park in the final round six nights later. By contrast an Ulster squad even more lacking in depth sit in 12th on 38 points, and so their need is the more acute in Thomond Park ahead of a trek to Edinburgh, who are 10th, on the ensuing Friday. Connacht’s chances of the top eight are more remote as they sit 14th on 35 points and must finish with wins at home to Edinburgh and away to Zebre if they are to have any chance of a top-eight place. Significantly, the Welsh quartet finish their campaigns with two games in South Africa. The fear always lurked that for all the huge improvement in the Ireland women’s team in the last 12 months some of it had to be attributed to the return of Olympian Sevens players who were unavailable in last season’s Six Nations, and that while they have become a good team they are not yet a good squad. In the absence of the hugely influential Sam Monaghan, Erin King and Aoife Wafer, that lack of depth was further exposed when losing Edel McMahon and Dorothy Wall in the first half of last Saturday’s loss to Scotland in Edinburgh. It’s still been a campaign of progress, with more competitive displays at home to England and France, as well as the high point of the win in Parma. But Saturday’s defeat is a setback psychologically, and certainly gives the first World Cup warm-up match against Scotland in Cork on August 2nd more significance. Either way while a World Cup semi-final is still a viable target, beating New Zealand again in the pool stages or overcoming France in the quarter-final looks a tall order, particularly after the stirring late comeback by Les Bleus in losing 43-42 in Saturday’s Grand Slam decider against England. Amid all this club rugby was seen at its best on the final weekend of the AIL as UL Bohs and Clontarf secured All-Ireland titles again at the Aviva Stadium. À la the Joey Carbery final when Clontarf beat Cork Constitution in 2016, last Sunday wasn’t quite the Hugh Cooney final, but it wasn’t far off it either. As a Clontarf centre who came through Blackrock, Cooney is not the first to plot such a journey, and while not wanting to saddle him unduly with comparisons to The Great One, with his leg power, explosiveness, pace and low centre of gravity the 21-year-old has similar attributes. Cooney and Hugh Gavin look like being the first of the new crop of young centres coming through to be capped this summer in Tbilisi or Georgia. Meanwhile Nenagh Ormond became the first Tipperary club to be promoted to Division 1A and Trinity preserved their 1B status with dramatic two-score comebacks at home to wilting UCC and Cashel sides. Dungannon won promotion to 1B by winning in Navan, Skerries stayed in 2B by beating Midleton at home, and Thomond reclaimed their AIL status by winning in Omagh in the only game that wasn’t a one-score affair. The league has found a niche. Ten-team divisions and playoffs ensure jeopardy and a dearth of dead rubbers until the very end. But having the finals a week after the semi-finals, which are just a fortnight after the three-game rush to the season’s final standings, is just too demanding a load for the mostly amateur and semi-pro players. The best final of recent times was two years ago, when Terenure beat Clontarf 50-24, which was a fortnight after the semi-finals. That’s the way it should be. The AIL finals could have been held next Sunday, on the May bank holiday weekend, which would also help rather than hinder clubs outside Dublin such as Cork Constitution in bringing members and fans to Dublin. It would also afford the IRFU, sponsors and finalists two weeks to promote the finals. The May bank holiday weekend should be enshrined in the club calendar as All-Ireland club rugby weekend. If occasionally this clashed with Leinster matches or the finals were lost to either TG4 or from the Aviva to somewhere else nor would that be the end of the world. gerry.thornley@irishtimes.com Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Irish drummer Kevin Brady: ‘Most nights you’re able to hear great live jazz. But we need something like classical has in the NCH’

Time Published: 2025-04-29T04:15:00Z
Full Content:
There is a photograph of the quartet led by the Irish jazz drummer Kevin Brady that makes it look a little like a Scandi death-metal band. The American keyboardist Bill Carrothers – buzz-cut, beard and steely eye – is decked out in camouflaged military-style hunting jacket. The London-born, Vancouver-raised and Cologne-based saxophonist Seamus Blake, whose father was from Dublin, is peering out over lowered eyebrows with what comes across as a combination of scepticism and menace. Brady, who is dressed, like Blake, all in black, is solemn, glassy-eyed and half in deep shadow. The Irish bassist Dave Redmond, to the rear, looks, as Brady jokes to me, “like he urgently needs to be somewhere else”. In reality, the group, which works under the banner of the Kevin Brady Electric Quartet – in which Carrothers plays Fender Rhodes electric piano, Redmond switches to electric bass and Brady is increasingly integrating electronic drum percussion – is one of the most acclaimed and ambitious international jazz ensembles working in Ireland. Formed in 2019, the band combines a highly intuitive and interactive Irish rhythm section that has played together for 20 years or more with two of the most gifted and admired, if sometimes criminally undervalued, musicians in modern jazz. Carrothers, who is based in Michigan, has a long association with Redmond and Brady – as a piano trio they have released three highly rated studio albums, many featuring Carrothers’s winningly eclectic compositions – and he is renowned for his harmonic elegance, broad musical knowledge and many-sided virtuosity. Blake, a master tenor saxophonist, is a muscular and commanding soloist somewhat in the Michael Brecker and Chris Potter mode, yet with his own elastic sound, advanced sense of lyricism and endlessly inventive style. The overall result lands in several sweet spots between late-1960s Miles Davis and early-1970s Herbie Hancock: liquid electric postbop with catchy melodies, deep grooves, rhythmic ingenuity, consummate improvisation and a strikingly contemporary edge. While the group’s multinational nature and heavily in-demand members may make regular creative get-togethers something of a challenge, the Electric Quartet has released one celebrated album, Plan B – “timeless, joyous music that will further burnish the reputations of all concerned”, according to the Irish Times review. Next month the band embarks on one of its rare tours of Ireland, playing seven dates across the island. Brady is a highly respected musician and teacher. A fluid and versatile drummer with a great sense of swing, he can play anything from funk to free jazz, but he is primarily influenced by some of the pioneering American drummers of the 1950s and 1960s, including Tony Williams, Max Roach, Jimmy Cobb, Art Taylor and Elvin Jones – as well as the irresistible polyrhythms of Afro-Cuban and Brazilian music. “In the 20 years I’ve been coming to Ireland, Kevin’s the best drummer I’ve heard,” Carrothers says. As a side musician and group anchor, Brady, who is 51, has become exceptionally popular with bands both in Ireland and abroad. At home he has been a crucial member of groups led by the guitarist Tommy Halferty, the pianist Phil Ware and the keyboardist Scott Flanigan, and by the saxophonists Richie Buckley and Meilana Gillard; in addition he has performed and recorded with Irish acts ranging from Van Morrison to the Irish Baroque Orchestra, Gráda to Dave Geraghty of Bell X1. [ Kevin Brady Electric Quartet: Plan B – an engrossing new musical directionOpens in new window ] Brady has also worked with the English jazz vocalists Norma Winstone and Ian Shaw, the American saxophonist and 1960s James Brown creative force Pee Wee Ellis, and the American guitarist and “godfather of fusion” Larry Coryell, among many others. “I try to bring an emotional response to any music I’m involved in, and an energy,” he says. “I want the music to be active.” He is also the composer of tight, melodically strong and rhythmically dynamic tunes that defy the lazy commonplace that drummers are there to keep time, not contribute original music. “The idea that if you play drums you’ve got no sense of cop-on with regard to knowing what a scale or a chord or a melody is … I think we’re way past that now,” he says. We meet in the recital room of Newpark Academy of Music, in Blackrock in south Dublin – “this room has been the venue for masterclasses by many great visiting jazz musicians, including the drummer Art Blakey,” he says – where Brady has been teaching drums for approaching 25 years; he is also head of the jazz programme at the school and lectures on the BA jazz degree course at Dublin City University. For participants who range from toddlers to final-year secondary students, Newpark is “the gold standard of musical education in Ireland”; founded in 1979, it is a registered charity with 42 staff and 600 students. Hozier is one of its alumni. Last year, at short notice, it was threatened with closure. Brady was one of the leaders of the campaign that saved the centre; from September the academy will transfer to new, though as yet unannounced, premises nearby. “I think people saw the importance of what’s been achieved here, both in the past and for the future,” Brady says. “If you start closing down music schools that have legacies like Newpark, then that’s not a world I would like to be living in.” Brady was born in Dublin. Neither of his parents was a musician, though his father sang in local musical societies, had a large vinyl collection and was a passionate fan of big-band jazz, as well as of the artistry of the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and the singer Sarah Vaughan. He began private piano lessons at the age of six, progressing through to the highest grades; a couple of years later he began playing trumpet, and later cornet, in a local concert band that sometimes toured Europe. In his teenage years Brady began playing keyboards in local jam bands, moving to drums “purely by coincidence” when one drummer failed to show for a rehearsal. He began teaching himself, initially falling under the influence of Stewart Copeland, the multifaceted American drummer from The Police, and at 17 began lessons at Newpark with the drummer Conor Guilfoyle. “I remember Kevin being a really good student with a voracious appetite to learn; like he is now, he was a complete enthusiast,” Guilfoyle says. “He wasn’t playing jazz at this point, more funk and rock, but he had a really good time feel. And that’s essential. It means you can adapt to many different styles of music – and also that good musicians will always want to play with you.” Increasingly drawn towards jazz – one of the earliest sparks was the present his father gave him for Christmas when he was 13: Wynton Marsalis’s Marsalis Standard Time, Vol 1 – he gave up a place studying classical music at University College Dublin in favour of a life practising, taking private lessons and playing blues and rock gigs. When he was 22, on Guilfoyle’s advice, he studied for six months at the prestigious Drummers Collective in New York; shortly after he took the year-long newly formed professional musician training course at Newpark set up by Ronan and Conor Guilfoyle. He has never looked back. Since then, over the past quarter-century or more, he has led an exemplary jazz life in Ireland, albeit one that has not exactly made him wealthy. He has admirably sought to advance his skills by studying with drummers and percussionists in the United States, Cuba and Brazil. And, from his early 30s, he has led bands and developed a reputation for being enterprising and hardworking, for being the kind of musician who consistently makes things happen. “His determination and discipline towards grant writing and procuring gigs is pretty legendary. He’s a dog on a bone,” Carrothers says. As a linchpin of the domestic music scene, Brady is also extremely well placed to gauge the state of jazz in Ireland. “I think it’s pretty healthy,” he says, quick as a flash. “Most nights, in Dublin at least, you’re going to be able to hear great live jazz featuring both established and younger musicians. “But one thing we’re lacking as a major capital in Europe is a government-backed centre for jazz and improvised music,” he adds. “Somewhere with a 300- to 400-seat venue, education and outreach programmes, resources, an archive, all sorts of stuff that would promote and preserve the music. Something like classical music has in the National Concert Hall and trad has with Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. [ Newpark Academy of Music saved from closure through licence reprieveOpens in new window ] “I know the audience is there, 100 per cent. As is the interest in jazz; I can see it in my students. But we need to follow through and take the initiative, take the next step. A dedicated venue would be a massive bonus not just for jazz in Ireland but for the whole country.” The Kevin Brady Electric Quartet plays the Yeats Building, Sligo, on Sunday, May 4th; Magy’s Farm, Dromara, Co Down, on Monday, May 5th; Riverbank Arts Centre, Newbridge, Co Kildare, on Wednesday, May 7th; Solstice Arts Centre, Navan, on Thursday, May 8th; Wexford Arts Centre on Friday, May 9th; Arthur’s Blues & Jazz Club, Dublin, on Saturday, May 10th; and Triskel Christchurch, Cork, on Friday, May 16th.

Title: Charlamagne tells Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer to 'cut it out' over hypocritical oligarchy concerns

CNN panelists were unimpressed by Sen. Chuck Schumer touting a "very strong letter" he wrote to President Trump over his attacks on Harvard University. Charlamagne tha God called out Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., for hypocrisy over their sudden concern about big money in politics. "I think it's ridiculous even when they try to say things, you know, all these conversations about oligarchy, oligarchy, oligarchy," Charlamagne said on "The Breakfast Club" Monday. "Now Bernie [Sanders] and AOC, they can go out there and say, ‘Fight the oligarchy.’ Hakeem Jeffries, you can't say that, okay, like, cut it out, we know that you've taken so much money from corporate donors." "So, it's just weird to see them, you know, push back against oligarchy now and say, 'Look at the billionaires controlling Trump.' It's like, really? You, Hakeem, really? Chuck Schumer, really?" Charlamagne added. According to OpenSecrets.org, some of Schumer’s biggest donations come from corporations, including Blackstone Group, Nextera Energy, Newmark Group, and L3Harris Technologies. SCHUMER REFUSES TO RULE OUT IMPEACHMENT: ‘TRUMP IS VIOLATING RULE OF LAW IN EVERY WAY’ Charlamagne tha God is schooling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries over what he calls their sudden apportion to big money in politics. (Getty Images) Previous reporting from Fox News Digital found that Democracy PAC II, tied to George Soros, gave $2.5 million to Schumer’s Senate Majority PAC in 2024. Democracy PAC II also gave $3.5 million in calendar year 2022, and $2.5 million in calendar year 2021, for a total of $6 million. Jeffries’ profile on OpenSecrets.org is similar, with some of his largest donations coming from BlackRock Inc and Lockheed Martin. Furthermore, in February, Politico reported that Jeffries met privately with major donors in Silicon Valley. "I know there are some people that think Joe Biden should help rebuild because, as the most recent president, he is the de facto leader of the party. And to those people, I’d like to say: Hunter, lay off the crack," Charlamagne joked. "So who’s supposed to be the leaders? Well, in Congress, you’ve got two people. The first one is this guy, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries." He then showed a video of Jeffries wearing a suit with no tie and sunglasses outside the U.S. Capitol Building, talking about democracy. Charlamagne then called Schumer "Payless Obama’s counterpart in the Senate," and said that he was "even less inspiring." Charlamagne has been critical of the two Congressional Democrat minority leaders before, recently mocking them as party leaders and saying they should be "thrown out of office."

Cory Booker, D-N.J., held a sit-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to protest President Donald Trump's budget bill and cuts they claim will be made to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

Title: Man (66) who died while cycling was ‘meticulous’ in wearing safety equipment, inquest hears

A 66-year-old man who was “meticulous” in wearing safety equipment when cycling died from a severe brain injury after falling from his bike, an inquest has heard. A sitting of Dublin District Coroner’s Court heard that Conor Kenny, the head of a consultancy firm and author of several business books, died hours after setting off for a cycle to Ticknock woods in south Dublin. Judith Kenny said her husband, who was a regular runner and cyclist, was “meticulous” about safety equipment, which he was wearing when he left for his cycle on August 4th, 2024. She recalled ringing her husband several times after hearing “concerning” sirens near their home in Ballinteer in the hours after he left. Neville O’Connor, who was hiking on the day of Mr Kenny’s death, recalled seeing a cyclist pass him at a “fairly good speed” shortly before 1.30pm. After Mr Kenny rounded a bend ahead and was out of sight, Mr O’Connor heard a “very loud bang like a bike hitting the ground”. He said there were no cars in the area at the time. He ran to Mr Kenny who was still wearing his helmet, lying on the ground close to his bike and struggling to breathe. Mr O’Connor said he administered CPR until paramedics arrived and transferred him to St Vincent’s University Hospital. Dr Patrick Hillery, a consultant in emergency medicine, said Mr Kenny arrived in cardiac arrest. After all possible avenues were exhausted, he was pronounced deceased some 35 minutes later, the doctor said. He noted a significant volume of blood in Mr Kenny’s mouth “which would be consistent with an unprotected fall”. He believed Mr Kenny may have suffered a cardiac arrest before the fall. Garda Jason McDonnell, a member of the roads policing unit at Blackrock Garda station, said Mr Kenny’s smartwatch recorded a “sharp and sudden” drop in speed from 13.06 metres per second (47km/h) to 0 metres per second at 1.28pm. Garda McDonnell said the brakes and tyres of Mr Kenny’s bike were in good working order, and the site of the crash “wouldn’t be an area where you would have road traffic collisions”. A postmortem recorded the medical cause of death as severe craniocerebral trauma and noted a finding of amyloid angiopathy, a condition that causes bleeding into the brain, which could have caused a spontaneous bleed before his crash. Coroner Dr Clare Keane returned a narrative verdict, saying: “We are clear there was a fall from the bicycle, what we cannot conclude with certainty is whether the bleeding resulted from the fall or possibly precipitated it.” Jack White is a reporter for The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: How Stablecoins And Tokenization Are Rebuilding Global Finance

BySandy Carter BySandy Carter, Contributor. Stablecoins and tokenization take center stage. (Photo by May James/SOPA Images/LightRocket via ... More Getty Images) Late last year, I stood on stage at a fintech summit in Singapore talking about digital identity, stablecoins and tokenization, surrounded by leaders from central banks, blockchain startups, and AI innovators. It was one of those moments where you could feel history nudging forward. Discussions that used to live in niche corners of crypto Twitter were now center stage — about programmable money, the fragility of global currencies, and the reinvention of financial infrastructure. There was an electricity in the air, not of fear, but of change. What struck me most was the shared understanding across sectors: the old financial rails weren’t just aging. They were being replaced, reimagined, and rebuilt. Later in 2025, at a Digital Economist event with financial researcher Tarun Kishnani, we dug deeper into what’s really happening underneath the surface. This isn’t about headlines or hype. It’s about a fundamental rewiring of the architecture that underpins global commerce and power. Much of this transformation can be traced back to an imbalance that has been growing for decades. Over reliance on foreign manufacturing, ballooning trade deficits, and geopolitical tensions have chipped away at the U.S.’s unchallenged monetary position. In just the past few months, the Dollar has weakened more than 10% against a basket of global currencies — not because people stopped believing in the U.S. entirely, but because uncertainty is being priced in at the margins. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, warned that adversaries are actively working to dismantle the Dollar’s hegemonic role. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, said what once would have been controversial: that U.S. debt mismanagement could erode the Dollar’s reserve status. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) The U.S. has long preserved Dollar dominance by keeping global demand high — from oil pricing to trade settlement systems. But the new levers of power are digital, decentralized, and dynamic. One of the clearest signals that global finance is evolving is the astonishing rise of stablecoins. In 2024 alone, stablecoins processed over $27 trillion in volume — more than Visa and Mastercard combined. Stablecoins are a category of digital assets designed to maintain a stable value by pegging their price to a reserve asset, most commonly the U.S. Dollar. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can fluctuate wildly in value, stablecoins aim to offer the speed, transparency, and programmability of blockchain technology without the volatility. They are backed either by fiat currency reserves, commodities, or algorithmic mechanisms that manage supply and demand. Today, stablecoins like USDC and USDT serve as vital tools for global payments, trading, savings, and cross-border transactions — blending the trust of traditional finance with the efficiency of decentralized systems. Why are stablecoins growing so fast? They solve real-world problems. They offer instantaneous, low-cost transfers. They are transparent, programmable, and — in most cases — backed by U.S. Dollars. In a world increasingly skeptical of traditional intermediaries, stablecoins offer direct access to a stable financial anchor. As Tarun put it during our conversation, “Every time someone in Latin America or Southeast Asia loads USDC into a wallet, they’re extending the reach of the U.S. Dollar — without a single bank branch or military base.” Financial researcher Tarun Kishnani Stablecoins have become a new kind of financial infrastructure — invisible, efficient, and profoundly influential. While the surface of finance looks much the same — banks, apps, payments — the underlying rails are being transformed. SWIFT’s ISO 20022 upgrade is modernizing cross-border messaging to support tokenized assets. China’s CIPS network is providing an alternative to SWIFT for emerging markets. Meanwhile, blockchain-based settlement layers like Ethereum are allowing assets to move at internet speed, without traditional banking bottlenecks. This evolution isn’t a tech experiment anymore. It’s a full-scale reengineering of how value moves around the world. It's laying the groundwork for a future where money flows like information — fast, borderless, and programmable. Many assume decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) are locked in a zero-sum battle. But what’s actually emerging is a collaboration. Banks are experimenting with blockchain rails to streamline settlement and custody. DeFi platforms are embedding compliance features to attract regulated capital. The two systems are beginning to meet in the middle — with stablecoins acting as the connective tissue. Rather than disrupting for disruption's sake, this hybrid model is focused on resilience, innovation, and access. It’s not about breaking finance. It’s about upgrading it. Tokenization — the conversion of real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens — is moving from pilot projects into real deployment. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, put it succinctly: “Tokenization brings Wall Street efficiency to Main Street access.” Already, we’re seeing tokenized U.S. Treasuries gaining traction among global institutions looking for dollar exposure without the friction of traditional custody. Real estate platforms are tokenizing properties, allowing fractional ownership that enables more diverse participation. Corporates are beginning to tokenize debt instruments to reduce settlement times and financing costs. The potential is staggering: 24/7 markets, instant settlement, broader participation, and increased liquidity. And most of these assets are priced in Dollars — reinforcing the very monetary system many predicted would wane. Beyond the technical benefits, this new financial infrastructure could redefine access to opportunity. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, emphasized this broader mission: “This is our opportunity to build financial systems that don’t just work better—but work for more people.” Stablecoins and tokenized assets open doors for billions of people left behind by traditional banking. A farmer in Kenya can save in a stable currency. A startup founder in Vietnam can raise global capital. A student in Argentina can invest in tokenized U.S. equities. The goal isn’t just efficiency. It’s equity. It’s about creating systems that are open by design, not as an afterthought. Of course, this future is not without its challenges. Digital identity remains a crucial missing piece — without verifiable, portable identity, trust in ownership breaks down. Regulatory clarity is lagging behind technological innovation, leading to uncertainty for businesses and users alike. Technical risks — from smart contract vulnerabilities to blockchain outages — are real and must be managed with rigor. Moreover, the U.S.’s fiscal and political stability will continue to underpin Dollar confidence. Digital diplomacy through stablecoins is powerful, but it still rests on trust in the core institutions behind them. As you navigate this financial transformation with Stablecoins and Tokenization, the takeaway is clear: participation is no longer optional. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, an investor, a policymaker, or simply someone managing personal finances, understanding how stablecoins, tokenized assets, and digital infrastructure work will soon be as fundamental as understanding credit cards or online banking. If you’re a business leader, now is the time to modernize infrastructure and explore how digital assets could streamline operations, reduce costs, and open new markets. If you’re an investor, learning how tokenization is reshaping access to real estate, bonds, and global equities could uncover new opportunities for diversification and growth. And if you’re a policymaker, the moment demands thoughtful regulation that encourages innovation while protecting stability and inclusion. For individuals, the implications are profound. Financial systems are opening in ways that will create more access, more ownership, and more agency for people worldwide — but only for those who engage early. Saving, investing, and transacting with digital tools will move from experimental to expected. The rails are being rebuilt around you. The next chapter of finance will be more borderless, transparent, and participatory than any that came before. The best time to start understanding this shift was yesterday. The second-best time is today. What do you think about Stablecoins and Tokenization?

WSB Now ATLANTA — The BlackRock Foundation has partnered with the Technical College System of Georgia to expand access to skill training for more than 1,000 state residents. According to the announcement from BlackRock, the BlackRock Foundation Empowerment Fund will provide $1 million over two years as a grant to the Technical College system. The foundation said the funding will be used to help TCSG students finish training programs and expand the pool of skilled workers for Georgia’s construction and advanced manufacturing industries. [DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks] “At The BlackRock Foundation, our mission is to help more people earn, save, and invest and that includes increasing access to pathways that lead to long-term financial security,” Claire Chamberlain, President of The BlackRock Foundation, said in a statement. “This grant reflects our deep commitment to investing in the workforce of the future, and more importantly, putting more Georgians on a path to earning a thriving wage in the state’s highest demand industries.” TRENDING STORIES: Programs that will work with the new Empowerment Fund will go through WorkSource Georgia for existing advanced manufacturing and construction pre-apprenticeship programs, according to BlackRock. The grant will also give $720,000 for scholarships from the TCSGF’s ‘Last Mile Fund,’ to help students graduate despite potential financial burdens. “This partnership with The BlackRock Foundation is a powerful investment in Georgia’s future workforce,” Greg Dozier, Commissioner of the Technical College System of Georgia, said. “By helping more students complete training and earn credentials—especially in rural communities and high-demand fields—we’re not only changing lives, we’re building the talent pipeline that keeps Georgia the number one state for business." Dozier said the Empowerment Fund was a good example of how public and private partnerships can expand opportunities across Georgia, help close skill gaps and support economic mobility.

Title: Looking beyond Pi Network? 5 underrated cryptos could 1000x in May’s bullish rebound

As the crypto market gears up for a potential surge, interest is shifting toward hidden digital assets with explosive growth prospects. Investors are eager to uncover the next big opportunity beyond well-known names. This article delves into five overlooked cryptocurrencies that might experience a hundredfold increase during May’s bullish momentum. XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key strengths of XYZVerse in the current market: Price prediction for $XYZ Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Is a 3000% surge possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Ondo Finance is changing how people access financial products. By blending traditional finance with blockchain, Ondo turns real-world assets into digital tokens. These assets are stable and earn income, like US Treasuries. This opens up high-quality financial products to more people. Ondo has two parts: one creates these tokenized products, and the other builds decentralized finance tools. Together, they enhance Ondo’s offerings. In a market where trust is key, Ondo partners with firms like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for asset custody. They prioritize transparency and legal compliance. Their product, USDY, combines the ease of a stablecoin with yield opportunities. Backed by US Treasuries, it’s a secure option for non-US investors. With many cryptocurrencies being volatile, USDY offers a stable and regulated alternative. Compared to others, its strong backing makes it attractive for those seeking stability and steady returns.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) currently owns an astounding 538,200 Bitcoin after it added a massive 379,800 $BTC in just the last six months. On average, the company has been acquiring 2,087 $BTC per day – a rate that far exceeds the current daily production rate of 450 $BTC, which comes to 13,500 $BTC per month. Keep reading to find out how institutional Bitcoin accumulation could reshape the market and why now might be a great opportunity to invest in the best altcoins to buy to benefit from this shift. By amassing such as dominant Bitcoin position, Strategy is moving toward a position where it could influence broader market trends. If institutions like Strategy control a sizable portion of Bitcoin’s fixed 21M supply, the asset may become a luxury in the future. In this environment, the $BTC cost of capital may no longer be driven by free market forces, but be increasingly shaped by the lending policies of major holders. Although this goes against Bitcoin’s decentralization ethos, it’s undeniably bullish for its price. Borrowing Bitcoin will become a luxury business reserved for nation-states and corporate whales, and Strategy will control the bottleneck. – Adam Livingston, a $BTC analyst Reinforcing this trend, more institutions are moving towards a Bitcoin corporate treasury plan. Blockstream CEO Adam Back even suggests this shift could eventually push Bitcoin’s market cap to $200T. Some critics warn that Strategy’s debt-funded Bitcoin buying could be risky. However, experts like Saifedean Ammous have said that institutional Bitcoin concentration does not threaten the currency’s protocol. Even if institutions control over 50% of the supply, they have no incentive to manipulate the protocol. Forking Bitcoin to create more coins would only devalue their holdings, leading to large losses. Bitcoin’s hard-capped supply remains fundamentally secure, and so does the long-term bullish case. If accumulation trends continue, Bitcoin’s scarcity could trigger explosive market movements. Smart investors are positioning now. Below, we highlight three of the best altcoins to buy that could surge alongside Bitcoin during a potential supply crunch. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is easily the best Bitcoin-centric altcoin on the market right now. Designed to follow the king cryptocurrency’s coattails, it’s the first-ever and only crypto to offer free Bitcoin to its token holders. All you have to do is store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. These $BTC airdrops will occur every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. As you can see, by doing so, BTC Bull Token has directly tied itself to Bitcoin’s growth. What’s more, the developers have also planned to shave off a part of the total token supply every time Bitcoin’s price increases by $25K. The first token burn event will take place when $BTC reaches $125K – then at $150K, $175K, $200K, and so on. Don’t miss out on one of the best cryptos to invest in now and buy $BTCBULL for just $0.002485 per token. Here’s a guide on how to buy it. A Bitcoin rally is highly likely to pull the entire crypto market along with it. With rising crypto prices across the board, it’d be the perfect time to be a crypto trader and investor. However, for the vast majority of us, finding high-potential tokens before they’ve taken off is an uphill task. That’s why you’re better off using MIND of Pepe ($MIND), an autonomous AI agent coin offering crypto investment advice. $MIND works by interacting with the crypto audience on decentralized applications and online platforms like X. It patiently listens to everyone’s opinion on crypto, punches every piece of unique data into its AI-powered hive-mind intelligence system, and finally identifies the next cryptos to explode. Over $8.4M in presale funding so far is proof that investors believe in AI’s newfound ability to analyze social sentiment trends, which the crypto market heavily relies on for explosive moves. If you buy $MIND today, you’ll have to spend just $0.0037465 per token. Mother Iggy launched towards the end of March and was more or less flat for the first three weeks. It sprung to new life in the last week or so and has since then jumped over nearly 250%. It’s currently the top-trending crypto in the entire market. As the name suggests, $MOTHER is based on the ultra-famous rapper Iggy Azalea, who is renowned for songs like Fancy, Work, and Money Come. Like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, $MOTHER, too, might not have a whole lot of fundamentals supporting it. But that is how it can be with meme coins backed by a celebrity. They enjoy massive hype and trading volume on account of the celebrity’s popularity. This ultimately leads to violent upmoves, i.e., if the token is lucky enough to be successful. $MOTHER is. Currently trading at just $0.01982, $MOTHER might just as well be in the early stages of a huge rally. With expectations for another $BROCCOLI-like run, it could be one of the best low cap coins to buy now. With Bitcoin poised to reclaim its all-time high and potentially rise further, the time is admittedly ripe to invest in some new cryptocurrencies like BTC Bull Token that could rise alongside $BTC. However, bear in mind that the crypto market is volatile and guarantees no returns. Finally, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice.

April 28, 2025 10:40 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, April 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unlimited, an asset management firm and ETF sponsor that uses proprietary technology to provide low-cost, alternative strategies to a variety of investors, today published its Q1 2025 Hedge Fund Barometer, which showed a significant reversal of pro-growth positions in both U.S. equities and corporate bonds over the quarter as well as an increase in bets on gold. According to Unlimited’s proprietary technology, hedge fund managers came into the year with relatively low conviction and modest views but subsequently ramped up pro-growth positions including long the U.S. dollar, and credit spread and equity bets in line with increased expectations of U.S. growth from the new administration. The majority of those positions were reversed starting in February with the exception of extending bullish positions on gold. “Hedge fund positioning shows some of the lowest conviction in the direction of asset prices that we have seen in decades,” said Bob Elliott, CEO and CIO of Unlimited and portfolio manager of actively-managed ETFs. “Those positions were a dramatic transition from the beginning of the quarter when hedge funds were ramping up their bullish bets on the U.S. economy. The prominence of policy volatility likely triggered managers' reluctance to hold significant directional positions.” Hedge funds eked out modestly positive performance in the first quarter with the mix of sub-strategy returns largely reversing the moves of the previous quarter. Emerging Market funds outperformed meaningfully as Chinese stocks surged meanwhile Equity Long/Short and Event Driven strategies came in weak. 1Q25 Hedge Fund Strategy Performance, Gross of Fees Unlimited’s Hedge Fund Barometer showed other notable moves during the quarter included: Click here to view a video on how Unlimited’s technology works.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Quantum computing has long been announced as “just around the corner,” but several companies are now determined to make this a commercial reality, with the promise of solving complex problems beyond classical computers’ reach. The problems in question are wide-ranging, from medicine and cybersecurity to materials science and chemistry. But first, there are very practical problems to be solved, such as developing chips that can reliably host large numbers of qubits — short for quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing. As usual in a high-stakes tech race with an uncertain time horizon, tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are at the forefront. Yet startups are also set to play an important role, especially tackling bottlenecks like connectivity and error correction that are critical for scaling quantum systems. But some startups and smaller tech companies are taking on the chip challenge head-on and deserve mention alongside the more attention-grabbing efforts from industry giants. While Big Tech projects typically boast the highest qubit counts, rethinking designs from first principles and using different approaches could yield equally promising results. Here are some of the companies behind the main quantum chip projects that are worth tracking. Akhetonics is a German photonics startup working on an all-optical, general-purpose chip — a contrarian bet in a field where most focus on narrower applications. This bold version and its first-principles approach helped the company raise a €6 million seed funding round led by Matterwave Ventures in November 2024. Alice & Bob is a French startup that raised a $104 million Series B round of funding in January 2025 to continue working toward building a “fault tolerant” quantum computer. Unlike companies focusing only on chips, Alice & Bob is developing a full quantum computing system. To do so, it relies on cat qubits, a type of superconducting qubit designed to reduce errors and simplify error correction. Amazon officially joined the quantum chip race in early 2025 when AWS introduced Ocelot, developed in partnership with the California Institute of Technology. While this is the company’s first quantum chip, AWS had previously launched Braket, a quantum computing service, in partnership with D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti, and others. Atom Computing is a U.S. company building quantum computers with arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms. At the Microsoft Ignite 2024 conference, Microsoft and Atom Computing announced plans to launch a commercial quantum computer in 2025. D-Wave is a quantum computing company whose latest flagship system, the Advantage2 prototype, relies on a process called quantum annealing, which uses quantum physics to find the most stable, lowest-energy arrangements of elements to figure out the best mix for a given problem. Founded in 1999 as a spinoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada, D-Wave is now a public company listed on the NYSE. Illinois-based EeroQ is a startup betting on helium for its quantum chip design. Having raised a $7.25 million seed funding round in 2022 and received regional public support, the company made a $1.1 million commitment in September 2024 toward expanding its HQ in Chicago’s Humboldt Park. In April 2025, Fujitsu and Japanese research institution RIKEN announced having developed a 256-qubit superconducting quantum computer at the RIKEN RQC-FUJITSU Collaboration Center, up from a 64-qubit iteration in 2023. In December 2024, Google announced Willow, its latest quantum computing chip. Google didn’t stop at saying Willow was better than its predecessor, Sycamore, or at describing it as “a major breakthrough in quantum error correction.” In a statement that made headlines, Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven wrote that Willow’s performance lent “credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes.” IBM’s quantum efforts include Condor, its milestone superconducting chip for scaling up to 1,121 qubits, and Heron, a 156-qubit processor focused on improved performance and lower error rates. Intel is developing quantum computers based on silicon spin qubits. In June 2023, it unveiled Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit research chip, and said a next-generation quantum chip based on Tunnel Falls was expected to be released in 2024, but this hasn’t happened. IonQ is a publicly listed U.S. company developing trapped-ion quantum computers, including the IonQ Forte. After going public via a SPAC in late 2021, it acquired Canadian networking specialist Entangled Networks. IQM is a Finnish startup building superconducting quantum computers and is a spinout of the Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It received funding in its early days from the Business Finland government agency, followed by additional support from the EIC Accelerator program. In 2022, IQM raised €128 million in Series A2 funding led by World Fund, adding to the €39 million led by MIG Fonds it had raised in 2020 as part of what was then its Series A. This second tranche included part of a previously announced €35 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank, as well as participation from the EIC Fund and others. In February 2025, Microsoft introduced Majorana, a quantum chip using a topological core architecture. Microsoft previously declared that it expected to build a quantum supercomputer within 10 years. Pasqal is a French startup taking a full-stack approach to quantum computing and betting on neutral atoms. The company emerged out of the Institut d’Optique in 2019, and its co-founders include 2022 Nobel Prize laureate for physics and professor Alain Aspect. In February 2023, Pascal raised a €100 million Series B funding round led by Singapore’s Temasek, with participation from existing investors Quantonation, the Defense Innovation Fund, Daphni, and Eni Next, as well as new investors European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund, Wa’ed Ventures, and Bpifrance (through its Large Venture Fund). PsiQuantum is a quantum computing startup using photonics technology and aiming to build “a 1 million-quantum-bit machine.” In February 2025, it announced Omega, a quantum photonic chipset manufactured at GlobalFoundries in New York. In 2021, PsiQuantum landed a $450 million Series D investment led by BlackRock, which is now said to be leading a potential $750 million round into the company at a $6 billion pre-money valuation. Founded by Australian academics, it is also backed by the Australian and Queensland governments. Qilimanjaro is a Spanish startup focusing on analog quantum app-specific integrated circuits (QASICs) and taking a full-stack approach, including hardware, software, and applications. Based in Barcelona, it won the Four Years From Now startup competition at Mobile World Congress in 2024, going on to receive €1.5 million in funding from Catalonia later that year. Quandela is a French startup founded in 2017 to develop photonic quantum computers. In November 2023, Quandela raised a €50 million Series B and received support from the French government through the France 2030 Plan. Quantinuum is a quantum computing company formed in 2021 by the merger of Cambridge Quantum and Honeywell Quantum Solutions. Its flagship product is the H-Series of trapped-ion quantum computers. In April 2024, together with Microsoft, it announced a breakthrough in error correction. QuantWare is a Dutch startup that came up with a proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, which focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs). It started accepting preorders for Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction, in February 2025. Founded in 2020, it is a spinout of TU Delft and its affiliated research institute, QuTech. In March 2025, and following a €6 million seed round in 2023, it announced having raised a €20 million Series A (approximately $19.27 million) — including €5 million in equity out of the €7.5 million it previously secured from the European Innovation Council (the remainder is a grant). Boston-based QuEra is betting on neutral atoms as the “best approach to achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.” Its products include Aquila, a 256-qubit analog neutral-atom quantum computer launched in 2022 and accessible via Amazon Braket. QuEra is notably backed by Google, which led the $230 debt round that the quantum startup raised in February 2025 — with a convertible note also backed by SoftBank, Valor, and existing investors. Founded in 2013 by Chad Rigetti, Rigetti Computing is a quantum company focusing on superconducting technology. Its range of products include Ankaa-3 and the uppcoming 336-qubit Lyra system. Just like rivals D-Wave and IonQ, Rigetti Computing is a listed company; it raised just under $200 million in VC capital before going public via a SPAC in 2021. In February 2025, it signed a strategic partnership with Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, which is set to invest $35 million and purchase shares of Rigetti, while both companies invest more than $100 million each over the next five years to accelerate the development and commercialization of superconducting quantum computing. U.S. quantum startup SEEQC — an acronym for “scalable, energy efficient quantum computing” — is a spinout of chip company Hypres, which was itself established by former employees of IBM’s superconducting electronics division. In 2023, SEEQC announced a partnership with Nvidia to build an “all-digital, ultra-low-latency chip-to-chip link between quantum computers and GPUs.” In January 2025, SEEQC raised a $30 million round of funding co-led by Booz Allen Ventures and Japanese-European VC firm NordicNinja. Other backers include Merck’s corporate venture capital arm, M Ventures. SEEQC is leading the U.K.-supported QuPharma project to explore how quantum computing can accelerate drug discovery, in partnership with BASF and Merck. SpinQ is a Chinese startup founded in 2018 that develops quantum computers. It claims that some of them are portable and making use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Xanadu is a Canadian startup aiming to build quantum computers through a photonic approach. In January 2025, it introduced Aurora, a 12-qubit system, including 35 photonic chips. Founded in 2016, Xanadu raised some $275 million to date, including a $100 million Series C in November 2022 at a $1 billion valuation.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 04/28 update below. This post was originally published on April 27 Bitcoin has bounced back this week alongside tech stocks after a leak revealed serious establishment fears of crypto “contagion." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin as one closely-watched crypto investor calls the market bottom, telling people to “buy everything” ahead of a Federal Reserve flip. Now, as Binance’s chief executive confirms wild speculation that could blow up the bitcoin price, "major" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has grappling with the end of a "higher for longer" U.S. dollar ... More amid predictions of a bitcoin price boom. “The preconditions are now in place for the beginning of a major dollar downtrend,” Deutsche Bank analysts George Saravelos and Tim Baker wrote seen by MarketWatch in a note, pointing to a huge shift in U.S. trade policy and a global reassessment of U.S. geopolitical leadership and predicting the end of a “higher for longer” dollar. The U.S. dollar has been supported in recent months by Fed chair Jerome Powell’s relatively hawkish approach to interest rates in the face of inflation fears, though U.S. president Donald Trump has piled pressure on Powell to cut rates. “Given the historical developments of the last few months our EUR/USD forecasts now anticipate the dollar entering a long-winded downcycle,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, adding that, "in a world of extreme uncertainty and rapidly shifting policy norms, the risk of market dislocations and regime breaks remains high." The warning echos the concerns of Goldman Sachs’ head of FX who told Bloomberg this week that the U.S. dollar’s weakness is “here to stay,” as the world adjusts to the new tariff-based international trade order established by Trump. 04/28 update: The bitcoin price has climbed over $95,000 per bitcoin as traders bet the worst of the tariff-induced sell-off is over, cheering data that showed investors poured $3.4 billion into crypto investment products, including the fleet of U.S. bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds, last week— the third-largest on record—according to asset manager CoinShares. "We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets, which are being seen as an emerging safe haven," CoinShares head of research James Butterfill wrote in a report. The bitcoin price rally over the last week, adding 20% to bitcoin from its April low, has emboldened crypto bulls who are now predicting a new bitcoin price all-time high over $110,000 is “imminent.” “Timing the upswing is tricky, but we think it is imminent; we expect a fresh all-time high in the second quarter,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. “Bitcoin accumulation by ‘whales’ (major holders) has been strong. Meanwhile, ETF flows in the past week suggest safe-haven reallocation from gold into bitcoin. We expect these supportive factors to push bitcoin to a fresh all-time high around $120,000 in the second quarter. We see gains continuing through the summer, taking bitcoin towards our year-end forecast of $200,000.” Meanwhile, Jay Jacobs, the head of thematics and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, has predicted “geopolitical fragmentation” will be a “megaforce that drives the world forward over the next several decades." "Directly related to that geopolitical fragmentation is the rise of bitcoin as people see more destabilisation and the need for alternative assets," Jacobs said during an interview with CNBC and adding that the bitcoin price is “decoupling" from technology stocks. "Fundamentally, [bitcoin] should behave like an uncorrelated asset," Jacobs said. "The more we see time play out in this uncertain environment, the more we will see this dispersion."

More fears swirl over the future of the U.S. dollar. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs: Grayscale’s GBTC is dominating this front – How?

Grayscale’s GBTC tops Bitcoin ETF annual earnings at $268M despite 70% decline in AUM. Despite being the most expensive, Grayscale Bitcoin [BTC] Trust ETF (GBTC) has outpaced the total revenue collected by the rest of the U.S. spot BTC ETFs. In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Nate Geraci of ETF Store highlighted that GBTC had an implied revenue of $268 million, compared to $211 million from combined collections by the other 11 products. “Nearly 16 months after spot BTC ETFs launched, GBTC still making more $$$ than all of the other ETFs combined…And it’s not even close.” Source: X After the debut in January 2024, Grayscale’s GBTC saw the heaviest outflows on what analysts linked to investor flight to cheaper alternatives like BlackRock’s iShares BTC ETF. Source: Coinglass Before the debut, GBTC held about 619,000 BTC. Sixteen months later, the GBTC’s holdings dropped to 191,000 BTC, a nearly 70% decline in assets under management (AUM). As shown by Geraci’s data, GBTC charged the highest fees of 1.5% while the rest of the products had an average cost of 0.15%-0.94%. Yet GBTC dominated the overall annual revenue. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, GBTC’s 1.5% fee was considered average in the traditional ETF market. However, other analysts pointed out that most investors were captured in GBTC due to the heavy tax implications of switching to a cheaper alternative. Daniel Sempere, a business coach, stated, “Paying the capital gains to switch out of GBTC is more painful than paying the extra fees, I guess.” Simply put, the high fees and captive tax implications boosted GBTC earnings. However, can the expected approval of in-kind redemption for ETFs affect GBTC’s moat? According to experts, in-kind redemption, using BTC instead of cash, would lower the tax burden, especially for large investors. Despite in-kind redemption being tax-efficient, individual investors sitting on massive unrealized gains will still face capital gains tax. That said, GBTC ranked third on the AUM front with $17.8 billion. The BlackRock iShares BTC ETF topped the AUM list with $54.8 billion, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $18 billion. After the slump in Q1 2025, the spot BTC ETFs saw renewed demand in April, with a whopping $3 billion in inflows. This boosted BTC’s recovery to $94k, up 26% from the year’s low of $74.5k. In the short term, the $92K range low support and $100K overhead mid-range resistance were key levels to watch.

Title: The Case for Higher-Ed “Co-Op” Programs

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/28/2025 3:31:01 AM PDT by karpov Like many students, I waited months after graduation before receiving a job offer. Why this delay for many of the nation’s recent graduates? The answer, in part, is that most “entry-level” positions now require candidates to have one to three years of experience. In fact, roughly 61 percent of entry-level job postings now demand at least three years. How is a fresh graduate supposed to gain experience without years-long internships, which many students don’t pursue? A potential solution to this problem is for universities to adopt the “co-op” or cooperative model, in which students alternate between working for a company and attending classes. Through the co-op model, students are given the opportunity to spend some semesters working for a company and others in class. A student applies to a co-op program at a large, respected corporation, such as BlackRock, JP Morgan, Exelon, Comcast, and others, and then interviews as if he or she were applying for a real job or internship. Once accepted, he or she begins working at that company at a predetermined time in the academic year. This model not only provides students with valuable work experience before graduation, but it also helps them build a network of professional contacts who can help them find future opportunities. Let’s consider two of the schools in the top 100 according to U.S. News: Drexel University in Philadelphia, ranked 86th overall, and North Carolina State University, ranked 58th. As of this writing, Drexel, at which more than 94 percent of undergraduates participate in a co-op program, places 97 percent of its business students in jobs (or graduate school) within the first year after graduation. Sixty-one percent of all graduates have at least one job offer upon graduation. (Excerpt) Read more at jamesgmartin.center ...

Co-ops are similar to internships, and I have personal knowledge of what’s happening now with internships: People thought college students should graduate with experience. So, many universities (maybe all of them?) now require all students to complete an internship before they can graduate. The problem is, the universities don’t place the students. It’s up to the students to find the internship, and it must be one approved by the university. As a result, some students are being denied degrees, even after they finished all their course work, because they can’t find an internship that’s acceptable to the college and will hire them. 14 posted on 04/29/2025 5:30:01 AM PDT by Tired of Taxes [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: Tired of Taxes Bad College, If they make a requirement for graduation, they should support that requirement.

Title: Parties involved in CK Hutchison's port transaction must not circumvent review process: China's State Administration for Market Regulation
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2025/04/mil-250427-globaltimes03.htm

Global Times By Global Times Published: Apr 27, 2025 08:32 PM China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said on Sunday that it is paying close attention to CK Hutchison's planned sale of its overseas port assets and will conduct a review in accordance with the law, CCTV reported. The regulator emphasized that all parties involved in the transaction must not take any measures to circumvent the review process by any means or implement concentration activities without regulatory approval. Otherwise, legal responsibility will be pursued, CCTV reported. The SAMR's statement came in response to media inquiries following a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report on April 16. The WSJ reported that CK Hutchison plans to split its overseas port asset sale into two separate transactions, as a way to advance the deals. According to the WSJ, the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) is considering carving out two Panamanian ports from the $22.8 billion deal to purchase dozens of terminals from CK Hutchison, citing sources familiar with the matter. MSC has reportedly discussed advancing the majority of the acquisition, which involves 41 port terminals across five continents, while resolving disputes over the two Panamanian ports, the WSJ reported. The deal involves collaboration with US asset manager BlackRock and has been structured into two components with different ownership frameworks: one for the Panama ports and another for the remaining assets. Discussions on the two components are moving in parallel, and separating the Panama ports would ultimately require the parties to reach a new agreement, according to the WSJ. The WSJ further noted that the BlackRock-MSC consortium and Hutchison are currently within a 145-day exclusive negotiation period and have not yet signed final agreements. Prior to the report, a spokesperson from the second antitrust enforcement division of SAMR said on March 28 that it would review CK Hutchison's Panama Canal ports deal in accordance with the law to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, according to a Q&A release conducted by Hong Kong Ta Kung Wen Wei Media and published on the regulator's official website. On March 31, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun responded to the SAMR's review of the planned port asset sale at a press briefing, stressing that China firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries' legitimate rights and interests.

GBTC is still "making more $$$ than all of the other ETFs combined..." Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, stated on X on Sunday. "And it's not even close." The fund generates approximately $268.5 million in annual revenue, with a 1.5% expense ratio applied to $17.9 billion in assets under management, according to Coinglass data. All the other U.S.-Bitcoin ETFs shown by Geraci generate an implied annual revenue of a little over $211.8 million from a total of $89 billion in assets under management. GBTC's revenue dominance persists despite losing more than half its holdings since spot Bitcoin ETFs went live in January 2024, revealing how fee structures have shaped the fund's economics, regardless of market share. Aside from its first-mover advantage and brand recognition, Grayscale's control over GBTC's management allows it to charge a 1.5% fee. For example, BlackRock's IBIT holds three times more assets, at $56 billion, compared to GBTC's $18 billion, but it generates only about $137 million in revenue with its 0.25% fee. In response, Grayscale launched its Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) in March 2025 primarily to offer a lower-cost alternative to GBTC’s fee, while also diversifying its product lineup amid intensifying competition. Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) pioneered regulated Bitcoin investment in 2013 as a private trust, before offering an ETF in January of last year, alongside several other ETF issuers. All this rolled into place after Grayscale won a landmark case against the then-Gensler-led SEC to convert its trust to an ETF. When a trust converts to an ETF, key aspects of its structure change. From a closed-end form, it becomes open-ended, allowing shares to be redeemed based on demand. Because their distribution and transaction costs are different and often lower, the expense ratios for ETFs have been "historically less than those for corresponding mutual funds," the SEC explains. As such, ETFs "can be more tax efficient" because ETF shares are generally redeemable "in-kind," the SEC notes. In April last year, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein claimed that the fees "will come down" as the ETF market matures. The largest single-day outflow for GBTC was recorded on March 19, 2024, totaling $618 million, according to CoinGlass data. At this pace, it could run out of Bitcoin by July 8, though James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, previously told Decrypt that its outflows would "slow from here."

Photograph what interests you, that’s how you’ll succeed in the competition. “Virtual beginners have entered and done very well for themselves. The competition can help people develop their craft, it’s an inclusive, enjoyable experience. I would encourage people to get involved in their local camera club and give it a go.” Charlie O'Donovan being presented with his prize by Ita Hegarty, President of the Irish Photographic Federation.

With BTC sittin’ pretty at $94K, you know the bulls are runnin’ wild. Eric’s Take: Yo, this ain’t no retail FOMO—this is Wall Street suits stackin’ sats like it’s their day job. When the big dogs like BlackRock and ARK are goin’ all-in, you know Bitcoin’s about to pop off. Keep your eyes peeled, ‘cause this could send us to the moon, fr. 2. Senator McCormick’s Stackin’ BTC, No Cap Hold up, we got a US Senator in the game now! @unusual_whales and @BitcoinMagazine dropped the tea that Senator Dave McCormick copped up to $250K in Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF. A politician bettin’ on BTC? That’s wild, fam. X is lit with folks sayin’ this could mean friendlier crypto laws down the road. If the suits in DC are hodlin’, you know Bitcoin’s gettin’ that mainstream glow-up. Eric’s Take: A senator stackin’ sats is straight-up bullish. This ain’t just about one dude’s portfolio—it’s a signal that crypto’s creepin’ into the Capitol. If more politicians jump on the Bitcoin train, we might see some real policy moves. Big W for the crypto crew. 3. Price Predictions Got Us Dreamin’ of Lambos X is poppin’ with price predictions, and they’re lookin’ juicy. @Vivek4real_ is hypin’ Bitwise’s call that Bitcoin could hit $200K, especially if countries start scoopin’ it up. @AltcoinDailyio’s teasin’ a video with end-of-2025 price targets, and you know it’s gonna be wild. Then there’s Michael Saylor, the OG, droppin’ bars on @BitcoinMagazine, sayin’ BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF gonna be the biggest ETF in a decade. With BTC at $94K and that cup-and-handle pattern poppin’ off (@Bitcoinmeraklsi), the chart nerds are losin’ it. Eric’s Take: $200K? Bruh, I’m already picturin’ the Lambo. But for real, these predictions ain’t just hype—big players are backin’ it with cash. Saylor’s callin’ it like he sees it, and when institutions and charts align, you better strap in. We might be lookin’ at six figures real soon. 4. Whales and Institutions Runnin’ the Show Here’s the tea from @HHorsley: Bitcoin’s at $94K, but Google searches for it are mad low. What’s that mean? Retail ain’t drivin’ this pump—it’s the whales and institutions, baby. @whale_alert caught a fat 564 BTC ($53 milly) movin’ from Antpool to Binance, and @Bitcoinmeraklsi’s talkin’ big transfers too. X is sayin’ the big boys are buyin’ while the crowd’s still sleepin’. Eric’s Take: Yo, when the whales are feastin’ and retail’s snoozin’, that’s when you know the smart money’s movin’. These dudes are stackin’ like it’s a cheat code. If you ain’t payin’ attention, you’re missin’ the wave. Time to wake up and get in the game. 5. CZ Droppin’ Truth Bombs on the Ecosystem My man Changpeng Zhao (CZ) got X shook with some real talk. @erhanunall posted that CZ’s sayin’ this bull run is all about Bitcoin ‘cause of them ETFs, but the altcoin season’s gotta pop off for the whole crypto ecosystem to thrive. That’s got folks on X debatin’ whether BTC’s hoggin’ the spotlight or settin’ the stage for the alts. Eric’s Take: CZ’s spittin’ facts. Bitcoin’s the king, no doubt, but the alts need some love too. If we get that altcoin pump, the whole crypto space is gonna be eatin’. Keep an eye on them smaller coins, ‘cause they might be the next to moon. Why This Matters, Fam This ain’t just news—it’s the pulse of the crypto game right now. Bitcoin’s flexin’ with ETF money, political clout, and whale moves, all while the X community’s hypin’ it to the stars. The sentiment? Bullish AF. But don’t get it twisted—@HHorsley’s point about low retail vibes means this is the calm before the storm. When the crowd catches up, it’s gonna be a whole vibe. Eric’s Final Word: Yo, Bitcoin’s out here makin’ power plays while the world’s still tryna catch up. Whether it’s senators, ETFs, or Saylor’s big bets, the game’s changin’. Stack them sats, stay humble, and don’t sleep on this wave. We in the future, fam—let’s ride it. Peace!

Title: Google Declared An Illegal Monopoly For The Second Time In A Year, Digital Ad Network Under Fire

Google's ad services are an illegal monopoly, according to a ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema. The decision, which was handed down April 17, is the second antitrust ruling against the company in the last year. In her opinion, the judge ruled that the company's ad business, which matches website publishers with advertisers and determines which banner ads appear on which sites across the web, has violated antitrust law. Don't Miss: "For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets," Brinkema wrote in her 115-page ruling. Continuing, "Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anti-competitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features." According to the Associated Press, the construction of the monopolizing ad system began back in 2008, when Google bought online ad specialist DoubleClick for $3.2 billion. At the time, U.S. regulators approved the purchase. Now, they've realized that move enabled the company to manipulate ad prices. The Justice Department argued that Google controls all three corners of the digital ad market— one side that allows website publishers to sell ad space on their websites, the other is the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of viewers, and the third is the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions that connect buyers and sellers. Today's Best Finance Deals Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Google has said it plans to appeal the ruling. "Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective," Lee-Anne Mulholand, the company's vice president of regulatory affairs, the media reports. According to the AP, the company's lawyers argued that the government is basing its case on antiquated concepts that were relevant a decade ago, but are no longer a good framework for understanding the highly competitive market for advertising that exists currently. The decision marks the Justice Department's second victory over the tech giant in a year. Last August, US District Judge Amit Mehta, ruled that Google held an illegal monopoly on search. In that ruling, the judge said that the company's exclusive contracts, which secured them the spot as the No. 1 search engine on smartphones and web browsers, violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. And back in 2023, a federal jury found the Google app store to be an illegal monopoly. The cases are expected to play out over the next several years as Google appeals the decisions.
