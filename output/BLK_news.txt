Overview The Indian asset management industry has witnessed remarkable growth over the past decade, driven by an increasing awareness of financial planning, a surge in retail participation, and robust economic expansion. This sector, which encompasses mutual funds, portfolio management services, and alternative investment funds, has become a pivotal part of India's financial landscape with a total AUM of ~₹117 or $1.3 trillion. With the asset management industry growing 6x in the last decade, the outlook also looks positive with growth in mutual fund expected at CAGR of 14%, portfolio management services and alternative investment funds at CAGR of 26% till 2028. In the last decade (from FY14 to FY25), the PMS and AIF markets have been growing at a rate of 33% per year. As India aspires to have $35 trillion economy size by 2047 and enters its next phase of rapid development, PMSes and AIFs are increasingly becoming the vehicle of choice for HNIs and UHNIs, seeking more personalized and higher-yielding investment options. This point of view explores the emerging trends and growth trajectory of the asset management industry with a specific focus on mutual funds. Key trends in mutual funds The India Mutual Fund Industry is expected to reach USD 0.78 trillion in 2025 and grow at a CAGR of greater than 18% to reach USD 1.78 trillion by 2030. Millennials and Gen Z are increasingly interested in mutual funds because they are more likely to embrace technology and digital tools for investing. There is also an increased focus on expansion into smaller towns and rural areas by offering micro- investing which is as low as INR 500. Tier 2 and tier 3 cities now account for more than 35% of new SIP registrations, demonstrating the widening geographic spread of Indian mutual funds. Women investors now represent approximately 33% of new mutual fund accounts, showing improved gender diversity in the Indian financial market. With tools like mobile apps, robo-advisors, and data analytics, investors can manage their portfolios in real time and track their investments with ease. The use of technology makes mutual funds more accessible to the average Indian investor, who can now easily invest and track their portfolio from the comfort of their home. Partnerships between AMCs, fintech companies, and technology providers help in creating digital platforms that can offer a wide range of financial services in one place and build platforms that offer superior customer service, including faster onboarding, online transaction capabilities, better customer grievance resolution, efficient and timely dashboards. At the same time, digital payment systems make it easier to transfer funds and complete transactions. DSP Asset Managers has joined hands with Cybrilla to become one of the first mutual fund companies to go live on the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). The Network’s open design lets more distributors, including local entrepreneurs and fintech startups—offer mutual funds to a wider audience. Because ONDC Network is decentralized, DSP and its partners can create new investment products like daily SIPs or goal-based micro-investments. Newer thematic funds have adopted increasingly focused, narrow ideas. From housing, defense and manufacturing, NFOs have moved on to target themes like tourism, electric vehicles, rural opportunities, conglomerates, among other flavours. Among the latest offerings, funds are targeting ideas like Railway PSUs and premium consumption. . In India, the ESG theme is also gaining popularity, and a few fund houses have launched ESG-thematic funds. India's passive mutual fund AUM surged 21% YoY to ₹11.13 lakh crore in March 2025, with equity ETFs and index funds dominating the landscape. Passive funds now account for 16.7% of the overall mutual fund industry AUM, reflecting a growing shift towards index-linked strategies. The growth in passive AUM over the past year underlines a shift in investor preference towards low-cost, rule-based investment vehicles. While equity ETFs and index funds dominate the landscape, the performance of debt and commodity passive funds presents a nuanced picture of evolving investor sentiment and market conditions. Recently Jio BlackRock has received approval from India's markets regulator to launch five passive index funds. Key drivers for growth Financial literacy initiatives and campaigns by industry bodies like AMFI (Sahi hai, Bharat Nivesh Yatra etc) are playing a crucial role in educating investors about the benefits of mutual funds which is a significant factor for choosing mutual funds as an investment option among retail investors. Online platforms and mobile apps (Zerodha and Groww (1+ crore total users) have simplified the investment process, making it more convenient for retail investors, especially the younger generation. These platforms simplify investment journeys with features such as goal-based investing, real-time portfolio tracking and personalized recommendations, empowering investors to make informed and independent decisions. Declining interest rates on traditional savings instruments like fixed deposits have encouraged investors to explore higher-yielding options like stock markets. India’s total demat account is expected to cross 18 crores by Nov 2024 – growing by over 4 crores in 2024 alone. NSE recorded the highest number of initial public offerings (IPOs) in Asia for the calendar year 2024 (CY24), with a total of 268 listings across its mainboard and SME platform. The trend is expected to continue in 2025; will enhance investor options. SEBI has permitted investments in new asset classes like REITs, InVITs, Gold and silver ETFs, expanding the investment options available to mutual funds. Alternative assets market in India is expected to grow 5X to USD 2 Tn by 2034. Alternative investments outperform traditional investment options, offering higher alpha, attracting increased interest from India’s HNI and UHNI segments SEBI has been instrumental in promoting transparency and lower costs in the mutual fund industry. Some of the regulations include the recent Mutual Fund Lite Regulations (2024) to bring compliance, new regulations seeking a clear segregation of offshore derivative instruments (ODIs) and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and mandated more disclosures to reduce systemic risks in India's capital market relaxations for the passively managed schemes. Key challenges for fund houses Low financial literacy in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities and a preference for traditional, more straightforward and perceived-safer options, such as fixed deposits, PPFs, and gold, hindered broader adoption. Similar challenges exist in the rural areas with the added factor of linguistic hindrances and lack of digital knowledge limiting the usage of digital platforms. There is more focus on the B-30 cities to attract investments, which has resulted in growth up to 40% in those cities. Severe market corrections and inherent volatility of equity markets have been major deterrents for casual retail investors from investing in mutual funds due to uncertain market returns. High investment costs in terms of total expense ratios due to exit loads, management fees and commissions are also additional challenges. Stable alternatives like public provident fund (PPF) also reduced the investments. HDFC Mutual Fund recently announced a hike in the Total Expense Ratio (TER) for its Mid-Cap Opportunities Fund from 0.67% to 0.73%. Despite increasing awareness mutual funds has limited set of AMFI distributors concentrated mainly in metropolitan areas. This has led to smaller investors and rural investors to take a cautious approach due to lack of advisory support and lack of confidence in investing independently in equity linked investments. Apart from the regular banks, another intriguing development is the inclusion of 18 boutique Mutual Fund Distributor (MFD) firms in the list of top 100. These boutique MFD firms are notably supported by individual MFDs, indicating a growing presence of niche, independent players. Although the mutual fund industry has made considerable progress in standardizing processes, a few challenges persist. These include simplifying the KYC procedures to ensure hassle-free onboarding, allowing Aadhaar to be used interchangeably with PAN, and enabling investments based on “Bank KYC”. The data localization requirements and cost sensitivity of Indian markets also hurt foreign fund houses. Only six of the Top 20 Asset Management companies in India are foreign owned fund houses. Among these, Invesco formed a joint venture with IndusInd International Holdings Limited (IIHL) by selling off 60% stake in 2024 and notable is the Jio Blackrock joint venture. The mutual fund companies are finding it difficult to expand into different businesses due to Clause 24 of the mutual fund regulation dealing with the issues pertaining to business activities that AMCs can take. The regulation mandates AMCs not to undertake business activities that are in conflict of interest with the core business of managing mutual fund schemes. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is reviewing its mutual fund regulations, including the scheme categorization framework and restrictions on asset management company (AMC) activities to simplify compliance and reduce regulatory burden. The growth trajectory At least six new fund houses have in-principle approval to set up the mutual fund business which includes big names like Jio Blackrock, Capital mind etc. While new entrants like Jio BlackRock plan to cater to all segments of the mutual fund business — including active, passive, and smart-beta strategies — and offer products across equity, debt, and hybrid categories, others are adopting a more focused approach. Some of the fund houses plan to exclusively offer passive funds, meanwhile others plan to concentrate on factor-based and quantitative investing strategies. Therefore, identifying the right theme is crucial for success. To attract NRI/foreign investments or overseas investments from India, many foreign FIs have set up branches in GIFT City. DSP Mutual Fund’s Global equity fund is the first open ended mutual fund for retail investors under the GIFT city which allows Indian residents to invest in a diversified portfolio of global equities. US-based State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), the asset management division of State Street Corporation, has established a strategic relationship with small case, a provider of model portfolios and investment platforms in India’s capital markets. The collaboration will enable SSGA to distribute its Standard & Poor’s Depositary Receipt (SPDR) ETFs through small case’s digital investment platform, opening up avenues for Indian investors to access global markets. Thus, foreign fund houses find it beneficial to partner with Indian Financial Institutions (Fis) to launch Asset Management Products. Anticipated advancements in fintech and AI will continue to reshape the mutual fund industry, offering innovative solutions for investors. Collaboration between AMCs, fintech startups, and technology providers will drive the expansion of integrated digital platforms, providing holistic financial solutions. Moreover, the proliferation of digital payment systems and open banking initiatives will facilitate seamless fund transfers and transaction processing, further enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of mutual fund services. Ensuring data privacy and protection is paramount, requiring continuous investment in cybersecurity measures and regulatory compliance initiatives. RTAs (Registrar and Transfer Agents) are the operational backbone of the mutual fund industry. RTAs leverage automation, enabling AMCs to scale operations efficiently while ensuring error-free processing and reliable services. This has significantly reduced operational costs and enhanced efficiency for AMCs, allowing them to cater to the market’s growing demands. RTAs also provide centralized digital platforms, offering investors real-time access to portfolios, transaction histories and account details, enhancing transparency and convenience. Women investors are increasingly making their mark in the mutual fund space, with their share of investments growing significantly over the past five years. According to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), women now hold 33% of the total individual investor assets under management (AUM) as of March 2024. Conclusion In summary, the growth trajectory remains strong with 6x increase measured by AUM over the last decade or so is attributed to the concerted efforts of all stakeholders of the ecosystem. AMCs developed innovative products and made them attractive for average investors (SIPs, FoFs, ETFs, etc.); technological interventions such as digital-first platforms by new-age players and digital tools and infrastructure were established by RTAs to streamline onboarding, settlement, record-keeping and servicing; campaigns were created to drive customer awareness and distribution reach by AMFI (MF Sahi Hai, MFD Shuru Karein); and regulatory interventions were imposed around product simplicity, affordability, democratization and sustainability.

Title: “The Corporate Takeover of Housing”

Yves here. It is very hard to know where to begin with this article, since it repeats many tropes about the US housing market that are simply false. The big problem in the US is housing affordability. There is no housing shortage: The total is just short of 148 million. About 35% is rental property, which has a typical vacancy rate of 7%, so one could argue for reducing the total stock by 3.6 million. FRED shows the active listings for owned residences at under 1.1 million; Zillow has the for-sale inventory as of end of June at 1.3 million. Generously (for the purpose of this analysis) using the Zillow figure and assuming all homes listed for sale are not occupied, we get 143.1 million, so say 143 million. The Census put the number of households (admittedly as of 2023) at 127.8 million. So there is no housing shortage on a macro level, as many claim. Now real estate is always and ever local, so there are shortages in certainly chronically underhoused metro areas like New York City, and no doubt in certain other spots. The not-sufficiently-discussed issues are the mismatch in housing stock composition versus needs (particularly the dearth of affordable housing) and the way policy schemes to increase housing affordability, just like the canard of health care “access”, have increased prices and enriched providers. Let’s go through some underlying issues: 1. The breakdown of the traditional model of housing as a forced savings vehicle for retirement. Matt Stoller wrote about this in a law review article: The Housing Crash and the End of AmericanCitizenship. Back in the days when blue collar workers could buy a house, pay for a car in cash, and have a stay-at-home wife, jobs were stable. My father, who changed employers a few times, got raised eyebrows for tenures of less than 10 years. And even if not, labor demand was generally strong enough that a worker had good odds of landing other work in the same community for the same or even better pay. So the 30 year mortgage was a good match for a typical career duration. A worker or professional would buy a home and pay off the mortgage and then live in it at lower cost when he retired. Much shorter employment tenures are the norm. The average US employee has been with their current company only 3.9 years. Changing employers might entail moving, when transaction costs compared to the equity in a house are high. Divorce and disability also lead to home sales rather than staying put until you pay off the mortgage. 2. The US response to lack of housing affordability: to make housing less affordable. Dean Baker wrote about this after the global financial crisis (with worked examples) and was ignored. First buyer subsidies, allowing for more leverage, using government guarantees to lower interest rates allow for greater borrowing when buying homes which over time has helped drive up prices. 3. Zoning and shelter porn have contributed to too much building of too many big houses and not enough “starter homes” of the sort constructed after World War II and more modestly-sized condos and townhouses. This table, although with dated data, presents per capita as opposed to per house data, and gives an even clearer picture of how extravagantly housed (on average) Americans are: Many communities also resist building denser, as in less expensive housing, aka apartments and townhouses. Another zoning contributor has been the end of single room occupancy hotels and boarding houses, where tenants would rent a room and share a bathroom. Some boarding houses offered meals for an additional charge. I had assumed that gentrification was the big driver for the loss of this sort of dwelling. However (and the passage of these laws and regulations may have been part of this gentrification process), in California, and I assume nearly all places, it is illegal to have a housing unit with no bathroom. The argument is that it was a health risk to have a shared bathroom. 4. As Elizabeth Warren outlined in The Two Income Trap, not mentioning how rising income inequality and the loss of inexpensive college education at often very good state schools (government subsidies fell markedly in the 1980s) has led to much greater competition to get into “good” colleges, led in turn to the phenomenon she flagged, of the big premium for housing in “good” and “pretty good” school districts. The article also incorrectly states that “home prices have surged nationwide.” Admittedly this Zillow chart goes back only to 2017. Although “surge” is arguably accurate, the text gives the impression that this is a long-term phenomenon when over the last decade, the frenzied buying during the Covid work from home phenomenon was the big perp. The Zillow chart does show a faster rate of increase, but the table below makes the pattern clearer: The US has not seen anything approaching the 2021 nominal increase of 19% and real increase of 12% in decades. However, it is true that with stagnant real wages, the increase in housing prices can and likely does exceed the increase in average real wages. And that is a huge issue. But that was not the claim made. In addition, the headline claim is incorrect as far as single family homes are concerned. Yes, private equity firms bought foreclosed homes from Fannie and Freddie after the crisis (and not in bulk sales, there was so much interest that the GSE did only “mini-bulks”). We warned at the time that single family homes were not well suited to corporate ownership and property management. They are too diverse in type and construction and too spread out to be managed efficiently. There are no scale factors save at most in rent collection. Consider the corporate owner’s economics versus that of the classic small landlord. He might be an electrician, plumber or carpenter and have someone regular who could perform the tasks beyond his expertise. The houses he owned would be nearby. And he would know their quirks. By contrast, the driving distances alone and the difficulty of managing maintenance staff efficiently works against the owner of dispersed single family homes. Wikipedia notes: According to John Burns Research & Consulting, only 0.4 percent of single-family homes in the United States are owned by institutional investors with over 1,000 homes in their portfolio. This share rises to 3.8 percent of single-family homes for institutional investors owning over 100 homes, and up to 10 percent in certain metro areas such as Atlanta. Housing researcher Paul Fiorilla, quoted in the Washington Post, stated that it is unlikely that large institutional investors have a significant impact on prices, except for select areas where their concentrations are unusually high: “‘Any segment that owns such a small percentage of the market cannot have that much of an impact on prices,’ with the possible exception of a handful of communities with a significant concentration of big investors.” Some housing advocates have argued that public attention to large institutional investors distracts from structural causes of the housing affordability crisis, such as the housing shortage and its roots in exclusionary zoning and other laws that empower NIMBY obstruction of housing. Indeed. Now to the main event. By John P. Ruehl, an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022. Produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute The 2025 U.S. housing market presents a paradox. Home sales are down, and there are far more sellersthan buyers, yet prices continue to hit record highs. Over the past decade, home values have surged nationwide, including in once-affordable Sunbelt cities. Policymakers appear ill-equipped to respond to the situation. In a July 2025 interview with the New York Times, 16 U.S. mayors listed housing as one of their top concerns. During her 2024 presidential campaign, former Vice President Kamala Harris proposed tax credits for first-time buyers to alleviate the crisis, while President Donald Trump has renewed calls for interest rate cuts to help lower mortgage rates. Homeownership remains central to the American dream, and U.S. homeownership rates have typically hovered around 65 percent “from 1965 until 2025,” according to Trading Economics. But the high-water mark came in 2004 when it reached 69 percent, and despite a temporary COVID-19-era spike, the rate has continued to inch downward. Worryingly, even among those who own homes, equity is shrinking. Many homeowners own less than half of their property’s value today, with the balance tied up in debt. Many of the pressures are structural. Construction costs have soared, labor is in short supply, and tariffs have raised the price of materials. Zoning laws, tax regimes, and anti-density regulations have stifled urban growth, while sprawling development is hitting geographic and environmental limits. Mortgage rates remain high, and the national housing shortfall, now estimated to be more than 4.5 million, continues to worsen. But the crisis has opened the door for new kinds of investors. A growing cast of corporate actors is moving into residential real estate, lured by the prospect of stable returns in a tightening market. Though they still own a minority of U.S. housing, these firms are often concentrated in key regions and markets. Increasingly capable of setting the terms of access to housing, their rising influence threatens to reverse the post-World War II surge in widespread homeownership. Buildup Large-scale corporate ownership of homes and influence over rent prices is a relatively recent development. Before 2008, most institutional investors stuck to apartment buildings and urban areas, as single-family homes were seen as too dispersed and costly to manage. That changed after the housing crash, when a wave of foreclosures flooded the market, leading to the availability of deeply discounted homes in the suburbs. “In the decade since the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, major institutional financial actors have invested heavily in U.S. single-family housing, acquiring anywhere up to three hundred thousand houses, and then letting them out,” stated a 2021 article in Sage Journals. In 2012, government-backed mortgage giant Fannie Mae began selling thousands of foreclosed homes in bulk to investors, showing single-family housing could be bought, held, and profited from at scale. At the same time, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac expanded support for institutional buyers through favorable financing terms and lower rates. Homebuilding, meanwhile, had collapsed, and a supply shortage began to take hold. “The crash badly hurt a variety of sectors, but it simply devastated the home construction industry, given that the crisis was directly centered there. … with a glut of foreclosures on the market and prices falling fast, America simply stopped building homes. New private home starts plummeted by almost 80 percent to the lowest level since 1959,” according to a 2024 article in the American Prospect. Investor interest surged as home prices recovered in the early 2010s. This era brought record-low interest rates and trillions in financial stimulus from the Federal Reserve and government, which helped stabilize the economy and flooded capital markets. With cheap borrowing and rising prices, housing became an attractive asset. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend. Remote work drove people from cities to suburbs, while eviction moratoriums pushed many small landlords to sell, opening the door for larger buyers. Digital platforms made it easier to browse, purchase, and manage properties remotely. Alongside traditional banks, a wide range of financial firms and platforms have been profiting from rising demand and tightening supply. Wall Street Landlords Blackstone, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, became a pioneer in large-scale housing acquisitions after 2008. In 2012, it helped launch Invitation Homes, now the largest owner of single-family rentals in the U.S. Though Blackstone sold its stake in 2019, it reentered the market by acquiring Canadian real estate firm Tricon Residential in 2024, and sold 3,000 homes that year to UK’s largest pension fund for approximately $550 million, showcasing its global influence in housing. Other major firms have followed suit. Progress Residential, backed by Pretium Partners, has come under fire for evictions, maintenance failures, and excessive fees. Amherst Holdings was profiled in Fortune in 2019 for using early predictive algorithms to identify and acquire homes, and advances in AI have only made this process more efficient. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS), originally designed in the 1960s to give everyday investors access to real estate profits, are now largely dominated by major institutional firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, and private equity funds. Invitation Homes agreed to pay $48 million to the Federal Trade Commission in 2024 for junk fees, unfairly holding security deposits, failing to inspect homes, and using improper eviction tactics. Professor Desiree Fields, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in 2021, meanwhile, singled out Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent as “particularly vocal about the use of extraneous fees to increase total revenue,” stated a 2022 article in the Charlotte Observer. Corporate homebuying continues to climb. Institutional investors bought 15 percent of U.S. homes for sale in the first quarter of 2021, which climbed to nearly 27 percent by early 2025. In some markets, the footprint is even larger: during the third quarter of 2024, investors accounted for 44 percent of all home flips. Some firms, like Rise48 Equity, focus on acquiring and renovating large multifamily buildings to raise rental income and property value. Others, like Amherst Holdings, are beginning to enter the rent-flipping space as part of a larger expansion policy. Unlike smaller flippers who tend to cash out quickly, these companies renovate and hold properties long term. A growing number of companies are focusing on build-to-rent subdivisions, with entire neighborhoods constructed specifically for rentals. No single company dominates nationally, but corporate influence is unmistakable in certain cities. In Atlanta, private equity owns more than 30 percent of single-family rental properties, with corporate ownership disproportionately affecting Black neighborhoods, intensifying housing insecurity and displacement. Large firms enjoy several structural advantages. They access cheaper institutional financing, often pay in cash, and benefit from early access to listings and local policy influence. Firms can use creative financing tools, like combining many homes into a single investment package and using the expected rent payments as collateral to borrow more money. Bulk purchases allow them to cut costs on repairs, insurance, and maintenance, while builders are more inclined to sell homes in large blocks at a discount rather than wait for individual buyers, helping firms to avoid bidding wars. Unlike individual homeowners who often sell for financial reasons, institutional landlords can hold assets for years and sell only when market conditions are favorable. Tax policies further tilt the scales. While individual sellers pay capital gains taxes on home sales, corporate buyers can use the 1031 exchange to defer taxes by reinvesting profits into like-kind properties, pushing tax burdens into the future. Rental property owners also get tax depreciation benefits, which allow them to deduct part of the building’s value each year, reducing their taxes, which compound over time. Tech Big Tech, with similar vast financial resources, has also become essential to the expansion of corporate housing. It enables investors to scale up, manage properties remotely, and influence markets and consumers to their advantage. One of the most influential tools is YieldStar, a rent pricing software developed by RealPage, purchased by private equity firm Thoma Bravo in 2021. RealPage gathers extensive rental data from participating landlords and uses algorithms to recommend optimal prices. Landlords who don’t use the technology are often left at a disadvantage. Many property managers adopt these recommendationsautomatically, often under performance monitoring that discourages underpricing or offering tenant concessions. In cities like Seattle, where a handful of property managers control large shares of the market, RealPage’s pricing influence can be especially powerful. A ProPublica investigation found that in one neighborhood, 70 percent of apartments were handled by 10 firms, all using RealPage software. Recommendations by the software included accepting lower occupancy rates if it leads to higher overall rent revenue. Critics argue that RealPage enables coordinated “rent-setting,” effectively encouraging landlords to behave like a cartel. The U.S. Justice Department opened a lawsuit against the company in 2024 for causing harm to American renters by using its “algorithmic pricing software.” The investigation remains ongoing. At the same time, short-term rental platforms like Airbnb have also reshaped housing. With vast reach and deep legal resources, Airbnb has helped normalize rental conversions and contributed to higher rents in many cities. In 2025, the New York Post reported that the company funded $1 million to alleged grassroots groups, such as Communities for Homeowner Choice, to oppose a New York City law requiring hosts to be present during guest stays. It has also backed tax battles and filed lawsuits across the U.S., challenging occupancy taxes and other local regulations, costing cities millions in legal fees. In both long- and short-term markets, tech platforms have made large-scale rental operations possible. Through pricing tools, political lobbying, and data leverage, housing is emerging as a more managed commodity. As corporate consolidation deepens and larger landlords become more integrated with tech platforms, these companies, and increasingly the property owners themselves, will exert even greater control over rent markets with less transparency or oversight. Addressing the Issue Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, including the U.S., now have some of the lowest home ownership rates in the world, and the rise of institutional landlords will drive those numbers lower. The core problem remains supply, with Wall Street firms targeting homes precisely because there’s a shortage—something they openly acknowledge and tout to investors as a profit opportunity. The city of Austin is a rare success story. After peaking at $550,000 in May 2022, median home prices fell to $409,000 by January 2025, and indicators point to a continual downward trend. The key difference has been that Austin has built more affordable housing, providing incentives to ease zoning laws. Homeownership remains most common in rural areas, while urban centers have been hardest hit by rising investor activity and housing scarcity. Public involvement is critical to reducing the problem. Landlord interests, represented by groups like the National Multifamily Housing Council, carry enormous influence, while tenants rely on thinner support networks like the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Federal agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Agency play a role, but lag behind corporate influence. In comparison, Blackstone has faced greater resistance in European countries with stronger tenant protections and better-organized renters’ movements. Policies like taxing the unimproved value of land could encourage development and discourage speculation on vacant or underused properties. Without effective measures, the concentration of land in private hands will only grow, whether through corporate landlords, billionaires like Bill Gates (who owns 250,000 acres spread out over 17 states), or creeping attempts to privatize public land. At stake is not just affordability but also whether the public retains any real claim to land and housing or surrenders it entirely to private capital. Is the “housing theory of everything” legit, or some neolib scam? I haven’t looked into it much. I do remember somebody’s-law saying that increasing wages in any region just resulted in the money going to landlords. I’ve made some effort to re-find the article explaining it, without success. Mathematically, simplified you have a Markov chain where a house can be in one of two states- 1) owned by noninvestor (e.g. family) 2) owned by investor. the family may sell the house to anyone every few years. the institutional investor does not generally sell and when they do they exchange to another investor in a SFH portfolio. State 2 is an absorbing state-eventually investors will own most properties. Consider this Markov matrix which represents families retaining house/selling to other family 85% and selling home to investor 15% (e.g annually). the investor only sells to a family 2% of the time and keeps/exchanges house to investor 98% of the time. in time, most houses will belong to state 2. 0.85 0.02 0.15 0.98 Theoretically an equilibrium can be maintained if the level of transition is lower than that of the growing number of families buying new construction, but new construction of affordable properties is not high. So it doesn’t happen. That intro by Yves is so cathartic to read but unearths the embittered feelings from my failed ventures. Watching a neighborhood largely get torn down and replaced with mcmansions but not a peep from the city. Meanwhile trying to build a few townhouses kicks off a local war. I’ll admit to feelings of weariness and hatred for the new home buyers. Cities, or their elected officials, are not immune to the benefits of big new houses. They expect more donations and higher tax bases, so the corruption supply and demand stay roughly in balance. Alternatively, there is the new California approach, Pacific Palisades edition. Fire burns down a desirable neighborhood? Use red tape to delay permits and construction. Then use new State funds to buy up targeted lots to build the right kind of new housing. Due process becomes do process to some, doo-doo process to others. Will potential voter increase effect outweigh the impact of the decline in donations. California Assembly is pausing the Palisades land grab bill after citizen input. Everyone, keep contacting your politicians at all levels to let them know what you think about issues and legislation. That provides more hope and voices that can’t be so easily ignored. When home building does happen now, its increasingly swaths of straight to rent subdivisions as the article mentions. Rather than trivial “homestead exemptions”, we need local “non-occupancy taxes”. If the home is not lived in by the owner- a hefty tax ensues. We already have that in most jurisdictions, or as in the case of California, Prop 13 which has somewhat the same effect. (And doing a 1031 exchange won’t prevent a Prop 13 valuation reset AFAIK). Here in Honolulu we have an increased property tax rate on non-owner occupied real property over $1 million, which means pretty much all 4 BR single family detached. I’ve seen articles claiming Gen Z prefers to rent, but it isn’t clear if that’s due to affordability. From a new build perspective, the costs associated with getting government authority to develop seem designed to push for the highest possible price for finished product. We’re mom-and-pop landlords of single family housing. They’re debt-free and if there were mortgages there wouldn’t be much if any cash flow. And for depreciation expense, you’re limited in the amount of net loss you can take for income tax; any excess has to be carried forward until you dispose of the property. Interesting. Thanks! The Zillow price chart to 2017 shows a price increase from 225k to 375k over 8 years. That’s an effective compound average of about 7% a year, is that not higher than CPI? Further, we cannot assume that the median home sold today is the same as that sold 8 years ago. What I’m seeing locally is a lot of homes on the market with issues of mould, termites, structural damage, rodents, etc that sellers don’t want to pay for. I suggest you use the official CPI calculator from the BLS which allows you to select a start and end month. It confirms my statement. You take the start level and month and ask what the future value (as of June 2025 would be. It is higher than the average house price shown by ~5%. https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm Yves, can you share your inputs? I’ve run that same calculator for June 2017 to June 2025 and I clearly get a lower much rate than you’re getting… Oof, I need new glasses. I ran it TWICE last night and misread the end #. Will correct the post. I discounted the look of the chart due to scaling and figured the much discussed Covid surge had been offsite by price stagnation/falls in places people were exiting. A table in this post gives a much clearer picture of what happened. The “surge” is very much due to the Covid WFH buying spike, as in a two year buying frenzy that has stuck (as in most of those who bought at those prices are anchored and won’t sell for less if they do sell): https://bilello.blog/2025/the-ultimate-guide-to-home-price-appreciation Will add it into the main post. The other thing that happened during the covid period is that the price per sqft to build went from approx $200/sqft to $400/sqft. I’ve built and rebuilt (actual banging nails) several houses over the years. Pre covid a Doug Fir 2×4 was about $2. they went as high as $8. Asphalt roofing almost tripled per square (10×10) to install. Price per sqft is still in the upper $300’s… My pet peeve is realtors price older houses (in FL ) the same per sqft as new or late model (Miami/Dade specs).. AND PEOPLE PAY IT !!!! In that cast they’re buying a Yugo for the same price as a Mercedes….. Drives me nuts !!! Well, I count ~3.5% CAGR in inflation from June 30 2017 to June 30 2025, and I also get a little over 6.5% for 225K to 375K… Also, if you look at the Zillow chart closely, it clearly shows a much higher price growth level from mid-2020 to mid-2022, which is the surge people are talking about. It was a 50% surge as far as I can tell eyeballing the graph. And noting that this aggregate hides a distribution, there are surely markets where home prices increased 75-100%. Sure, if you take that surge over a long period and compare to CPI, may or maybe not better. It’s also very likely that references to a surge in “home prices” are imprecise references to home purchase affordability, where a high price has been compounded by higher mortgage rates and higher home insurance premiums even after the technical price surge stopped in mid-2022. If you start with a $225,000 home financed at 80% LTV at 5% in 2017 with $1500 home insurance and 1% property tax, the monthly PITI would be about $1278. If you increase the home value to $375,000, set the interest rate at 7%, and grow the home insurance to $2500, that’s monthly PITI of $2516–just almost double in 8 years. What is not considered here is the attitude of Generation Z members (born after 2000) who now at the age of 25 should be at the age of considering the purchase of first time homes. Unlike generations before them, home ownership is no longer as important as it was. It appears that this generation is keener on spending money on life experience more than previous generations. Hence the rise in tourism, travel and doing cool stuff amongst them. Could it not be that some big business has seen this gap and is catering for it? Complete speculation on my part, but I would argue it’s a chicken/egg issue – Housing is way more expensive, jobs are way shitter, much more precarious (what good is a 30 year mortgage if I’m not even sure I’ll live that long, let alone have a job that long, plus any necessary savings to weather several likely job changes and still cover mortgage), and pay way less. Yet I’m supposed to save up for a 20% down payment to incur a long term liability for an asset that I may not be able to hold on to? Eff that. I may as well spend what little money I have on something I will enjoy and will make existence slightly less shitty. It’s not that Gen Z or Millennials don’t want their own place – the drive to own a house in the US is strong and deep – no cultural history of multi generational family living together, unlike say Italy. Given the opportunity, who wouldn’t want their own place to make your own / live in / get laid in without having to deal with parents? It’s just that prices are obscene, and it’s not realistic, given the difficulty of obtaining stable, high paid work, to even consider purchasing. So you either rent and try to live your life, or live with Mom and Dad if that’s an option, and take it day to day. Ownership, one of the few ways to guard against getting screwed over, is still just as important…just not attainable. Maybe I’m reading it wrong. Apologies if so. I think this is a fairly accurate assessment. You can see this reflected in young people’s voting patterns being towards candidates that promise to improve affordability of homes. Trump was vocal about this with interest rate policy, and in the recent Canadian election many young people believed Pierre Poillevre would make homes more affordable. The drive to own a home is still there, but most younger people have jobs that aren’t paying enough to achieve that. There’s a huge divide in young people’s affordability depending on career paths out of highschool. Those who went into trades, specialized medical fields, or engineering fields are doing well. Those who went into other fields are struggling to find well paying jobs. I do think there’s an aspect of financial illiteracy as well, but I’ve seen the above in kids from wealthier parents who you would think would pass it on. I agree with you, but wanted to add a little bit of shading regarding one point. “Financial Literacy” in this context has multiple layers, none of which bode well for the younger set. 1. Financial literacy generally is not taught in schools, and especially not primary school. Math certainly is (quality notwithstanding), but its application to the real world is incredibly limited. That this is beneficial to multiple companies and entities that subsist on predatory behavior and ill-advised financial decisions may or may not have direct bearing but they certainly benefit. 2. Even if kids get some literacy, it takes time and experience to develop any kind of savvy, if they ever do. Couple this with the fact that financial products GENERALLY are far more complex than they were 70 years ago, and contain much more in the way of weasel behavior and awful traps (as neoliberal norms have allowed them to flourish – decent social behavior from a corporation is largely a financial liability), you basically have to get screwed a couple times to realize where the pitfalls are. Only as you age do you recognize these old wolves in new sheep skins. 3. Even being well-to-do is no guarantee. Providing a good financial education, as a parent, to a child, is incredibly difficult. It took me years to educate myself financially, and I’m still only halfway there, not to mention any terrible habits and stupid behavior that I’m still struggling with. I wouldn’t know where to start with a young child. Better than nothing, sure, but not ace, either. 4. Becoming financially literate, or at least practicing at financial literacy, requires…you know…finances. Excess finances. Buying in bulk, for example, or even being able to say no and walk away from something obviously bad necessitates having some amount of leverage. In many cases that leverage is money, or some equivalent. Many studies have shown that poor people, when given direct cash payments, are remarkably rational and spend money in the ways that are most beneficial in the longer term. When you have no excess cash, though, the most rational decision is usually the one that keeps your kids fed, or the lights on, or a roof over your head. After all that, if I only have $20 left, I may as well buy some smokes because it won’t do shit for future planning. Having no excess cash is basically like running your life using lean principles and JIT inventory. The mildest setback is usually a complete disaster. Congress can disallow corporate landlord income tax write-offs for interest and depreciation on SFH and multi-units less than 13.. Problem solved. Could you explain how that would work for REITs? I agree that this post which Yves vivisected falls far short of making its argument after she discredited some of its claims: “According to John Burns Research & Consulting, only 0.4 percent of single-family homes in the United States are owned by institutional investors with over 1,000 homes in their portfolio. This share rises to 3.8 percent of single-family homes for institutional investors owning over 100 homes…” That alone crumbles the key stone holding up the post’s headline and themes. However, I believe corporations and private equity do create a significant effect on the cost of housing through their investments in apartments and their activities colluding to drive up rents. My only warrant in making this claim is my own feelings of powerlessness as a renter. Moving is an ordeal. Landlords often have tenants at their mercy as they raise rents as I have experienced renting an apartment from a corporation and as a private equity firm bought a little duplex where I lived some years later. I have always wanted to own my own home but my work and life situation made home ownership too costly. I have often had to move across the country to follow jobs. The squeeze on rents, availability of rentals in many urban areas, and orders to move following the sale of the apartments where I lived only added to my desire to own my own home. In comparing rents to monthly mortgage payments, the increasing cost of rents, persistent rent increases, and threat of being moved out to accommodate gentrification added to my demand to own my own home and my willingness to increase how much I might pay for that home. I believe corporate land speculation added with the land speculation by the 10% who have captured the share of earnings growth that might have accrued to the lower 90% helped drive up land prices. The upper 10% have more directly added to the price of homes through their purchases of second homes in otherwise relatively affordable areas. In the small city where I have been looking for a home, I drive by many homes on large, often elegant properties that appear unoccupied most of the year. I believe corporate employment practices helped grow the income spread between the upper 10% and the lower 90%. The COVID work-from-home policies added to this pressure and housing outside urban centers. I doubt the apartments previously occupied by the 10% came down in rent enough to help many in the lower 90%. The cost of land leads to the tendency for developers to build relatively expensive McMansions on postage stamp lots. Builders must build more expensive homes, which usually means bigger, grander homes, on smaller lots to get the most return. Apartments with affordable rents, even when allowed, do not yield sufficient returns, especially as the cost of getting loans to finance the purchase of more expensive land, labor, and materials to build housing. “The US has not seen anything approaching the 2021 nominal increase of 19% and real increase of 12% in decades.” I tend to view this as indication that housing prices have reached a point where home buyers are nearing the maximum amount of their income that they can afford to spend on housing. The changes in interest rates and the current tendency for loan agents to look askance at less than 20% down and buyers who would be paying more than a third of their income to pay for housing. I believe this post is too anxious to find a single cause for the high cost of housing in America. Nixon stopped the feds from building affordable housing, and Reagan cut HUD’s affordable housing budget by 75%. Homelessness surged to levels not seen since before the New Deal. Surprise!

Title: ‘Be single-minded’: Cork hurling heroes of 1966 on what it takes to end an All-Ireland drought

It may have been a Tipperary man who first popularised the use of “famine” to describe a dearth of hurling success, but few Cork people listening to Borris-Ileigh’s Richard Stakelum as he lifted the Munster Senior Hurling Cup in 1987 would ever thought it would one day apply to them. At that stage, Cork led the All-Ireland roll of honour with 26 titles, three ahead of Kilkenny and four ahead of Tipperary. The idea that the Rebels would experience a 16-year barren stretch was unfathomable to most on Leeside. The Rebels have remained consistent in Munster, but they have endured a long wait for an All-Ireland that stretches back to 2005. From the 1890s up to that point in 1987, Cork had won at least one All-Ireland every decade. With the peerless Christy Ring to the fore, they won five titles in the 1940s followed by three in the 1950s. The dry period between Cork’s All-Ireland wins in 1903 to 1919 stands out as a particular disappointment. However, that was ancient history by 1987. For Cork fans born in the 1920s, the halcyon days of the 1940s and the first half of the 1950s surely looked like they would never end. Until they did. “Those were the days,” as Mary Hopkin sang over a decade later. Cork’s failure to reach All-Ireland finals for a decade following the 1956 loss to Wexford meant fans were desperate for success when a young team finally made it back to Croke Park in 1966. That 1966 team offers the closest example in living memory of what the current Cork team are facing into this Sunday when they take on the Premier County in the All-Ireland final. The current crop of Rebel hurlers will be seeking to prove that famines – even 20-year famines, in their case – do eventually end. But unlike this year’s team, who go into Sunday’s final as most people’s favourites, the Cork team that entered Croke Park for the 1966 decider were rank outsiders and featured several under-21 players. Among them were the three McCarthys, who were all unrelated. Gerald and Charlie hurled with St Finbarr’s, while Justin hurled with Passage. This week, all three looked back on a day that earned them and their teammates a particular place in Cork hurling lore. Coming up against a seasoned Kilkenny outfit who had beaten Waterford just three years earlier to win the All-Ireland, that young Cork side ran out 3-09 to 1-10 winners. Colm Sheehan from Éire Óg netted two goals and John O’Halloran from Blackrock bagged a third . The three McCarthys also played their part. Justin, who was 21, lined out at midfield, contributing two-second half points. Gerald, also 21, captained the team from left half-forward and Charlie (20) lined out at right corner-forward. Each chipped in with a point. Justin recalls that while Cork had gone over a decade without an All-Ireland, it was no great burden to the team. “I think we were conscious that it had been 12 years,” he said. “We had all grown up seeing Cork winning in 1952, ‘53 and ‘54, and of course the loss to Wexford in ‘56. I suppose that gave us all an urgency to want to play for Cork and a lot of lads on the panel had experienced the lean years. [ Three Munster finals that created the mythos of Tipperary v CorkOpens in new window ] “We knew it was important to Cork, but a lot of us were very young. There was a blend of youth with Gerald and Charlie and Seanie Barry and myself, and there were older fellows on the team like Peter Doolan and Paddy Fitzgerald and Tom O’Donoghue and Denis Murphy. “None of us had ever played in an All-Ireland final before, but we were quite confident – we had beaten Clare after a replay and then Limerick and Waterford in the Munster championship, and we were well geared up and we were quite confident going in that we could beat them. “Gerald and myself were rooming together and I remember that morning, as we were going to Mass, he said to me, ‘we have a good chance’. I said, ’we have, and we’ll have that cup in this room this evening’. We had no fear.” Similarly, Gerald McCarthy acknowledged that they were all conscious of Cork’s 12-year barren run. He said: “There’s always an expectation in Cork – the fans nearly demand success. But in fairness, it wasn’t being overdone by people. We didn’t have fellows coming up to us on the street and saying ‘it’s 12 years’ or that sort of thing. We were a young team and people recognised that. [ Cork crowds, Tipp trips, Munster mastery: Seven-step guide to the 2025 hurling championshipOpens in new window ] “Okay, there was a bit of pressure, but I think when you are young, you can deal with it better. We had played Kilkenny in the league semi-final in Croke Park earlier that year, but we didn’t have a semi-final after winning Munster, so it was our first championship match in Croke Park. “So, we didn’t have any real experience of Croke Park, certainly not a crowd that size. We were a good mix of young and experience, but I think the younger players just took it on. When you are young, you don’t take in the whole impact of it and can deal with it better than an old stager. “I remember as we were going in from Lucan to Croke Park on the bus, The Beatles had a hit with Yellow Submarine and somebody started singing ‘We All Live in a Red Submarine’. It just clicked and everyone fell in with it and it just broke the tension, so we handled that well.” Charlie MacCarthy says it helped Cork that Kilkenny were such favourites to win. “We went into the game without any one really giving us a chance,” he said. “It’s a bit like Sunday with Tipp, nobody is giving them a chance. I was only a young fellow, just turned 20 and the attitude was, ‘we have nothing to lose, we’ll go up there and give it our best shot’. “And in fairness, everybody got stuck in and stuck in early. We really didn’t give Kilkenny a chance to settle down – our backs were very good, very tight and we got our goals at the right time and it settled us. We kept plugging away and things turned out right for us in the end.” Gerald acknowledges that Cork are going into Sunday’s game as favourites but says players can react in different ways to being favourites and the pressure it may bring. “The pressure can affect your head, but everyone is different and you have to learn to deal with it somehow.” Charlie thinks it will be a tight game, but feels that Cork might shade it, especially as they are driven by the pain of losing last year’s All-Ireland final to Clare. “I think it will be close enough,” he said. ”The Tipp lads are after improving since the League final and the round-robin game and they battled back well against Kilkenny in the semi-final, so it will be close. But I have a slight fancy for Cork and think they will shade it.” As for Justin, his advice to the current wearers of the jersey is forget about history and simply go out and hurl. He agrees that the desire to make amends for last year’s narrow loss to Clare could help drive them on “Yes, they have a chance now to redeem themselves for last year. That’s a good motivation but forget about 20 years – you can think about that afterwards when you win. It’s all on the day and you just have to be single-minded and go out with the belief you are good enough to win it.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Global agribusiness giants are seizing Ukraine’s fertile farmland

Key points: Ukraineâs "chernozem" soilâamong the most fertile in the worldâis being rapidly acquired by foreign corporations as Ukrainian farmers struggle amid war and displacement. IMF pressure forced Ukraine to lift a land-sale moratorium in 2020, opening the door for agribusiness giants to buy up vast tracts of farmland. Major investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, alongside agribusiness corporations, now control nearly 28% of Ukraineâs arable land. Ukrainian labor and regulatory loopholes allow these corporations to exploit cheap labor, banned fertilizers, and GMO cropsâpractices illegal in the EU. If Ukraine joins the EU, these corporations could flood Europe with cheap, deregulated crops, decimating local farmers while pocketing taxpayer-funded subsidies. The great land grab: How corporations are colonizing Ukraine Ukraineâs black earth, known as chernozem, is a national treasure, possessing nearly a quarter of the worldâs richest soil. Historically, Soviet collectivization stripped farmers of private land ownership, but after Ukraineâs independence in 1991, oligarchs and foreign investors began seizing control. Fast-forward to 2024, and the situation has worsened dramaticallyâthanks to IMF-imposed land reforms pushed through during COVID lockdowns, preventing mass protests. The Oakland Instituteâs explosive 2023 report reveals a stark reality: foreign agribusinesses now dominate Ukrainian farmland, operating through shell companies in tax havens like Cyprus and Luxembourg. Entities like NCH Capitalâbacked by U.S. pension funds and university endowmentsâare buying up land at unprecedented rates. Worse still, Ukrainian oligarchs have sold off shares to Western banks, turning food security into just another Wall Street commodity. "They donât care about feeding peopleâthey care about controlling the food supply," warns AndrÃ¡s Tibor Cseh, a Hungarian agricultural expert. "Ukraine is becoming a sacrifice zone for global agribusiness." Deregulation warfare: How GMOs and banned chemicals flood Ukraine While EU farmers must comply with strict environmental laws, Ukraine has become a deregulated playground for agribusiness. Half the fertilizers used in Ukraine are already banned in Europe, yet corporations like Monsantoâblocked from operating in the EU due to GMO bansâsee Ukraine as an open frontier for genetic experimentation. With labor costs four times lower than Hungary and no animal welfare laws, Ukraine is a corporate dreamland. "There are no rules," says Cseh. "They grow whatever they want, poison the soil, and then sell the contaminated grain abroad." This toxic harvest isnât just a Ukrainian problemâthese cheap, deregulated crops will soon flood European markets, undercutting local farmers while filling corporate coffers. The EU membership trap: A corporate takeover in disguise The ultimate goal? Fast-tracking Ukraine into the EU, giving agribusiness giants duty-free access to 450 million consumers. Once inside the EU, these corporations will grab even more land while pocketing billions in farm subsidiesâpaid for by European taxpayers. Meanwhile, Ukrainian farmersâmany of whom opposed the land reformsâare being pushed aside. As land transactions surge post-invasion, foreign entities exploit legal loopholes, even bypassing Ukrainian citizenship rules through presidential decrees. "Theyâre not just buying landâtheyâre buying influence," warns the Oakland Institute. With thousands of lobbyists in Brussels, these corporations are ensuring Ukraineâs EU accession benefits them, not local farmers.

If Ukraine joins the EU, these corporations could flood Europe with cheap, deregulated crops, decimating local farmers while pocketing taxpayer-funded subsidies.

The great land grab: How corporations are colonizing Ukraine Ukraineâs black earth, known as chernozem, is a national treasure, possessing nearly a quarter of the worldâs richest soil. Historically, Soviet collectivization stripped farmers of private land ownership, but after Ukraineâs independence in 1991, oligarchs and foreign investors began seizing control. Fast-forward to 2024, and the situation has worsened dramaticallyâthanks to IMF-imposed land reforms pushed through during COVID lockdowns, preventing mass protests. The Oakland Instituteâs explosive 2023 report reveals a stark reality: foreign agribusinesses now dominate Ukrainian farmland, operating through shell companies in tax havens like Cyprus and Luxembourg. Entities like NCH Capitalâbacked by U.S. pension funds and university endowmentsâare buying up land at unprecedented rates. Worse still, Ukrainian oligarchs have sold off shares to Western banks, turning food security into just another Wall Street commodity. "They donât care about feeding peopleâthey care about controlling the food supply," warns AndrÃ¡s Tibor Cseh, a Hungarian agricultural expert. "Ukraine is becoming a sacrifice zone for global agribusiness." Deregulation warfare: How GMOs and banned chemicals flood Ukraine While EU farmers must comply with strict environmental laws, Ukraine has become a deregulated playground for agribusiness. Half the fertilizers used in Ukraine are already banned in Europe, yet corporations like Monsantoâblocked from operating in the EU due to GMO bansâsee Ukraine as an open frontier for genetic experimentation. With labor costs four times lower than Hungary and no animal welfare laws, Ukraine is a corporate dreamland. "There are no rules," says Cseh. "They grow whatever they want, poison the soil, and then sell the contaminated grain abroad." This toxic harvest isnât just a Ukrainian problemâthese cheap, deregulated crops will soon flood European markets, undercutting local farmers while filling corporate coffers. The EU membership trap: A corporate takeover in disguise The ultimate goal? Fast-tracking Ukraine into the EU, giving agribusiness giants duty-free access to 450 million consumers. Once inside the EU, these corporations will grab even more land while pocketing billions in farm subsidiesâpaid for by European taxpayers. Meanwhile, Ukrainian farmersâmany of whom opposed the land reformsâare being pushed aside. As land transactions surge post-invasion, foreign entities exploit legal loopholes, even bypassing Ukrainian citizenship rules through presidential decrees. "Theyâre not just buying landâtheyâre buying influence," warns the Oakland Institute. With thousands of lobbyists in Brussels, these corporations are ensuring Ukraineâs EU accession benefits them, not local farmers. If BlackRock, Monsanto, and Saudi investors can bleed Ukraine dry during wartime, theyâll do the same anywhere else. This isnât just about Ukraineâitâs about who controls the global food supply. Once these corporations monopolize farmland, they dictate prices, production, and even policy.

Title: More pain for would-be buyers as price of a typical home rises by €35,000 in a year

Report reveals the areas with highest and lowest price increases It's more bad news for those looking to get on the housing ladder. Stock image: Getty The cost of a typical property has shot up by €35,000 in the past year, putting a renewed squeeze on home buyers. Prices jumped again in May, the 21st month in a row of rising home values. In the last five years, buyers have had to pay an additional €74,000 to secure a home. The national property price index increased by 7.9pc in the 12 months to May. This is up from 7.6pc in the year to April, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO). Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.9pc, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.7pc, compared with May last year. The median, or typical, price of a dwelling bought in May was €370,000, up €5,000 on the median price in April. A typical property is now €74,000 more expensive than in May 2020, when the median price was €296,000, according to a deep dive into CSO data. The highest median price for a dwelling in May this year was €670,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €186,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to May was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €770,000. Castlerea, Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €150,000. In May this year, 3,824 home ­purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.6bn. These were made up of 2,913 existing dwellings and 911 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,388 first-time-buyer purchases in May. The area outside of Dublin with the largest growth in house prices was the border region, which consists of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo, at 11.1pc. Prices rose an average of 10pc in the mid-west, which consists of Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary. At the other end of the scale, the south-east – comprising Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford – had a 7.7pc rise in house prices. The Dublin property market seems notably stronger than elsewhere of late Independent economist Austin Hughes said the latest price surge suggested the need for somewhere to live remained a more important factor than nervousness about tariffs and trade wars. He said it was notable that the monthly increase in Dublin prices of 0.7pc exceeded that of the rest of the country. It was the first time since September that price rises in the capital were ahead of those outside of it. Property sales in the capital were 14pc higher in the first five months of this year compared to the same period last year, but sales in the rest of the country are slightly lower. “So, the Dublin property market seems notably stronger than elsewhere of late, possibly reflecting the impact of lower interest rates as well as relatively strong income growth,” he said. Mr Hughes said that, so far, there was little sign of any notable fallout from multinational tariff fears on the home sales market in the capital. This week, the Economic and ­Social Research Institute (ESRI) told an Oireachtas committee there would be no major uptick in housing supply this year or in 2026. It said the Government was to miss its targets in both years. ESRI economists said a tight construction labour force and low productivity levels meant the outlook for housing remained bleak.

Title: Trump and the Energy Industry Are Eager to Power AI With Fossil Fuels
URL: https://www.wired.com/story/trump-energy-industry-ai-fossil-fuels-pittsburgh-summit/
Time Published: 2025-07-16T16:16:45Z
Full Content:
AI is “not my thing,” President Donald Trump admitted during a speech in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. “You need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,” Trump said, recalling a conversation with “David”—most likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. “I said, what, are you kidding? That's double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.” At the high-profile summit on Tuesday—where, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat, and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods—companies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building “titan clusters” of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania’s fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country’s second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice—who dubs himself the “people’s champion of natural gas”—moderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech. All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world’s top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach “multi-decade highs” over the next few years. A jolt of new demand—like the demand represented by massive data centers—could revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are “why the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,” says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast—responding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration’s priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration’s anti-renewables positions, aren’t necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. This demand isn’t necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate—many tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened—but rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. “The waiting list for a new turbine is five years,” Williams-Derry says. “If you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‘I want more solar.’” Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an “energy crazy train,” scoffing at those administrations’ support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant’s carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We’re going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive “40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,” while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists’ projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It’s easy to find any variety of headlines or reports—often based on projections produced by private companies—projecting massive growth numbers for AI. “I view all of these projections with great skepticism,” says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. “I don't think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there’s “a bunch of self-interested actors,” Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels, and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications, and experts testifying in front of Congress began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (“Dig More Coal—The PCs Are Coming” was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet’s energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. “People just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,” he says. There’s some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. “It can both be true that there's growth in electricity use and there's a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what it's likely to happen,” Koomey says.

Title: KGNCloud Launches New $100 Trial Mining Program, Expanding Access to Compliant Cloud Mining

July 16, 2025 12:15 ET | Source: KGNCloud KGNCloud London, UK, July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KGNCloud, a Financial clean energy cloud mining platform, today announced the launch of its new $100 Trial Mining Program. This initiative is designed to significantly expand access to compliant and efficient cloud mining, allowing individuals to explore cryptocurrency earning with a low entry barrier. In response to the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, KGNCloud's new program addresses the high thresholds of traditional mining by offering a streamlined, zero-hardware investment solution. This move solidifies KGNCloud's position at the forefront of the industry, emphasizing both compliance and ecological innovation through its use of renewable energy. The cryptocurrency market will usher in structural changes in 2025. BlackRock Bitcoin spot ETF holdings exceeded 700,000 BTC, and institutional funds continued to inject market heat. At the same time, miners’ income dropped sharply after the Bitcoin halving, and individual mining costs skyrocketed: ASIC mining machines cost more than $5,000, and combined with global energy price fluctuations, household mining machine electricity bills accounted for 40%-60% of the income. The high threshold of traditional mining is shutting out ordinary investors. Against this background, the search volume of “passive income mining” surged by 300%. Cloud mining has become a new favorite with its zero hardware investment and low technical threshold, and KGNCloud has become the focus of the industry with its compliance and ecological innovation. 1. Core positioning: The clean energy cloud mining platform launched by KGNCLOUD provides mining contracts for mainstream currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. 2. Disruptive workflow: 3-minute quick start: Register → Select computing power package → Automatic daily payment Contract example: VIP Old Customer Festival-2: Invest $15,888, 3-day contract daily income $1,458 (total return rate 72.94%) Dogecoin Smart Innovation: Invest $2,800, 6-day contract daily income $110 (annualized return over 90%) 4. Why choose KGNCloud? Five differentiating competitive advantages 24-hour automatic settlement: income goes directly to the user’s wallet, supporting BTC/ETH/USDT multiple currencies Step-by-step reinvestment mechanism: income can be automatically converted into computing power to achieve compound growth (actually measured income is 20%-30% higher than peers) 100% renewable energy driven, single mining carbon emissions are only 1/6 of traditional mines, recommended by the 2025 “Blockchain Sustainable Development White Paper”. Users do not need to deal with hardware failures, software upgrades or heat dissipation issues, and the platform’s professional technical team monitors global mines 24 hours a day. Provide a “Dogecoin Experience Miner” contract with a minimum investment of $100, and a 1-day cycle allows novices to verify the income model without risk. With the explosion of Bitcoin Layer2 ecology (such as Maple Finance’s assets under management exceeding 1 billion US dollars), mining income has shifted from simple block rewards to the dual channels of “mining + staking”. KGNCloud has laid out a staking interface. In the future, users can directly deposit the ETH produced by mining into Lido and invest BTC into the Babylon test network on the platform, and the elasticity of income will be increased by 3 times. “The essence of cloud mining is the democratization of computing power – KGNCloud has torn apart the resource monopoly of the old era.” The future has come: KGNCloud announced that it will connect to the AI computing power scheduling system in Q3, and optimize the allocation of mining pools in real time through machine learning. It is expected that user income can be further increased by 15%-18%. Call for action: In an era when institutions are swallowing up Bitcoin, individual investors can still share the market dividends with the help of compliant cloud platforms.

Title: Businesses support auto-enrolment, department says

The introduction of automatic pension enrolment in January will “undoubtedly” involve additional costs for businesses, but these will dissipate over time, the Department of Social Protection has said. Only about 35 per cent of private sector workers are currently in pension schemes, which means they would be dependent on the State pension when they retire. In many cases that would result in steep drops in living standards in retirement. To address this, anyone aged 23-60 and earning in excess of €20,000 a year will be automatically enrolled in the new scheme – called My Future Fund – on day one of their employment. It is expected that about 750,000 workers will be enrolled in this way. Under the terms of the scheme, employers and employees will each initially contribute 1.5 per cent of gross pay, increasing to 3 per cent after three years, to 4.5 per cent after a further three years, and finally to 6 per cent in year 10 and from then on. Contributions will be made equally by employees and employers with the State providing a top-up of €1 for every €3 saved by an employee. So, in short, every €3 saved by an employee will automatically become €7. Tim Duggan, assistant secretary general with the Department of Social Protection, was before the Oireachtas joint committee on social protection, rural and community development to answer questions on the scheme on Wednesday. While the scheme was broadly welcomed by the committee, a number of members raised concerns about the additional cost for businesses at a time when there is already significant pressure on margins. [ Auto-enrolment needs to be more user-friendly for bosses and workers, recruitment firm saysOpens in new window ] Mr Duggan acknowledged there would be a cost, but said the scheme had been designed to ease any pain. “Undoubtedly, this is an additional cost if you’re employing people,” he said. “However, it has been deliberately designed that instead of introducing the contribution at 6 per cent from the very beginning, it is phased in over a decade to allow employers to adjust budget-wise. “In most cases, and the experience of other counties has shown, that when you introduce it on a gradual basis like that, it becomes part of the normal remuneration negotiation that goes on between employers and employees on a continual basis.” [ Will starting a pension now exclude daughter from availing of auto-enrolment?Opens in new window ] He said there had been extensive talks with the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (Ibec), the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise Association (Isme), and other business lobbies, and that “practically all of them” are “fully supportive” of the scheme. The scheme has been the subject of numerous delays as businesses have readied themselves for its introduction. Mr Duggan insisted it would “absolutely” be rolled out on January 1st without any further holdups. “We have made excellent progress in getting everything ready for the launch in January,” he said. Tata Consultancy Services, based in Letterkenny, Co Donegal, has been appointed as a managed service provider of the scheme’s administrative services and is currently configuring and testing its systems in line with the scheme’s requirements. Three investment managers – Irish Life Investment Managers, Amundi and Blackrock – have been selected for the scheme. Mr Duggan said the department is making “considerable progress” in staffing and resourcing the new authority, which will be called the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority or NAERSA. The recruitment of a chief executive and of board members are at a “final stage”, he said, while competitions are under way for the senior management positions. The scheme overall will create about 140 jobs in Letterkenny.

July 16, 2025 10:31 ET | Source: BAY Miner BAY Miner Miami, Florida, July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mobile-First Mining Platform Uses AI and Renewable Energy to Deliver Real-Time, Passive Crypto Income for Global Users In response to the crypto market’s latest bull run—fueled by Bitcoin crossing the $118,000 mark and Ethereum’s expanding institutional adoption—BAY Miner has officially introduced a next-generation mobile app that transforms smartphones into powerful cloud mining hubs.

Personal news: after four incredible years as President & COO of @Uniswap, I’m starting something new. This is a new chapter for crypto.

I’m… — Mary-Catherine Lader (@Mclader) July 15, 2025 While she remains as an advisor as the project prepares for a successor, attention has shifted to how Uniswap has fared since Lader joined in 2021. Lader leaves after four years of shaping Uniswap into a household name within the blockchain sector. Her departure means crucial transitions into the blockchain’s leadership and strategic direction. Lader joined the Uniswap team in 2021 after his role as BlackRock’s managing director. She was among the executives who left traditional finance to explore the cryptocurrency industry. The COO has monitored key operations, including Uniswap’s extension to several blockchains and the Uniswap mobile wallet launch. Also, Lader oversaw the termination of the Securities and Exchange Commission case. Most importantly, she was the president during the Uniswap v4 rollout. She helped transform Uniswap from a developer-centric project into a massive blockchain organization, overseeing internal developments across human resources, customer support, finance, and regulation. Thus, the Uniswap team will likely feel Larder’s absence as the COO. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has appreciated her leadership at Uniswap Labs, while some industry players urge Lader to join their projects. Congrats!! Appreciate your leadership at Uniswap over the years. — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) July 16, 2025 Meanwhile, the transition signals a strategic decision not influenced by the network’s instability. While leadership changes aren’t uncommon in traditional companies as teams evolve, such shifts are somewhat rare in crypto, especially among early team members and founders. That’s why Mary’s departure attracted attention. However, she is leaving with excitement, which bodes well for Uniswap’s future as a DeFi giant. The development confirms a maturing industry. Early builders and founders can now move on with new challenges or launch new projects, similar to traditional setups. The blockchain’s total value locked has soared from $1.64 billion in December 2020 to $5.54 billion today. Also, the native coin UNI has performed relatively well. It has gained 12% on its yearly chart, showcasing resilience despite macro challenges. The platform boasts over $75 billion in monthly DEX volume, according to DeFiLlama. UNI trades at $9.04 after gaining 17% and 14% in the past month and week. Technical indicators highlight bullish presence. The 1D Moving Average Convergence Divergence displays green histograms above the signal line. Also, the daily chart’s Relative Strength Index at 65 suggests further gains before overbought conditions. Moreover, the Chaikin Money Flow has climbed steadily since July 4. That confirms money entering the UNI ecosystem as investors anticipate substantial rallies. These signals match the prevailing broad market sentiments. Analysts forecast impending altcoin rallies as Bitcoin dominance cools after BTC’s latest rally to $123K.

US stock market futures today struggled to gain momentum as Dow Jones and S&P 500 stalled, while Nasdaq futures dipped after June’s CPI report showed inflation rising faster than expected. With Federal Reserve rate cut hopes fading, Wall Street is now looking to the Producer Price Index (PPI) for more clues. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs are also adding pressure on markets, as traders reassess inflation risks and policy direction. Meanwhile, rising Treasury yields and mixed corporate earnings from firms like Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson have added uncertainty. Get the full picture on where markets might head next.

Many more houses and apartments need to be built. Stock image: Getty The squeeze on home buyers has intensified after property prices shot up again in the year to May. It was the 21st month in a row of rising home values. The national property price index increased by 7.9pc in the 12 months to May, up from 7.6pc in the year to April, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) said. Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.9pc, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.7pc compared with May last year. The median price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to May 2025 was €370,000. This is up €5,000 on the median, or typical, price paid in April. The cost of a typical home is now up by €35,000 since May last year. The highest median price for a dwelling was €670,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €186,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to May was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €770,000. Castlerea, Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €150,000. In May 2025, 3,824 dwelling purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.6bn. These purchases were made up of 2,913 existing dwellings and 911 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,388 first-time buyer purchases in May. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border, which consists of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo, at 11.1pc. Prices an average of 10pc in the Mid-West, which consists of Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary. At the other end of the scale, the South-East, comprising Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford, saw a 7.7pc rise in house prices, the CSO said. This week the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) told an Oireachtas committee there will be no major uptick in housing supply this year or in 2026. It said Government targets set to be missed in both years. ESRI economists said a tight construction labour force and low productivity levels mean the outlook for housing remains bleak. ESRI research professor with the ESRI Conor O’Toole said these factors, coupled with the out-turn for 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, mean the group does “not foresee any major uptick in 2025 and 2026 in housing supply”. He said the ESRI is currently forecasting 33,000 units in 2025 and 37,000 units in 2026, which would be well below Government targets of 41,000 this year and 43,000 next year. Furthermore, Mr O’Toole added most of the risks “weigh on the downside”. The slow delivery of new homes comes at a time when demand for housing continues to surge. Close to one in five consumers in this country are looking to rent or buy, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland said, quoting European Central Bank statistics. Demand for housing in this country is now the second highest in Europe, after the Netherlands. The banking lobby group said 17pc consumers in Ireland, or almost one in five, report that they were looking to rent or buy. This is according to the February 2025 ECB Consumer Expectations Survey.

Title: Property prices pick up pace again in May - CSO

David Murphy Economics and Public Affairs Editor Irish residential property prices increased by 7.9% in the 12 months to May, marginally higher than the 7.6% rise in year up to April, according to latest figures from the Central Statistics Office. Prices rose faster outside the capital where they were up 8.7% while the cost of buying a home in Dublin was up 6.9%. The median price of buying a home in the 12 months to May was €370,000. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to May was A94 in Blackrock in Dublin with a median price of €770,000, while F45 in Castlerea in Roscommon had the least expensive price of €150,000. "In the 12 months to May 2025, house prices in Dublin rose by 6.8% while apartment prices increased by 7.2%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Fingal at 9.3% while Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown saw a rise of 5.1%," the CSO said. Outside Dublin, house prices were up by 8.9% and apartment prices rose by 6.7%. The CSO said the region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo) at 11.1%, while the South-East (Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford) recorded a 7.7% rise. Commenting on today's figures, Trevor Grant, the chairperson of Irish Mortgage Advisors, noted that property prices continue to rise faster than incomes, pushing homeownership even further out of reach for many, especially first-time buyers who are now regularly competing with trader-uppers for an ever-shrinking pool of second-hand homes. He said that with supply still falling well short of demand, this imbalance is not likely to correct itself anytime soon. Mr Grant said that the median mortgage for a first-time buyer has surged by 36% since 2019 (according to BPFI data), now sitting just shy of €300,000. For buyers in high-cost areas, this number is even higher. "Despite that pressure, mortgage approvals have hit record highs. Buyer appetite remains strong, especially among first-time buyers," he said. "One in three first time buyer (FTB) homes were valued over €400,000 in 2024, three times the 2019 share. And it has recently been reported that average household incomes for new buyers sits at €85,000, so it's clear that affordability continues to be stretched, " he stated. He also said that while mortgage interest rates have eased in recent months, and some lenders are now offering sub-3% rates, affordability pressures remain severe. Properties are regularly selling well above asking price, with recent reports stating that one in six or seven now are going 20% over, he added. Mr Grant said the fundamental issue continues to be the chronic undersupply of housing - with just over 30,000 completions in 2024. "Yet we know we need at least 50,000 new homes per year for the next five years to meet demand," he said. He said the shortage of private supply is particularly acute, and developers are still facing major challenges, including rising build costs, planning bottlenecks, and labour shortages. "Delays in connecting new homes to essential utilities like water and electricity are also adding to delivery timelines and further restricting the pace of supply. Without targeted intervention to boost output and streamline the development process, house price inflation will persist," he added.

Title: What ‘Crypto Week’ Means for ETFs

The price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $123,000 this week as Congress prepares to vote on landmark crypto legislation. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com It’s “Crypto Week,” and that means clients are probably wondering if they should transfer their retirement savings to meme coins. Congress is preparing to vote on three landmark bills this week that could transform America into the world capital of crypto. The Genius Act, which allows private companies to launch stable coins, already passed the Senate. But, the other two proposals — the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which sets up a framework for crypto to be regulated as a security or commodity; and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act that bans the Fed from launching a digital currency — may have a more difficult path to President Trump’s desk. The bills could revolutionize how digital assets are bought, sold and regulated in the US. But with all the attention, what will it take for advisors to finally get on board with an asset class that is quickly becoming impossible to ignore? “We think about crypto investments often, but before incorporating them, we want to understand what problem it solves,” said Robert Persichitte of Delagify Financial. It’s no surprise that the price of Bitcoin topped a record $123,000 high on Monday and that’s been good news for issuers and investors. The world’s biggest Bitcoin ETF reaped the benefits this week with the $80 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) jumping 2.5% as Bitcoin broke pricing records. Other funds also cashed in, including: There may be an even bigger rush to digital assets once more sovereign governments issue debts denominated in cryptocurrency, like El Salvador, Persichitte said. “That’s when it emerges as a unified, globally unified, currency, but it will be difficult to see when that is coming in the future.” Where’s the Bill? While many clients are already invested in crypto, the “eye-popping” valuation could encourage more client questions about digital assets, said Lawrence K. Pon, a CFP and CPA at Pon & Associates. Besides risk, however, there are other important aspects of crypto that advisors should be aware of, like understanding the tax consequences. Trades will generate capital gains or losses that need to be reported on Form 8949, Pon said. Clients will also need to think about estate planning. “Can their beneficiaries get to the cryptocurrency after they die?” Pon said. “They need to understand all the complications before investing.” JPMorgan, T. Rowe Price, and Capital Group had some of the top-performing funds of the first half of 2025, according to a recent Morningstar report. A handful of asset managers reported earnings Tuesday. The firm has launched nine total fixed-income ETFs this year. Trump’s media company has filed for a third crypto-focused ETF that would hold Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Cronos and XRP. The agency’s new guidelines focus on disclosures around price fluctuations and market manipulation, among other common concerns. The fund pulled in more than $18 million in assets over two days last week but has seen negligible interest from investors long term. The fund marks the latest example of issuers capitalizing on growing investor appetite for lower-risk options. The first spot Solana ETF came to market last week through a filing under the Securities Act of 1940, unlike competitors who filed under the 1933 Act. The firm has increasingly brought its nontraditional style of active management to Dimensional ETFs, which has ramped up sales. Innovator’s new ETF takes its structure from the world of annuities, but its utility to investors remains an open question. Sales of fixed income ETFs have been accelerating, and more companies are focusing on active management in new products. Sports betting and gambling have taken off in recent years, but their ETFs’ success remains relatively market-dependent. © 2025 The Daily Upside

JPMorgan, T. Rowe Price, and Capital Group had some of the top-performing funds of the first half of 2025, according to a recent Morningstar report. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com The first half of the year has been all about actives. Now, investors have the numbers to prove it. Active ETF launches and inflows hit record highs in the first half of the year, according to a recent Morningstar report. Increasingly complex strategies — like derivative income and collateralized loan obligation funds — are becoming more popular amid ongoing market turbulence, and continue to eat away at mutual fund market share. Active fixed-income ETFs were also favored by investors. “We’ve seen a lot of interest in active bond ETFs, particularly from big managers like Vanguard, [who] make it very clear that they plan to compete actively in the active bond space,” said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research at CFRA. “So we expect a lot more growth there.” There have also been 297 active ETF launches so far this year, with firms like Capital Group, JPMorgan, and T. Rowe Price continuing to build out offerings. Active strategies collectively took in $183 billion in assets, per the report, with derivative income, large blend, and ultrashort bond strategies seeing the most inflows. There was also a jump in the number of ETFs with small- and mid-cap holdings, a trend to look out for, said Stephen Welch, research analyst at Morningstar and author of the report. “That’s obviously a place where capacity matters, so it’d be interesting if there’s uptake there, and if firms continue to launch in that area,” he said. The top-performing funds of H1 2025 in terms of net flows were: The large-blend, ultrashort bond, derivative-income, and large-value categories accounted for roughly half of all active ETF flows so far this year. Still, buffer ETFs, a recent addition to the space, accounted for more than 100 active fund launches in the past six months. Call of Duty. Covered call strategies are another major category to keep an eye on, said Ullal, exemplified by the popularity — especially among older investors nearing retirement — of products like JPMorgan’s JEPQ. “If you look at those strategies, they tend to underperform in a very rapidly rising market, if you’re writing call options on equities,” he said. “But in a market that’s declining or going sideways, it’s an effective strategy to generate income.” The price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $123,000 this week as Congress prepares to vote on landmark crypto legislation.

A handful of asset managers reported earnings Tuesday. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com Much of Wall Street is expecting a possible market slowdown in the second half of the year, so it’s a good thing it hit some high notes beforehand. It’s earnings season, which is often a time to celebrate victories, and BlackRock hit a big one. The New York-based firm reported Tuesday that its assets under management grew to a record $12.5 trillion in the second quarter, up 18% year over year, putting it in a league of its own. Still, shares slid more than 5% on Tuesday, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink attributing the move to investor concerns over the company’s expenses. Meanwhile, Boston-based competitor State Street reported $5.1 trillion in AUM as well as $49 trillion in assets under custody, a 17% and 11% increase year over year, respectively. Basically, two of the world’s largest asset managers just got a lot bigger. The firm’s success in the first half of the year has been driven by high stock prices, massive inflows, and BlackRock’s push into private markets: Also, on the private market front, BlackRock completed its acquisition of private credit firm HPS Investment Partners this month and agreed to acquire ElmTree Funds, a real estate-focused private-equity firm. Starting next year, BlackRock plans to expand access to alternatives by including private assets in target-date retirement funds. “This is a place that we have particular strength and can add a lot of value, rather than just rote allocations of X percent to public markets and Y percent to private markets,” Martin Small, BlackRock CFO, said on an earnings call Tuesday. Win Some, Lose Some. State Street’s low-cost offerings were a win this quarter as many investors sought out affordable ETFs over mutual funds. The company generated nearly $3.5 billion in revenue this past quarter, bolstered by an 11% jump in fees year over year. However, despite higher revenue, profits fell as total expenses reached $2.5 billion in the second quarter, also up 11% compared with this time last year. State Street’s expenses went toward workforce reorganization, technology upgrades and higher performance-based incentives. Like they say, you gotta spend money to make money. – Griffin Kelly The price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $123,000 this week as Congress prepares to vote on landmark crypto legislation.

In partnership with In partnership with The pending deal poses risks to Allete’s financial health and ratepayers, and the proposed private equity model isn’t in the public interest, an administrative law judge said. The proposed Allete transaction, announced in May 2024, has cleared all required regulatory hurdles, except for approval by the Minnesota PUC. However, ALJ McKenzie agreed with entities opposing the deal — the Minnesota Office of the Attorney General, a consortium of Minnesota Power’s large industrial customers, the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, the Sierra Club and CURE, an advocacy group — that it doesn’t meet Minnesota’s public interest standard. Allete and its buyers failed to adequately support key arguments for completing the deal, such as improving the utility company’s access to capital and expertise, according to McKenzie. “Petitioners have not shown that the acquisition will improve Allete’s access to capital or even whether Allete needs improved access,” McKenzie said. Also, access to CPP Investments’ and GIP’s expertise appears to have limited value because of assurances that they intend to keep Allete’s existing management, staff and business plan, she said. Further, the private equity model offered by CPP Investments and GIP isn’t in the public interest, McKenzie said, pointing to the experience of Upper Peninsula Power Co., a utility in Michigan with similarities to Minnesota Power that was bought by private equity firms in 2014 and 2021. After a series of post-transaction rate increases, UPPCO’s rates were 9 cents/kWh higher than the average rate for other investor-owned utilities in Michigan at the end of last year, according to McKenzie. In her recommended decision, McKenzie cited Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Mark Christie’s warnings that asset managers such as Blackrock could hurt ratepayers by trying to maximize profits from the utilities they buy. “Consistent with the strategies of private equity investors generally, the partners plan to become deeply involved in Allete’s governance,” McKenzie said. CPP Investments and GIP expect to earn a return by buying Allete that “significantly exceeds” the returns produced by publicly traded utilities, according to McKenzie. “Petitioners are most likely to make up the difference between a plausible regulated return and the targeted return through financial engineering,” she said. After the deal was announced, S&P Global Ratings lowered Allete’s outlook to “negative” from “stable” over concerns the transaction could lead to higher leverage and weaker financial measures at the company, McKenzie noted. Under private owners, Allete will no longer be required to make financial filings at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which could significantly reduce information available to the Minnesota PUC and ratepayers about the company, according to McKenzie. Despite the ALJ recommended decision, Allete expects the Minnesota PUC will approve the transaction this year, noting it is supported by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 31, the Laborers' International Union of Minnesota & North Dakota and other organizations. Under the agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power would freeze its base rates for a year and reduce its return on equity from 9.78% to 9.65% until a future rate case, providing immediate ratepayer benefits, according to Allete. Also, CPP Investments and GIP agreed to fund Allete’s five-year capital plan, ensuring that the company will have access to the capital needed to advance its transmission and renewable energy goals, Allete said. Besides its utility subsidiaries, Allete owns Allete Clean Energy, a renewable energy company, BNI Energy, a coal company, and New Energy Equity, a solar developer. It has an 8% stake in American Transmission Co.

Title: ‘You Can’t Put the Genie Back’: Bitwise CIO Reveals Why Crypto May Never Be the Same Again

The conversation around cryptocurrency in the United States appears to be entering a new phase as key legislation gains traction in Congress. According to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, the passage of several pro-crypto bills under discussion in Washington could have lasting implications for the market. In a note to clients, Hougan emphasized the long-term structural shift underway, stating that once these bills pass, “you can’t put the genie back in the bottle.” The legislative push, dubbed “Crypto Week” by Hougan, follows a declaration by the US House of Representatives to advance three major pieces of digital currency-focused legislation. These include the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins; the CLARITY Act, designed to regulate broader digital currency assets; and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the introduction of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC). The GENIUS Act has already cleared the Senate, placing it a step closer to becoming law. Hougan argues that regulatory clarity could play a pivotal role in reducing systemic risk across the digital asset industry. He noted that many of the high-profile failures in the digital currency space, including FTX, Terra (Luna), Celsius, and Mt. Gox, were enabled by a lack of oversight. In the absence of defined rules, offshore platforms with inadequate internal controls and auditing were able to thrive, resulting in significant losses for users. He contends that proper legislation could have prevented such failures. “If clear regulations had allowed safer versions of these services to exist in the US, many of the historical blow-ups might not have occurred,” Hougan stated. Regulatory guidelines, according to the note, could also facilitate entry for traditional financial institutions, allowing for crypto custody and services through familiar, regulated channels. That shift could improve investor confidence and potentially limit the frequency and severity of market drawdowns. Hougan also believes that the passage of these bills could diminish the likelihood of future extreme price crashes. While Bitcoin remains one of the best-performing assets over the last 15 years, its history includes multiple drawdowns exceeding 70%. Hougan argues that enhanced regulation could limit the impact of unpredictable events that trigger such volatility. While some may question whether future administrations could reverse pro-crypto momentum, Hougan remains unconcerned. He pointed out that support for legislation like the GENIUS Act has been bipartisan, passing the Senate 68-30 with significant backing from both Democrats and Republicans. He attributes this cross-party alignment not only to generational voter interests but also to Wall Street’s growing involvement in crypto. According to Hougan, as financial institutions like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley expand their crypto operations, the likelihood of political reversal diminishes. “As a broader array of investors and firms becomes involved in crypto, it will be increasingly difficult for politicians to align against it,” he said. Should these legislative efforts succeed, Hougan concludes that crypto is positioned to transition further into the mainstream. With clearer rules, reduced risk, and rising institutional support, the digital asset market may be entering a new era of growth and maturity.

Title: Why the World Needs Bitcoin Now More Than Ever

A stylized representation of Bitcoin’s decentralized network. Bitcoin operates without central control, enabling financial freedom through peer-to-peer transactions. Bitcoin isn’t just an investment or a buzzword – it’s a beacon of hope and freedom in a world facing unprecedented economic and social challenges. Around the globe, people are confronting rising inflation, inequitable access to banking, costly remittances, and authoritarian financial controls. In this context, Bitcoin emerges as more than a technology; it is a movement empowering individuals with financial sovereignty. The following sections explore how, right now, Bitcoin is catalyzing economic inclusion, safeguarding value against inflation, streamlining global payments, empowering the oppressed, and spurring a revolution in decentralized innovation. The message is clear and urgent: the world needs Bitcoin now more than ever. 1. Economic Freedom and Financial Inclusion: Banking the Unbanked Billions of people worldwide remain unbanked or underbanked, locked out of traditional finance . This lack of access means missed opportunities and vulnerability to exploitation. Bitcoin offers a lifeline of economic freedom. With nothing more than a smartphone and internet, anyone can create a Bitcoin wallet and join the global economy . There are no gatekeepers demanding paperwork or minimum balances – Bitcoin’s network is open to all. In places where banking infrastructure is weak, Bitcoin is filling the gap. Nigeria is a powerful example. Despite over 55% of Nigerians lacking bank accounts, the country ranks second worldwide in crypto adoption . An astonishing 47% of Nigerians aged 18–64 have used cryptocurrency, the highest rate globally . Young entrepreneurs in Lagos or Kano aren’t waiting for banks – they’re using Bitcoin to start businesses, pay bills, and store savings in a way that was impossible before. Even a government ban couldn’t stem this tide; peer-to-peer Bitcoin trade flourished until the ban was lifted in late 2023 . This grassroots movement shows Bitcoin’s inclusive power: it is simply the most efficient way for many Nigerians to conduct daily transactions, from buying groceries to paying for phone credit . We see a similar story in El Salvador, where about 70% of the population was unbanked prior to 2021 . By making Bitcoin legal tender, El Salvador enabled millions of citizens to leapfrog into digital finance via mobile wallets. Suddenly, a single mother in a rural village – previously without any bank access – can receive payments or remittances on her phone and participate in the economy. The motivation was clear: “help the 70% of Salvadorans who are unbanked” by allowing anyone with a phone to transact . This bold step has turned El Salvador into a living laboratory for financial inclusion, inspiring other countries to explore Bitcoin for the same reason. Bitcoin is economic empowerment. It democratizes finance, giving individuals control over their money regardless of status or location. From subsistence farmers in Africa to gig workers in Southeast Asia, people are downloading wallets and unlocking opportunities. They can save without fear of local bank failures, transact across borders, and access global markets directly. As the World Economic Forum noted, cryptocurrencies are building “open, democratic financial systems” that can include the 1.7 billion+ underbanked people through low-cost, automated services . In short, Bitcoin is banking the unbanked, igniting hope in communities long left on the margins. The world urgently needs this inclusive financial revolution to continue growing. 2. Inflation Hedge and Store of Value: Protecting Wealth in Turbulent Times Around the world, families are watching their hard-earned savings melt away as inflation soars. In these trying times, Bitcoin shines as digital gold – a safe haven asset with a hard cap that governments cannot debase . Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed in unlimited quantities, Bitcoin’s supply will never exceed 21 million coins. This built-in scarcity makes it resistant to inflationary pressures and instills confidence that one’s savings won’t be eroded by central bank policies . As a result, more people are turning to Bitcoin as a store of value when traditional money falters. We see this vividly in countries suffering hyperinflation or currency collapse. In Venezuela, years of economic mismanagement led to one of history’s worst hyperinflations at over 1,000,000% . The Venezuelan bolívar became virtually worthless – but Bitcoin offered a lifeline. Venezuelans began converting their rapidly devaluing cash into Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to preserve whatever value they could. By 2020, Venezuela ranked third globally on the crypto adoption index due to the sheer volume of bolívar-to-Bitcoin transactions . Everyday people used Bitcoin to protect wages from inflation, with bank deposits losing value “in weeks or even days” otherwise . As Reuters reported, in Venezuela “crypto has become a tool to send remittances, protect wages from inflation and help businesses manage cash flow in a depreciating currency” . In short, Bitcoin has been a lifesaver for many Venezuelans, acting as a palliative for economic disaster when nothing else was available. Argentina provides another compelling case. Long plagued by inflation, Argentina recently saw annual inflation spike above 100%, the highest in decades. In response, Argentinians have rushed into cryptocurrency as a hedge. By mid-2023 an estimated 5 million Argentines (over 10% of the population) were using crypto regularly . Data shows that as the Argentinian peso plunged, crypto purchases shot up, peaking when inflation crossed 100% for the first time in thirty years . Many people now take their paycheck and immediately convert it to Bitcoin or stablecoins to escape the peso’s loss in value . One local exchange executive explained, “We have really high inflation… That makes crypto a valuable option for saving” . For Argentinians, Bitcoin offers something their national currency cannot: trustworthy long-term value. It’s telling that even in a bear market for crypto, Argentina led Latin America in transaction volume precisely because of this need to survive hyperinflation . What makes Bitcoin so attractive in these scenarios is financial sovereignty. As Human Rights Foundation’s Alex Gladstein observed, if you hold Bitcoin in your own wallet, “governments can’t delete or freeze your stuff, and they certainly can’t hyperinflate you” . People living under double- or triple-digit inflation have discovered this truth firsthand. Bitcoin’s design guarantees that no central authority can erode its value by printing more. This provides an essential hedge, especially during hyperinflationary spirals when prices double in weeks and local currencies collapse. Even in more stable economies, the post-2020 era of stimulus and rising prices has woken people up: in the U.S. and Europe, investors increasingly view Bitcoin as “digital gold” to diversify portfolios and guard against the highest inflation in 40 years. Historical data show that interest in Bitcoin spikes during inflationary periods , reflecting its growing reputation as “a hedge against traditional market downturns” . By offering ordinary people a way to preserve wealth, Bitcoin is fulfilling one of its most important promises. Whether it’s a middle-class family in Turkey watching the lira crash, or a professional in Lebanon who saw banks freeze their accounts (and wished they’d held Bitcoin ), individuals are learning that Bitcoin can secure their financial future when local systems fail. In a very real sense, Bitcoin is hope: hope that one’s lifetime of savings can be saved from the silent theft of inflation. As more people recognize this, Bitcoin’s role as the 21st century store-of-value will only grow – a stabilizing force in an unstable world . 3. Cross-Border Payments and Remittances: Fast, Low-Cost Global Transfers Every year, migrant workers and families worldwide lose billions of dollars to high fees and slow processes when sending money across borders. Traditional remittance services often charge 5-10% per transaction and can take days to clear . For the people relying on these funds – often small amounts for food, education or medicine – those fees hurt the most. Bitcoin offers a game-changing alternative: near-instant, low-cost international transfers that can empower families and boost entire economies. Consider El Salvador again. Remittances from workers abroad make up a whopping 20% of El Salvador’s GDP , but much of that used to be skimmed off by money transmitters. By embracing Bitcoin, El Salvador aimed to dramatically cut remittance costs for its people. Using the government’s Chivo wallet or Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, Salvadorans can now receive money from the U.S. in seconds, with virtually no fees – a stark contrast to lining up at Western Union and paying hefty commissions . This means more money in the pockets of low-income families and rural communities. As President Bukele touted, a construction worker in California can send $100 back home and nearly the whole $100 arrives, rather than $85 after fees. Enabling direct Bitcoin remittances has been life-changing for households that depend on that extra cash for daily needs. It also exemplifies how Bitcoin makes global commerce more fair: it doesn’t discriminate between a bank transfer of $10 or $10,000, and it never takes a cut based on percentage. Across the globe, other countries are similarly leveraging Bitcoin and crypto for remittances. Mexico, one of the world’s largest remittance destinations, has seen a surge in crypto-fueled transfers. In 2022, the exchange Bitso processed over $3.3 billion in remittances from the US to Mexico via crypto, about 5.4% of total flows . That 5% share – achieved in just a few years – translated into millions of dollars saved in fees for Mexican families. Importantly, these Bitcoin-based remittances arrive in minutes rather than days, and receivers in Mexico’s villages can convert to pesos or keep Bitcoin as they choose. The convenience and speed are a game changer. It’s no wonder that other Latin American countries with large U.S. diasporas (like Guatemala or Honduras) are exploring similar avenues, and companies like Strike are building Bitcoin Lightning solutions specifically to link U.S. earners with families back home in the developing world. In Africa, where remittance fees are the highest in the world, Bitcoin and stablecoins are truly transformative. Many Africans working abroad have shifted to sending money home via crypto because it can be 40-60% cheaper than using a traditional remittance corridor . For example, sending $200 in the legacy system might cost $20 or more in some African routes, whereas doing it with Bitcoin or a dollar-pegged crypto costs just a few dollars – and arrives the same day. Startups have sprouted across Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana to facilitate these transfers, often using Bitcoin’s network as the backbone beneath user-friendly apps. The result is that families can receive more of what their loved ones earn, helping pay for schooling, healthcare, and local business investments. But remittances are only part of the story. Cross-border commerce and payments are also being revolutionized by Bitcoin’s network. Small exporters and freelancers in countries with restrictive banking can now get paid directly in Bitcoin from international clients, sidestepping delays of wire transfers or unfair currency exchange rates. A designer in Lagos or a coder in Dhaka can offer their services globally and receive value in minutes, opening up opportunities previously blocked by banking friction. Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a secondary layer for instant micropayments, has further enabled things like pay-as-you-go services, streaming money for content, and tipping creators across borders with negligible fees. These innovations point to a future where sending money is as easy as sending an email – a future Bitcoin is actively creating today. The world urgently needs faster, fairer payments, and Bitcoin is delivering. By stripping away the artificial barriers and tolls in the legacy system, Bitcoin lets migrants support their families more effectively and lets value flow to where it’s needed most. It’s profoundly inspiring to see a grandmother in the Philippines receive a Lightning payment on her phone from her grandson overseas, or a community in Senegal fund a well via global Bitcoin donations, all with minimal overhead. This is financial connectivity as it should be: inclusive, efficient, and empowering. As more people discover how easily and cheaply they can transact globally with Bitcoin, the pressure will mount on old remittance providers to lower costs – a positive force Bitcoin has already set in motion. 4. Political and Social Empowerment: Sovereignty Under Authoritarian Regimes Imagine living under a regime that controls every aspect of your life – even your ability to access money. In many authoritarian and crisis-hit countries, people face financial repression: frozen bank accounts, capital controls, surveillance of transactions, and the ever-present threat of asset seizure. Here, Bitcoin’s value is not just financial – it’s profoundly human. Bitcoin provides a form of money that no dictator can easily control, giving dissidents, activists, and ordinary citizens a tool to reclaim their freedom. As one activist put it, “Bitcoin is bad for dictators”, because it’s money that empowers the people . Time and again, when repressive governments have tried to cut off their citizens from resources, Bitcoin has ridden to the rescue. In Nigeria, during the 2020 #EndSARS protests against police brutality, authorities froze the bank accounts of activists to stifle the movement . But young protesters quickly turned to Bitcoin for fundraising after seeing their local currency access blocked. Within days, Bitcoin donations from around the world were keeping the protests alive, paying for food, medical supplies and legal aid – all beyond the government’s reach. Nigeria’s youth effectively said: “If the banks won’t let us raise money for justice, we’ll use Bitcoin, which no one can censor.” This marked one of the first major instances where a social movement was funded by cryptocurrency out of necessity, showcasing Bitcoin’s power as censorship-resistant money. Even as the government tried to clamp down (at one point even ordering crypto accounts frozen), organizers kept routing funds through Bitcoin until their voices were heard. In Belarus and Russia, opposition groups and journalists have similarly leaned on Bitcoin to survive crackdowns. When authoritarian regimes blacklist dissident organizations from financial services, they assume they can starve them out. But with Bitcoin, an independent media outlet or an NGO can keep operating, paying contributors and receiving support from abroad, without a single bank having to approve. Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation notes that “so many people…have essentially been saved or rescued because of this technology” . His organization started recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as early as 2013, when Ukrainian protesters in Kyiv faced bank freezes and found that Bitcoin could still get funds to them on the ground . In his words, “Bitcoin continues to prove itself as a powerful tool against authoritarian control”, offering ordinary people an alternative when regimes would otherwise trap or devalue their money . No story illustrates this better than that of Venezuela’s medical workers in 2020. Amidst economic collapse and COVID-19, Venezuela’s authoritarian government was blocking aid money for doctors and nurses – refusing assistance for political reasons while these frontline workers earned just a few dollars a month. The opposition-led team found a clever solution: they used cryptocurrency to bypass the regime and deliver aid directly. They set up Bitcoin (and stablecoin) wallets for thousands of healthcare workers. Funds from international donors were sent to these wallets, and trusted community members (termed “human ATMs”) helped the recipients convert to usable local currency . This Bitcoin-fueled aid program succeeded in getting $100 per month to 65,000 desperate doctors and nurses – an absolute lifeline when the average salary had plunged to just $5 . The government could neither intercept nor stop this relief, as it was happening on a decentralized network outside their control. Think about that: tens of thousands of families were sustained because Bitcoin enabled humanitarian aid without borders. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s potential as a weapon against oppression, delivering hope where conventional channels failed. Bitcoin’s censorship resistance and self-custody mean that you and you alone control your money. If you hold your own Bitcoin keys, no bank, no court, not even a superpower can freeze your account or block a transaction. For people in Hong Kong, Iran, Afghanistan, and other repressive environments, this is incredibly empowering. It means a journalist can escape their country with their savings intact on a USB drive or memorized seed phrase – whereas carrying cash or gold would get confiscated at the border. It means a refugee can receive support directly from supporters worldwide, even if the local regime wants to choke them off. And it means communities can build a degree of economic autonomy, using Bitcoin in local circular economies, that lets them endure sanctions or financial blockades. As Gladstein has bluntly stated, Bitcoin strips authoritarians of a key lever of control. “With Bitcoin, the ability of these leaders to [financially] manipulate and control people is completely decimated,” he explains . A government can’t inflate away your wealth if it’s in Bitcoin, and they can’t freeze what they can’t find the keys to. Indeed, “no government or bank can freeze your bitcoin or restrict access to it”, as one Lebanese survivor of hyperinflation observed – and that could have saved many in his country’s collapse . This is why Bitcoin is increasingly called “freedom money”. It is giving people an exit door from tyrannical systems. Each time an oppressed individual opts out of the state-controlled currency, they reclaim a bit of power over their own life. We should be clear: Bitcoin alone won’t topple dictators overnight. But it evens the playing field by denying dictators total financial dominance. It provides a plan B for those bravely working for change – a way to sustain themselves and their missions when traditional means are cut off. This has a profound psychological impact too: just knowing there is an alternative builds resilience. In the words of one Togolese activist, people in autocracies turn to Bitcoin because “it helps bypass financial repression” and gives them hope for a more free future . By empowering civil society and weakening the grip of repressive governments over finances, Bitcoin is quietly fueling a revolution in human rights. The world needs this “money of freedom” today, because so many are still fighting for their basic dignity under harsh regimes. Bitcoin is their ally – our ally – in the timeless struggle for liberty. 5. Technological Innovation and Decentralization: A New Era of Trust and Opportunity Bitcoin isn’t just changing finance; Bitcoin is changing the world by introducing a revolutionary model of trust through technology. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin network in 2009, few understood that this was the dawn of a new era – the era of decentralized innovation. Today, we recognize Bitcoin as the foundation of a global shift: a shift towards systems that are open, transparent, and not reliant on any single authority. This technological paradigm is unleashing creativity and economic opportunity on a scale reminiscent of the early internet. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Bitcoin sparked the Fourth Industrial Revolution in finance, one centered on decentralization and digital scarcity. At its core, Bitcoin solved a problem long thought impossible: it created digital scarcity. For the first time, there was a digital asset that could not be copied endlessly, that people could trust to hold value like a physical commodity. This breakthrough – “the birth of digital scarcity” – underpins Bitcoin’s value . With a hard limit of 21 million coins, Bitcoin established a reliable, programmatic monetary policy that anyone in the world can verify. This scarcity, combined with robust security, means Bitcoin can serve as a foundation for wealth creation and preservation in the digital age . It has inspired an entire ecosystem of innovation: thousands of cryptocurrencies, smart contract platforms, decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, and more – all tracing their lineage back to Bitcoin’s fundamental breakthroughs. Yet Bitcoin remains unique and irreplaceable, the most secure and widely adopted of them all . As an OSL research piece put it, Bitcoin’s “unique properties, such as scarcity, decentralization, and security, contribute to its status as a digital asset that cannot be replicated.” Decentralization is the beating heart of Bitcoin’s technology. By operating on a global network of tens of thousands of nodes and miners, Bitcoin eliminates the need for any middleman or central server . Transactions are verified by the consensus of the network participants, not by trusting a bank or government. This has enormous implications. It means the Bitcoin network is extraordinarily resilient – there’s no single point of failure that could bring it down . It means transparency – every transaction is recorded on an open ledger (the blockchain) that anyone can examine, reducing the chance of fraud. And it means empowerment – “it empowers individuals by giving them control over their own funds,” free from the fees and whims of intermediaries . In practical terms, a farmer in India can trade with a developer in France and a designer in Brazil directly, with each party trusting the math and the network, not having to know or trust each other beforehand. This trustless transaction capability is revolutionary; it removes friction and fosters a new era of global commerce and collaboration. Bitcoin’s decentralized design also drives security and immutability. The network is secured by advanced cryptography and a proof-of-work mechanism that makes altering confirmed transactions virtually impossible . Unlike centralized databases that hackers often breach, Bitcoin’s blockchain has never been compromised in its history. Once a transaction is settled in a block, it cannot be changed or erased . This gives users an unprecedented level of confidence in the integrity of their money. Funds can’t just vanish because of a bank’s error or a government’s whim – the Bitcoin ledger is ironclad. Each additional participant and each additional use case only strengthens the network (through what’s known as the network effect): as more people use Bitcoin, it becomes more valuable and useful, which attracts yet more users in a virtuous cycle . Already Bitcoin has the largest, most battle-tested computing network on Earth securing it, making it one of the most secure assets ever devised. This level of security is what allows Bitcoin to function as digital cash and digital gold simultaneously. And as the network grows, we see more businesses and even nations exploring it, knowing that they can plug into a financial protocol that is robust and globally accessible. Beyond Bitcoin itself, the innovations spurred by Bitcoin’s principles are reshaping technology and finance. The rise of the Lightning Network, for instance, has made Bitcoin payments ultra-fast and scalable, enabling a wave of creativity in micropayments and small-value use cases. In 2025, the Lightning Network reached new heights, reportedly processing over 100 million transactions in a single quarter as adoption accelerated . This layer-2 solution allows people to send tiny fractions of a cent instantly – something not feasible with traditional payment rails – which is opening up possibilities like pay-per-stream content, micro-tipping for social media posts, and machine-to-machine payments in the Internet of Things. As Lightning and similar technologies mature, Bitcoin is evolving from just a store of value to a full-fledged payments and innovation platform. Crucially, Bitcoin has catalyzed a movement towards decentralized governance and open-source development in finance. It proved that a community of globally distributed contributors can maintain and upgrade a monetary system without any CEO or central authority. This is inspiring new governance models in other domains (think decentralized autonomous organizations for everything from art to insurance). In essence, Bitcoin taught the world that trust can be built into code – and that people anywhere can cooperate to run critical infrastructure (like money) by consensus. The cultural impact of this cannot be overstated: “Bitcoin serves as a symbol of resistance against centralized control and government overreach”, representing a vision of a future where financial freedom and sovereignty are accessible to all . It has ignited the imagination of millions – engineers, economists, futurists – who are now pushing the boundaries of what decentralized tech can do, from reinventing banking to creating new social networks free of censorship. The world needs Bitcoin’s innovative spirit urgently. Traditional financial systems, with their siloed ledgers and 20th-century technology, struggle to keep pace with today’s digital economy. Bitcoin and the technologies it birthed offer a leap forward, much like the internet did for information. They promise financial services that are more efficient, more inclusive, and more secure. They also promise new economic models that reward participation and merit over privilege and monopoly. We are already seeing early glimpses: developing nations using Bitcoin to stabilize their economies, tech startups building on Bitcoin to bank the unbanked, and even forward-thinking governments crafting laws to accommodate this innovation rather than stifle it. By embracing Bitcoin’s decentralized paradigm, societies can unleash entrepreneurship and give individuals greater agency in the economic realm. This is a positive-sum game – one where everyone can benefit from a more open and innovative financial system. At a time when trust in institutions is low, Bitcoin offers a trust in technology as an alternative, and it’s proving to be trust well-placed. The momentum of Bitcoin’s technological revolution is unstoppable, and joining it means stepping into the future of finance with optimism and confidence. 6. Global Relevance: A Worldwide Movement from Developing Villages to Developed Cities Bitcoin’s impact and adoption are not confined to one type of economy or one region – it is a global phenomenon, touching lives in developing countries and developed capitals alike. What’s truly inspiring is how Bitcoin means different things to different people, yet it brings them together under one monetary network. In struggling economies, it’s a lifeline and an equalizer. In wealthier nations, it’s an agent of change and a hedge for the future. Across continents, a diverse tapestry of Bitcoin use cases is emerging, proving that this technology is broadly relevant and adaptable to local needs. Below is a snapshot of key regions embracing Bitcoin today, and the primary drivers behind their adoption: Table: Key Regions Adopting Bitcoin and Their Drivers of Adoption Sources: Adoption data from Chainalysis and national reports ; inflation and unbanked stats from World Bank, IMF, and local sources . As the table illustrates, Bitcoin’s appeal is truly global and multifaceted. A rural villager in Kenya might cherish Bitcoin for giving her a safe savings vehicle outside any bank. A software engineer in San Francisco might value Bitcoin as an investment and a statement of support for open technology. A shopkeeper in Turkey could accept Bitcoin from tourists to avoid the lira’s volatility, while a college student in Ukraine might use Bitcoin donations to fund relief efforts during a crisis . In each case, Bitcoin is solving a problem or enhancing lives in ways that weren’t possible before. It’s particularly noteworthy how Bitcoin adoption often surges in response to crises or limitations of the traditional system. In Lebanon’s recent financial meltdown, for instance, when banks imposed strict withdrawal limits and the local currency crashed, interest in Bitcoin surged as a lifeline . People realized that had they held savings in Bitcoin, no bank could have prevented them from accessing their money, and the value wouldn’t have been tied to Lebanon’s failing policies . Similarly, during currency scares in Turkey and Nigeria, Bitcoin trading volumes hit all-time highs as people scrambled for stability. These aren’t speculative manias – they’re signs of urgent need. When trust in government money falters, Bitcoin stands in the gap. And even in stable countries, events like bank failures (for example, the 2023 U.S. regional bank crisis) or concerns about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and privacy have driven more people to hold Bitcoin as a sovereign money option just in case. It’s a grassroots insurance policy that’s catching on everywhere. Perhaps one of the most uplifting aspects of Bitcoin’s global rise is the sense of unity and community it fosters. Bitcoin has built a global network of advocates and educators crossing all cultural and political lines. A farmer in rural India and a banker in New York might have little in common – until they start discussing Bitcoin, and suddenly they share this vision of a more open financial future. Conferences, meetups, and online forums brim with enthusiastic collaboration – developers improving the technology, economists debating its impact, ordinary people sharing stories of how Bitcoin changed their lives. This bottom-up energy is contagious. It’s turning Bitcoin from just a currency into a global movement for financial empowerment. We see governments starting to pay attention (and some, like El Salvador, taking bold steps), largely because they realize this is driven by people’s genuine needs and aspirations. In summary, from Jakarta to Johannesburg, São Paulo to Stockholm, Bitcoin is proving its relevance. It adapts to local contexts: serving as a currency here, a store of value there, and a network for innovation everywhere. The world has never had a truly global, people-powered financial system before – and now it does in Bitcoin. This universality is why the world needs Bitcoin now. It is the common thread of financial hope running through so many disparate struggles and dreams on our planet today. Conclusion: A Hopeful Future with Bitcoin In this moment of global challenge and change, Bitcoin rises as a beacon of hope and a tool for empowerment. It offers a path toward greater economic freedom, where anyone can participate in finance without permission or prejudice. It offers relief from the silent theft of inflation, giving ordinary people a way to safeguard their life’s work. It tears down costly barriers in moving money, reuniting families with more of their hard-earned wages. It strengthens those who dare to speak out against tyranny, ensuring their voices can’t be silenced by freezing their funds. It pioneers a radical new trust model – one rooted in math and consensus rather than fallible institutions – unleashing innovation and inspiring collaboration worldwide. And it does all of this through a single, open network that welcomes every citizen of the world. The urgency cannot be overstated. As we’ve seen, people are using Bitcoin today to overcome real hardships – feeding their families in inflation-ravaged countries, raising funds for noble causes, or simply accessing opportunities long denied to them. The status quo has left too many behind and let too many down. Now, Bitcoin gives us a chance to course-correct – to build a fairer, more inclusive global financial system from the ground up. It is not controlled by the powerful; it is owned by all who use it. In Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos, we glimpse a future where technology empowers the many, not the few. This report has laid out why the world needs Bitcoin now more than ever, but the truth is even simpler: the world needs hope, the world needs freedom – and Bitcoin is delivering both. From a young woman in Latin America finally able to save for her education, to a father in Africa sending money home without extortionate fees, to an entrepreneur in Asia launching a startup via global crowdfunding, Bitcoin is lighting up lives with new possibilities. It instills a sense of optimism and agency – the feeling that yes, we can take control of our financial destiny. That energy is infectious and unstoppable. We stand at a crossroads in history. Down one path, we stick with old financial structures that are creaking under their own weight, often exclusionary and prone to crisis. Down another path, we embrace the Bitcoin-led revolution – an open, resilient, people-centric financial future. The choice is becoming clearer by the day. Around the world, millions have already chosen Bitcoin as their lifeline and their inspiration. They chose it because it answered a deep need that nothing else could. Now is the time for all of us – individuals, communities, and forward-thinking leaders – to recognize this urgent call. Bitcoin is here to stay, and its positive impact is only growing. By championing Bitcoin and the ethos it represents, we champion a world of greater justice and opportunity. As the examples and data have shown, this is not theoretical; it is happening right now. The world needs Bitcoin, today, to continue breaking down barriers and uplifting those in need. If we seize this moment, we can usher in a brighter, more inclusive era of human prosperity. In the powerful words of one Bitcoiner, “Bitcoin isn’t just money – it’s hope.” Let us embrace that hope. The world needs Bitcoin, and together we can carry this torch of freedom forward, energized and united by the promise of a better tomorrow. ₿LOG ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: Rachel Fehily: Why are the experiences of people born, like me, in Temple Hill forgotten?

I spent the first three months of my life in a contested space: Temple Hill in Blackrock, Dublin, commonly known as St Patrick’s Infant and Dietetic Hospital. It is contested because there is a fundamental disagreement as to its historical purpose: there are two different retrospective interpretations of its function. To this day the Government insists that it was a hospital; but in reality, it was an adoption home for infants and babies. It was stated in a parliamentary question in the Dáil by Sinn Féin TD Claire Kerrane last year that: “Temple Hill does not qualify for supports, redress or recognition because it was a hospital, yet babies were adopted and paid for on foot of newspaper advertisements. Many children went to America. I have never heard of a hospital that does that.” Despite the indisputable fact that many children were adopted from Temple Hill through the former adoption society St Patrick’s Guild, and some were resident for lengthy periods of time, it is one of at least four institutions excluded from the Mother and Baby Institutions payment scheme as it was not on the initial list of homes investigated by the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes. The fact that it was not an institution within the meaning of the terms of the commission and no mothers resided there with their babies (apparently they were taken from them at the door) kept it out of its terms of reference. I am not seeking a payment under the scheme or looking for redress personally, because I left Temple Hill with my adoptive parents at the age of three months. I was fortunate to grow up with six siblings – five adopted, also from the same location – in a stimulating and supportive environment, but I am advocating for people who have been left out. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has stated that the official commission report was flawed because many institutions were excluded. Its remit was too narrow. In an “alternative report”, a team including survivors, activists and eminent academics wrote that its “text excluded significant cohorts of affected people” and that “it is regrettable that the Commission did not request to modify its terms of reference to permit deep engagement with a wider range of organisations”. Minister for Children, Disability and Equality Norma Foley will have a chance to review the operation of the scheme within six months of its second anniversary, by September 2026. Many of the now-ageing adults who were resident and abused in institutions and identify themselves as “survivors” in need of the supports offered by the scheme are currently left in limbo. I had the pleasure of meeting the Irish artist Bernard Canavan, a recipient of the prestigious Presidential Award for his contribution to Irish culture in the UK at the Irish Cultural Centre in Hammersmith, London. He recently held an exhibition at The United Arts Club in Dublin entitled Theocracy. His paintings represent the trauma that he and others endured in institutions. He was a long-term resident of the same Temple Hill in Blackrock, more than 25 years before me. Despite evidence of his abuse, neglect, lengthy period of residency at Temple Hill, and his advanced age, he is excluded from the payment scheme because of “contested” definitions. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has set up a comprehensive curriculum resource on “mother and baby homes” for the Junior Cycle. It developed it in collaboration with groups involved in advocating for survivors of “historic” institutions. This is an important and worthwhile initiative. The list of related literature for the English curriculum is comprehensive and impressive, including the novel Small Things Like These by Claire Keegan and the play An Trial by Máiréad Ní Ghráda. The curriculum has input from many survivors and is all the better for it. However, the framing of the curriculum comes directly from the NCCA, a statutory body of the Department of Education. At the launch, Minister for Education Helen McEntee said: “It is vital that our young people learn about the history of this State in every aspect, and in order to provide this teaching and learning, teachers must be supported with resources such as this one.” One of the resources for Junior Cycle teachers - a series of slides, maps, a list of the homes included in the Commission’s report - omits the contested homes. Much of the lengthy reading list that goes with the teacher supports comprises “official” reports. Searching through the voluminous reading list, I eventually found an alternative “List of Institutions, Agencies and Personnel Involved in Separating Unmarried Mothers from their Children.” It is collated by Claire McGettrick and the Justice for Magdalenes Research and Adoption Rights Alliance. The database includes St Patrick’s Infant Dietetic Hospital (aka Temple Hill). It is vital that students understand how our Government and legal system operates to include and exclude people from access to justice. These nuances matter. If school children are taught to think critically they might be driven to question as to whether their history curriculum is in fact “history” or “current affairs”? In Fintan O’Toole’s excellent recent article on the excavation of the Tuam site, he writes that: “This is making history in a double sense – doing something that has never been done before while simultaneously reshaping a country’s understanding of its own recent past. And, hopefully, of its present.” It seems ironic that the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four has been removed from the Senior Cycle curriculum for 2026 by the Department of Education, while Greta Gerwig’s film Barbie has been deemed worthy of inclusion. Leaving Certificate students won’t have to read George Orwell’s text or consider one of its most memorable lines: “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.” But they will have a chance to consider this dialogue by Weird Barbie: “That Ken of yours, he is one nice looking little protein pot … I’d like to see what kind of nude blob he’s packing under those jeans.” Rachel Fehily is a barrister, lecturer in literature and justice at UCD and is engaged in interdisciplinary creative-based doctoral studies supported by Research Ireland © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The best restaurants around Ireland worth travelling to

The Barrett family of Dunmore House Hotel know more than a thing or two about hospitality. Over the years, they have consistently developed and improved their little piece of heaven overlooking Clonakilty Bay. Under head chef Manuel Canapini, Adrift has become a contender for the country’s top seafood spots – trawler to table. Joanne Cronin It was all change last year at Aniar when owner JP McMahon commissioned architect Aidan Conway to create a new interior for this iconic Galway restaurant. Out went the lighter greens and neutral tones, making way for a darkened interior with dramatic focused lighting. It makes sense though, acting as a focus for McMahon’s dishes which have evolved into an intense, almost primal, expression of the west of Ireland. JC Baba’de may be the little sibling to Michelin-starred Dede, but this charming little spot is standing firmly on its own two feet. Under chef Muslim Karafil, savour fragrant delights such as charcoal grilled chicken thighs with hazelnut satay sauce, spiced crispy chicken with brown butter dip, or a whole west Cork blue lobster with pil pil potato mousseline. Or come for Turkish-influenced brunch on weekends. JC At Ballyfin – a hotel so exclusive it barely seems real – Richard Picard-Edwards has delivered the final flourish: a Michelin star for the diningroom. The €145 eight-course tasting menu is on the familiar side of grandeur, with a thrillingly good Jerusalem artichoke cream topped with chicken jelly and gold leaf, and dishes featuring lobster and caviar. Broths, purées and reductions bring depth without being overwrought. Non-residents can book, but getting a table feels about as casual as applying for citizenship. Read our full review here. Corinna Hardgrave Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix turns out sharp, confident cooking built on serious pedigree – Sam cooked at Ballyfin and Bath Priory – and produce from their own walled garden. The lunch menu and midweek Supper at Six are great value, but it’s at dinner that the kitchen really hits its stride, with a la carte and tasting menus (€80) delivering dishes like seared scallops, honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion, pan-fried wild halibut with mussels, and slow-roast organic duck. Read our full review here. CH The dark wood panelling of Ashford Castle’s George V diningroom might scream old-school but under executive head chef Liam Finnegan the food has taken a fresher turn. French-rooted, yes, but lighter, with sauces built on serious stocks rather than just butter and cream. Much of the produce now comes from a new two-acre kitchen garden, run by head gardener Alex Lavarde using no-dig methods and supplying everything from beets to honey. The twice-baked Hegarty’s cheese soufflé is a must; the wine cellar, as always, is formidable. CH It’s not every day a stone-walled cottage on the wild west coast lands a Michelin star, but Robbie McCauley’s precise cooking makes it feel inevitable. Along with his wife Sophie, he has transformed this former cafe into something rooted in tradition but unmistakably modern, serving a nine-course dinner (€125) and six-course lunch (€85). McCauley works tightly with local producers, using Burren outwintered beef, and lobster and crab from Michael O’Connell, they raise their own chickens and have an impressive vegetable garden. There’s even a small terrace for pre-dinner drinks – if the weather behaves. Read our full review here. CH When Bryan Meehan – the Irish entrepreneur behind Blue Bottle Coffee – bought The Park Hotel from the Brennan brothers last year, two things changed in the diningroom. The tasting menu was dropped in favour of a focused a la carte, and Meehan hung two Sean Scully paintings – one of which gives the room its name, The Landline. Local chef James O’Sullivan keeps things classic but special with seared scallops, Kerry Hill lamb, and pan-seared sole. Non-residents can book. CH One of Dublin’s smallest restaurants and one of its mightiest, Liath is an intimate space where food is staged as art. Damien Grey and team perform manoeuvres with grace through service in the fully open kitchen, allowing guests to see the artists at work. Grey is looking to move to a larger space, so make sure to get a booking at Blackrock market before they leave. JC Chef Stevie McCarry recently won the Northern Ireland final of the Great British Menu, a well-earned accolade for this self-taught chef. With wife Rebekah, he has developed Lir into a truly exciting seafood restaurant. The Japanese konro grill is put to good use in the kitchen which turns out cod collar schnitzel, ling kofta with burnt apple sauce and smoked dogfish corndog. Look out for the upcoming summer music nights on the terrace. Read our full review here. JC After more than 30 years in business, Denis Cotter is planning his transition away from his legendary fine-dining vegetarian restaurant. Long-term restaurant manager Dave O’Mahony is in line to take over, with head chef Miguel Frutos continuing to lead the kitchen into the future. With produce grown in a unique partnership with Gort na Náin farm and a super natural wine menu, Paradiso continues to set the standard. Read our full review here. JC There isn’t another restaurant quite like Rare. Drawing on his classical French training, chef Meeran Manzoor has invented a cuisine that is all his own, using the best of local produce accented with flavours from his home city of Chennai. His menu descriptions may sound simple but they belie a complexity of spice and nuanced technique that is simply delightful. JC Rob Krawczyk and Elaine Fleming’s Michelin-starred Chestnut offers three routes – a €55 two-course prix fixe, a four-course for €75 or the full €120 tasting menu. Ingredients are local and fiercely seasonal – Lisheen Greens, Twomey’s butchers, Union Hall fish – with much of it cooked over a custom wood-fired grill. Expect wild halibut with mussels or aged Skeaghanore duck with coal onion and sour cherries. His food is exacting, mature and restrained – one of the country’s top chefs. CH Sitting in a little glen outside Ballyvaughan, Gregans Castle is the quirky but extremely stylish countryside hotel of dreams. Chef Jonathan Farrell moved from Dublin to take over the kitchens and is producing food perfectly harmonised with the stunning landscapes. Choose from dishes such as wild garlic spaetzle, Atlantic scallop with XO, butter-poached cod, roast rack of Burren lamb or forced rhubarb direct from the hotel garden. Read our full review here. JC The Olde Glen bar would have a serious chance in any “Ireland’s most traditional pub” competition, and is worth a visit in its own right. But it’s the cooking of Ciaran Sweeney to the rear of the pub that brings the punters in night after night. The menu is packed with local produce including roast Mulroy Bay scallops, fermented potato bread with Gortahork cabbage and glazed Killybegs cod. JC Former Michelin star chef Danni Barry keeps things razor sharp at the Owenmore Restaurant, with a four-course table d’hote menu (€95) that lets the ingredients do the talking. Kilkeel scallops with caramelised kohlrabi, line-caught mackerel with blood orange and horseradish, barbecued quail with soy and honey, and wild sea bass with salt-baked celeriac are cooked with precision. Bookings are available for non-residents. CH © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin Naysayer Vanguard Makes Bold Bet On Strategy Stock–Details

In a twist that few saw coming, Vanguard has quietly become the top shareholder in Strategy (MSTR). The $10 trillion asset manager now owns just over 20 million MSTR shares. That adds up to nearly 8% of Strategy’s Class A stock. Vanguard once warned that Bitcoin was “immature” and carried “no inherent economic value.” Now it finds itself deeply tied to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin play. According to a Bloomberg report, Vanguard didn’t set out to back Saylor’s moves. It simply follows its index‑fund rules. When Strategy’s stock climbed, it grew larger in the indexes that the company tracks. The result: Vanguard had to buy more shares. Through its broad‑market funds, the asset manager ended up with a stake worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It shows how passive strategies can lead to active positions in unexpected places. Vanguard’s CEO Tim Buckley once said that Bitcoin “could wreak havoc on portfolios.” He argued that the flagship crypto lacked the history and solid ground that long‑term investors need. Yet Vanguard’s own track record of following index weights means it can’t shy away from a stock that’s on the rise. No matter the fund’s view on Bitcoin, the rules forced its hand. Strategy now holds 601,550 BTC. Each share of MSTR represents a slice of that giant pile of Bitcoin. For anyone holding Vanguard’s indexes, that means indirect exposure to more than half a million coins. Since 2020, MSTR stock has climbed around 3,400%. That surge helped push the firm’s market value up fast enough to land in Vanguard’s top holdings. Large investors often use ETFs or purpose‑built products to get Bitcoin exposure. Vanguard could have joined the likes of BlackRock in launching a spot Bitcoin ETF. But it declined. Instead, it finds itself holding a big chunk of Strategy. That makes it an unwitting part of the Bitcoin story, even if it wasn’t the path the firm’s managers originally chose. The fact that Vanguard is now the largest shareholder of $MSTR is proof that God has a sense of humor, or at least that was my reaction to @VildanaHajric who wrote story about it out today pic.twitter.com/TLg4iqT3kQ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 14, 2025 Michael Saylor sees this as a sign that institutions are coming around to Bitcoin. He told Bloomberg that Vanguard’s stake is “a powerful signal” of acceptance. For years, many big firms treated Bitcoin as a niche asset. Now they’re tied to its fortunes through Strategy’s public shares. That shift may encourage others to take a closer look. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas summed up the irony on X, saying “God has a sense of humor.” He pointed out that Vanguard’s index approach means it must own all the stocks in its benchmarks—whether it likes them or not.

Wednesday, 16 Jul 2025 NEW YORK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday as investors digested fresh inflation data and a wave of earnings reports from major financial institutions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 436.36 points, or 0.98 percent, to close at 44,023.29. The S&P 500 fell 24.8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,243.76. In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite rose 37.47 points, or 0.18 percent, to 20,677.8, marking a new all-time closing high. Ten of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors closed in the red. Materials and health care were the biggest decliners, falling 2.11 percent and 1.88 percent, respectively. Technology was the only sector to finish higher, gaining 1.27 percent. June's inflation data, released Tuesday, showed consumer prices rising 0.3 percent for the month, in line with expectations and up from May's pace. The annual CPI rate stood at 2.7 percent. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy, climbed 0.2 percent from the previous month and 2.9 percent year over year, both matching analysts' forecasts. Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital, said it was a relief to see Tuesday's CPI report come in line with expectations, but "it's highly likely that a tariff-driven inflation reckoning is coming." "The latest U.S. inflation report practically confirmed that President Trump's tariffs acted to push up consumer prices in June," said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebuy. On the earnings front, several major banks delivered underwhelming results. Wells Fargo beat profit expectations but issued lower guidance for net interest income, pushing its shares down more than 5 percent. JPMorgan Chase also posted strong results but saw its shares slip. BlackRock dropped 5.88 percent after missing revenue estimates. Citigroup stood out, gaining 3.68 percent after beating second-quarter earnings expectations. In the tech sector, Nvidia surged 4.04 percent after announcing it would resume shipments of its H20 AI chips to China, following White House assurances that current export restrictions would be eased. The news sparked a rally in semiconductor stocks. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rose 6.41 percent, Arm Holdings and Broadcom each added less than 2 percent, and the iShares Semiconductor ETF climbed 1 percent. Among other mega-cap tech names, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon posted modest advances. Tesla declined 1.93 percent, and Meta Platforms lost 1.46 percent. Thank you for your report!

Title: S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: State Street, BlackRock Shares Fall; Nvidia Stock Rises

Major U.S. equity indexes were mixed as the latest Consumer Price Index report showed inflation ticking higher in June, with indications that President Donald Trump's tariffs are beginning to push up prices on goods like groceries and clothing. The CPI report was in line with economists' forecasts. Still, the lift in inflation likely came as a disappointment to investors hoping that a softer reading might nudge the Federal Reserve towards cutting interest rates as soon as this summer. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session with a loss of 0.4%. The Dow dropped more than 400 points, falling 1%, while strength in the tech sector helped lift the Nasdaq to another record closing high with a gain of 0.2%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Shares of financial services giant State Street (STT) slipped 7.3%, suffering the steepest drop in the S&P 500, in the wake of the firm's second-quarter earnings release. Although sales and profits topped estimates, net interest income was down from the year-ago period. State Street's total expenses jumped 11% year-over-year, reflecting a $100 million workforce rationalization and higher performance-based incentive compensation, as well as technology and infrastructure investments. Agilent Technologies (A) shares fell about 6%. The laboratory instrument provider said that CFO Bob McMahon would leave the company for personal reasons, effective at the end of July. Rodney Gonsalves, Agilent's corporate controller and principal accounting officer, will serve as interim CFO. Analysts at Citi recognized investors' esteem for McMahon but suggested that his departure should not have a major impact on the company's outlook. BlackRock (BLK) reported that its assets under management reached a record level of $12.5 trillion in the second quarter, but the firm's revenue for the period fell short of expectations. The top-line miss resulted partly from a decline in net inflows, which BlackRock attributed to a major single institutional client making a major withdrawal from index funds. BlackRock shares lost 5.9% on Tuesday, receding from a record high posted in the prior session. Semiconductor giant and world's highest-valued company Nvidia (NVDA) said it intends to relaunch sales of its top-selling H20 AI chip in China. The announcement came days after a meeting between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Trump. Nvidia shares jumped 4% to a record high on Tuesday. Nvidia's plans to resume H20 chip deliveries to China helped boost other stocks in the artificial intelligence space. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) surged 6.9%, notching the top daily performance in the S&P 500. Citi analysts recently lifted their price target on Supermicro stock, highlighting strong demand for AI servers and an increasing supply of key Nvidia-produced server components. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares were up 6.4%, adding to gains posted last week after analysts at HSBC suggested that AMD's AI chips are comparable to Nvidia's offerings. First Solar (FSLR) shares jumped 6.9% after Jefferies increased its price target on the panel maker's stock. Although analysts recognized that the macroeconomic challenges facing the renewable energy business could weigh on First Solar's second-quarter financial results, Jefferies believes additional visibility surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act could help drive volume gains starting in 2026.

Title: Rise of Zohran Mamdani has Wall Street giving up on Gotham

The NYC Partnership threw a party — but no one really showed up. A who’s who of the New York City business community were no shows for a Tuesday meet and greet session with socialist democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. The list of New York City-based CEOs that declined the Partnership’s invitation includes Jamie Dimon, the nation’s top banker and chief of JP Morgan, the nations largest bank; Steve Schwarzman, the CEO of private equity powerhouse Blackstone; Brian Moynihan, the head of Bank of America, the nations second largest bank; Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, the worlds largest asset manager; and David Solomon, the CEO of investment banking giant Goldman Sachs. Most publicly pleaded “scheduling conflicts.” But “what is this guy going to tell us that we don’t already know?” is how someone close to Solomon described the situation. Those sentiments were pretty universal among according to sources at the banks of the CEOs who didn’t attend. There was once a time that CEOs of this caliber would want to meet the likely next mayor of the city. Now, it’s resignation — a bet that New York City is a lost cause, and a belief that the Partnership, run by the retiring Kathy Wylde, is an increasingly impotent advocate to turn back the increasingly leftist political class. Most business leaders I know are looking for an exit strategy rather than a strategy to deal with a mayor Mamdani. Yes, they want the current mayor Eric Adams to stick around — ethical warts and all — because he’s the devil they know and they like his very competent police commissioner, Jessica Tisch. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. But Adams faces an uphill climb, all the more so because Andrew Cuomo, who lost to Mamdani in the primary, is leading what they see as a Quixotic run as an independent. Curtis Sliwa, the GOP nominee, is going nowhere fast. The polls, for now, show a likely Mamdani mayoralty, combined with a leftist city council and a state government that veers nearly as far left as Zohran. All which spells disaster for those businesses who stay: Police defunding, higher taxes and government takeover of businesses like supermarkets. And that gets us to why there were so many no shows Tuesday: the city’s business community doesn’t have to stay. If you follow these big firms, as I do, you know they employ hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers — but fewer and fewer in recent years. The harsh COVID lockdowns here gave them the excuse to move operations to places with lower taxes and regulations, mainly Florida and Texas, but also Utah and even Tennessee. Mamdani will be another reason for the big banks to finally say goodbye to Gotham.
