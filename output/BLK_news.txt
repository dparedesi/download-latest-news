Title: Solana ETF filings now include staking – Approval odds soar to 91%

The SEC isn’t saying no, but it’s also not saying yes. What’s behind this ETF limbo? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent delays in approving a range of altcoin ETFs have stirred uncertainty within the crypto community, fueling speculation about what these postponements mean. Despite the rising fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), data from Polymarket offers a contrasting perspective, suggesting several altcoin ETFs remain poised for potential approval. In response to ongoing regulatory scrutiny, major asset managers Bitwise, Canary, and Grayscale have taken a proactive step by amending their Solana [SOL] ETF filings to include staking. This feature would allow funds to earn rewards by staking the Solana held in custody. These updated S-1 filings aim to address the SEC’s concerns, but according to a source cited by Reuters, the agency appears to be in no rush to greenlight the launches. Remarking on this, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said, “I think there needs to be a back and forth with the SEC and issuers to iron out details, so I doubt it. If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were *A LOT* of filings over the preceding couple months before launch.” While the spotlight remains on the growing number of amended Solana ETF filings, it’s worth recalling that the journey for spot crypto ETFs in the U.S. has been long and hard fought. Spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs gained approval only in January 2024, more than ten years after Gemini’s Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss submitted the original application back in 2013. In the case of Solana, VanEck was the first U.S.-based firm to propose a spot ETF in mid-2024, and interestingly, one of the last to revise its S-1 filing to incorporate staking provisions. Interestingly, BlackRock is absent in the Solana ETF race, and this silence raises questions about the firm’s intentions in the altcoin ETF space. Expressing on the matter, Seyffart noted, “They haven’t yet. But I would not be surprised if they were to eventually do that. But right now it doesn’t seem like they will be in the first wave (whenever these launch).” Despite the SEC’s apparent lack of urgency around altcoin ETF approvals, market sentiment remains strikingly optimistic. According to Polymarket data, the odds of a Solana ETF being approved in 2025 stood at 91% at the time of reporting. This bullish outlook appears to be mirrored in Solana’s performance, with the token trading at $146.40 following a modest 0.92% daily increase, as per CoinMarketCap. While delays may suggest caution, they don’t necessarily signal denial. As ETF analyst James Seyffart had aptly noted, “Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days. If we’re gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — i wouldn’t expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q.” This shows that the lack of movement doesn’t equate to rejection, leaving the door open for approval despite regulatory hesitations.

Title: Trump's tariffs and tax bill look like a 'Greek tragedy' that could tank the economy and stocks, former IMF official warns

Like a protagonist in a Greek tragedy, President Donald Trump is exhibiting a concerning level of hubris in his handling of the US economy, former IMF official Desmond Lachman worries. Despite warnings from credible sources — like Fed Chair Jerome Powell, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink — about what tariffs would mean for inflation and growth, and what his tax cut bill would mean for bond yields and the US dollar, Trump is doubling down on these policies, Lachman said in a June 10 post for the American Enterprise Institute, where he is a senior fellow. Unless Trump changes course, Lachman said, he could end up reigniting inflation, pushing up long-term bond yields, further tanking the US dollar, and sending the US economy into recession. "To Trump, these warnings are like water off a duck's back. Instead of dialing back his tariff policy, Trump has recently raised the import tariff on all aluminum and steel imports to a staggering 50%," Lachman wrote. He continued: "At the same time, instead of coming up with belt-tightening revenue and spending measures to address the country's gaping budget deficit of 6.25% of GDP, Trump is making every effort to secure the passage of his budget-busting One Big Beautiful Bill." So far, inflation has been tame and the labor market has held up as businesses have started to digest tariffs. But Lachman said the US economy is not out of the woods yet. Since businesses stockpiled inventory to prepare for Trump's tariffs, their effects won't start to show up until the second half of the year, he told Business Insider on Friday. "The fact that you're not seeing it in the May, June, July data, it doesn't mean anything," Lachman said. Here's the US trade deficit showing a surge in foreign goods buying from US businesses in late 2024 and early 2025. But tariffs aren't the only inflationary factor potentially at play. Lachman said that if you add the implications of Trump's tax bill on the value of the US dollar as the the national debt and budget deficit grow, consumers could end up paying even higher prices. With the dollar's value down 10%, for example, it means foreign goods are more expensive in addition to the 10% tariffs, or more, already being paid. In an inflationary environment — and with no indication that the US government is looking to reduce its debt and budget deficit — foreign investors have started to flee, and could continue to do so. That could send long-term Treasury rates soaring, Lachman said, slowing the US economy as the cost of lending follows suit. All of this puts US stocks in danger with valuations elevated, Lachman said. For example, here's the Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500, which measures current stock prices against a rolling average of earnings over the last 10 years. "Start with the fact that the stock market has got very high valuations, and then overlay that with the likelihood that you could have either a bond or a dollar crisis, and it would seem to me that stocks don't do very well," he said. The myth probably most associated with hubris and its sometimes disastrous consequences is the tale of Icarus. Looking to escape from a labyrinth, his father builds him wings made of wax. Icarus succeeds in getting off the ground, but in the end ignores his father's warnings and flies too close to the sun, melting his wings. Trump having imposed steep universal tariffs without sparking inflation or a recession has so far defied conventional wisdom and warnings from top economists. But with Trump's tax bill on the way, will his wings, along with the US economy and stock market, soon start to melt? Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

BlackRock faces legal action in Tennessee for allegedly misleading investors with conflicting ESG promises. ESG activism, driven by financial elites, prioritizes political agendas over shareholder returns, harming pension funds and taxpayers. Mentions of ESG buzzwords like "climate change" have plummeted since 2022 as skepticism grows. Conservative states push back, banning ESG considerations in public investments, while blue states defend the framework. Critics warn ESG operates as a "social credit" system, eroding free-market principles under the guise of sustainability.

Critics warn ESG operates as a "social credit" system, eroding free-market principles under the guise of sustainability. In a landmark lawsuit filed Monday in Tennessee, asset management titan BlackRock stands accused of violating consumer protection laws by peddling contradictory Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategies âÂ one promising robust financial returns, the other a climate-focused overhaul of capitalism. The case, the first of its kind, underscores a growing backlash against ESGâs opaque metrics, which critics argue prioritize progressive activism over fiduciary duty. As ESG-related terminology fades from corporate earnings calls âÂ dropping from 28,000 mentions in early 2022 to just 4,800 by mid-2024Â â the movement faces a reckoning: Is it a legitimate risk-management tool or a Trojan horse for ideological control? BlackRockâs double game: Profits vs. climate virtue Tennesseeâs lawsuit alleges BlackRockâs ESG pledges have "deprived consumers of the ability to make informed choices," citing CEO Larry Finkâs 2022 letter declaring ESG would "reshape finance." Yet internal documents reveal the firmâs continued investments in fossil fuels â $310 billion as of 2023 â while publicly pressuring companies to divest. Luke Lloyd, an investment strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners, bluntly summarized the contradiction: "ESG is driven by financial interests, not environmental concerns. Itâs a marketing ploy." The fallout isnât theoretical. Pension funds, reliant on steady returns, face heightened risk as ESG policies artificially depress energy stock values. As the International Energy Agency notes, global oil demand may still grow for decades â rendering BlackRockâs anti-fossil fuel posturing economically reckless. The ESG backlash: Red states fight green tyranny Conservative leaders are mobilizing against ESGâs encroachment. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis barred state pension funds from using ESG criteria, while Texas blacklisted 10 financial firms, including BlackRock, for "boycotting" fossil fuels. Blue states retaliated with a joint letter accusing critics of ignoring "climate threats," but the financial data tells another story: ESG funds underperformed the S&P 500 by 4% in 2023, per Morningstar. Even ESG insiders admit flaws. Tariq Fancy, BlackRockâs former sustainable investing chief, likened ESG to "wheatgrass for a cancer patient â a dangerous placebo." His indictment aligns with Vivek Ramaswamyâs crusade against corporate "wokeism," targeting firms like Disney for diversity audits he calls "political theater." From apartheid divestment to climate lockstep ESGâs roots trace to 1980s anti-apartheid divestment and a 2004 UN report urging "stakeholder capitalism." But todayâs iteration, fueled by climate panic and social justice campaigns, has ballooned into a $35 trillion industryâdespite lacking standardized metrics. The result? A system where ExxonMobil can rank higher on ESG indices than Tesla, sparking Elon Muskâs ire: "ESG is a scam." The high cost of virtue signaling As ESGâs contradictions mount, so does skepticism. The Tennessee lawsuit may be the tip of the iceberg, exposing how financial elites exploit ESG to advance political goals while jeopardizing retireesâ savings. BlackRock, State Street and Vanguardâcontrolling trillions in assetsânow act as de facto regulators, steering capital away from fossil fuels, defense and other "unfavored" industries, regardless of profitability. This artificial redirection distorts competition, inflates energy costs and weakens national securityâall while delivering negligible environmental benefits. For free-market advocates, the lesson is clear: When corporations trade profitability for progressive dogma, everyone loses â except the activists counting their fees. ESGâs opaque scoring systems, riddled with subjective criteria, empower a small cadre of unelected bureaucrats to dictate corporate behavior. Meanwhile, middle-class investors bear the brunt of underperforming "woke" funds, as returns take a backseat to political posturing. ESG isnât saving the planet â itâs reshaping it into a playground for unelected elites. From the EUâs heavy-handed sustainability mandates to the SECâs proposed climate disclosures, governments and asset managers collude to enforce ideological conformity. The result? A chilling effect on innovation, diminished shareholder value and a marketplace where success hinges not on merit, but on compliance with ever-shifting political whims.

Title: ‘It horrifies me, but I had actually developed a corporate strut’: Fintan Drury on Anglo, Paddy Power and Gaza
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/06/14/it-horrifies-me-but-when-i-looked-back-i-had-actually-developed-a-corporate-strut-fintan-drury-on-anglo-israel-and-paddy-power/
Time Published: 2025-06-14T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Fintan Drury was marching in support of Palestine with one of his daughters last year, feeling the same distrust he felt during his 1980s stint as a presenter of RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. “I just sort of thought, well, I don’t believe what we’re being fed. I just don’t believe it.” As Israel’s onslaught on Gaza intensified, his participation in marches became more regular, and so did the sense that he could do something else to counter the official line coming from Israel. He rejects as “patent nonsense” any perception that the conflict began with the Hamas attacks of October 7th, 2023. “I thought there was more I could do if I got up off my ass and used my curious mind and my journalistic training.” This was the catalyst for writing Catastrophe: Nakba II, his sober yet devastating account of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians over decades. He says the subject is too important not to actively promote the book and that means being “quizzed” by journalists, though he seems keen throughout our conversation to avoid coming across as egotistic – something that will not surprise readers of his 2021 memoir See-Saw, which dwells on the perils of ego. “Sorry, it sounds sort of pompous,” he apologises soon after explaining how he was counselled to exhume his reporting skills in 2016. That year Drury wrote a series of articles for The Irish Times from his time as a volunteer at a Syrian refugee camp in Athens. It came after a long spell in the higher echelons of Irish corporate life during which he was, on occasion, the story. Indeed, so much of his career was spent in business that when he identifies journalism as the thing he was “best at”, the self-criticism is implied. Catastrophe opens with a note acknowledging that most books on Palestine and Israel are by authors with more extensive experience of the Middle East. Many are by “absolutely brilliant minds”, he says, but can be academic and dense. His aim, when he began working on it “in a serious way” in April 2024, was to provide an accessible narrative “so even the people who are out marching and protesting and wearing their keffiyehs – the people who are instinctively pro-Palestine – can better understand why they’re protesting”. His research, which saw him travel to the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon last July, helped confirm his own “gut” feeling, though he didn’t know then how extreme the situation would become. “I didn’t honestly believe at that time that it could be as bad as it is now. And it was bad then. Really, really bad.” Israel’s aggression escalated while he was in the region, obliging him to call off one trip to southern Lebanon after a phone call with a contact in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil). He was advised that an elevated security threat meant it would no longer be able to dedicate a minder. “It’s a bit like swimming when you’re told not to, and the coastguard getting called out. You’re putting other people at risk. I’m a grandfather. I wasn’t trying to be a hero; that wasn’t my mission, so I didn’t go.” He has been heartened by the “very positive” public reaction. At the Listowel Literary Festival, interest in Catastrophe was such that his talk was moved to a bigger room, though when someone asked him about solutions, he said he wasn’t the right person to offer them. “It is multifaceted, and it will ebb and flow and change,” he says. “But the fundamental of the story is pretty clear to me and to a great many others who are there and studying it and observing it for decades. This is a genocide. All bets are off now. This is not right.” [ Britain and allies sanction two Israeli ministers as Gazan authorities say gunfire kills dozens at food aid siteOpens in new window ] Authors often have more than one reason for writing a particular book and in his case there were several. Apart from the conflict itself, and the time being right for him to embark upon the project, he sees parallels with Ireland’s colonisation that intersect with his own family story. Drury’s maternal grandfather Joseph Connolly was a leader of the Irish Volunteers in Belfast who was imprisoned by the British in 1916 and resumed his republican activities in the city after his release. When it became too dangerous to stay, he fled with his wife and young family to Dublin. Connolly, who went on to serve twice as a minister under Éamon de Valera, died when Drury was two, but he knew his grandmother well, he says. “My grandparents were displaced people. They were refugees from Belfast. Is that relevant? Absolutely, it’s relevant. Because it’s in your history. You understand that Catholics and nationalists who weren’t able to get out continued to suffer.” Catastrophe – the Nakba of the subtitle refers, in the first instance, to the mass displacement of Palestinians in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war – is dedicated to the memory of his Belfast-born mother Róisín Drury, née Connolly. Their discussions about how the plight of Jewish people was shamefully ignored in the 1930s and 1940s would sometimes end with her relief that modern communications meant nothing like the Holocaust could ever happen again. There will be no credible basis for anyone to claim they did not understand what Israel was doing in Gaza or that they “somehow missed it”, he writes. The book documents an “institutionalised bias” in the West towards Israel as the “upholder of Western values” in the Middle East, with Drury despairing at both “staggering” international inertia and “chilling” sponsorship of Israel’s campaign. He witnessed what he calls the “warped” US policy first hand when he reported for RTÉ on Ronald Reagan’s 1984 re-election and believes Democrats as well as Republicans have abandoned Palestinians. While Israel’s prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu found it easy to “play” the US in a presidential election year, he says the young mothers he met in Lebanon were livid that such a “warmonger”, as one described him, was permitted to address Congress. Ireland should be doing more, too, he concludes. “I think Ireland has done many things really well, I really do, but has Ireland done enough? Time will tell, but right now I don’t think so.” Drury (67) was born in Dublin and raised in Clonskeagh, then a “sleepy part of south Dublin”. He attended Blackrock College and later UCD – its relocation to Belfield was an early taste of the city’s encroachment on the fields of his youth. From 1981 to 1988 he was a newsman, joining RTÉ despite being told in a screen test that his head was “shaped like a shovel”. He reported from Belfast and overseas before becoming the co-presenter of Radio 1’s then fledgling Morning Ireland in 1985. But after just two-and-half years he grew restless and left broadcasting at age 29. It wasn’t his plan to go into business, yet that’s what he did, founding the public relations firm Drury Communications before selling it to its management a decade later to concentrate on his eponymous sports consultancy, which in 2004 rebranded as Platinum One. He became chairman of RTÉ in mid-2005 but resigned after six months when a perceived conflict of interest arose – over golf. The then government was flirting with adding the 2006 Ryder Cup, which was being held in Co Kildare, to its list of free-to-air television events, but Drury was an adviser to its organisers. Relinquishing the role was “the right thing”, he says. Does this all seem like a long time ago? “It was a long time ago,” he says, laughing. It was that exact Celtic Tiger era, I say. “Yeah.” These were hubristic times, as Drury outlines in See-Saw, which is laced with mea culpas about a “sense of impregnability” borne of live news presenting and his PR and sports management success. It underpinned decisions that led, he writes, “to a decade of stress that was degenerative of body and soul”. I had actually developed a corporate strut. When that becomes part of your way, you don’t lose the capacity or the facility to make good judgments, but that capacity is dimmed or diminished After Anglo Irish Bank supremo Seán FitzPatrick persuaded him to join the Anglo board, he served as non-executive director for six years until May 2008, leaving six months before the bank failed. FitzPatrick’s post-collapse recollection that Drury brought him and then taoiseach Brian Cowen together for a July 2008 meeting and round of golf did no one any favours, with Drury and Cowen, his friend, still being asked about it at an Oireachtas inquiry seven years later. (No banking was discussed that day, they said.) FitzPatrick’s distraction-creating move convinced Drury of FitzPatrick’s “utter selfishness”, he notes in the memoir. Cowen, meanwhile, remains a friend and was one of the early readers of Catastrophe. [ Fintan Drury: Brian Cowen put country first, party secondOpens in new window ] I ask him about his realisation that when FitzPatrick said he wanted board members who would “never be afraid” of expressing their opinion, he was flattering his ego. “Yeah, and men, in particular, we’re more susceptible to that,” he says. He mentions his use of the phrase “corporate strut”, which he suspects he acquired in those Anglo days. “It horrifies me, and it would have horrified me before – it wasn’t a conscious thing – but when I looked back on it, I had actually developed a corporate strut. When that becomes part of your way, you don’t lose the capacity or the facility to make good judgments, but that capacity is dimmed or diminished.” He also regrets that “the blinkers were on” during his tenure as Paddy Power chairman, when he says his old curiosity was subsumed by passive subscription to corporate Ireland, blinding him to the societal consequences of gambling. Efforts to regulate the industry are “nowhere near tough enough”, he says. “I was a good chairman in the sense that I helped the company grow. But I was horrified when I looked back, and I wished I’d never been chairman.” [ From the archive: Banking inquiry: Drury’s evidence was worth the waitOpens in new window ] The memoir, as well as his articles for The Irish Times and business publication The Currency, gave him a “certain level of confidence” that he could write, though he has been reluctant to call himself a journalist again. “There was a discussion with [Catastrophe publishers] Merrion Press about how to describe me on blurbs, and initially I was kind of resistant to that, because I think I have an old-fashioned sense of what a journalist does,” he says. (The blurb says he “returned to journalism” in 2016 but introduces him as “an author and opinion writer”.) The principles of his news years are deeply rooted, nonetheless. When he says he watches “really good interviewers” flail amid the “stonewalling, stonewalling, stonewalling” of Israel’s spokespeople, I ask if he thinks it is correct to invite them on air when this outcome can be anticipated. “I would have suffered the constraints of Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, and I don’t believe in censorship. I am strongly of the view that censorship of any description is not of value. So I think it is better to attempt to interview them, and every so often you might make a little breakthrough,” he says. “I think their own Sphinx-like intransigence, and same old weary lines, reinforces to most of the audience – which is more intelligent than we ever give them credit for – that that’s what it is.” Sport being the other through line of his life – he played soccer for UCD – Drury is now chairman of not-for-profit Sport Against Racism Ireland. “The work of any NGO, trying to get funds, is hard,” he says, adding that he would like to see the Government “crack the whip” so the private sector does more. “A lot of private-sector companies benefiting from migration aren’t investing any money at all in supporting initiatives that make migrants feel part of our community, feel cared for, feel respected, and that’s a real shame. I would much rather you include that than any bolloxology about Fintan Drury.” Catastrophe: Nakba II by Fintan Drury is published by Merrion Press Laura Slattery is an Irish Times journalist writing about media, advertising and other business topics © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Flying taxi developer Archer Aviation raises another $850M in funding

UPDATED 15:31 EDT / JUNE 13 2025 by Maria Deutscher Archer Aviation Inc. has raised $850 million in funding to support the rollout of its flying taxis. The NYSE-listed company announced the deal on Thursday. The transaction was structured as a direct offering in which Archer sold 85 million shares for $10 apiece. In today’s trading session, its stock price dropped about 14% to exactly $10. The deal marks Archer’s third nine-figure capital raise in under a year. It secured $300 million in February from a consortium that included Blackrock and closed a $430 million investment three months earlier. Following this week’s cash infusion, Archer’s total pro forma liquidity stands at about $2 billion. “We now have the strongest balance sheet in the sector and the resources we need to execute both here in the U.S. and abroad,” said Archer founder and Chief Executive Officer Adam Goldstein. Santa Clara, California-based Archer is developing a flying taxi called Midnight that takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane. According to the company, it can take four passengers on up to 100-mile trips with a top speed of 150 miles per hour. Midnight lands and takes off from specialized landing pads called vertiports. The aircraft is powered by 12 electric rotors that can adjust their angle mid-flight to reduce drag. Archer says that they’re 100 times quieter than a helicopter, which makes Midnight suitable for use in urban areas. The rotors draw power from six onboard battery packs optimized for quick charging, which reduces downtime between flights. Midnight completed its first piloted test flight in late May. According to Archer, the aircraft reached altitudes of more than 1,500 feet. The successful test may have simplified the company’s latest capital raise by boosting investor confidence in its development roadmap. Archer will use the funds to develop an “AI-based aviation software platform.” In parallel, it plans to build the infrastructure necessary to support flying taxi networks based on Midnight. The company has inked deal to establish such networks in the U.S., United Arab Emirates, India and South Korea. Last year, Archer won a contract to provide air taxi services for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Midnight aircraft will ferry spectators and staff between sports venues in the city. The company has also teamed up with United Airlines to launch multiple flying taxi routes in the U.S. One of those routers will ferry passengers from Manhattan to the Newark Liberty International Airport. As part of the deal, United has pre-ordered hundreds of Midnight flying taxis worth about $1.5 billion.

UPDATED 15:31 EDT / JUNE 13 2025 by Maria Deutscher Archer Aviation Inc. has raised $850 million in funding to support the rollout of its flying taxis. The NYSE-listed company announced the deal on Thursday. The transaction was structured as a direct offering in which Archer sold 85 million shares for $10 apiece. In today’s trading session, its stock price dropped about 14% to exactly $10. The deal marks Archer’s third nine-figure capital raise in under a year. It secured $300 million in February from a consortium that included Blackrock and closed a $430 million investment three months earlier. Following this week’s cash infusion, Archer’s total pro forma liquidity stands at about $2 billion. “We now have the strongest balance sheet in the sector and the resources we need to execute both here in the U.S. and abroad,” said Archer founder and Chief Executive Officer Adam Goldstein. Santa Clara, California-based Archer is developing a flying taxi called Midnight that takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane. According to the company, it can take four passengers on up to 100-mile trips with a top speed of 150 miles per hour. Midnight lands and takes off from specialized landing pads called vertiports. The aircraft is powered by 12 electric rotors that can adjust their angle midflight to reduce drag. Archer says they’re 100 times quieter than a helicopter, which makes Midnight suitable for use in urban areas. The rotors draw power from six onboard battery packs optimized for quick charging, which reduces downtime between flights. Midnight completed its first piloted test flight in late May. According to Archer, the aircraft reached altitudes of more than 1,500 feet. The successful test may have simplified the company’s latest capital raise by boosting investor confidence in its development roadmap. Archer will use the funds to develop an “AI-based aviation software platform.” In parallel, it plans to build the infrastructure necessary to support flying taxi networks based on Midnight. The company has inked deal to establish such networks in the U.S., United Arab Emirates, India and South Korea. Last year, Archer won a contract to provide air taxi services for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Midnight aircraft will ferry spectators and staff between sports venues in the city. The company has also teamed up with United Airlines to launch multiple flying taxi routes in the U.S. One of those routers will ferry passengers from Manhattan to the Newark Liberty International Airport. As part of the deal, United has pre-ordered hundreds of Midnight flying taxis worth about $1.5 billion.

Title: China-backed firms in talks to join stalled $19B Panama ports deal: report

Several China state-backed firms – including the country’s largest shipping company – are reportedly in talks to join a stalled $19 billion deal for 43 global ports, including two along the Panama Canal. China’s Cosco Shipping Corp. has held discussions about partnering with a global consortium headed by Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd., as well as US asset manager BlackRock and its Global Infrastructure Partners unit, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The move comes after Beijing’s fierce opposition has jeopardized a deal that would hand over control of the ports owned by Hong Kong business magnate Li Ka-Shing to TiL and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager led by Larry Fink. President Trump had touted the sale of the ports as a national security win after demanding the US “take back” the Panama Canal and eliminate Chinese influence over the critical shipping lane. The inclusion of Cosco and other China state-backed companies emerged as a way to nudge the deal forward after intense trade talks between US officials and their Beijing counterparts over tariffs in Switzerland last month, sources told Bloomberg. The consortium is staring down a deadline in late July after a 145-day period for talks on the ports deal expires, and have already missed an initial goal of signing an agreement by early April. Aponte’s family-run business – Mediterranean Shipping Company, which owns TiL – has emerged as the lead investor, though BlackRock is notably expected to take over the two Panama ports included in the sale. The deal is expected to crown Aponte’s MSC as the world’s largest terminal operator after acquiring the ports from Li’s CK Hutchison Holdings. China has steadfastly opposed the deal over concerns it could hinder its global trade and shipping operations. Talks are ongoing and terms of the deal have not been finalized, sources told Bloomberg. BlackRock declined to comment. Cosco Shipping and TiL did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The White House and CK Hutchinson did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. The canal, which was finished by US engineers, was handed back to Panama between 1977 and 1999 under a Jimmy Carter-era treaty establishing permanent neutrality. The head of the operator of the Panama Canal has warned that the deal could threaten its commitment to neutrality. “There is a potential risk of capacity concentration if the deal comes the way it is structured as we understand right now,” Ricaurte Vasquez Morales, administrator of the Panama Canal, told the Financial Times in an interview published this week. “If there is a significant level of concentration on terminal operators belonging to an integrated or one single shipping company, it will be at the expense of Panama’s competitiveness in the market and inconsistent with neutrality.” Advertisement

Title: New code strings attached to Xbox Game Pass suggests a price increase may be imminent

Time Published: 2025-06-13T17:35:54Z
Full Content:
Death, taxes, and subscription service price increases. The three horsemen of inevitability. A new code string suggests Xbox Game Pass is next. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft recently raised the price of Xbox game consoles. Then it raised the price of games to $80. Next on the list might be Xbox Game Pass. Over the past year, Microsoft and other companies have been gradually increasing the price of their products and services, blaming things like Trump's tarriff war, sticky inflation, and consumer confidence. Whatever the reason, shareholders don't seem to be too bothered, with megacorps like JP Morgan, Blackrock, and Vanguard set to earn millions via Microsoft's dividend pay outs this quarter. But hey, hedge funds could always use some more, right? After raising the price of Xbox consoles and, now, controversially, Xbox games to $80, Microsoft may also be on the cusp of raising the price of Xbox Game Pass too. @RedPhx who who builds the rather amazing Better xCloud Xbox Cloud Gaming enhancement project noticed that Xbox Cloud Gaming recently added a new notification type, dubbed "SubscriptionPriceIncrease" over the past few days. Fun. A new notification type called "SubscriptionPriceIncrease" has been added to the xCloud website pic.twitter.com/iH29k1x3VxJune 13, 2025 The strings pertain to pop-ups that Xbox Cloud Gaming serves to players who enable notifications on the Xbox.com/play web app. Most of them are innocuous enough, like reporting on rewards earned, achievement unlocks, friends coming online, and so on. But this latest one specific to subscription price increases is new. It's not a stretch to think that an Xbox Game Pass price increase is imminent, given the fact Microsoft decided now would be a good time to necessitate such a notification type. Either way, I don't think anyone is expecting Game Pass to stick to its current price. Netflix, Disney+, and other subscriptions are constantly increasing, or gunning for enshittification tactics like Amazon Prime, which now seemingly has more ads than simply watching TV. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Xbox Cloud Gaming currently costs $19.99 per month as part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate bundle, and provides access to hundreds of games playable via Microsoft's servers. It's still the best subscription deal in gaming overall, and Xbox Cloud Gaming is a decent service on top. However, its latency and resolution is sub par compared to NVIDIA GeForce Now, whose purpose-built PC gaming cloud servers are simply better at delivering gaming streams than Microsoft's. At least for now. Still, it has improved a lot over the years, but not to the point where Microsoft is confident enough to remove its (Beta) tag, which has been bundled with its title since its formal public launch years ago. Our sources have indicated to us that Microsoft is working on the next generation of Xbox cloud servers, which are in testing at Redmond HQ as we speak. These new servers will be part of Microsoft's next-gen hardware offering, alongside devices like the Xbox Ally and Xbox Series X successor. The new Xbox Cloud Gaming servers should deliver lower lag, improved bitrates, and higher resolution options. We've also heard that Microsoft is exploring a cloud-only subscription, which would free it up from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. An increasing number of users in certain markets are becoming cloud-only. If Microsoft was interested in building Xbox Cloud subscriptions on a tiered basis like NVIDIA GeForce Now, it stands to reason that you might have to pay a bit more to get access to higher resolution feeds. Either way, it probably won't be long until we find out if Xbox Game Pass is indeed going up in price, following on from last year's price increase. You can stack Xbox Game Pass subscription cards for up to two years to combat price increases, if you intend to stay subscribed. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate | $19.99Xbox Game Pass provides access to hundreds of games, natively on Xbox consoles and PC, but also via Xbox Cloud Gaming on the web. All of Microsoft's upcoming games including Call of Duty Black Ops 7 and The Outer Worlds 2 go live day and date into the service.

Title: Invesco, Galaxy Digital file to launch Solana ETF in Delaware amid SEC approval buzz

Share this article Invesco and Galaxy Asset Management, the fund management arm of Galaxy Digital, have filed to register a trust in Delaware for a proposed Solana ETF, a key early step toward launching the fund. The filing suggests that a formal SEC application may be imminent. Once Invesco and Galaxy Asset Management submit a formal application to the SEC, the firms will officially join the growing list of asset managers seeking to launch a spot Solana ETF in the US. To date, that list includes Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, 21Shares, Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity. In effect, nearly every fund manager that offers US-listed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs is now pursuing a Solana-based counterpart, except BlackRock. The latest move by Invesco and Galaxy comes amid growing optimism around potential SEC approval of spot Solana ETFs. Momentum picked up this week following reports that the SEC had engaged directly with ETF issuers, instructing them to submit revised S-1 registration statements. The requested revisions suggest possible fast-tracking of the approval process, which some sources believe could conclude within three to five weeks. The SEC has also reportedly signaled its openness to staking within the ETF structure. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate a 90% chance of approval for Solana and Litecoin ETFs this year, placing them at the top of their list. XRP ETFs follow closely with approval odds of roughly 85%. I wrote about this topic a bit today as well.

Title: Bitcoin At $1 Million? CEO Says It’s The Price To Beat Gold

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to CNBC’s Power Lunch, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz thinks Bitcoin could climb all the way to $1 million per coin if big institutions keep piling in. The cryptocurrency hit a weekly peak of $110,290 on Tuesday. It slipped 4.5% to $104,300 by Thursday, but it’s still climbed 1.75% over the past seven days. Novogratz says this isn’t just hype. He points to firms moving cash from dollars and gold into crypto. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) went live in January 2024 after SEC approval. Based on reports, that fund now gives big investors a straightforward path to own Bitcoin without buying coins directly. BlackRock manages about $11.6 trillion in assets. When a player that size steps in, others notice. Novogratz says wealth managers and pension funds have started treating Bitcoin like a macro asset, on par with gold and the S&P 500. Treasury companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds have begun to follow suit. Retail investors keep buying, too, thanks to easier trading apps and ETFs like IBIT. A handful of public companies have raised millions to buy Bitcoin outright. According to filings, Metaplanet, the Blockchain Group, GameStop, and US President Donald Trump’s Media arm all announced major purchases this year. Their moves chip away at the 21 million-coin supply, making each remaining Bitcoin scarcer. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is hard-wired into its code. Gold, by comparison, has a market worth north of $12 trillion and sees about 1–2% new supply each year through mining. Novogratz argues that younger investors will choose a capped digital asset over a metal bar. That switch isn’t guaranteed, but once people see Bitcoin as a store of value, its appeal could grow. At today’s $2 trillion market cap, Bitcoin has room to expand many times over if it ever rivals gold. Regulators remain a wildcard. The SEC green-lit IBIT, but future rules on taxes or derivatives could slow things down. Bitcoin’s price swings make it riskier than bonds or gold. Institutions often chase stable returns, and Bitcoin pays no dividends or interest. Finally, moving another $10 trillion into crypto would need a massive shift in asset allocations. That kind of inflow isn’t impossible, but it won’t happen overnight. Based on reports, Novogratz sees Bitcoin’s march toward gold’s market cap as a “ball rolling down a hill.” He predicts that, over time, Bitcoin will match gold and then outpace it.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Gold, long considered a safe haven, beckoned investors seeking safety from the escalating Middle East conflict. Bitcoin, often touted as digital gold, instead joined the exodus of risk assets. "The traditional buyers of gold are not in the crypto market yet,” Stephen Wundke, director of strategy and revenue at quantitative digital asset investment firm Algoz, told Decrypt. He added that gold buyers are “risk-off investors who will return to the safe haven that is gold, as they see it, whenever there is potential conflict." Though gold is up over 2% on the day, Wundke thinks this is "hardly a rush to cover," adding that Bitcoin, for one, had been falling "well before there was any news of the strike on Iran." Data from CoinGecko show that the price of Bitcoin plunged 3.6% to $103,900 Friday morning as initial reports that Israel launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities came in. At the same time, gold leapt to $3,427.90 per ounce, showing how the two assets diverge during a geopolitical crisis. It is up 7% in the past month and more than 46% year-to-date, data from Trading Economics indicate. "Bitcoin is sometimes seen as a safe haven, but in reality, it often moves in line with tech stocks rather than gold," Jay Jo, senior research analyst at Tiger Research, told Decrypt. "Because of this coupling, Bitcoin and gold can show opposite price trends during geopolitical crises." While the smoke hasn't settled, altcoins including Ethereum, XRP, and Solana tapped over $1 billion in liquidations, most of which are in long positions. Meanwhile, traditional safe havens, including gold, the U.S. dollar, and government bonds, attracted flight-to-safety flows as investors dumped risk assets. "Fundamentals are more at play with BTC than problems in the Middle East, at the moment," Wundke noted, adding that June is "traditionally a quiet month for BTC" and that the market appears to be "in a consolidation phase." Still, Wundke argued that if "any significant escalation in the Middle East" occurs, it might affect Bitcoin and send it breaking below $100,000. Sentiment has slipped over the past day; although the Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently sits at 61, indicating greed, it's down 10 points on the day—and over 81% of predictors on Myriad expect it to hold below 64 through the end of the week. (Disclaimer: decentralized on-chain prediction market Myriad was launched by Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN) Bitcoin's younger, more leverage-prone investor base might have contributed to the selloff intensity, with some noting that a shift is underway. "The bull case becomes [that] over time, young people care about it more than old people," Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz claimed in a CNBC interview Friday. Gold "slowly gets replaced by Bitcoin" as the alpha crypto has increasingly become an institutionalized "macro asset," he added. Citing weighted demand from financial institutions such as BlackRock, Novogratz said that interest in Bitcoin as a macro-asset could be likened to "a ball rolling downhill."

Title: Bitcoin To Replace Gold As Store Of Value And Hit $1 Million, Predicts Mike Novogratz

Former Goldman Sachs partner and Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz remains one of the most prominent Bitcoin bulls in finance. Novogratz has now joined the $1 million per Bitcoin (BTC) bandwagon, suggesting that the OG cryptocurrency could 10X and break that milestone if it continues to grow in popularity and surpass gold. Appearing on CNBC’s Power Lunch on Thursday, Mike Novogratz said he foresees a seven-figure moonshot for the premier cryptocurrency. Novogratz’s main rationale for anticipating Bitcoin’s potential 1,000% growth is based on the crypto’s increasing institutional adoption as a macro asset. “Now we’ve got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we’ve got sovereign wealth buying Bitcoin, we’ve got retail investors buying Bitcoin, there’s easier ways to get it,” he quipped. “So the adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset, as an asset to save money in, I think that’s now a ball rolling down hill.” BlackRock is perhaps the most notable example of institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset. The $11 trillion asset manager’s spot BTC exchange-traded fund has amassed approximately 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply for its clients since going live in January 2024. The iShares Bitcoin Trust currently holds more than $70 billion in assets under management. Novogratz further suggested that the increasing adoption will ensure Bitcoin catches up with gold. According to the pundit, younger investors would buy Bitcoin over gold, with the supply-capped digital asset replacing the yellow metal over time: “If you look at gold’s market cap and Bitcoin’s market cap, Bitcoin has a long way to go, 10x, and so that’s [$1 million] Bitcoin just to be where gold is.” Novogratz is not the first Bitcoin bull to predict that Bitcoin will appreciate significantly in value over the long term. In April, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest raised its bull-case Bitcoin price projection to $2.4 million by 2030, up from a previous projection of $1.5 million. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said last month that BTC could break $1 million by 2028, thanks to strong tailwinds including a likely outflow of foreign investment and devaluation of the huge stock of the US Treasury. Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has also, on multiple occasions, shared his thoughts on how high he thinks the price of Bitcoin could rocket to.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. From their Manhattan headquarters on Thursday, top BlackRock leaders—including Chief Executive Larry Fink, who had just flown back to New York after a trip to the Middle East—lined up to discuss their business with investors and analysts over five hours of presentations. The goal: to show why they think BlackRock is a stock worth owning. They were gathered for the company’s investor day, complete with 147 slides packed with fresh five-year financial targets for fund-raising, revenue, and more. The firm’s last investor day was in 2023. BlackRock has ambitious goals. Over the next five years, the company aims to roughly double its operating income to $15 billion, double its market capitalization to $280 billion, and increase revenue, which in 2024 totaled $20 billion, by 75% to $35 billion. It’s targeting organic base fee growth of at least 5%, and an operating margin of at least 45%, “through the market cycle." Private markets will be a big part of BlackRock’s growth. The world’s largest money manager, with $11.6 trillion of assets, is now targeting $400 billion of private markets fund-raising by 2030 as it aims for technology and private markets businesses to contribute at least 30% of overall revenue by that year. That’s up from a 15% slice in 2024. “Bold, but doable ambitions," said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr. BlackRock’s fresh targets sets new stakes for the performance expected from the $28 billion of private markets acquisitions it’s carried out in the past year. They paint a picture of an asset manager betting its future on private markets after making its name in the public markets with fixed income and exchange-traded funds. “We’re not reliant on any one strategy or asset class," said Martin Small, BlackRock’s chief financial officer and head of corporate strategy, in prepared remarks. “All of our businesses have delivered organic base fee growth over the last five years. That said, the BlackRock of the next five years, to 2030, is different than the past." Trading at 24 times earnings, investors assign BlackRock’s stock a lower multiple than shares of pure private markets players Blackstone and KKR, which trade at 42 times and 54 times earnings, respectively. Investors could start to view BlackRock’s stock as a play for exposure to assets such as private credit and infrastructure, not just its best-known products in the public markets like exchange-traded funds. “Are we in direct competition with Blackstone? I would say, in their two core businesses, no. But in other areas of private [assets], where we have deemed we have an incredible opportunity, [yes]," Fink said in an interview with Barron’s in March. He added at the time: “I have no intention of going into private equity" with any large-scale acquisition. “I have no intention of being huge in real estate." For now, investors seemed underwhelmed by what they heard Thursday. Shares of BlackRock fell 0.4% while the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. That slide is typical of the firm’s investor days. In 2018, 2021, and 2023—the past three such events held by the firm—the stock fell 1.1%, 0.4%, and 0.5% before recovering those losses the following session, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Title: This AI platform is drastically changing how major financial firms do business: ‘Like having a really capable intern’

George Sivulka — the 27-year-old founder and CEO of AI platform Hebbia — is supplying artificial intelligence to those with more information than time, and millions, if not billions, on the line. Since starting the company in 2020, his client list has grown to include BlackRock, KKR, the U.S. Air Force, Centerview Partners, MetLife, Gunderson Dettmer, Oak Hill and TowerBrook, among others. “The CEOs that get to the [top of these firms] know that innovation could either [elevate] their companies to even bigger levels or completely disrupt their market position,” Sivulka told NYNext. “And so, we’re partnering at the board level for massive transformational projects … really help[ing] them think through how they’re going to [embrace] change.” While popular AI applications such as ChatGPT are largely transactional — a user issues a prompt, the model responds and then the conversation ends — Hebbia’s models are tailor-made, persistent, process-oriented and evolve through repeated use. Agents — autonomous AI programs trained to mirror how a firm works — can execute customized workflows, asynchronously, non-stop. An analyst at a private equity firm could instruct their agent to analyze a target company’s filings, build comps, generate a valuation model in Excel and prepare a draft investor memo — all within a single query loop. But the analyst isn’t being replaced, they’re being freed up from repetitive work so they can “focus on more interesting, investigative or curious tasks,” Sivulka told NYNext. “It’s almost like having a really capable intern.” Sivulka initially planned to pursue a career in academia, not business. He spent nearly a decade at Stanford, earning his undergraduate and master’s degrees before enrolling in a fully funded PhD program. Over the years, he saw innumerable peers leave for white-collar jobs and come back disillusioned. They had secured high-paying, high-powered gigs, yet they spent their days copying data into slides or skimming dense filings for small insights. “Some of the smartest people in the world were doing some of the stupidest tasks,” Sivulka said. So he dropped out, moved into a closet in East Palo Alto, and started working on what would become Hebbia. Each morning he would wake up, code for 16 hours and cold-call prospective clients. This was back before the world had heard of ChatGPT, when AI was still a murky and misunderstood term. Most investors didn’t bite at his ideas for intelligence tools, but eventually, a few did: Peter Thiel, Mike Volpi at Index, and later, Andreessen Horowitz growth partner Alex Immerman. Sivulka ultimately decided to base Hebbia in New York City’s SoHo neighborhood to get away from the pervasive “groupthink” of the Bay Area. He relishes being near to those he and his growing team are making tools for. “We’re in New York [because] there’s nothing like actually being able to understand user pain, to be on the floor with our customers,” he said. Just as Zoom made offices location-agnostic, Sivulka thinks AI will make companies compositionally agnostic. The new normal won’t just be in-person or remote, “You’ll have hybrid teams of AI agents and humans.” This story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC’s power players (and those who aspire to be). He notes that in recent decades, despite software services and cloud platforms, productivity per employee hasn’t changed much. He believes AI has the power to finally move the needle, dramatically changing how companies work. “AI is actually delivering hours and hours of time savings,” he said. “We’re seeing tangible results.” Send NYNext a tip: nynextlydia@nypost.com Advertisement

Title: Private equity wants in on your 401(k). What you need to know before investing | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/business/private-equity-401k-investing-explained
Time Published: 2025-06-13T09:30:03Z
Full Content:
Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Chances are very good that your 401(k) does not currently offer you access to private equity investments, which, as the name implies, are investments in companies that are not publicly traded. The question is, will that change in the next few years? And, if it does, is it worth it for you to invest? Large company pension plans and university endowments — both of which have very long time horizons — have invested for years in private equity and private debt funds. But 401(k)s typically haven’t offered those options to plan participants. In November 2024, only 2.4% of 401(k) sponsors said they added a private equity investment option to their plan, according to a weekly poll question from the Plan Sponsor Council of America. That may be because employers are afraid of potential lawsuits if they include those options, which typically charge investors more than investment funds in public companies. And under the Employment Retirement Security Act (ERISA), employers have a fiduciary duty to ensure that investment options in your 401(k) are prudent and have reasonable fees, said Jerry Schlichter, founding partner of Schlichter Bogard, who pioneered lawsuits against plan sponsors for charging excess 401(k) fees. It also may be because private assets are riskier to invest in and information about them is opaque, since they’re private. So there is less of a requirement to be transparent with investors about how a fund is doing on a regular basis. In addition, private capital options are considered illiquid investments because you can’t take your money out whenever you want. And that may prove too constraining for retirement plan participants, who may need access to their 401(k) money for any number of reasons — including changing or losing a job, Schlichter said. There has been an increasing push to provide more private capital investment opportunities for retail investors and participants in workplace retirement plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s. On the regulatory front, according to Jaret Seiberg, a financial services policy analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, the Trump administration is likely to make it easier to access so-called alternative investments, which include private equity, private real estate and hedge funds. That could result in an executive order from the president requiring government agencies to expand access to such investments as well as rulemaking or guidance from the Department of Labor — which enforces ERISA — “to expand the ability of individuals to invest in 401(k) and IRA accounts in alternative investments,” Seiberg said in a daily research note. There are far fewer public companies today than there were 30 years ago, as more companies remain private. For that reason, some say, if investors want to own the whole market and have a truly diversified portfolio, where some asset classes move up when others move down, they should have access both to public and private companies. In a recent conversation with Morningstar, BlackRock chief operating officer Robert Goldstein noted that the performances of publicly traded stocks and bonds have become more correlated than they used to be, and “many of the less correlated assets are only accessible through the private markets.” That may be. Or not. For average retail investors, it could be hard to tell because there currently isn’t a centralized way to track the performance and underlying investments of private capital funds and directly compare them to that of the stock and bond funds and indexes they’re used to. That’s just one reason why other market watchers and investor advocates worry about expanding access to private capital for average retirement savers. Among those squarely in the camp of those who say employee and retiree nest eggs won’t be helped — and could be harmed — by having exposure to private capital is Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, a nonprofit seeking to promote the public interest in financial markets. “Why is there a push to open up the private markets to 401(k)s now? It’s not because workers want less liquid and harder-to-value assets in their 401(k)s. And it’s not motivated by plan sponsors, who have long worried that exposing 401(k) plan participants to private market assets would violate their fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the investors,” Schiffrin said in a statement. “It’s because private market firms are finding it harder now to raise money. Their traditional sources of funding — institutional investors such as pensions and endowments — have evaporated.” Indeed, for plan sponsors, including private equity among their plan’s investment options will require a lot more due diligence from them in terms of investigating the underlying investments in a given fund and examining the fee structure, Schlichter said. “This is fraught with danger. A company that puts private equity in its 401(k) is undertaking a serious risk of breaching its fiduciary duty.” Credit ratings agency Moody’s this week put out an analysis, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which cautioned that the accelerated push to give private capital firms access to the multitrillion-dollar retirement investment industry holds risk for everyone. “Competition for retail investor capital within private markets will intensify as alternative asset managers roll out new partnerships and special funds to address this potentially vast, still largely untapped market,” the analysts wrote. “But rapid growth within this still relatively opaque market also carries systemic implications.” One example, they cited, is the potential for a liquidity crisis. “Unlike institutional investors, retail investors expect ready access to their cash. To help, managers are launching products with periodic windows of liquidity. But in volatile markets, retail investors may run for the exits, which would exacerbate liquidity needs and the risk of potential mismatches between a product’s available liquidity and what investors are expecting.” The promise of investing in private equity is that the additional expense and risk assumed by investors can be rewarded with potentially strong returns over time. While it’s hard to easily and quickly track private equity performance on your own, there have been academic and industry studies on it, and the results have been mixed, said Jason Kephart, senior principal for multi-asset strategy ratings at Morningstar. So, while you will likely pay more and have less transparency into what you’re investing in, having a stake in private capital is no guarantee that you will enjoy meaningfully better returns in your portfolio. As for the diversification argument, Kephart said, it’s worth remembering that just as with public companies, private companies’ performance will be affected by external forces such as economic downturns, interest rates, geopolitical concerns, tariffs and supply chain issues. “Being private doesn’t shield you from the world,” he noted. And, Kephart added, “It’s not like the public markets are broken. Public stocks and bonds have paid off pretty well for those who’ve stayed invested.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Business FILE PHOTO: Midnight, an all-electric aircraft from company Archer Aviation, is seen at the Salinas Municipal Airport in Salinas, California, U.S. August 2, 2023. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo Air taxi maker Archer Aviation on Thursday said it raised $850 million in funding following executive orders signed by U.S. President Donald Trump to boost electric air taxis. Trump's orders also focused on bolstering U.S. defenses against hostile drones, and supporting the development of supersonic commercial aircraft. Earlier this year, Archer secured $300 million in a funding round led by institutional investors, including accounts managed by BlackRock . In April, Archer unveiled plans to establish an air taxi network in New York City in partnership with United Airlines. The company has also been named the official air taxi service for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

The fund also register another monthly dividend record, distributing over $10 million in May. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) expanded by about $1 billion between March 26 and June 11, representing roughly half of the $2 billion growth of the tokenized US treasuries market in the period. According to rwa.xyz data, BUIDL’s size is $2.89 billion as of June 11. It is the largest tokenized money fund, representing 40% of the $7.34 billion market. The March 26 benchmark is significant because it’s when Ethena Labs stopped adding the fund shares to back its USDtb stablecoin. USDtb drove most of BUIDL’s growth in 2025, channeling 90% of its reserves into the fund, totaling $1.3 billion. Consequently, the significant 35% growth in less than three months without Ethena’s boost suggests continuing demand for regulated, high-yield cash instruments on public blockchains. Furthermore, the fund has grown by nearly three times since it reached $1 billion on March 13, achieving this milestone in just over a year. However, it took less than 90 days to triple the amount, suggesting a spike in interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, especially tokenized US treasuries. According to rwa.xyz’s overview, the RWA market grew by nearly $5 billion between March 13 and June 11. The tokenized US treasuries market represented almost half of the global RWA market growth. As shared on June 12 by ETF Store CEO Nate Geraci, BlackRock recently published its effort to bridge the traditional capital markets “with the developing digital assets ecosystem,” currently focusing on tokenized funds. Alongside asset growth, BUIDL’s income distributions continued to set new highs. The fund paid $4.17 million in March, pushing cumulative payouts above $25 million. April dividends rose to about $7.9 million, lifting lifetime payments past $33 million, according to issuer posts. May distributions exceeded $10 million, bringing total dividends to more than $43 million since inception. This represented the third consecutive monthly record.

Title: BlackRock Aims for $400B in Private Market Fundraising by 2030

BlackRock Inc. wants to achieve $400 billion in cumulative fundraising between 2025 and 2030, according to an investor day presentation released Thursday. The $10 trillion asset manager’s vision includes expanding its alternative investment offerings to insurers and wealth managers, leveraging its recent manager acquisitions and technology offerings. The firm recently acquired infrastructure investor Global Infrastructure Partners ($170 billion assets under management) and expects to close its acquisition of private credit manager HPS Investment Partners ($157 billion AUM) in the third quarter. HPS and BlackRock reported that together, as of the first quarter, they had $14 billion in fee-paying credit AUM in existing wealth management channels, a figure they hope to grow to at least $60 billion by 2030 by expanding into European direct lending, private asset-based income products and offering private credit investments across wealth management channels. BlackRock, through its acquisition of GIP, has become the world’s largest infrastructure manager, and it sees private capital bridging the infrastructure funding gap. According to BlackRock, the world needs $94 trillion in infrastructure funding by 2040, of which a $15 trillion gap exists between the current pace of investment and what will be needed.

Revenue derived from private markets and technology is expected to double as a percentage of BlackRock’s income. In 2024, private markets and technology accounted for 15% of the firm’s $20 billion in revenue. In 2030, BlackRock wants these businesses to account for 30% of total revenue.

Title: Polygon unveils ‘Gigagas’ roadmap to reach 100,000 TPS

The Gigagas roadmap positions Polygon for high-throughput financial applications with planned scalability and instant finality. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Polygon has laid out an ambitious scaling roadmap to reach 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), beginning with a July upgrade that will bring the network to 1,000 TPS. The roadmap comes a day after Polygon announced a governance revamp and shift in focus to Agglayer. Dubbed the “Gigagas” roadmap, the initiative is focused on making Polygon the go-to blockchain for real-world financial applications. It culminates in a long-term plan to power global-scale payments and tokenized assets. The July Bhilai Upgrade will introduce 1,000+ TPS throughput, reduce transaction finality to ~5 seconds, and stabilize gas fees under $0.001 per transaction without increasing validator requirements. In a separate development, the network’s native token POL became available on Solana (SOL) via Wormhole Bridge on June 12. By the end of this year, Polygon expects to scale past 5,000 TPS using a new Validator-Elected Block Producer (VEBloP) model that streamlines block production with stateless validation and a single leader architecture. This approach removes the risk of chain reorganizations by guaranteeing one-block finality, a key requirement for institutions and financial applications demanding predictable execution. Polygon said that the 5,000 TPS benchmark has already been achieved in a devnet environment, with technical proposals (PIP-64 and others) outlining the pathway to mainnet rollout. Alongside this upgrade, Polygon will also integrate with Agglayer, a multichain interoperability layer powered by POL staking that allows seamless liquidity movement across chains. In 2026 and beyond, Polygon’s goal is to exceed 100,000 TPS through continued optimization of its validator network and deeper integration with Agglayer. It will also focus on scaling for high-volume use cases like retail payments, AI-driven microtransactions, and tokenized financial markets. The network aims to match the reliability and speed of traditional payment systems while preserving decentralization. Polygon already ranks among the top chains in stablecoin and RWA activity, with over $134 billion in stablecoin transfer volume in April and hundreds of millions in institutional RWAs deployed by firms like Apollo and BlackRock. However, the Polygon team said the chain needs to scale “an order of magnitude higher” to support trillions in on-chain value. The Gigagas roadmap signals a shift from theoretical scaling to real-world execution and positions Polygon as a high-throughput infrastructure layer for the next wave of blockchain adoption.

Title: Strategy, GameStop Lead $50 Billion Institutional Surge Into Bitcoin as Treasury Asset

Highlights Bitcoin has evolved from a niche asset to a mainstream institutional-grade investment, with Fortune 500 companies, like Strategy and GameStop among others, allocating billions to bitcoin holdings, transforming corporate treasuries into crypto-forward financial operations. Companies are leveraging complex financial instruments (e.g., convertible notes, structured products, bitcoin-backed loans) to gain crypto exposure, potentially blurring the line between financial innovation and speculative risk. The role of corporate treasurers is expanding beyond traditional finance to include crypto expertise, risk governance, and digital asset strategy, prompting a critical reevaluation of bitcoin's place on balance sheets — as a hedge, speculative asset, or branding signal — based on a company’s unique financial profile. In the early days of bitcoin, it was hard to imagine Fortune 500 treasury teams doing anything more than monitoring its unpredictable price swings out of casual interest.

Δ But 15 years and several bull-bear cycles later, the cryptocurrency is no longer just the domain of technologists and retail investors. It’s evolving into an institutional-grade asset. Not just in theory, but in practice. Fortune 500 blockchain adoption has allegedly now hit 60% with institutions injecting as much as $50 billion into crypto funds in Q1. Leading the pack is the one-time software company Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has compiled a war chest of 580,000 bitcoin, worth about $63 billion, since the middle of 2020, with its latest purchase coming within the past two weeks. Strategy has transformed itself into a bitcoin treasury company and is now primarily in the business of selling securities to raise money to buy the cryptocurrency. Far from being viewed as a black sheep, the company’s “bitcoin treasury” approach has spurred a wave of publicly traded copycats. GameStop, for example, on Wednesday (June 11) announced it was issuing $1.75 billion in convertible notes to buy bitcoin. This followed an earlier Q1 acquisition of 4,710 BTC (about $513 million), which made GameStop the 13th‑largest corporate holder. Elsewhere, The Blockchain Group, which describes itself as Europe’s first bitcoin treasury company, on Monday (June 9) announced a $300 million issuance for, you guessed it, the purposes of purchasing more bitcoin. From structured notes and hedging instruments to yield-bearing custodial accounts and even Bitcoin-backed loans, the ecosystem is diversifying at a pace few anticipated. But beneath the innovation lies a familiar tension: are these truly risk-managed tools for corporate finance, or cleverly packaged speculative bets in disguise? Read also: Making Sense of Bitcoin’s Growing Relevance for Corporate Treasuries Milestones like the launch of CME Bitcoin futures (2017), the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. (2024), and the entrance of traditional financial institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, and JPMorgan into the crypto arena have provided a sense of legitimacy. With regulatory clarity slowly improving, especially around custody and reporting standards, corporate finance professionals are being offered a potential new value proposition: the cryptocurrency not as a gamble, but as a balance sheet diversification strategy. As PYMNTS covered, even the Ivy-league institution Brown University has recently disclosed a $4.9 million investment in BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF, signaling a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in diversified portfolios. After all, the CLARITY Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets and crypto markets in the U.S., is set to be considered by the full U.S. House of Representatives after being advanced by two House committees Tuesday (June 10). At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants to ease restrictions governing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. The treasurer’s role in this environment? It’s no longer merely about cash, FX, or interest rate swaps — but increasingly about whether the CFO team has the infrastructure, expertise, risk governance, and capital strategies to harness any crypto strategy judiciously. See also: Are Crypto Markets Going Mainstream? What Treasury Execs Should Know Bitcoin is maturing into a multi-dimensional treasury instrument: a defensive store-of-value, a potential yield generator and a signal of corporate innovation. But behind the headlines and bold plays lies a complex ecosystem rich with financing engineering, volatility exposure, regulatory uncertainty, and governance pitfalls. After all, for all the innovation, there’s a critical issue at the heart of this trend: are these financial tools being used to serve prudent corporate strategy, or are they a new flavor of speculative risk? Some critics argue that bitcoin-linked treasury products may be less about strategic diversification and more about corporate speculation dressed in financial engineering. Today’s suite of corporate crypto offerings are designed to mitigate some of the risks. But in doing so, they can sometimes introduce new forms of complexity — particularly around counterparty risk, liquidity constraints and regulatory uncertainty. The accounting treatment of crypto assets remains a thorny issue. In the U.S., bitcoin is still classified as an intangible asset, meaning unrealized losses must be recognized, but gains can’t be booked unless the asset is sold. This creates a lopsided risk profile for public companies. Perhaps the central question for corporate treasurers is this: What is bitcoin in the context of the corporate balance sheet? Is it a modern hedge against fiat inflation, akin to gold? A speculative instrument that can juice short-term returns but introduces material downside? Or a strategic signaling tool — part financial asset, part branding exercise? The answer may depend on the type of business and its risk profile. For a tech-forward firm with high margins and a long investment horizon, limited bitcoin exposure may offer a form of asymmetric upside. For a capital-intensive industrial company with tight liquidity, it may be an unjustifiable risk.

Share this article BlackRock is aiming to become the world’s dominant crypto asset manager by 2030, targeting at least $50 billion in assets under management (AUM) through its digital asset offerings, according to a Thursday presentation on its website. For its flagship crypto ETFs, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), BlackRock’s goal is to lead their respective categories by AUM. IBIT has already secured the top spot among spot Bitcoin ETFs, managing over $73 billion in assets as of June 11. ETHA also leads the spot Ethereum ETF group, with a $4.3 billion market cap, ahead of Grayscale’s ETHE. On global expansion, the asset management giant targets to expand its digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) beyond the US into Europe and Canada. Following its successful launch of IBIT in the US last year, BlackRock rolled out its first Bitcoin ETP in Europe in March 2025. The fund trades under the ticker IB1T on major European exchanges, including Xetra, Euronext Paris, and Euronext Amsterdam. The fund is BlackRock’s first crypto-linked ETP outside North America. In addition to this, BlackRock offers the iShares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Canada. In the tokenization space, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund remains central to the firm’s long-term digital asset strategy According to rwa.xyz, BUIDL leads the tokenized US Treasury market with approximately $3 billion in assets as of June 11.

Despite the ONDO x Ripple partnership, the two cryptocurrencies did not react instantly. Ondo Finance [ONDO] continued to lead in the Real World Asset space with its recent partnership with Ripple’s XRP Ledger to enable 24/7 access through the RLUSD stablecoin. The partnership of Ondo Finance and Ripple has seen the tokenization of the U.S. Treasuries cross stay at the XRP Ledger with 24/7 get right of entry to and redemption in RLUSD. The mixing was enabled via the BUIDL fund, a BlackRock initiative, making ONDO the hub of institutional DeFi infrastructure. But this was not merely a story game — this was operational capital investment in the quest of scalable income. ONDO sprang a new all-time high on its Total Value Locked of $1.368B. This was more than $20 million in additional growth since the previous milestone. Source: DefiLlama The market cap was equal to $2.824 billion, and the daily volume was $167.02 million. The revenue was less impressive though — annualized fees stood at $54.24 million. The platform revenue was $11.69 million as holders continued to get in revenue share. That was indicative of the growth momentum in ONDO but also indicative of the absence of direct holder returns, which may become an issue as the sector matures. Nevertheless, as the XRPL integration went live and the TVL was increasing, the strategy of ONDO proved to bring results. This was in terms of bringing real-world assets to DeFi rails. The extent to which it can maintain this rate will relate to its success in balancing institutional attractiveness with community incentives. Technically, ONDO kept increasing along the trendline, and the support as it approached the $0.867 area. The price was circling around $0.88 and indication of pressure was seen as price retested trendline. Provided this support beneath ONDO held, it may rebound back to the $0.90 area and even come a second time to challenge the swing high at around $0.98. Nevertheless, a decrease to the levels under $0.867 could result in the pullback to $0.84 or even deeper. The MACD indicated a deteriorating bullish trend, with the MACD line falling below the signal line ($0.0053) and heading into negative territory. This reversal indicated possible near term weakness unless momentum could get restored. Source: Trading View The trend structure was intact in the meantime, though a confirmed break below the rising support would turn the sentiment bearish. The traders may observe $0.867 and $1 as directional validation areas. Meanwhile, the price of XRP on the other hand saw modest gains in the last 24 hours while maintaining its stay around the $2.30 zone. This stressed that the partnership did not have direct impact on prices of the crypto in the short-term but would in the long-term.
