What could this mean for supply, staking, and Ethereum’s price ceiling? SharpLink Gaming has ramped up to over 438,000 ETH, signaling deep institutional interest and long-term conviction. Analysts warn of a possible short-term dip before the next breakout. While the spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin [BTC] amid growing institutional accumulation, a quiet but significant shift is unfolding in the Ethereum [ETH] space. SharpLink Gaming, a prominent player in gaming and data analytics, has deepened its Ethereum commitment by purchasing an additional 77,210 ETH over the weekend, worth approximately $295 million, per Arkham. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain also confirmed the purchase, which has pushed SharpLink’s total Ethereum holdings to 438,017 ETH, now worth approximately $1.69 billion. Source: Lookonchain/X A large portion of this stash is staked via platforms such as Figment and Hoppers DApp, signaling a long-term approach rather than speculative accumulation. In fact, SharpLink itself emphasized Ethereum’s 24/7 availability compared to traditional banking hours, pointing to the agility and scalability that make ETH an attractive reserve asset for modern firms. They further added, Source: SharpLink/X Echoing the growing confidence in Ethereum, crypto analyst Crypt Rover posted on X that such large-scale accumulation is a strong signal of deepening institutional inflows. He even predicted that ETH could be on track to hit $10,000, as demand surges and long-term holdings tighten supply. This shows that with Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin serving as chairman and former BlackRock strategist Joseph Chalom as co-CEO, SharpLink is positioning itself at the intersection of traditional finance and Web3. If it fulfills its acquisition goal, the company would hold over 1 million ETH, or approximately 1% of the total supply. According to ETH Strategic Reserve data, SharpLink is now the second-largest holder of ETH, trailing only Bitmine Immersion Tech, which holds 566,000 ETH. This coincided with ETH trading at $3,871.72, up 1.12% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Technical indicators like the RSI also support a bullish case for Ethereum, showing that buyers currently have the upper hand. Source: Trading View The community also seems to have appreciated this move by SharpLink, as noted by one X user, who said, “$ETH will Moon!” Echoing similar sentiments, another page — WISE, added, “Oufff so bullish” Thus, with both sentiment and fundamentals lining up, Ethereum’s current trajectory could be signaling a larger trend in crypto capital allocation. However, Alphractal’s Liquidation Heatmap indicates a cluster of open long positions, hinting that a short-term dip may precede Ethereum’s next breakout as reported by AMBCrypto.

Title: Web 3.0 Founders Must Learn From AI Industry Success
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/28/web-3-0-founders-must-learn-from-ai-industry-success/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T03:40:35Z

Discords and X threads aren’t fooling investors anymore. Web 3.0 founders must look towards AI to survive. Web 3.0 founders have to pivot. The AI (artificial intelligence) industry has demonstrated itself to be far more apt at innovating than Web 3.0, which as an industry must accept defeat in a way and reorganize. It would behoove AI founders to take a page out of the book of big AI companies, which have impacted lives and scooped up a big market share in short order – leaving crypto very much in the dust when it comes to the mindshare of crypto in the global consciousness versus AI. Web 3.0 founders must ask themselves, ‘What can we learn?’ As AI becomes more powerful, and it will do so quickly, Web 3.0 will quickly become a subservient industry, dependent upon the whims of the almighty big technology corporations in control of AI technology. Web 3.0 will likely only become lucrative and impactful by partnering with AI companies. Web 3.0’s decentralization, which has resulted in thousands of projects promising all sorts of decentralized versions of apps that already exist, has led to the general public – including investors – not understanding which projects are for real. Investors simply don’t know which projects can achieve results or are even offering a solution to a real problem. DAOs, DeFi protocols and metaverse land rushes are largely a cacophony of Discord servers, Telegram groups and X threads. For many Western investors, these business models are completely foreign. The business models of AI companies, including startups, are far more familiar. In addition, Web 3.0 has gained a bit of a reputation for being associated with hype and scams. The AI industry, on the other hand, has forged a clearer path towards deals that make a difference. AI companies aren’t shilling tokens based on future promises, writing convoluted whitepapers and posting endlessly online. They’re building groundbreaking technology from the ground up. In the AI industry, the cream has risen quickly to the top. The world knows that it is companies like xAI, OpenAI, Google and others that dominate the marketplace. Investors know that real innovation doesn’t come from a 10,000 NFT (non-fungible token) collection. BlackRock will tokenize bonds, not NFTs. Partners want to make deals with the AI behemoths building out the world-changing infrastructure, such as cloud providers, chipmakers or platforms like xAI’s Grok, which has revolutionized the way in which humanity seeks out information. Unfortunately for those of us in the Web 3.0 space – for now at least – these companies are building the future, not Web 3.0 startups. Centralization is winning the day over decentralization. The fragmentation in Web 3.0 – the fierce competition over so little – is not nearly as appetizing to investors and strategic partners as AI monopolies. Web 3.0 companies should start looking to partner with those companies sitting on a vast GPU supply or a proprietary data organization. These are the companies – the ones that control algorithms – getting inventor funds. A new way forward for crypto Web 3.0 founders are left with no other option than to pivot. The industry has to face it and move towards a new strategy. Big money has found it difficult to navigate the decentralized web of Web 3.0 companies. Instead, centralized powerhouses are the ones building the future, and they could step into the crypto arena at any time and potentially outcompete crypto native incumbents. It’s time for crypto to move on from its messaging chat and X strategy, as well as the promises of decentralization, and start working the phones to get into the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies touching technology. It’s high time to deliver. The idealism of Web 3.0 is proving not to mesh with reality. The quest for decentralization, ownership and democratized value creation has stalled. In the future, Web 3.0 might further fragment. The biggest blockchains, such as Ethereum and Solana, will begin to pin their fates on centralized solutions, increasingly looking like the tech gatekeepers they once billed themselves as disrupting. The blockchains of tomorrow will exist as integrations into the traditional financial and technology giants, which are looking for supply chain tracking and similar solutions. For the blockchain world, these solutions are the quickest way to real-world utility and a monopoly. The more lofty solutions, such as decentralized data storage, are not making much progress when it comes to market share. Memecoins, redundant DeFi protocols and incomplete metaverses are already suffering under the strain of zero sum competition between one another. There is no crypto community. The incestuous strategic partnerships of crypto projects with each other have resulted in limited innovation. It’s time for Web 3.0 founders to make a change. Billion-dollar partnerships are made via access to C-Suites of the world’s biggest companies – not in the world of hashtags or virtual land. The Web 3.0 companies that don’t adapt to the fact that Web 3.0 has fallen far behind the AI industry in terms of innovation won’t be around for long.

Breitbart News initially reported the number of shooting victims as three, consisting of one police officer and two civilians. However, numbers were later updated to show at least six were shot, including another police officer who lost his life. At 9:17 p.m. FOX New York noted that at least three of the shooting victims had died. No motive for the shooting has been reported.

Update: FOX News is reporting the number of shooting victims in Monday’s Manhattan attack now sits at six, two police officers among them. Earlier reports indicated two civilians and one officer were shot. Those same early reports indicated the police officer would survive, but FOX News is reporting one of the two wounded officers is deceased. *****Original story below***** At least three people were shot, including a police officer, in the lobby of a midtown Manhattan office that houses Blackstone and the NFL headquarters. The shooting allegedly occurred around 6:30 p.m. The New York Post reported that the gunman is dead — that he “turned the gun on himself” after shooting individuals. NBC New York pointed out that the attacker was armed with an “assault” style rifle. Ironically, Mike-Bloomberg affiliated Everytown for Gun Safety ranks New York as No. 4 in the country for stringent gun control in part because the state bans “assault weapons.” New York also has heightened background check requirements, a red flag law, a ban on “high capacity” magazines and bump stocks, and many other gun controls.

Title: BlackRock’s ETHA becomes 4th-largest ETF by 30‑day inflows as Ethereum funds aim for $10B

Spot Ethereum ETFs register 16 consecutive days of inflows, driven by institutional whales and corporate treasury firms' appetite for ETH. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are close to breaking the $10 billion mark in inflows this month, as BlackRock’s ETHA makes its way to the spot of fourth-largest ETF by inflows in the last 30 days. According to Farside Investors’ data, spot Ethereum ETFs accumulated $9.3 billion in inflows as of July 25. This represents a 120% increase from the $4.2 billion registered on July 1, marking 16 consecutive days of inflows. The average daily inflow is $233 million, which would total over $930 million in the four trading days left in July. Even if the average doesn’t repeat itself, the ETFs require $162.5 million daily to reach $10 billion, and 13 out of 16 trading days with inflows have surpassed this amount. ETHA leads the inflows by a large margin, accounting for $9.34 billion in total flows, nearly four times the $2.35 billion in inflows of Fidelity’s FETH. In July, the BlackRock fund represented 91% of the total. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that ETFs took $97.6 billion in inflows in the past 30 days. ETHA took the spot as the fourth-largest ETF, showing nearly $3.9 billion in inflows, roughly 4% of the total. Moreover, Balchunas noted that ETHA registered the 17th-largest trading volume among ETFs as of July 28, 11:25 am ET. He added: “$ETHA 17th most traded ETF today Top 0.4% of all ETFs, first time I recall seeing it in there. Given it is up 5% today and still pretty new a lot of this volume is gonna convert to inflows.” As of press time, ETHA’s daily trading volume stands at $1.35 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Shawn Young, chief analyst at MEXC Research, assessed that the rising inflows are driven by both institutional whales and corporate treasury firms’ appetite for ETH. In a note, he said this growth reflects the increased conviction in Ethereum’s utility, sustainability, and long-term staying power, particularly due to its use in tokenization, stablecoins, and on-chain settlement. He concluded: “The rise of Ether ETF AUM to over $20 billion, which represents almost 5% of Ether’s total market cap, speaks to this growing strategic asset role it’s now occupying in institutional portfolios.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: Ethereum Soars on $1.9B Inflows and ETF Optimism as BlackRock and SharpLink Double Down

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum (ETH) is once again at the center of investor attention, pulling in a staggering $1.59 billion in inflows over the past week. This marks the second-largest weekly inflow in Ethereum’s history, amid growing optimism that U.S. regulators will soon approve a spot Ethereum ETF. Overall, digital asset investment products attracted $1.9 billion, marking 15 consecutive weeks of positive flows. This surge in capital has pushed Ethereum’s price up 62% this month to $3,900, positioning it just below the critical $4,000 breakout level. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETPs faced $175 million in outflows, signaling a capital rotation from BTC to ETH and other altcoins. Analysts point to the passage of the Genius and Clarity Acts in the U.S. as key drivers of this trend, enhancing regulatory clarity for altcoin investment vehicles. Institutional investors are doubling down. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) surged past $10 billion in AUM, becoming the third-fastest-growing ETF globally, while the firm raised its ETH holdings to $10.47 billion, with 100% of its crypto exposure now allocated to Ethereum. Simultaneously, Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming purchased 77,210 ETH worth approximately $295 million, raising its total ETH treasury to over 438,000 ETH. This single purchase surpassed the network’s entire 30-day ETH issuance, underscoring the aggressive accumulation trend among institutions. Ethereum’s rally is further supported by bullish technical signals. A “golden cross” pattern emerged, and the MACD shows strong upward momentum, despite an overbought RSI reading of 82.07, a level often associated with potential price pullbacks. Solana and XRP also saw inflows of $311 million and $189 million, respectively, while Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash experienced minor outflows. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s on-chain activity surged 288%, reinforcing confidence in the network’s role as the leading smart contract and DeFi platform. As regulatory momentum builds and ETF approval appears within reach, Ethereum’s dominance in institutional portfolios signals a pivotal moment for altcoin adoption—though short-term volatility remains a factor to watch.

Title: BNY Mellon Wealth CIO Shares One Quiet Power Behind Smart Investing
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gemmaallen/2025/07/28/bny-mellon-wealth-cio-shares--one-quiet-power-behind-smart-investing/
Time Published: 2025-07-28T22:00:32Z
Full Content:
ByGemma Allen ByGemma Allen, Contributor. Sinead Colton Grant - Chief Investment Officer BNY Wealth poses in NYC - 2024 As a child growing up in 1980’s Ireland, Sinead Colton Grant didn’t dream of a career in finance. Instead, her journey to the top ranks of Wall Street started with an unexpected monetary gain. She was a college student headed to Italy on a summer trip when she noticed a pleasant surprise in her finances. The devaluation of the currency just before she left, meant she had a little more Italian lira than she expected. For Colton Grant, this little holiday windfall sparked a lifelong fascination with global finance and smart investing, that would see her rise from FX sales on a London trading floor to become the first female Chief Investment Officer in BNY Wealth history. Her role oversees key decisions at one of the world’s largest private banks. But she shares, that for her, the numbers and portfolios have only ever been part of the story. “Investment isn’t just about returns,” she says. “It’s about trust. Without trust, even the best strategies fall flat.” While she crafts strategies for some of the world’s wealthiest people and foundations, she’s equally attuned to the changing face of wealth, who’s wielding it and how that changing client profile makes trust more important than ever before. I sat down with Colton Grant to discuss her rise through the ranks of an industry where she has often been the only woman in the room, her take on the current investment landscape and how she is witnessing and championing a historic shift in who holds financial power. Colton Grant’s career path has followed the broad arc of globalization and financial markets. After beginning in FX trading and currency management, she pivoted into asset allocation and multi-asset portfolios, before joining Barclays Global Investors and then BlackRock. She views those early years as formative, not just in building technical knowledge but in realizing that at the heart of strong investment strategies is the necessity of clear, human communication. “You can have an amazing investment process, but if you can’t articulate it in a way people understand, no one is going to invest with you,” she shares. That skill, which in practice means translating complex systems into human stories, became a cornerstone of her leadership style and one that would see her move between locations and offices before landing in Mellon Capital. There, she helped develop one of the ten largest liquid alternatives mutual funds in the U.S., before joining BNY Wealth as Deputy CIO and stepping into the CIO seat in 2020 at the height of a global pandemic. Sinead Colton Grant Pictured Colton Grant shares that while on reflection the pandemic era feels like a fever dream, it marked a unique moment in the investment ecosystem, when the personal, political, and economic suddenly converged. For a leader like Colton Grant, who had built her career on human connection and trust, her appointment as CIO couldn’t have come at a more defining moment. "Managing wealth, is above all, a human business with trust at the center,” she shares, “Our clients aren’t just investing for themselves. They’re thinking about the financial legacy of their families, often over generations.” Increasingly, she notes, those conversations are being driven by a new generation, and a new type of investment profile - women. It’s a shift Colton Grant sees first hand, with a front-row seat to a growing wealth transfer, marked by a significant increase in female participation in angel investing, venture capital, and broader financial decision-making. She shares that this represents more than just a demographic shift. “I meet with more women thinking about the financial legacy of their families, often over generations. It's a mindset shift, and one that’s starting to show up in how capital moves and who’s deciding where it goes. We are now at a time when most of the wealth from the Silent Generation and Baby Boomers is moving into the hands of women,” she continues. “That means more women will be making, or solely responsible for major financial decisions, many for the first time.” Catherine Keating Former CEO BNY Mellon Wealth and colleagues Ring bell at NYSE 2022 For Colton Grant, this means that representation isn’t merely a moral imperative, it’s a strategic advantage. "Our clients want to see themselves reflected in the people managing their money. Diverse leadership teams make better decisions. It’s that simple." That also means that helping more women step into investing has become both a personal mission and an economic imperative. “Money means freedom," she says. "Our financial markets have built tremendous wealth over time, and it’s important that more women participate in that wealth creation by investing. I understand why it makes people nervous, but it doesn't have to be complicated. You can start small, with methods like a low-cost S&P index exposure which can generate strong returns over time." What she wants women to realize is that the ripple effects of investing extend far beyond individual portfolios. Women's increased participation creates a flywheel that benefits the broader macroeconomy. "The data shows that more female investors also lead to more female founders receiving seed capital for their businesses. This is vital given that only 2% of overall venture capital dollars go to female-founded start-ups." Asked about her advice to women with the resources to invest but not sure how or where to start? Her reply echoes the age old investment mantra: there will never be a perfect moment. "Time in the market beats timing the market. So just get started," she says. As for this moment we are in right now, marked by an unprecedented level of workplace and market uncertainty, Colton remains bullish on U.S. markets, citing strong underlying fundamentals, backed by innovation capacity, productivity growth, and healthy earning margins. Her investment philosophy doesn't listen to political noise. "You don't invest with your politics," she says, "You focus on the fundamentals." Sinead Colton Grant, Chief Investment Officer, was featured on Fox Business ‘Making Money with ... More Charles Payne’ discussing her market outlook and the future of US exceptionalism. July 1, 2025 When asked where she thinks the opportunity lies, she shares that there are some clear emerging trends reshaping the industry. Private markets, which have long been the exclusive domain of institutional investors, are now more accessible through evergreen investment vehicles. Digital assets are gaining traction, particularly among younger generations, and, of course, artificial intelligence is a key factor. "2025 will be a 'show me' year," she predicts. "It's not just about tech companies, it's about how AI-driven productivity starts to ripple through sectors like healthcare, energy, and beyond." When asked what advice she’d offer women entering finance, Colton Grant boils it downto three things: Speak up, advocate for yourself- don’t assume people will notice your work. Go before you’re ready- don’t wait to tick every box. Know the difference between mentors and sponsors - mentors offer guidance, but sponsors open doors. Above all, however, Colton Grant shares that her trajectory - from a curious college student intrigued by currency shifts, to a leader at the forefront of finance’s biggest transformation - boils down to one undeniable truth: success and smart investing hinges on trust. As she puts it, “people buy people. Trust is everything.” For Sinead Colton Grant, aligning trust is more than virtue, it’s a movement led increasingly by women like her who are reshaping finance from every role: client, leader, founder, and investor.

Title: Ethereum Is Becoming TradFi’s Settlement Layer — Here’s Why
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-is-becoming-tradfis-settlement-layer/
Time Published: 2025-07-28T19:00:49Z
Full Content:
Ethereum is quietly transforming from a hub of speculative activity into the foundational settlement layer for traditional finance (TradFi). With its secure infrastructure, growing regulatory alignment, and network effects, ETH is proving it can securely and efficiently handle large-scale institutional settlements. In an X post, crypto trader MoonKing recently highlighted a significant trend in the financial world, stating that Ethereum is becoming the settlement layer for traditional finance (TradFi). Since January, the tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on Ethereum have surged 20-fold, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down. The capital flows that were once confined to testnets and pilots are now moving decisively into production-level deployments on the ETH mainnet. This transition is supported by real yield and a growing regulatory traction, which together are driving greater institutional confidence. The leading institutions, like BlackRock, Plume, Ondo Finance, Superstate, and Franklin Templeton, are building with a clear intent to reshape financial infrastructure by leveraging blockchain. Their focus is not just on speculative crypto trading but on bringing US treasuries, credit products, and other yield-bearing assets directly into on-chain. This strategic movement signals a paradigm shift, as traditional finance is integrating with decentralized platforms to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. With ETF momentum building, stablecoin adoption is surging, and now a wave of real-world asset (RWA) inflows is accelerating, ETH is rapidly cementing its role as core financial infrastructure, which has become harder to ignore. This convergence of on-chain finance and legacy systems marks a critical inflection point where ETH is evolving into a foundational layer for global capital markets. BlackRock’s appetite for Ethereum keeps growing. According to Ucan_Coin revealed on X, the asset management giant has continued its accumulation through the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). BlackRock now holds 2.8 million ETH, worth around $10.5 billion. In the past week, BlackRock added another $440 million to its ETH holdings, which marks one of the largest single-week institutional inflows to date. ETH has experienced a brief pullback earlier in the week but has impressively reclaimed the $3,700 to $3,800 range, which has served as a key battleground for momentum over recent weeks. The altcoin market cap continues to hold firmly above the $1.25 trillion mark, a critical psychological and technical threshold that is reinforcing bullish sentiment across the broader crypto space. The institutional inflow led by giants like BlackRock has continued to fuel confidence, and the crypto market is gaining a firmer foothold in mainstream finance.

Title: BlackRock CIO Warns US Must Issue ‘A Lot of Debt,’ Names One Factor That Could Trigger Stock Market Correction

A top BlackRock insider says that the stock market could face a correction in the near future if inflation takes off. In a new interview on Bloomberg, Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, says that the US government’s fiscal situation requires it to issue “a lot” more debt. Rieder says large debt issuance makes it harder to allow longer-term yields to go up, making it more difficult to invest in T-Bills with durations longer than 10 years. And if inflation picks up, Rieder says long bonds could get hit even harder along with equities. “We’re going to issue a lot of debt. The long end is a hard place to invest. It used to be that the long end protected you against the equity market. If inflation ends up being higher, which I don’t necessarily anticipate, then what’ll happen is equities and the long end will get hit. So the long end of the yield curve today, given that you can get so much yield – if you’re an investor on the front end – the long end doesn’t become that attractive.” Looking forward, Rieder says that the US can only maintain its debt burden if it somehow manages to spur a higher GDP than the amount of debt it takes on, perhaps with the productivity expected to come from the growth of artificial intelligence (AI). “There’s only one way to de-lever the economy. You’ve got to outrun the debt, you’ve got to outgrow it. So there is a plausible outcome where you get nominal GDP running at 4.5-5% if you get that interest rate down to 3%. Gosh, now you can start to de-lever but it takes a really long period of time. Listen, I think the one engine today, since we are going to have a bigger debt burden, and not only are we going to have a bigger debt burden, you have to fund it domestically, because internationalism doesn’t buy as much. As long as we grow, then you can work through it.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Join the leading maritime news network An aerial view shows the Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, as U.S. President Donald Trump plans to regain control of the Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun (Bloomberg) — CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. said it may invite a “major strategic investor” from China to join a group seeking to buy its global ports, as the Hong Kong-based company works toward a solution that pleases all in the geopolitically-sensitive deal. The unnamed investor would join as a significant member of the consortium, the company said in a stock exchange filing Monday, hours after the expiry of a 145-day exclusive talks window with the group backed by American asset manager BlackRock Inc. “Changes to the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction will be needed for the transaction to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities,” CK Hutchison said, adding that it “intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions.” State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. was negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the consortium, Bloomberg News reported last week. Shares of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s firm oscillated between gains and losses after the announcement. The stock closed 0.84% lower in Hong Kong on Monday. Cosco Shipping Holdings Co., the listed unit of China Cosco, was down 2.9%. Monday’s confirmation about a Chinese investor will likely help remove the obstacles that have been holding back the deal. Beijing has so far viewed the sale of CK Hutchison’s 43 ports as a threat to its interests because it includes transfer of two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal to the group backed by BlackRock — which China considers a proxy for American influence. Chinese authorities separately warned the parties involved not to bypass antitrust reviews, so as to prevent them from rushing into a deal. CK Hutchison reiterated its position Monday that it “will not proceed with any transaction that does not have the approval of all relevant authorities.” CK Hutchison’s shares, which shot up 37% in the days following the sale announcement on March 4, saw political pressure wipe out all the gains in the space of a month. The stock started rallying again last month as investors flocked back after China Cosco came into play. While it may initially sound like positive news, restricting the group to a few potentially strategic buyers means limited competition in the price discovery process for the asset, according to Ke Yan, head of research at DZT Research in Singapore. “Hence, the deal may not fetch the best price that the company hopes for,” he said. Investors have in recent weeks flocked back to CK Hutchison amid optimism that the 96-year-old Li will seal the deal of his lifetime. If it goes through, the sale will net the group more than $19 billion in cash. The renewed optimism is largely due to China Cosco’s interest in playing a role in the buying consortium, alongside BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd. “Ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal’s viability,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong. Initially hailed as a smart move by Li to exit a business caught up in global trade tensions, the deal quickly drew the ire of Beijing. It didn’t help that President Donald Trump billed the transaction as the return of Panama Canal back to American influence. Challenges remain even as Cosco enters the discussions, David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors, wrote on financial analysis platform SmartKarma. That could reverse the current rhetoric and upset Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, he said. CK Hutchison’s share price could also be under pressure should talks on the sale drag on, he added. Even with an extended timeline, revised terms or a partial agreement, uncertainty around the deal’s value and timing would increase, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Wong. The delay may also fuel concerns about regulatory and policy challenges, she said. Investors will be watching out for more answers to questions surrounding the deal, including what role the Chinese side will play in the consortium, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis. The controversial deal has also weighed on Li and his family’s other businesses. Younger son Richard’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The original structure of the buyer consortium was designed to give the Aponte family-controlled Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Most prominent among them was Golden Cygnet, a spectacular winner of the Supreme Novices Hurdle in 1978, who looked to have the racing world at his feet only to sustain fatal injuries in a fall just weeks later. O’Grady started training in 1972 and saddled his first winner, Vibrax, at Gowran Park in January of that year. He took over the license from his father Willie, who had just died. It meant O’Grady, who attended school at Blackrock College in Dublin, had to leave university without finishing a veterinary degree. He was in the spotlight due to the famous Gay Future controversy in 1974 when the horse of that name was at the centre of a gambling coup by an Irish betting syndicate. O’Grady was later played by Pierse Brosnan in the film ‘Murphy’s Stroke’ based on the matter. He was also instrumental in introducing the then bookmaker and gambler JP McManus to racehorse ownership. In 1982 the pair combined to win at Cheltenham with Mister Donovan. McManus backed the horse and later admitted: “He was needed!” O’Grady was champion National Hunt trainer in Ireland for four years between 1977 and 1980. He flirted with switching his attentions to the flat but returned to the jumps to some effect with star names such as Nick Dundee, Back In Front and Sound Man. A statement issued by his family through Horse Racing Ireland on Monday said: “It is with profound sadness that we announce the death of Edward O’Grady, who passed away peacefully yesterday evening at St James’s Hospital, surrounded by his family. “Edward was a cherished husband, father and grandfather and also one of the most respected and successful racehorse trainers of his generation. “Over the course of an extraordinary career that spanned more than five decades, Edward trained just shy of 1,700 winners under rules. His name became synonymous with Irish National Hunt racing, and he was a formidable force at Cheltenham and across the racing world. “Beyond the winners and the headlines, Edward was a man of deep intelligence, sharp wit, and remarkable warmth. He had friends on every continent, a story for every occasion, and a lifelong passion for the sport, the hunting field and everything equestrian.” O’Grady’s second wife, Maria, died in a fall while out hunting in 2017. He is survived by their daughters, Mimi and Rosie Mae, as well as his older children, Jonathan, Amber and Lucy.

Title: ‘Strap In’—$4 Trillion Bitcoin And Crypto Braced For A Price Game-Changer

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has bounced back from a sell-off last week, climbing after a $9 billion earthquake. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price dropped to around $115,000 per bitcoin last week but has rebounded to touch $120,000, propelling the combined crypto market to back over $4 trillion and helped by U.S. president Donald Trump issuing a huge crypto prediction. Now, as Elon Musk’s SpaceX sets bitcoin alarm bells ringing, analysts are predicting the wild bitcoin price swings that have rocked the market in recent years could be over. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Traders are braced for a major change to the bitcoin price and crypto market. “The days of parabolic bull markets and devastating bear markets are over,” Mitchell Askew, a bitcoin analyst with the bitcoin miner Blockware, posted to X, echoing CryptoQuant chief executive Ki Young Ju who believes the bitcoin four-year cycle theory “is dead.” However, Askew also predicted that the bitcoin price will soar to $1 million over the next 10 years as it switches between “pump” and “consolidate" phases, adding: “It will bore everyone to death along the way and shake the tourists out of their positions. Strap in.” Historically, the bitcoin price has climbed to all-time highs in the years following a bitcoin halving that sees the number of new bitcoin issued to miners in exchange for maintaining the network cut by half. Bitcoin saw significant price surges in the second halves of 2017 and 2021, following halvings that occurred in 2016 and 2020. Bitcoin’s last halving, cutting the bitcoin block reward to 3.125 bitcoins per block, happened in April 2024. Others have also said they believe the so-called four-year bitcoin price cycle is over, pointing to the huge accumulation of bitcoin over the last few years by first Michael Saylor’s Strategy then by bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers led by BlackRock Strategy now controls 600,000 bitcoin worth $72 billion, sparking a flood of copy cat companies who are buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, while the combined bitcoin ETF issuers now hold 1.5 million bitcoin worth $175 billion. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher this year, hitting an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin. "The four-year cycle is dead and adoption killed it," Kyle Chassé, a bitcoin and crypto commentator, posted to X alongside a video he appeared in with Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. "The long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic "four-year cycle" forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year," Hougan said in the clip. “I think it’s more ‘sustained steady boom’ than super-cycle,” Hougan added. “I could be wrong, and I’m certain there will be significant volatility." Other analysts have though pointed to the possibility of unexpected events as either boosting or crashing the bitcoin price—something they warn could happen at any time. “This fifth bitcoin bull market has been characterized by bursts of momentum and sudden pauses, rather than a steady, high sharpe ratio climb,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of bitcoin price and crypto analysis company 10x Research, said in an emailed note. “Each move has hinged on a clear catalyst: Fed rate expectations, Trump’s political traction, ETF breakthroughs, or regulatory interventions, such as the dismantling of crypto-friendly banks. That’s why staying laser-focused on macro triggers and reacting quickly to breakouts remains critical. In crypto, momentum is sparked by events, not driven by the calendar.”

Ex-BlackRock executive Chalom’s arrival signals SharpLink’s dedication to institutional-grade crypto exposure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. SharpLink Gaming is accelerating its Ethereum strategy with a major purchase that brings its total holdings closer to a key milestone of 500,000 ETH. On July 28, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain revealed that the firm acquired 77,210 ETH, worth approximately $295 million. This move brings SharpLink’s total Ethereum reserves to 438,017 ETH, valued at around $1.69 billion. While the company has not formally confirmed the latest buy, the transaction suggests SharpLink is pushing toward a 500,000 ETH target. Reaching that threshold would cement its position as the second-largest known corporate holder of Ethereum, behind only BitMine Immersion, which holds about 566,800 ETH valued at $2.21 billion. Meanwhile, data from Arkham Intelligence shows the newly acquired ETH was staked in 3,200 ETH batches using Figment. The firm is a leading provider of institutional staking infrastructure, offering services to over 500 institutional clients, including asset managers, exchanges, and large token holders. Early market indications show that SharpLink’s Ethereum-focused strategy appears to be resonating with investors. According to Google Finance data, the company’s stock (SBET) has surged over 120% in the past month. As of pre-market trading, the stock is priced at $23.61, up 7.37% on the day This Ethereum acquisition is the first major move since SharpLink named Joseph Chalom as Co-CEO on July 25. Chalom previously led digital asset strategy at BlackRock and played a key role in launching the BUIDL fund, as well as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. SharpLink’s chairman, Joseph Lubin, said Chalom’s appointment signals the firm’s deeper focus on institutional-grade crypto exposure. He furthered that Ethereum is entering a new phase, one that requires large capital, capable leadership, and long-term alignment. Lubin added: “Joseph brings all three. His decision to join Sharplink is a massive vote of confidence for Ethereum and for the role ETH will play in the future of capital markets. With stablecoins, ETH Treasury companies and top tier talent TradFi is onboarding to DeFI.” Chalom echoed this vision, saying: “Our goal [at SharpLink] is not just to hold ETH, but to activate it, using native staking, restaking, and Ethereum-based yield strategies. All to increase the value of our treasury and create long-term shareholder value.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: Blackrock Ethereum ETF Crosses $10Bn, How High Can The ETH Price Go In 2025, Is $10K Back On The Cards?

Ethereum’s 2025 bull rally is garnering serious attention — especially now that BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF has crossed more than $10 billion. This has sparked new optimism about the ETH price, with whispers of a potential breakout to $10,000. With old-school giants joining in, projects such as Remittix (RTX) are trending toward more utility-driven strategies, addressing fundamental pain points in cross-border crypto payments. Ethereum is priced at $3,825.95, which is a 2.33% increase within the past 24 hours. The market capitalization of $461.68 billion positions it at the second-largest crypto rank, behind only Bitcoin. Volume traded is lower by 18.4%, though, and is at $24.35 billion, which could be reflective of a short-term breather after weeks of increasing optimism. Most long-term investors are hopeful the ETH price could retest highs. Legacy institutions launching spot ETFs have given renewed life to Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives, DeFi platforms, and crypto with real utility. As hype gathers steam, the search for the next giant altcoin 2025 gets more intense. That shine is increasingly turning towards smaller, high-utility tokens—like Remittix. The Remittix DeFi project is seriously gaining momentum in 2025 with a very specific mission: to enable users to send cryptocurrency directly to fiat bank accounts in 30+ countries. With this fiat bridge, there is no need to go through centralized exchanges, so real-world payments can be easily made by using RTX. The beta wallet, which will roll out in Q3 2025, will cover Ethereum and Solana, with low gas fees and fast transactions. It is best suited for freelancers, global workers, and those in emerging markets where bank services are not available. At $0.0876, Remittix has already raised $17 million+ and sold over 565 million tokens. Early buyers also get a 50% bonus, with the project heading towards its $18 million soft cap. You can buy RTX tokens here and view the wallet beta roadmap for upcoming milestones. The Remittix whitepaper also mentions long-term token deflation and cross-border expansion plans. Why Remittix Is Making Waves in 2025 With a $250,000 Remittix giveaway running and beta around the corner, RTX is in the spotlight as among the most undervalued crypto initiatives today. And while price movement in Ethereum may be the big news, Remittix is building the rails for real-world adoption behind the scenes.

Title: Left-wing hedge fund D.E. Shaw fears ‘reprisals’ over DEI from Trump administration: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/28/business/left-wing-hedge-fund-d-e-shaw-fears-reprisals-over-dei-from-trump-administration-sources/
Time Published: 2025-07-28T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Staffers at the notoriously secretive hedge fund D.E. Shaw fear the wildly lucrative left-wing firm could face “reprisals” from the Trump administration over its woke DEI policies, The Post has learned. The New York-based powerhouse founded by billionaire David E. Shaw — whose algorithm-driven trades made it the most profitable hedge fund in 2024, raking in $11.1 billion for investors, according to Institutional Investor magazine — has grown remarkably quiet of late when it comes to diversity, equality, and inclusion, sources said. D.E. Shaw did not respond to The Post’s emailed request for comment for this article. The company, which gave a young Jeff Bezos his big break in finance before he set up Amazon in 1994, has promoted DEI policies for years. A June 2019 memo obtained by The Post that was written by managing director Eddie Fishman encouraged staffers “to display their pronouns” that “align with their gender identity” in their emails so managers could “foster an inclusive culture.” But a review by The Post of archived pages from D.E. Shaw’s website shows that its DEI language has since been scrubbed, including references to how the firm “actively promotes LGBTQ+ inclusion.” Now, its site merely says it’s seeking “talented people with diverse perspectives and backgrounds.” One insider said top brass at the Wall Street firm — whose 74-year-old namesake helped bankroll the presidential campaigns of Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton — made “a strategic move” to steer away from full-throated wokeness over fear of catching the attention of the White House. “There was some concern that aggressive policies would make the firm a target for reprisals by the current administration,” the source said. “And we were about as aggressive as you could get.” “They were going 100 miles an hour on DEI in public, only then to drop to zero and fall off a cliff,’ said another staffer. “The communications have certainly been ratcheted back,” claimed a third employee. “It’s not as in-your-face as it once was.” D.E. Shaw’s retreat follows a Supreme Court ruling last month and a White House-led crackdown on corporate DEI policies, which critics say lower performance standards and foster so-called reverse discrimination. Top Department of Justice lawyer Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, issued the starkest of warnings to corporate America during a testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 23. “The goal is clear: either DEI will end on its own, or we will kill it,” the top Trump administration official said. Nevertheless, five sources with direct knowledge of the matter told The Post that executives at the company — founded by computer scientist Shaw in 1988 after he did stints at Stanford, Columbia and Morgan Stanley — are still paying lip service to wokeness to the rank and file. “They have said internally that our commitment and programs regarding DEI are not changing,” said another senior D.E. Shaw source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “They have themselves in a bit of a bind. They went hardcore DEI to appear progressive and cater to liberal recruits,” a veteran of the firm added. “Internally, they are putting a brave face on it. But they are now very worried that the administration will start looking into them.” Fearing Trump’s ire, the hedge fund appears to have axed its “inclusive” Bridge internship. The program was set up in 2016 for “historically underrepresented” groups in finance. The ‘woke’ job placement schemes still featured prominently on D.E. Shaw’s website last week. But they have now been deleted after The Post approached the firm for comment on their DEI policies on Friday. According to an archived version of D.E. Shaw’s Campus website — an online recruitment portal — the firm created three programs aimed at diverse recruitment. Its “Discovery” program was “designed for students who self-identify as women”, while “Momentum” was aimed at those “who self-identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community D.E. Shaw also had a program called “Latitude,” which was “for students who self-identify as Native American or Alaska Native, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.” Other Wall Street giants including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Bank of America and Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan Chase have scaled back their public commitments to DEI. The Post reported exclusively how Goldman decided to give woke the boot — on its website at least — when its partners met with CEO David Solomon in Miami in February. The Post attempted to speak to additional employees at D.E. Shaw, but they declined, citing fears of retribution from D.E. Shaw’s management, which has even been known to weigh in on whether employees can attend social gatherings with people who have left the company. “It is definitely something that people are talking about at the firm,” a separate person briefed on the matter told The Post. “The irony is that the whole firm is still very white and very male,” said another source. The hedge fund’s leadership team counts two females, Alexis Halaby and managing director Anne Dinning, amongst its ranks. The firm last made major headlines in 2022 when it was forced to pay a $52 million defamation settlement to one of its former rising stars, Dan Michalow, after an arbitration panel found that it had falsely accused him of sexual misconduct. Michalow, who always denied any wrongdoing, left the company not long after the start of the #MeToo movement, where hundreds of rich and powerful men were accused of sexual misdeeds. Aside from Amazon’s Bezos and his ex-wife, Mackenzie Scott, D.E. Shaw’s most famous alum is arguably Lawrence Summers. He served as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and as director of Barack Obama’s National Economic Council. Advertisement

Title: Ethereum price prediction: ETH eyes new all-time highs in August, whales buy up Pepe and Remittix

Ethereum price prediction models are flashing green as August approaches, and institutional demand continues to climb. While ETH aims to break past the $4,500 resistance, investors are also flocking to newer projects like Remittix, which is becoming the go-to cross-border crypto solution in 2025. This August, Ethereum price prediction experts are eyeing strong resistance breakouts. Leading analysts like Fundstrat’s Mark Newton forecast Ethereum reaching $4,000–$4,500 in the short term, with longer-term predictions soaring to $15,000–$20,000 by year-end (Changelly forecast, Finance Magnates update). Driving this optimism is a surge in Ethereum ETF inflows led by BlackRock, coupled with reduced liquid supply as more ETH is staked across DeFi protocols. This bullish cycle aligns with major trends like the rise of Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives and top crypto to buy lists focused on blue-chip altcoins. With decentralized exchange volume climbing and smart contract usage on the rise, ETH is once again leading the charge among long-term crypto investments. Remittix is making waves in the early stage crypto investment scene. Whale activity has surged since the announcement of its Q3 wallet beta, which enables direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries. At a price of $0.0876, over 551 million tokens have already been sold, raising $17.4M+ to date. This cross-chain DeFi project is solving real problems in borderless finance—and investors are paying attention. A Nigerian freelancer recently used Remittix to accept ETH and convert it to mobile funds to support his family instantly. That’s the kind of utility missing from most low cap crypto gems. Remittix is quietly becoming the breakout presale of 2025, as smart investors seek crypto with passive income potential and real-world impact. While Remittix delivers utility, Pepe continues to attract meme coin momentum. Whale wallets have scooped up trillions of tokens recently, including a massive $22M withdrawal from Binance. These high-volume moves signal bullish sentiment. Source: TradingView PEPE is forming a bullish cup-and-handle chart structure, with traders predicting gains of 40% or more. It’s a speculative bet, but one that still commands strong attention in the meme coin space. Ethereum price prediction targets remain high for August, but whales aren’t just holding ETH. They’re hedging into upcoming crypto projects like Remittix and low gas fee crypto plays like PEPE for broader exposure this bull cycle. If you’re looking for the next 100x crypto, this could be your signal.

Title: DWF Ventures Analyzes Catalysts Behind ETH’s Price Rally, Including Rising Institutional Interest

July 28, 2025 – Dubai, United Arab Emirates It examines the catalysts behind ETH’s rally, which has seen its price rise by 70% in the past month, with a particular focus on institutional support. In its analysis, first published as an X thread, DWF Ventures assesses whether ETH’s recent performance is indicative of an Ethereum season arriving, propelling both ETH and the assets its EVM ecosystem supports to greater heights. DWF pinpoints the triggers that have prompted ETH to break out of a three-year downtrend and flip bullish. The Web 3.0 investment firm notes that ETH’s recent price rise hasn’t occurred in a vacuum but is rather the product of growing interest in the Ethereum ecosystem. On-chain activity on Ethereum has been increasing steadily including transactions, active addresses, volume and the total percentage of ETH staked. Many of these metrics are at or approaching ATHs (all-time highs), paving the way for ETH to move up. As highlighted in the report, institutions are increasingly acquiring ETH as a strategic asset, whose ETF inflows have surged past 230,000 ETH in a single day, while the ETH/BTC ratio has broken out of a multi-year downtrend. The analysis observes that companies are leveraging ETH for treasury diversification, capitalizing on its yield-generating potential through staking and DeFi integrations. It also asserts that greater regulatory clarity, aided by legislation such as the GENIUS Act, has provided the transparency required to attract cautious investors, paving the way for sustained upward momentum. Public companies that have purchased significant quantities of ETH include SharpLink Gaming, which DWF Ventures records as having purchased over $1 billion of the crypto asset since May 2025. It acknowledges that BTC remains the asset of choice for public companies acquiring crypto but suggests that ETH’s ability to generate native yield via staking is desirable for preferred stock holders who are accustomed to receiving dividends. Other tailwinds contributing to ETH’s rally, as outlined by DWF Ventures, include the CLARITY Act, which places less restrictions on institutions accessing ETH because it is regarded as a commodity rather than a security. It also notes that while the GENIUS Act was primarily concerned with stablecoins, Ethereum’s dominance of almost 50% of the total stablecoin market cap will work in its favor as stablecoin capitalization increases. DWF Ventures concludes by analyzing increased institutional demand to bring capital on-chain through tokenized RWAs (real-world assets) and participation in DeFi, with Ethereum overwhelmingly the blockchain of choice. It cites global institutions including BlackRock, PayPal, Deutsche Bank and UBS – all utilizing Ethereum infrastructure. The analysis finishes by saying, “The strong performance of associated sectors and tokens are encouraging signs of a potential ‘ETH szn,’ especially for protocols that share and benefit from overlapping tailwinds in clearer regulation, stablecoin expansion and onboarding of institutional capital.” The full ETH analysis from DWF Ventures can be read here.

East Asia A view of the Balboa Port is pictured in Panama City, Panama on Mar 4, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Enea Lebrun) HONG KONG: Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison said Monday (Jul 28) it was considering inviting a Chinese "major strategic investor" to join a United States-led consortium negotiating the sale of its global ports business outside China, including operations at the Panama Canal. The firm said in March it was offloading the ports - including operations in the vital Central American waterway - to a group led by asset manager BlackRock for US$19 billion in cash. The consortium was to include BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company.

Loading The sale was seen as a political victory for US President Donald Trump, who had vowed to "take back" the Panama Canal from alleged Chinese control, prompting Beijing's ire. China's market regulator said in March it was reviewing the deal. In May, Hutchison co-managing director, Dominic Lai told shareholders that Terminal Investment was the main investor. Its parent company is led by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte. Aponte's family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with the owner of CK Hutchison Li Ka-shing, who is also Hong Kong's richest man. "(CK Hutchison) remains in discussions with members of the consortium with a view to inviting (a) major strategic investor from (China) to join as a significant member of the consortium," CK Hutchison said in a stock exchange filing Monday. The firm added that changes to the consortium's membership and deal structure will be needed for the deal "to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities". It said the "period for exclusive negotiations" mentioned in the March announcement had expired, but discussions will continue. It did not name the major investor. The deadline for their exclusive negotiation period ended on Jul 27.

The deadline for their exclusive negotiation period ended on Jul 27. China's biggest shipping company Cosco was set to join the consortium and was requesting veto rights or equivalent powers, Bloomberg News reported. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong told the outlet that "ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal's viability". Gary Ng, senior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, said Monday's developments show that "business deals can be increasingly subject to politics in the new economic and geopolitical reality" as the Hong Kong conglomerate seeks to "keep everyone happy". CK Hutchison said it "intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions to achieve" a workable arrangement. It said it had stated on several occasions that it "will not proceed with any transaction that does not have the approval of all relevant authorities". The initial deal, valued at nearly US$23 billion including US$5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. That agreement also required approval from Panama’s government. Its Hong Kong-listed shares fell 0.6 per cent Monday, while Cosco dropped 2.2 per cent. AFP has contacted Cosco for comment.

Title: Earn $8900 a day with your mobile phone with BTC Miner!

As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) steadily runs in the range of $118,000 to $120,000, the market’s expectations for it to hit historical highs again are getting stronger. With the continuous increase in institutional holdings and the continuous inflow of funds on the chain, the crypto market is entering a structural growth cycle with policy loosening, capital acceleration, and technology upgrading as the core. But for ordinary investors, facing the reality of high currency prices and volatility, how to enter the market and how to make stable profits? Smart cloud mining platform BTC Miner may be the answer. According to Coindesk data, Bitcoin has tested the area above $119,000 many times in the past 72 hours, and the technical side shows strong support signs. If it can successfully break through the current platform consolidation area, the next target may be $130,000. At the same time, on-chain data shows that Bitcoin’s “realized cap” has exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, which means that more long-term investors will include BTC in their core asset allocation rather than a short-term speculative tool. This bull market is no longer driven by emotions, but a systematic revaluation driven by ETF funds, policy shifts and institutional buying. BTC Miner: Ordinary people can also seize institutional dividends While the crypto market is developing rapidly, BTC Miner is using a simple, efficient, and automated way to provide ordinary investors around the world with a low threshold to enter the mining income. Five core advantages of the platform: 1. Zero technical threshold, one-click mining Users do not need equipment or blockchain knowledge; they only need to register and purchase contracts, and the system automatically allocates computing power and participates in the mining of mainstream currencies such as BTC, XRP, ETH, and DOGE. 2. Daily automatic settlement, transparent income to the account The platform implements an automatic income calculation and distribution mechanism, and you can see the income account every day, which is clear and traceable, avoiding the uncertainty of waiting and fluctuations. 3. Register to get $500 computing power, free trial mining for new users BTC Miner gives $500 computing power to all new users, and you can experience the real mining process without recharging, and the daily stable income is credited to your account in real time. 4. Multi-currency support, global use Supports recharge and withdrawal of mainstream crypto assets such as BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, DOGE, etc., and the internal income is calculated in US dollars, which is unified and transparent. Referral rewards, build a passive income network Through the invitation mechanism, users can get up to 7% rebate to create a sustainable passive income model. Bitcoin has entered an upward track, but the investment threshold is also rising simultaneously. Compared with the high volatility and high threshold of direct currency holding, BTC Miner provides a lightweight and stable income alternative: purchase computing power contracts from a minimum of $200, with an annualized income of up to 180%+. BTC Miner continues to optimize product structure and profit mechanism, and launches diversified contract solutions suitable for all types of investors. All plans support automatic settlement of daily income, and return principal when the contract expires, which is simple and transparent: Contract principal Contract period Daily income Total income at expiration (Actual income is intelligently adjusted according to market conditions and contract types, transparent and traceable) Especially in the stage where the currency price has not yet broken through significantly and the mining difficulty is still controllable, early entrants can obtain more attractive returns. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of BlackRock, recently said that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates as soon as possible to release liquidity; Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Fund, suggested that investors allocate at least 15% of their assets to Bitcoin and gold. All signs indicate that Bitcoin is gradually becoming a new generation of “risk hedging and value-added” dual tools. For most ordinary investors who cannot deploy capital and resources like institutions, the cloud mining platform BTC Miner provides an opportunity to stand at the same starting line as institutions. You can also make money through invitations: just share your personal invitation link. Directly invite friend B: 7% rebate [Friend B invests $10,000, you can get $700] Friend B invites C: 2% rebate [C invests $10,000, you can get $200] Build an exclusive computing power network, earn while using, and share the benefits! The price of Bitcoin is on the eve of a key breakthrough, and the BTC Miner cloud mining platform has opened a stable door to high returns for ordinary people. It is not only a new way to participate, but also a passive income tool that resists inflation and stabilizes growth. If you want to seize this round of structural bull market, act now.

Title: Hong Kong's CK Hutchison seeks Chinese investor to join Panama Ports deal
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/hong-kongs-ck-hutchison-seeks-chinese-investor-join-124126111

A Hong Kong conglomerate that’s selling ports at the Panama Canal says it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong conglomerate that had agreed to sell its two ports at the Panama Canal said Monday it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers, a move that could please Beijing but bring more U.S. scrutiny to the geopolitically fraught deal. CK Hutchison Holdings’ initial plan to sell port assets in dozens of countries to a group that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc. pleased U.S. President Donald Trump, who has alleged that China interferes with the critical shipping lane’s operations in Panama. However, the deal apparently angered Beijing and drew a review by Chinese anti-monopoly authorities. After months of uncertainty brought by tensions between Washington and Beijing, Hutchison said in a statement Monday that the exclusive negotiations period with the consortium had expired. However, it added “the Group remains in discussions with members of the consortium with a view to inviting major strategic investor from the PRC to join as a significant member of the consortium,” referring to the People’s Republic of China. It said it needed to change the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction for the deal to be able to pass reviews by “all relevant authorities.” In Beijing, a Chinese official said the government had noted the announcement but did not comment directly on it. “The Chinese government will conduct supervision in accordance with the law, firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintain market fairness and justice,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a daily briefing. A Hutchison subsidiary has operated the ports of Balboa and Cristobal at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997. The awkward position Hutchison found itself in for months highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing. It announced March 4 that it would sell all its shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium that also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company. A Beijing-backed newspaper in Hong Kong posted scathing commentaries about the deal, with one describing it as a betrayal of all Chinese. Chinese government offices overseeing Hong Kong affairs reposted some of the commentaries, widely seen as an indication of the Chinese leaders’ stance. In May, Hutchinson co-managing director, Dominic Lai told shareholders that Terminal Investment was the main investor. Its parent company is led by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte, whose family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with Li’s. The initial deal, valued at nearly $23 billion including $5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the two at the Panama Canal. That agreement would have also required approval from Panama’s government. The deadline for the exclusive negotiation period ended on Sunday. The Panamanian government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the operation of the ports by Hutchison does not mean Chinese control of it. ___ Associated Press writer Ken Moritsugu in Beijing contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery CK Hutchison said it may invite a "major strategic investor” from China to join a group seeking to buy its global ports, as the Hong Kong-based company works toward a solution that pleases all in the geopolitically sensitive deal. The unnamed investor would join as a significant member of the consortium, the company said in a stock exchange filing Monday, hours after the expiry of a 145-day exclusive talks window with the group backed by American asset manager BlackRock. "Changes to the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction will be needed for the transaction to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities,” CK Hutchison said, adding that it "intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions.” In a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Shirley Zhao Jul 27, 2025 (Bloomberg) –Investors are regaining enthusiasm for CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. despite a delay in the company’s plan to sell 43 ports, with optimism fueled by news that a Chinese shipping behemoth is finding its way into the global deal. Shares of CK Hutchison, which oscillated between gains and losses since the company first announced the deal on March 4, reached the highest this year on Friday after state-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. emerged as a potential new member of the buyer consortium that includes American asset manager BlackRock Inc. Although a 145-day exclusivity window for talks between CK Hutchison and the buyers’ group lapsed on Sunday, the possible involvement of China Cosco is boosting expectations that it would nudge the transaction forward. Beijing has so far viewed the deal as a threat to its interests because it would transfer two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal to the BlackRock-backed group, which China sees as a proxy for American influence. “Ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal’s viability,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong. China separately warned the parties involved not to bypass antitrust reviews, so as to prevent them from rushing into a deal. As of last week, the buyers’ group was considering China Cosco’s demand for veto rights to secure Beijing’s interests, Bloomberg News reported. CK Hutchison’s shares, which shot up 37% in the days following the sale announcement in March, saw political pressure wipe out all the gains in the space of a month. The stock started rallying again last month as investors flocked back after China Cosco came into play. The share price recovery shows investors are increasingly betting on Li Ka-shing, the 96-year-old founder of CK Hutchison, to seal the deal of his lifetime. If it goes through, the sale will net the group more than $19 billion in cash. The renewed optimism is largely due to China Cosco’s interest in playing a role in the buying consortium, alongside BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd. Initially hailed as a smart move by Li to exit a business caught up in global trade tensions, the deal quickly drew the ire of Beijing. With President Donald Trump billing the transaction as the return of Panama Canal back to American influence, that didn’t help. Challenges remain even as Cosco enters the discussions, David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors, wrote on financial analysis platform SmartKarma. That could reverse the current rhetoric and upset Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, he said. CK Hutchison’s share price could also be under pressure should talks on the sale drag on, he added. Even with an extended timeline, revised terms or a partial agreement, uncertainty around the deal’s value and timing would increase, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Wong. The delay may also fuel concerns about regulatory and policy challenges, she said. Investors will be watching out for more answers to questions surrounding the deal, including what role the Chinese side will play in the consortium, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis. The controversial deal has also weighed on Li and his family’s other businesses. Younger son Richard’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The original structure of the buyer consortium was designed to give the Aponte family-controlled Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Slow And Steady Wins? Bitcoin To Hit $1M Via ‘Pump’ And ‘Consolidate’ Pattern: Expert
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/slow-steady-expert-says-bitcoin-to-reach-1-million/
Time Published: 2025-07-27T23:00:07Z

The bull cycle was deemed over when the price of Bitcoin tragically fell toward $75,000 earlier in March 2025. Having notched an all-time high of above $100,000, most investors feared that the premier cryptocurrency had already reached its top for the current cycle. Contrary to popular belief, the price of Bitcoin has since forged multiple new all-time highs, with the current record high at around $122,800. Interestingly, the now-popular market consensus is that it is only a matter of time before the BTC price reaches a seven-figure valuation. In a recent post on the X platform, Blockware Bitcoin analyst Mitchell Askew has joined a growing list of experts to put forward a $1 million projection for the premier cryptocurrency. According to the analyst, the price of BTC is expected to achieve this major milestone over the next 10 years. What’s interesting is that Askew expects the Bitcoin price to reach a $1 million valuation in the next 10 years. The crypto intelligence expert believes that “the days of parabolic bull markets and devastating bear markets are over” for the flagship cryptocurrency. Askew highlighted that Bitcoin looks like two entirely different assets before and after the launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. With this shift, the analyst expects the price of BTC to reach $1 million through a consistent oscillation between “pump” and “consolidate.” Askew added: It will bore everyone to death along the way and shake the tourists out of their positions. It is worth mentioning that Askew’s thesis aligns with the recent claim that the Bitcoin cycle theory is dead. In essence, both beliefs state that the premier cryptocurrency is now less likely to experience the extended bear market that typically follows after a bull run — a theory based on the introduction of institutional players through spot ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas agreed with Askew’s theory about the movement and trajectory of the Bitcoin price since the spot exchange-traded funds hit the market. According to the pundit, the Bitcoin market has witnessed less volatility and fewer corrections since BlackRock filed for a spot BTC ETF. Ultimately, the air of increased stability around the premier cryptocurrency has made it a more attractive investment option for large institutional players. Balchunas also acknowledged that the BTC price is now less likely to experience major surges in short periods — as seen in the past. Over the past week, the price of Bitcoin moved mostly sideways, oscillating between the $120,000 and $115,000 levels. As of this writing, the market leader is valued at around $117,900, reflecting a 0.4% price increase in the past day. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Year of the stablecoin: The GENIUS Act, Wall Street, and the dollar’s digital leap

Leading experts share their insights into the future of money as the GENIUS Act redefines finance in 2025 and beyond. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate’s new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. If 2024 was the year of the dragon, 2025 has been the year of the stablecoin. U.S. dollar-backed digital assets, in particular, have taken front and center stage, achieving buy-in all the way from the highest office. The World Liberty stablecoin, USD1, was launched in March by a DeFi platform majority-owned by members of the Trump family. Then Vice President JD Vance set the stage alight at the Bitcoin Conference in May, clarifying the administration’s bullish stance on stablecoins and their ability to act as a “force multiplier” for U.S. economic power. Stablecoin issuer Circle’s $20 billion IPO followed, igniting what the Bankless podcast duo coined “stablecoin summer.” And last week, the GENIUS Act was signed into law, becoming the first piece of U.S. legislation to directly regulate digital assets, creating a turning point for global finance. Even Jamie Dimon’s getting in on the action despite his personal skepticism about Bitcoin and digital assets. He may publicly claim not to understand their appeal, but there has long been a gap between what Dimon says and what Dimon does: America’s largest bank has been a pioneer in blockchain technology, developing its own stablecoin, JPM Coin, since 2019. So, what’s with all the latest developments in moving value worldwide, and what does the GENIUS Act mean for the future of crypto, TradFi, and the global economy? I asked experts from the technical, legal, and financial fields to throw some light on the subject and unpack the types of advancements we may see in the years ahead. For those of you who’ve been hiding under a rock, let me guide you out of your shadowy abode. The GENIUS Act stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act of 2025,” but “GENIUS” is a lot more catchy. It’s the first comprehensive U.S. federal law that specifically regulates “payment stablecoins” (AKA, digital tokens pegged to fiat money). The GENIUS Act establishes a long-awaited licensing and oversight regime for stablecoin issuers, mandating full 1:1 reserve backing, imposing strict consumer protection measures, and creating a clear legal footing for integrating stablecoins into mainstream finance. The law also bars non-financial companies like the Facebooks and Googles of this world from issuing stablecoins without special approval, applying substantial penalties for noncompliance (violations can incur fines of up to $200,000 per day, and criminal penalties including up to five years’ imprisonment). Why is the GENIUS Act such a big deal? Well, because after years of opacity and uncertainty surrounding stablecoin issuers in the United States, it provides the first federal legal framework, providing clarity on how to run their operations. As international law firm, Winston & Strawn LLP writes in a recent blog: “The Act pushes stablecoin issuers into a regulatory regime similar to that of banks. For many firms, this means a need to hire compliance officers, invest in risk management systems, and potentially partner with experienced regulated institutions to meet the standards set by Congress.” Moon Pursuit Capital is a fast-growing crypto investment fund. Its founder, Utkarsh Ahuja, shared his thoughts on just how groundbreaking the GENIUS Act is, commenting: “The GENIUS Act is a major step forward, not just for crypto, but for U.S. leadership in global finance. For the first time, we have clear rules around stablecoins, which are the backbone of open, programmable money infrastructure. For too long, uncertainty has held the industry back and driven builders offshore. The GENIUS Act changes that. It gives stablecoins legal clarity and sets the stage for broader crypto adoption.” Genna Garver is a partner at the international law firm Troutman Pepper Locke LLP. She also provided her thoughts on the GENIUS Act to share with CryptoSlate readers. She said: “This is a watershed moment for institutional financial services. The GENIUS Act authorizes the tokenization of fiat currency and regulation of the same, thereby legitimizing digital US dollarization.” Guillaume Poncin is CTO at Alchemy, a developer platform that facilitates over $100 billion in transactions annually for businesses across the ecosystem, from Fortune 500 firms like Robinhood, Visa, JPMorgan, and PayPal, to crypto-native companies like Coinbase and Circle. He told me via written commentary: “The GENIUS Act provides the clarity that institutions have been waiting for, and it helps legitimize programmable money that operates at internet speed. This legislation is important because it reduces regulatory uncertainty that has held back institutional adoption.” What’s more, the GENIUS Act does not exist in a vacuum. With a groundswell of favorable momentum toward digital assets from the current administration, the tailwinds are blowing like crazy. The unwinding of the stranglehold on crypto during the Biden years, and the repeal of key pieces of prohibitive legislation such as SAB 121, which prevented U.S. banks from providing custody of digital assets, are creating a perfect storm. Poncin enthused: “We saw immediate interest from major banks that had previously been cautious. Now, with GENIUS in place, we believe every major bank will move toward issuing or supporting stablecoins in some form. It unlocks the next era of programmable money that is trusted, regulated, and built for internet-scale speed.” The GENIUS Act also serves to extend U.S. dollar dominance, spurring innovation based on the USD and reinforcing the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency for decades to come. As crypto-native investment firm, CoinFund, president Chris Perkins commented: “The GENIUS Act will go down in history as a law that served as a foundational step in the mainstreaming of crypto as an asset class. By catalyzing innovation on our greatest export, the greenback, GENIUS will position the dollar as the global reserve currency for decades to come, enhance national security, and unlock financial opportunity across the globe Stablecoins deliver obvious utility by offering inexpensive, 24/7 payments. But, by enabling seamless and efficient access to U.S. dollars across the developing world, stablecoins will also serve as a store of value when local monetary policy goes awry.” Stablecoins have come a long way from their original use case as a means to store wealth, while avoiding the volatility of digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, to be enshrined in a landmark bill recognizing them as key financial infrastructure. So what are some of the main use cases the GENIUS Act enables, and what can we expect from the coming years? Ahuja comments: “The GENIUS Act unlocks real innovation, instant remittances, AI-native payments, and global commerce without intermediaries.” Poncin adds: “The opportunity in stablecoins isn’t in holding them, unless they’re being used in DeFi for yield opportunities. The real opportunity lies in companies issuing their own stablecoins, such as payment processors integrating stablecoins and fintechs launching their own tokens. We’re seeing fintechs generate meaningful revenue from stablecoin reserves through treasury management. This can potentially be $100M+ annually on $2-3B in deposits. The real value creation comes from how stablecoins are enabling the new financial system.” Beyond experimenting with its own stablecoins, JPMorgan made headlines this week for its moves to allow clients, particularly institutional ones, to use bitcoin as collateral for loans. Thanks to the GENIUS Act, the bank is developing a new program that would allow clients to pledge their Bitcoin or Ether holdings to secure cash loans, much as they might with stocks or real estate. While JPMorgan already enabled clients to borrow against crypto ETFs, the move to accept direct crypto holdings as collateral is a paradigm shift for an institution helmed by one of the industry’s most vocal critics. The GENIUS Act’s significance extends across the industry, with DeFi platforms and tokenized RWAs taking note as well. Orest Gavryliak, the chief legal officer at DEX aggregation pioneer, 1inch Labs, told me: “Tokenized technology has become a major area of focus for TradFi giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and more, as it represents marked improvement on the current setup of financial standards. It is also a major benefit in terms of the accessibility of liquidity. By transcending geographic barriers, the global nature of tokenization, enabled by blockchain technology, allows markets with limited, isolated liquidity to unify and access liquidity from multiple sources—available 24/7, in real time.” Poncin expands: “Banks will enable customers ‘investor-grade opportunities, like trading in private equities, and get loans against their holdings. Small businesses can finally harness the remote work era to pay overseas workers affordably. We’re about to see a flood of not one, but hundreds of stablecoin ‘killer apps’, all enabling people to exchange and create value in ways unimaginable just months ago. Tokenized treasuries are growing significantly. Stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, hold substantial U.S. debt positions. We’re seeing increased interest in tokenizing traditionally illiquid assets like private credit and real estate to unlock liquidity. There’s also growing development of infrastructure to make RWAs composable with DeFi protocols. The real innovation is about making these assets programmable. This enables new financial products like automated lending against tokenized assets or smart contracts that can interact with real-world collateral.” One interesting clause in the GENIUS Act is the prohibition on paying interest or yield to stablecoin holders, which could mean an explosion of demand in DeFi yield-earning opportunities. Perkins says: “Under GENIUS, stablecoins do not pay interest to end users, and without interest, stablecoins are depreciating assets. So, holders will seek yield. And that’s where DeFi comes in. If the Treasury Department’s projections are correct and trillions of stablecoins come into the system, expect DeFi summer on steroids as users seek to maximize yield by engaging across a variety of yield strategies. Users will be drawn to yield-bearing vaults, and they will commission AI agents to optimize their returns. With the U.S. back in the lead, countries around the world will need to accelerate and optimize stablecoin policies of their own. The $7.5 trillion per day FX market stands to benefit. Watch this space.” Will Beeson, founder of MultiLiquid, and former co-lead of Standard Chartered’s Tokenization platform, comments: “The outright ban on stablecoin yield marks a critical inflection point. Capital is already shifting. Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin as traders seek returns via Ethereum-native protocols and tokenized funds. The stablecoin market is entering a phase where only institutions that can put capital to work efficiently will survive. But there’s a bottleneck: stablecoins move 24/7, Treasurys don’t. Liquidity infrastructure that bridges this gap is now mission-critical.” Gavryliak adds: “Regulatory clarity, like the GENIUS Act, means companies and institutions can now look to leverage stablecoins for fast, cost-efficient cross-border payments, treasury optimization, and real-time settlement, bypassing TradFi banking rails and unlocking operational efficiencies. It’s a positive step forward for DeFi. It also provides security for institutions and other TradFi operators, who can now put their full weight behind the sector. Those previously just dipping their toes in can now dive headfirst with the clear guardrails.” With digital assets an increasingly partisan issue, and key Democrats like Elizabeth Warren holding onto her anti-crypto army, is there any risk of the GENIUS Act, or any other legislation, being reversed if and when the blue team returns to power? And with the Trump family so overtly benefiting from digital assets, does this clear conflict of interest pose any threat? Poncin believes it’s too late for that: “The momentum in crypto adoption transcends political divisions. We work with institutions across the spectrum that recognize blockchain’s potential. The repeal of SAB 121 had bipartisan elements, and there are crypto advocates across party lines. Major banks, asset managers, and payment companies are building on blockchain because it offers superior technology for settlement and programmable money. Moreover, the cryptocurrency industry has demonstrated resilience in the face of various challenges over the years. What matters is that institutions are building real utility on blockchain. These use cases exist because they solve real-world problems, such as settlement speed, operational costs, and 24/7 availability. That’s what drives lasting adoption.” Garver is also positive that GENIUS brings in lasting change. She says: “During the legislative process, there were numerous attempts to debate and offer amendments to the bill to address certain conflicts of interest, but those amendments were not adopted as part of the final GENIUS Act. Now that we have final legislation authorizing permitted payment stablecoins, digital asset adoption likely will depend more on the use cases. Not unlike ATM adoption of the last generation, at some point, it’s just too convenient and beneficial not to get on board. I don’t see potential users sitting on the sidelines as a sign of protest. I think the ship will quickly sail, and crypto will become too integrated into the fiber of our economy, the global economy, and the financial services industry.” With the ballooning global debt, liquidity expansion, geopolitical uncertainty, and lowering interest rates, favorable regulation for digital assets in the U.S. could mean that “nothing stops this train.” As Ahuja affirms: This is, frankly, as constructive a macro setup as you can ask for, short of resolving event-driven risks like tariffs or Middle East escalation. But from a pure market-structure and liquidity standpoint, the conditions are primed. We’re entering a rare window where fundamentals, liquidity, and macro dynamics are all pointing in the same direction; and that’s precisely when the most compelling upside gets unlocked.” Christina is a web3 writer, editor, and content manager with a passion for technology and starting important conversations.

Title: Bitcoin’s Parabolic Glory Days May Be Over, Analyst Claims

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin has climbed 250% since BlackRock’s IBIT launch. But those massive green candles—spikes traders chase—could become a thing of the past. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the era of sudden jolts up or down may be ending. He says that spot ETFs and big companies piling in will smooth out those drawdowns. Balchunas pointed out that IBIT just passed $100 billion in assets under management. Based on his view, that landmark tells you everything. Bitcoin traded between $116,000 and $120,000 after Galaxy Digital sold 80,000 coins. No panic sell‑off followed. Before ETFs, a sale like that could send prices tumbling by double‑digit percentages. Now, deep corrections look less likely. This guy gets it. We’ve been saying same thing. Since BlackRock filing Bitcoin is up like 250% with much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns. This has helped it attract even bigger fish and gives it fighting chance to be adopted as currency. Downside is prob no more… https://t.co/0ECd5XevcO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 26, 2025 In‑and‑out profit‑hunters once drove Bitcoin up or down by 20% or more in a day. But steady inflows from regulated products lure in large investors. Balchunas argues that fewer wild swings will make crypto more useful for buying coffee or paying bills. He believes this shift will help Bitcoin behave more like a real currency and not just a roller‑coaster asset. Based on reports from Citigroup, every $1 billion of ETF inflows can lift Bitcoin by about 3.6%. Using that math, Citi sees Bitcoin hitting $199,000 before December 31. That forecast depends on steady money flowing in. Big funds make big bets. And those bets tend to stick around longer than retail traders chasing quick gains. Citigroup notes that BlackRock’s IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $100 billion. That matters because it shows how hungry big players are for crypto. If those trends keep up, Bitcoin could push past its current trading band. It may even test new highs without the classic “God candle” leaps that gave quick fortunes—and quick losses. Meanwhile, some analysts warn that early Bitcoin whales are taking profits and stepping aside. As institutions arrive, some old‑school traders will leave. That could shift volume to less regulated spots or exotic derivatives markets. In a calmer main market, risks may hide in side channels. Lower volatility brings fewer heart‑stopping moments. It also means less of the adrenaline rush that attracts day‑traders. For some, that trade‑off is worth it. For others, the loss of big swings could drive them away. Overall, Bitcoin seems to be entering a new phase. Based on Balchunas’s take, those “God candles” won’t vanish overnight—but they’ll be rare. The push from spot ETFs and corporate treasuries aims to make price moves smoother. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock’s CIO fires at Fed’s policy delay: ‘It’s not a goods economy’

With crypto inflows rising and Fed criticism peaking, Rieder’s support for rate cuts may shift the macro winds this week. BlackRock’s Rick Rieder pushes for rate cuts as the crypto industry and housing sector strain under Fed policy. With ETH ETF inflows surging past BTC, all eyes now turn to the upcoming FOMC decision. With just four days to go before the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting, the debate around interest rates is heating up, drawing in voices from both Wall Street and the crypto industry. This time, it’s not just crypto-native investors calling for rate relief. BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer, Rick Rieder, has entered the conversation. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Rieder urged the Fed to begin slashing interest rates. He argued that the broader U.S. economy and particularly the service sector would benefit from such a shift. That said, markets have heard this tune before. Earlier this month, traders piled into Bitcoin [BTC] ahead of a strong U.S. jobs report, hoping the Fed would finally pivot—only to be met with data that reaffirmed its hawkish stance. As previously reported, that macro surprise cooled crypto momentum and reminded investors that the Fed’s next move remains tightly tethered to real-world labor and inflation numbers. Rieder’s comments contrast with prevailing sentiment on Wall Street, where many still favor a cautious or minimal easing approach. For the crypto sector, however, Rieder’s remarks could serve as a critical point of validation, as lower interest rates historically fuel investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. He said, “The service economy is what drives this economy today. It’s not a goods-oriented economy, not commodities, not exports, not manufacturing.” Further in the interview, Rick Rieder emphasized that the Fed’s current approach to inflation may no longer be effective in today’s service-dominated economy. According to the BlackRock executive, aggressive rate hikes are now doing more harm than good, particularly in sectors like housing, where the impact is most pronounced. “The real impact of interest rates on the economy today… it’s about housing.” These individuals, he noted, are the ones most reliant on credit and now face increasing barriers to home ownership. Rieder argued that easing rates could spur more housing construction and improve affordability, ultimately benefiting the broader economy. He added, “If we get the rate down, you actually can bring home prices down. You build more houses, you’ll actually reduce inflation.” This shows that his stance not only challenges the Fed’s current policy direction but also adds weight to the growing call, especially from within the crypto industry. However, despite the Fed’s continued concerns about inflation, BlackRock’s Rieder pointed out that even a rate cut to 3.25% would remain above current inflation levels. Still, optimism for an imminent Fed rate cut remains low. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there’s a 95.9% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged after July’s FOMC meeting, with only a slim 4.1% chance of a cut. Meanwhile, Ethereum [ETH] ETFs have outpaced Bitcoin [BTC] in inflows, with ETH seeing $1.85 billion in net inflows between 21 and 25 July, compared to just $72 million for BTC. With so many crosscurrents shaping the market, all eyes are now on the FOMC meeting and its potential ripple effects across the crypto landscape.

Title: Lions and Wallabies give the MCG the epic it deserves

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Think about all of the times you've seen Jerry Guscott’s drop-goal to clinch the series against the Springboks in 1997. Hugo Keenan’s try to defeat Australia in Saturday’s epic second Test at the MCG has joined a list of iconic moments in the 137-year history of the British and Irish Lions. Owen Farrell’s winning penalty in the second Test in Wellington in 2017, George North lifting Israel Folau over his shoulders and carrying him like a toddler in Brisbane in 2013, Brian O’Driscoll’s dancing feet at the Gabba in 2001. Jim Telfer’s 'This is your Everest’ speech. Add Keenan to the montage. Every four years, the sight of the Ireland and Leinster full-back hitting the gas and burning Len Ikitau to the line will be replayed again and again and again, probably with a Scott Quinnell or Ian McGeechan voiceover that would have you ready to run through walls. Sport can create unlikely heroes, and when Keenan was playing off the bench for Blackrock College’s U14 C team back in the day, never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined scoring a last-minute winner to win a British and Irish Lions series. Even a few weeks ago it would have seemed like a long shot. Having come into the tour shaking off a calf injury, his Lions debut was delayed by a gastro bug that emptied him out and left him 6kg lighter. One of the more level-headed players – even by modern rugby standards – Keenan couldn’t be contained after the final whistle, doing his best to leap into the stands of the MCG every time he spotted some of the friends and family that made their way down to the front row to meet him, including some particularly emotional moments with his parents, Paul and Avril (below). Maybe we’re biased, but on a Lions tour that was so dominated by green, it felt appropriate that one of the Irish contingent was the hero of the day. It was also appropriate that the game itself matched the setting and occasion. The Melbourne Cricket Grounds is one of the world’s iconic sporting venues, and with 90,307 people crammed into ‘The G’, we were treated to one of the all-time great Lions Tests. While the Wallabies fell 60 seconds short of bringing it to a decider in Sydney, Joe Schmidt’s side put to bed any ideas of this series being a formality. Bullied a week ago in Brisbane, they allowed the Lions win pulling up and only a sleepy final quarter at Suncorp put some respectability on that scoreboard. Last night at the MCG it was a different story. While the Lions never played with the same efficiency that marked the first half of their win a week ago, both teams played their part in a thrilling 80 minutes. All week there were fears that this game would be wasted on the occasion, but what played out was a game of rugby that delivered beyond all expectations. In the first half, Australia played with a determination and flair unrecognisable from a week ago. With Will Skelton and Rob Valetini back in their side, they used their two most powerful forwards effectively. The first two lineouts saw them manufacture touches for each player in space; first Skelton broke down the touchline off a clever short lineout, and on their second they went over the top where Valetini charged to the 22. They carried nine times each, with Valetini departing at half time as his calf injury caught up on him, while Skelton’s tank was empty early in the second half. Even with those early departures, captain Harry Wilson was the only forward who carried more. It wasn't just physically where they matched the Lions. Full-back Tom Wright was inspired in the first half, with his glorious 50:22 laying the platform for Jake Gordon’s try, before he raced clear to score one of his own almost straight from the restart, after Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii had left Bundee Aki for dead. "I suppose the drama and how it unfolded is what makes it special," Lions head coach Andy Farrell said. "We came here to win a series. To do it in that type of fashion, you wouldn’t have backed us at 23-5, but to find a way adds to the story, doesn’t it? It adds to the fairytale." Twelve years ago Farrell was part of Warren Gatland’s coaching group who were brought the distance by the Wallabies in the series, before blowing them away in the Sydney decider. "To be a part of it is an honour, it really is. 2013 was special, 1-1, and being able to win it at the death, but we won quite comfortably in the end. "To win it like that is what top level sport is all about." If any context was needed to back-up how thrilling Saturday’s game was, the numbers back it up. Keenan’s match-winner saw the Lions take the lead for the first time on the night, having trailed for 75 minutes, while no Lions side had ever come from more than 10-points down to win a Test, as highlighted by the great rugby historian Stuart Farmer. Jack Conan’s workload summed up the physical toll, with the excellent stats man Russ Petty confirming his combined 31 tackles (24) and carries (7) were the most for Lions player in a single Test across the last five series. Judging by the singing in the Lions’ changing room, which could be heard loudly from the press conference room at the MCG, there will be a physical toll to the celebrations too, and the players are set to be given a couple of days off before turning their attention to Saturday’s third Test in Sydney. With the series win complete, it’s unlikely we’ll see the intensity of the MCG repeated at Accor Stadium. But with a first 3-0 sweep against the Wallabies for more than 100 years the prize on offer, there’s incentive enough for the Lions to throw everything they have at the last week, and give the final game of this tour, and Australian rugby, the respect it deserves.
